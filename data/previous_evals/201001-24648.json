   "comments": [
    "History 016 is a great course for anyone interested in food. I would highly recommend it to another student with any interest at all in what they eat.",
    "A great class to learn more about food history and contemporary food. Getting a high grade in this class isn't easy and I'm not sure what he actually wants but work load isn't very heavy either.",
    "One of the best courses offered at Yale. If you have the opportunity to take it, do so. He teaches it as a lecture some years, but you will only get the amazing experience of getting to know him and going to New York City if you take the seminar.",
    "This was an easy freshman seminar class. it was not necessary to do the readings, although they were very interesting. Your entire grade is based on 3 papers, all of which you have a ton of freedom on. Professor Freedman was great. He was very accessible and always made himself available to meet with students. He was a very helpful resource when writing papers. I also really enjoyed listening to him lecture about the history of food. He obviously knows a ton about it and is very passionate.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this course, as long as you're willing to do the readings. This was by far my favorite course of the year. Professor Freedman is an incredible teacher and has a vast wealth of knowledge about food. It was a seminar class, so we had a small number of students, and it really created a warm, friendly environment. We spent 1.5 hours twice a week talking about food--what more could you ask for?. Professor Freedman also has a ton of connections in the food\/restaurant business, so our guest speakers were incredible. I also loved the field trip we took to New York to sample different cuisines. The readings were always enjoyable (although often very long) and the papers and workload was very manageable.",
    "I highly recommend this class to any student interested in food, agriculture, history, and anthropology. It's a fun class- not too much work- but one will still learn a lot. Plus, how cool is it to talk about the history of restaurants, fast food, and ethnic cuisines in a class?",
    "I would definitely recommend the History of Food and Cuisine. It covers many interesting topics related to food starting in the pre-historic era and progressing to modern times. The books that you read for class are great and are ones that I would consider reading for fun. Professor Freedman is a wonderful professor who seems to really enjoy leading the seminar. He organized a trip to New York City for our class to visit ethnic food restaurants and grocery stores, which was really fun. He also brought in several guests, such as a food critic, a journalist, and the manager and chef from the Union Square Cafe who contributed interesting perspectives on different aspects of food. We wrote three papers for the class, and we had a lot of freedom in choosing our topics, which was great-you have the chance to really investigate the food-related topics that you are most interested in.",
    "History of Food is a freshman seminar that follows the progression of food and cuisine from the prehistoric times to the modern day (with most of the focus being in the past two centuries). The class is mostly reading (and the books are all really interesting), with 3 papers. Most of the classes revolved around discussion of the books we read for that day, but we also had visits from people such as the New Yorker food critic and the manager and cook of Union Square Cafe.I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The reading is manageable, and interesting, and the class discussions are enjoyable. The papers are also manageable, and they are an opportunity to learn about something novel and interesting, especially given the resources that Yale has. You'll get a lot out of the class especially if you're interested in food\/sustainability, and history as well, but I think anybody would enjoy the class.",
    "History of Food and Cuisine is a broad survey course of the topics involved in Food Studies. I would recommend the class if you are interested in history or if you just want to learn about some very interesting things.",
    "Yes, it was a super fun course with great reading that extended beyond the simple subject matter.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 016 to another student. Essentially it is a class on the history of food. There are three major papers and a lot of reading, but the class discussions are very interesting and engaging. It is a really nice change of pace from other academic coursework. I looked forward to going to this class each week."
