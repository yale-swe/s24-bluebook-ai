    "This course is amazing. It's so perfect for anyone interested in doing research. The only problem is that there are so many students for Mark and Elaine to handle, and I'm sure it's overwhelming. There should be other professors teaching this course too! The support is so vital for the successful completion of our research.",
    "Excellent TF. Elaine was very helpful and knowledgeable and gave us a huge amount of her time. Her workshops on statistics were very clear and well organized, and overall show that she is a great teacher.",
    "This is a perfect class for students planning on publishing their research!",
    "Question 7: Both the professor and TA were very responsive to questions and I give them great credit fordoing twice as much work given the number of students.",
    "Question 10. Its valuable to students who did summer research and came back with data that might not be in good shape. This class helps you organize your research with the help of both the Professor and TA to write out a manuscript fit for publication. So for students like me this is a class that disciplines and helps you to write your masters thesis on time."

   "comments": [
    "The relaxed atmosphere, the motivation to move forward on research, the opportunity for comments from peers and other experts, the general morale boost offered from the group. And the pizza!",
    "I was so thankful for this course this fall! Dr. Ashton creates a supportive and collegial environment. I really enjoyed the paper critique assignments - this is a crucial skill and Dr. Ashton is great at teaching it. I also really enjoyed the chance to develop my skills in giving constructive feedback to my classmates. By offering this course, Dr. Ashton is providing a CRUCIAL service to 2nd-year students, and he is amazing at combining true skill development with a wonderful sense of humor. He keeps us working hard, he keeps things positive, and he gives great feedback.",
    "Mark and Elaine! No matter how many students they have or even if they're sick with the flu, they always give 300%. They genuinely care so much.",
    "Making progress on my thesis while getting very valuable feedback from students and instructors.",
    "Working in depth on my research.",
    "It is geared toward helping student succeed with their own projects - instead of taking independent study, the collaborative environment in this course was invaluable.",
    "To end with half my research paper done.",
    "How we get feed backs on various sections of our manuscript not only from the instructor and TA but also form our colleagues. We also learn how to critique other papers and learn from mistakes and the good things about other manuscripts to inform our own.",
    "The push to move forward on your thesis as part of the class - giving me more accountability.",
    "It really helped me keep a good pace with developing my own thesis\/reserach.",
    "Practicing our formal presentations and keeping us on track for publishing in the spring. The class is a great support network for students trying to synthesize their summer research!",
    "The chance to present your work to group of people with a diversity of interests.",
    "Really incredible dedication from Mark, how he made a second section just to make sure everybody could be included in the course who wanted to take it. It shows that a course like this is in great demand at FES and needs to be promoted. Perhaps would be most ideal to have a natural science and a social science version so that people could get valuable feedback from peers in the same field.",
    "Peer (classmates, instructor and TA) review and comments on the writing work and presentations.",

    "none",

    "This class should have another professor and\/or TA, potentially splitting social and natural science (though it is helpful to have options for the class time).",
    "I wish the prof would keep time better (if presenters are given 8 minutes, don't let them speak for 15).",
    "It would be great to do more small group work-shopping of presentations and papers.",
    "Students should be split up according to their interests during the weekly classes. I know Mark wanted more people in the Tuesday section vs. Wednesday section, but I think perhaps this should have been split up more thematically as opposed to who was simply available which day (although I know this is hard to do).",
