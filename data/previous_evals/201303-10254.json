   "comments": [
    "Don't take this class unless you are a math or econ major as it is super boring. If you do take it, go to class and take the notes, but play games on your phone as well to pass the time. It isn't difficult to study right before the test and beat the class average by around 10 points, AKA A- range.",
    "I would recommend it. The material is not too complex and has practical applications.",
    "If you take this get ready for sections to be of arbitrary difficulty. Some are really easy and a few sneak up on you.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in mathematics. It is a good introduction to the realm of math above basic calculus.",
    "It is a well taught course if you take it with this professor .",
    "Solid class, perhaps a little low on the applications but Folsom is a good lecturer and the topics are interesting enough if you like math. I would actually go as far as to say it was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "Math 222 is a good way to learn Linear Algebra if you are not overly interested in higher math. It will teach you what you need to know to solve problems, but it probably won't give you a proper foundation for continuing into a math major. The workload is reasonable. There are often lots of problems, but they are all pretty straightforward.",
    "It's a linear algebra class; if you're taking it you probably need it. It teaches a lot of things that are useful for the sciences\/engineering. This class is quite a bit easier than 225, and depending on who's teaching either, certainly worth taking over 225.",
    "Take this course if you need to learn linear algebra but already have a high course load or if you don't plan on pursuing math very deeply. This would not prepare you adequately if you are going into deeper mathematics, but for other tracks like engineering, it should be fine.",
    "Don't go to lecture but definitely take the course.",
    "If you're looking at this class, you probably need it for a requirement or are just interested in math - if that's the case, I would recommend this class. Professor Folsom is knowledgeable and fair and the material we covered could be useful for numerous different majors. Also, I'd suggest taking this before multivariable (120\/ENAS 151).",
    "Linear algebra is a great mathematical tool to know. Professor Folsom was a excellent and clear teaching made this a very worthwhile class.",
    "I would recommend this course for students looking to fulfill a linear algebra major requirement or simply a good math class. Nothing is terribly difficult and doesn't draw extremely heavily on other courses.",
    "Math 222 was a pretty good\/ok class. Professor Folsom was not engaging but she is at least clear, and this is a step above the apparently terrible professors who used to teach this class in the fall semester in previous years. Not too much work; 9 straightforward but sometimes long psets; exams were really well written and also straightforward. \"Applications\" not as exciting as I had expected. The professor and TA are approachable. Overall, afairly solid course. If you don't want to put in the work\/time for 225, take this.",
    "Math 222 is a tedious, boring and miserable course. I only took it because it was a prerequisite for a more interesting course in another department and it seemed as though most people were in a similar situation as I was. The concepts this class teaches are important in many fields, but that does not change the fact that the lectures were boring and the homework felt like tedious busywork. At least the textbook Professor Folsom used was good enough that if you did not want to go to lecture, you were able get by without doing so.",
    "some interesting topics. not really necessary to go to class if taking it with Professor Folsom because her examples were generally taken directly from the book and could be learned in a shorter amount of time by just reading the book. not extremely difficult psets or midterms. do practice problems and youll be fine",
    "Math 22 is a straight forward, logical course. If you need any type of Linear Algebra for your major, I would recommend this course.",
    "This class isn't very enjoyable but you probably have to take it. I didn't get much from lectures and mostly learned out of the book. With enough studying, you can do well on the tests and the final wasn't too hard.",
    "I think in years past this course has had a bit of a bad reputation. Professor Folsom was new this semester and I thought she did a wonderful job. I knew a fair bit of Linear before taking the class, but I felt she explained a lot of the subject matter really well. Homework were a little long, especially after the first midterm, but they were never super difficult. Her exams were straight-forward and the average was always around a B. So it was easy to do well if you studied a bit. Definitely take it with Professor Folsom if you need to take Linear and more specifically Math 222.",
    "I would recommend Math 222 to students who want to pursue a career that is math-dominant. It is a lot of information, and for non-math savyy people, it could be intimidating. As a student interested in majoring in math\/Econ or both, I enjoyed linear algebra but it was not my favorite topic in math because it was harder for me to conceptualize what each formula meant. However, it is definitely important for all math students to have some familiarity with linear algebra.",
    "If you are thinking of taking linear algebra at Yale, take it with Professor Folsom. She is clear, engaging, and approachable, and truly cares about making the class meaningful and enjoyable.",
    "Good class to take as prerequisite for majors pr other courses. Not exciting, but not terrible either. Would recommend, though with warning that this will not be a \"favorite\" class, even if you enjoy math.",
    "Yes, but 225 would probably be more exciting.",
    "I was not a STEM or econ major when I took this course, and I still found this course t to be interesting. The key is to practice and ask a lot of questions; don't take the class lightly!",
    "Good, useful, interesting, not too tough",
    "High recommendation. Not very theoretical, as the title suggests, but very useful. Well-organized and a nice addition to my schedule.",
    "MATH 222 is a very good course that covers the basic concepts of linear algebra. The textbook is really good too!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. It covers the essentials of linear algebra, which is very important for all further courses.",
    "Definitely take this class. The material was easy to understand and matrices and manipulating them is definitely useful in all forms of math and science",
    "I feel like the skills I learned were quite useful, so I'd recommend it to anyone looking to enter a technical field.",
    "Professor Folsom did a good job with this class. The material will never be riveting, but she made an effort to do interesting examples. I felt like the exams were fair and I learned the material well."
