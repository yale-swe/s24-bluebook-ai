   "comments": [
    "If you get in, you must take this class. As a senior in the college, this is the best class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The course load is very light and you get great insights about how decisions are made through the guest speakers.",
    "Yes, definitely! A new look at leadership, great course readings, a warm experienced professor, and the best roster of guests who visited one class. Well-run, not too much work, and the essays you write are fantastic. How could you turn down this opportunity? Things like this...that's why I chose Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you can get in. The students were all superb, the reading was not too heavy and usually fascinating, assignments were reasonable and valuable, and Gen. McChrystal was clearly passionate about the subject matter and about teaching.",
    "No Question at all- Take it if you get the chance. No drawbacks.",
    "Gen. (Ret) McChrystal dedicated himself to teaching this course, making himself available for office hours and conversation, grading work himself, and pushing students to do their best. His intelligence and enthusiasm were clear in his teaching, and the course benefited from this.McChrystal's greatest strength in teaching was asking students to challenge him, and I took him at his word and tried to ask provocative questions, do the reading, and approach the class with seriousness more than I've heard other \"celebrity\" profs do. I'd recommend the class without hesitation, though more for personal then academic reasons.Yale classes often teach either information (History of the Modern Middle East), a skill (Programming, French), an intellectual approach (English 120, Logic) or academic grounding. INRL 690 does none of these things. Still, it gives students a chance to develop their own views on what good leadership is, and I think it makes students more ambitious, for better or for worse. It is also most valuable as an unprecedented window into real-world decision making, something that will be helpful to students hoping to work in any field touching on foreign policy, the military, or politics.",
    "I would recommend his course to every student as it offers an unrivaled opportunity to talk to first-class practitioners about leadership.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in leadership in a political, business, or any other context. A wide cross section of students would potentially be interested in this course."

   "comments": [
    "I now am beginning to understand what it takes to be a leader, and the challenges that I will face.",
    "I think the course showed that leadership (and things like good communication skills, relationships and adaptability) are necessary in any line of work.",
    "Leadership is a life skill, and in that, it has allowed me to develop more than I could have ever hoped for.",
    "The course was very helpful especially in getting an understanding on how many, especially American, bureaucracies work from the inside, as well as a valuable collection of lessons and advices for the future.",
    "The course gave me some practical insights into leadership under stressful conditions.",
    "See above. The course has been decisive in shaping how I respond, intellectually, personally and professionally, to the leadership challenges I and the societies I study face."
