   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class. The lectures were fun and given that I don't know anything about the time period, I think I got a good grasp in general knowledge.",
    "Take this class. Whether it's with Freedman or Winroth, it'll be good. This year, the class was very little work, but the material is really fascinating. The Middle Ages is such a cool time that you can't help but enjoy learning about this history. Prof Winroth is very funny and his lectures are like story time. Also, if Aaron Vanides is TA'ing, take his section. Why don't more people take this class? Why don't more people become absolutely enamored of this time period?",
    "It's a great class with a great professor and TF. It covers an interesting time period, that the professor shows much passion for.",
    "I took it for a pre-industrial Europe credit (History major). The papers were a bit harshly graded but the quizzes helped boost my grade. I thought I would be bored by the material but actually ended up enjoying it. Take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is about a period of history that is largely ignored, but once you take the course you gain a greater understanding of the Middle Ages' importance and even develop a particular interest in it.",
    "This is a great class! The readings and workload are manageable compared to the average history class, and the lectures are very interesting. Even if you're not sure that you are interested in the Middle Ages, it's well worth your time!",
    "YES! Great history class.",
    "Eh. I took the class credit\/d so I didn't get too much out of it. I ended up skipping a ton of class, so I wouldn't recommend you take this class if you are only halfheartedly interested--because it lacks an intrinsic draw.Also, the grading was ridiculous. For the first paper, the average was a B-. It made me happy I took it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "This is an excellent class if you are interested in learning about early christianity. The class covers little else.",
    "History 210 is a fantastic introduction to medieval history. The lectures are creative and engaging, and you learn how to better interpret events from a historical perspective. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes I would recommend. A well-taught course with a lighter workload, and laid back atmosphere."
