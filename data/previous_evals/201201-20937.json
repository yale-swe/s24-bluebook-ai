   "comments": [
    "This course is quite helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to those undergraduate students who are not environmental science or engineering major, or who have just started studying in this area.I will not recommend thi course to graduate students especially those majoring in environmental engineering.The reasons were stated in the first question.",
    "It's an unconventional class, with lot of in-class and group (project) dynamics involved. The class basically helps one develop 'sustainable' designing skills.",
    "ENAS 660 is a thought-provoking course that will provide you with a different perspective towards design and assessment of technologies, that is rather \"soft\" and light on homework.I would recommend this course to a fellow student, based on the instructor and workload.",
    "It is a great class to change your prospective of how engineering and design should be. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "Yes. This class was fun and there was some great learning, particularly to those who are interested in performing product design later in their careers.",
    "Yes! Although not if he\/she is looking for a rigorous theoretical class.",
    "Good overview of Green Engineering. A fun and interesting course with a moderate work load. Definitely worth taking if you can get a spot."

   "comments": [
    "I have to say that I don't think it deepens my knowledge of my profession that much.",
    "This course provided me with a different perspective on design considerations and methodologies for assessing alternatives, which I can use to make more environmentally sensitive decisions in my career as an engineer.However, I do not believe that this course contributed any significant values towards my dissertation and research at Yale.",
    "I really enjoyed the class. I think that it will have many benefits for my career andfor the rest of my studies that I may not even recognize now. It was my first engineering design class and really changed my way of thinking regarding the engineering process.",
    "I was quite familiar with the product design process from all of my engineering (grad and undergraduate) experience plus professional work. However, I still managed to learn quite a bit (toxicity, design evaluation, process efficiency, policy paths).I would say this course contributed secondarily to my research, however, I now have the toolset to evaluate the environmental impact of my designs, which I think is incredibly relevant in the present engineering market."
