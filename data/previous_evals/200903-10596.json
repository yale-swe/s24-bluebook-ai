   "comments": [
    "An overview of the Avant-garde, Dadaism and introduction to early twentieth century trends in art, music, and literature. Very interesting, but sometimes a bit scattered. I would recommend this for the humanities student, particularly, if you are focusing on any topic in late nineteenth\/early twentieth century Russia or Germany.",
    "I would summarize the class as an attempt to represent the avant-garde from these countries in this time period through different media and perspectives. Points of particular focus are where the two \"avant-gardes\" intersect and, possibly, how they compose a single avant-garde. I would quickly recommend the course to other students: the level of discussion, interesting material, and enthusiastic instructors have made it one of my favorite classes while attending Yale.",
    "The class covers the spectrum of the avant-garde arts in Moscow and Berlin in the inter-war period, and reveals the strong links between the two cities during that period.I would definitely recommend the class to another student. It is a very important period in 20th century arts, and it is helpful to understand the links between the Russian and German avant-garde artists during the inter-war period to provide a deeper understanding to the artistic movements in Western Europe during that period.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially for anyone with an interest in modernism. I imagine that it is a lot of work for those taking it for credit, but is a course that would reward you for time invested."

   "comments": [
    "It introduced me to modernity in Russia, and some Russian literature. I would have appreciated more of this. As a Germanist, it continued to deepen my knowledge about trends in fin-de-siecle Berlin. Thanks!",
    "This class was very helpful to provide a deeper understanding of the avant-garde movements in inter-war europe, which is directly related to my research.",
    "The course raised some questions that are pertinent to my own research and familiarized me with figures and works outside of my own regional specialization. As a comparative course and one that looks at modernism from the perspective of literature, theater, architecture, music and intellectual history, it inspires interdisciplinary thinking."
