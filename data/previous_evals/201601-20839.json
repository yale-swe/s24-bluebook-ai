    "Good class, would recommend if you want to improve your Spanish and be conversational. Is a significant time commitment, however.",
    "Don't underestimate the work in this class but do work hard. Your reading and writing skills will exponentially increase!",
    "140 is a great course. The readings are interesting and you will develop better speaking and grammatical skills. If you take this class with Len, what I just mentioned will also be true but be warned that she's an overly harsh grader. She rarely gives A's. It becomes really frustrating when you realize the other Spanish sections are actually a lot more lenient, and the tremendous amount of effort you put in her section would have been more than enough to secure an A in another. The harsh grading takes away from the focus of the course-- learning and appreciating the language instead of obsessing over your grade since the class is worth 1.5 credits.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's enjoyable, but a lot of work.",
    "Yes, very helpful.",
    "Recommend for anyone who has taken Spanish 3 and wants to make real improvements regardless of whether Spanish 4 is required",
    "Take it. It's hard but you learn a lot"
