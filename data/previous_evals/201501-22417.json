    "Don't waste your time on this very basic intro class unless you need a very basic intro class. It's truly a shame that this is a Lit prereq, because it's not enough work to make it worthwhile as a meaty major class.",
    "A COURSE TO AVOID.",
    "This class is very little work compared to the other classes that I had. The readings were usually minimal, and at the most confusing, which was even better because you could read it, not understand it, and still be ok for class the next day because everyone was in the same boat. That being said, do the readings or the class feels like it's happening behind a wall of glass. Without the readings, the lectures are worthless and the seminars are even worse. The only time consuming thing is the papers, of which there are only three. TLDR: Not a huge dent and interesting if you try.",
    "LITR 122 will give you the chance to read some interesting works from across the world, but any glance at the syllabus can show you that it is absurdly broad. If you need to take the class for the literature major, you can have fun thinking about particular works, and the professors are a good resource, but don't expect that it will add much to your education. If you are a freshman, I'd tell you to look at the introductory courses in a particular language or to check out the intro English seminars, such as Epic or Tragedy, amongst countless others. The professors are decent, but \"World Poetry & Performance\" is a crazy premise for a class."
