    "Absolutely enroll in this class. The curriculum (a wonderful mix of canon and under-appreciated writers) is challenging and deeply interesting; the assignments are incredibly well-designed and well-paced, building on the previous one in a logical way - the last assignment in particular requires creativity and is truly a joy to write; the students are absolutely brilliant, capable of incredible, book-changing thoughts; and Roffman is an amazing resource. She is a very sweet, very compassionate and accessible professor who genuinely values your opinions and wants to hear what you have to think. She guides conversation fairly well (better with novels than with poetry), and she's capable of following comments from left-field quite impressively. She's a fair grader, not easy but certainly not overly tough by any means. And, as previously mentioned, she's more than willing to meet to go over any aspect of the writing process: drafts, her comments on your graded essay, brainstorming ideas, etc. Further, her deadline policy is one of the most generous at Yale. She's a human being first and foremost, and wants to see you succeed. Four essays, some eight books. A great class for English students and non-majors alike.",
    "'Twas an excellent course! We read many great works (even though not all of them were capital-G-W Great Works). Some of them were real classics (Moby Dick, Leaves of Grass), but there were also some not-so-well-known yet still excellent books. You probably won't enjoy all of the lesser-known works, but you should find at least some of them meaningful and\/or entertaining. The workload was significant but not overwhelming. In general, the reading homework was not too much as long as you stayed on top of it, and the only graded assignments were 4 medium long essays (ranging from a 3-4 page essay to a 6-7 page essay). Professor Roffman is very good at engaging class discussion, and she's also a very relatable person--she really understands that people are busy and is very open to extending deadlines if something is due unreasonably early. She also was willing to carefully read and comment on any drafts of essays, so as long as you start your essays early and take advantage of her help, you should do well on the essays.",
    "If you are looking for the American canon, this is NOT it. This course is an apparently random assortment of American poets and writers. The curriculum does not appear to be structured or really thought through. You will not read the American greats. You will read the alternatives to the greats.",
    "Good class. Make sure you get a section that you like. Prof Roffman was great, highly recommend her. Quite a bit of reading (which you should do all of, because otherwise why take a literature class?) but not too much writing.",
    "Yes.",
    "I would absolutely recommend to any student.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 127 to a student looking for a straightforward, engaging literature course. Its essays are heavy on close reading, so if you take it, be ready for that. Four to five medium length essays without a final is totally doable. If you have Professor Roffman, she gives tremendous feedback!",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who loves to read and analyze the inner workings of a reading. While the readings are evenly paced, you may find yourself reading an entire book within a week or two so take notes as you read. If you have something to share, don't be afraid to speak up in class; it's an implicit judgment-free zone"
