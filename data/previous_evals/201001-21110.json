    "This is a required course for all students. Nonetheless, I have praised Gundula's handling of the course this past term to a number of students, and I feel that her handling of the course exceeded my expectations of what the course would have to offer (based on previous rumors of the course under various other professors) in every way."

   "comments": [
    "This course was essential for deepening and broadening my knowledge of the discipline, not only by creating a space for the digestion and critique of my own work and the work of my peers, but also by allowing a free exchange and review of the musicological discourse through the discussion of sources and arguments popular in the discipline today. The open, engaged, and constructive criticism of the class is something to be treasured by all as the best of what the academy has to offer: an open but critical exchange of developing ideas that engage a broad body of interests but are united by the common goal of new and engaging scholarship in a specific field of study."
