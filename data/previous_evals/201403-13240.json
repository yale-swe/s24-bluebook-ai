    "I would recommend it if they like languages, are prepared to be committed to Chinese everyday, and are prepared to have no alphabet.",

    "It is a very intensive, fast-paced, Chinese language learning class. I would recommend it to another student but only if you think you are ready for that level. If you are even a little unsure of your preparedness for the class, you should drop down to a lower level.",
    "Mandarin is obviously an important language and this course it taught very well at Yale. I would definitely recommend it to a student who is capable of studying L3 Chinese."
