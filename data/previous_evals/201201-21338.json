   "comments": [
    "I recommend it, it is still fairly easy (light on the calculus) and the classroom atmosphere was great.",
    "Yes.",
    "Don't take this course unless someone else is teaching it! It's ridiculously boring yet it's hard to do well because the tests are way too easy, the curve is way too steep, and he gave us a midterm in which the questions were extremely easy but hardly anyone could work fast enough to finish them in an hour and fifteen minutes. I'm guessing intermediate macro is better taught. How they can call this \"macro theory\" is a mystery to me, we only used basic algebra and never went beyond extremely simplistic models.",
    "Prof. Galenianos was a guest lecturer, so expect this course to get back to difficult. So, for next year - definitely take after Intermediate Micro \/ Micro Theory, or at least any Yale introductory econ class - don't just take it because you placed out of introductory econ. This year was bearable, because it was easy. Don't expect it to be that next year. (Also, most people will have taken Micro Theory first, so you'll be at a disadvantage.)",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. Although it's supposed to be more difficult than \"regular\" intermediate macroeconomics, it's a very manageable and fun course.",
    "ECON126 was a good class for those who would have wanted to learn about the intuitions, even though it is designated as the more mathematical version of intermediate macroeconomics.",
    "She was always kind and sincere.",
    "Unlike the usual Macro Theory classes offered at Yale, this class is taught by a visiting professor from UPenn. He explains the material very well and takes a pragmatic approach to the subject. However, this class lacks the mathematical rigor demanded in a Macro Theory class. Although it's easy, it's disappointing. The curves on the exams are very high.",
    "From my understanding, this class has been more difficult in the past because someone else usually teaches this course. Manolis was a visiting professor so I doubt he'll be teaching it again. I really liked this class and actually managed to stay awake in it (unlike in other econ classes I've taken). Manolis used a lot of real world examples which kept things interesting and we got to read some pretty current articles from the Economist\/WSJ. The way it was taught this year wasn't really too math-heavy but again, it's probably not going to be the same in the future. I thought it was a good class and Manolis was really nice and accessible."
