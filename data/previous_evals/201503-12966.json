    "A really cool intro to electronic music! Konrad's goal for the course was to expose us to a lot of different Max patching techniques so that we could \"hack apart\" a patch that someone else created and tweak it for our needs. (By the way, programming for this class is done almost exclusively through a visual programming language called \"Max\". You need to google \"MaxMSP\" to find it.) He was really successful in doing that. However, it would have been more effective if we focused more time on the basics of Max, and had assignments that required us to build patches from scratch. This would have provided an important foundational skill set to students without prior Max experience. By the time the final project rolled around, I found myself spending most of my time frantically learning the fundamentals of Max that I didn't even realize I didn't know! All this being said, it was a wonderful course that I highly recommend! Possibly my favorite thing about this course was the diversity of the class's interests, from music, physics, computer science, and electrical engineering majors to students in the School of Drama and School of Music. It was fun to see how everyone used Max in unique ways. LLLOrkY! (\"Long Live Laptop Orchestra of Yale!\")",
    "Take it! It will blow your mind.",
    "I've maybe once or twice learned as much in a class. MAX is amazing!!!!",
    "An eclectic mix of programming, acoustics and other theory, and music performance. Lots of fun."
