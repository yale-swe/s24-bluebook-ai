   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved this class. It was so different from the theory-based classes in my major that I looked forward to every class session that we had together. The nature of the material also meant that virtually all students were incredibly engaged in the subject matter being discussed; it was an excellent way to end senior year.",
    "Interesting readings, great discussions. This course is very instructive in forming your understanding of structural issues.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You'd be crazy not to take it. Unless you don't like class discussion - but then why are you looking at a seminar anyway? The readings are manageable, Prof. Rasmussen understands that you're an actual human being, and you will have fun.",
    "If you're interested in talking about race, take this class. If you have some foundational knowledge about race, race formations, etc you probably won't learn anything substantial.",
    "This course is interesting and has a light work load. Professor Rasmussen is great!",
    "A cool class with an interesting reading list, but the conversation often devolved into the world of personal example-giving and non-academic discussions \u0097 things like \"When I came to Yale, I was the only black person in my suite, and it was really hard.\" (This is coming from someone who was also the only black person in my suite when I was a freshman.) I used to call ERM 232 the \"racially-confused-people support group.\" It's a shame, because the readings were so fascinating and nuanced \u0097 I wish we could have engaged with them more rigorously.Prof. Rasmussen is very knowledgeable and knows a lot about her area of study. There's a lot to be learned from her.",
    "Interesting course... I learned a lot. The pace of the class got slow at times, but I think a lot of what the class ends up being depends on the students. Professor Rasmussen is very insightful and does a good job of tying in issues learned in class to current events as well as on campus happenings.",
    "AMST 262 is a great class that focuses on issues of whiteness studies, immigration studies, etc. A must-take class that every Yalie needs before graduating. Take it with Rasmussen!",
    "Take this class if you enjoy heavy class participation!",
    "If you're interested in learning about contemporary ethnic studies, this is a great overview. Also, this class has the best paper topics ever: really challenged and excited me to write the papers.",
    "Don't think just take it.",
    "One of the best classes you can take at Yale. There is not a lot of pressure in class and it really is a time for you to talk about the readings or any other thoughts you have about ethnic studies. If you aren't too interested in the material take it for Professor Brander Rasmussen. There is no way you will not like her. Some class days were so involved that we went over the class time- this happenedall the time because the students were engaged. Take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "yeah!"
