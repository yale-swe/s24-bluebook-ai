   "comments": [
    "If needed, take it. If not, don't.",
    "Recommended. A well-designed laboratory course.",
    "I would recommend Chem 223L as a way to put to use the reactions learned in organic chemistry.",
    "great supplement to learn orgo concepts that are otherwise more blurry if you just take the chem 221 lecture",
    "It's not bad for a lab course. Most of the labs do not take that long.",
    "Much better than gen chem lab, significantly better than orgo lab I, in my opinion. You already know the vast majority of the skills. There can be a lot of waiting, but not a lot of tedium.",
    "Chem 223L is a fun lab. The experiments are interesting and the workload is very manageable. The labs are great applications of the concepts we learn in lecture. I would definitely recommend this lab!",
    "This is a great course to take. The workload will not wear you down at all, and there's a lot of pride to be had in the assortment of colored solids you'll by synthesizing. And you'll most always be out before 3:15, which is a boon. Highly recommended.",
    "Chem 223L is better than first semester in that you do more interesting syntheses. There are longer postlabs, sure, but it's not as bad as everyone says it is (as long as you get a great TA like David Romney). Overall, more enjoyable than first semester lab.",
    "Orgo lab is one of the more relaxed lab classes. People say it's a pain but it's really not and it can be pretty fun synthesizing compounds.",
    "Yes! It's way better and more relaxed than Chem 116L. It's prbably one of the best labs to take at Yale.",
    "it's more work that first semester orgo lab. it's actually enjoyable though. not too much time spent IN lab but a lot of time spent outside of lab writing reports.",
    "I mean if you're pre-med you have to take it so it doesn't really matter if i recommend it or not. It is a good lab, though.",
    "orgo lab is much easier than gen chem lab.. super relaxed and your results aren't all that important (as long as you can explain why you have a low percent yield)",
    "It is required for pre-meds. I did think it was sort of fun.",
    "If you're taking this lab it's because you have to. That being said, it's a pretty good one. Especially if you're pursuing a career or internship in a lab - the things you learn will continue to serve you in real life.",
    "You're taking this for pre-med, right? It's fine, DiMeglio makes it bearable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I think that lab is a great way to see the material from lecture in practice and to realize that reactions actually have applications once they come off the page. Synthesizing banana smell one week and aspirin over the next two? It was fun to spend a couple of hours every week watching things change colors, textures, physical states, and structures. Though reflux was sometimes long, it let you getyour lab notes done during lab. That's fine by me.",
    "Not too bad of a lab",
    "manageable workload, lab topics were very relevant to lecture",
    "Take it if you have to for credit -- and ONLY if you HAVE TO. Lab single-handedly ruins a whole weekday for me.",
    "YES! Orgo lab with Christine and her cohort of great TAs is actually, really, really fun! Cool experiments make you feel like you're not wasting any time at all, which for a lab is an achievement in an of itself.",
    "I mean its orgo lab - I don't know why you would take it if you weren't premed or a chem major, but for a science lab its really not too bad.",
    "Yes! Especially if you are interested in science!",
    "This is the best lab that I have taken at Yale so far. Work is very manageable and the final at the end of the course is very fair. Labs won't ever last for all four hours, you usually get out after an hour or two.",
    "If you are taking it, you took first semester so you are kind of stuck. There is no appreciable difference in difficulty between the two. Make sure to focus on the science a little more.",
    "Take it (if you're reading this you probably already have to). It's not too much work (a fair half credit I think) and well-run--really student-oriented and you learn a lot. DiMeglio is a great lab instructor and she understands what a reasonable workload is.",
    "Yes, if you are pre-med or chem major.",
    "Work wasn't as demanding as I thought it would be.",
    "The experiments are much more fun this semester than for first semester orgo lab.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. But overall, the labs are fun!",
    "Yes, cool.",
    "Welcome to the world of a never-ending stream of EP's, LN's, and PL's. You will end up rewriting the procedure of each lab more times than you care to, but, overall, the work load isn't to bad and not overly difficult. Of the labs I've taken (bio, physics, gen chem) this was probably the best\/most tolerable (though still I can't say I actually looked forward to going to lab). But hey, you're a premed or a chem\/mbb major, so you have no choice but to take this. In fact, you already took the first half of this course so you know what you in for. Good luck, my friend, and enjoy your refluxing...",
    "Basically, your experience all depends on your TA. A harsh grader\/unhelpful TA will negatively taint your lab experience which should otherwise be straightforward methodical. The final was very difficult.",
    "Good lab",
    "It's the standard second semester orgo lab course. You'll take it if you have to. The experiments are more enjoyable than first semester lab and the post-lab assignments take less time. Definitely not too difficult to do well and worthwhile taking.",
    "Yes; especially since it is a premed requirement. The labs got boring and the time in the lab is not long--just a few hours. But, the lab write-ups are tedious.",
    "Yes take chem223--it's a great supplement to the class and reinforces a lot of the concepts that you learn in chem221. It's fun, too, and provides a nice break to the monotony of orgo2 lecture. It's a lot more laid-back than general chem lab, and i think because of this you end up learning\/retaining a lot more knowledge.",
    "pretty much a continuation of orgo lab I.",
    "If you're taking Organic Chemistry II then I'd definitely recommend the lab to go with it. However, if you're taking Organic Chemistry II then you most likely have to take the lab anyway.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "yes, its a good lab to take, and proves that chemistry is more than drawing structures in your notebook; the things actually work. also, it allows you to put to practice what you did in the chem 222L",
    "This is a great lab - the syntheses are fun to run (even though they do get slightly repetitive at the end, and even though for the most part you're just following instructions) and the workload isn't too heavy. Take it if you have to or if you want to get familiar with basic lab techniques in organic synthesis.",
    "yes",
    "Chemistry 223L is a great lab course. Most of the people take it to fulfill pre-med reqs as I did, so I would just say that the workload is not too intense and the experiments are pretty straightforward. You're given ample time to write the full lab reports, and the post-lab assignmentsdo a good job of making sure you understood what you did in lab that week.",
    "The effort you put in is what you get out.",
    "Take it if you need the lab. It's relatively painless and sometimes very satisfying.",
    "Shadows what you learn in orgo II; lots of labs are basically sitting waiting while refluxing, so it's not too much work.",
    "Orgo Lab II was a great lab. It was well organized, and the workload was reasonable. It was probably the least painful, dare I say, pleasant lab I have taken at Yale.",
    "Second semester chemistry laboratory is much less concerned with having perfectly formatted lab reports than first semester. In this lab, you must understand the material. If you forget page numbers, it's understood that it's not the end of the world. The work is appropriate for a half credit class. I feel like I learned a lot and that this lab helped my understanding of Orgo II lecture as well.",
    "It's not the most time intensive lab you'll take, but it is by no means the easiest. Watch out for meticulous grading.",
    "Very good. It actually has the right amount of work for a half-credit course. TAs and DiMeglio are quick to respond to emails. Sometimes grading is a bit arbitrary and varies among sections, but as long as you ask a lot of questions, you won't have a problem.",
    "Best science lab I've ever taken at Yale. The lecture material goes hand-in-hand (for the most part) with the lab experiments. You don't have to stress all the time about grades. Instead you can really concentrate on the concepts, making it so much more enjoyable. Also, the environment is not as tense or hardcore as most other labs like gen chem or physics (they even play music in the background!). Simply put, you're going to have a blast.",
    "If you're considering it, then that means you have to take it. It's actually interesting and much more fun than Orgo 1 Lab. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this lab because it was fun and I feel like a learned a lot about basic organic synthesis. It was a good introductory lab course and does not assign unnecessary work.",
    "There's pretty much no way you're taking orgo lab if you don't have to. That said, it's not so bad, and I actually had fun running reactions. Basically, if you like\/are good at lab, you'll probably like Chem 223L, and if you don't, you won't.",
    "I would definitely take this lab if it fits into your schedule, even if you don't have to. It's well-run, and the laid-back atmosphere in lab makes the time spent there enjoyable. The hardest thing about the lab is the final at the end, and if you listen to their recommendations and do the questions as you complete each lab, it's not difficult to prepare for.",
    "Chem 223L is a good class. It is not boring and the music in the background, while experimenting is comforting. Also, the class is really manageable with more intensive classes, since it doesn't take up that much time out of class time.",
    "Second semester orgo lab is harder than first semester. The work isn't much worse (although you write two lab reports instead of one), but the grading is much tougher. Most of the experiments don't take too long.",
    "Fine - exactly like first semester.",
    "Recommend. Most people only take it because they have to do it for Pre-med or they're chemistry majors.",
    "Take the class, especially if you want to work in a lab. It really improves your lab skills.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to students taking Organic Chemistry. It complements the course nicely by reinforcing material taught and class and by providing a new perspective to the material.",
    "I actually really liked the class, and I would definitely recommend it...the labs were well structured, there was always plenty of time to finish the lab, and the work outside of class was far more appropriate for a half credit class than most. This was the best lab I've taken at Yale so far. There's music played on the radio throughout lab, so it's a way less stressful atmosphere than what you'll find in other labs.",
    "One of the best labs that you will ever take, and the work is not overly grueling.",
    "Much easier than other labs.",
    "It's a good class, although I probably wouldn't take it unless you're required to. Lab write-ups are a lot of busy work. Overall a good overview of the laboratory side of chemistry.",
    "Yes, orgo lab is fun and great. Definitely take it if you're taking orgo concurrently.",
    "Great course to take simultaneously with the Organic Chemistry class.",
    "Yes, if interesting in organic chemistry, it should be taken.",
    "Take this course. It is a very good way of learning how to organize well made laboratory reports.",
    "Just like orgo lab 1 except more synthesis. there aren't too many full lab reports so that's nice.",
    "Chem 223L is a great lab! You learn all the fundamental techniques of organic chemistry lab while making beautiful crystals and even a banana-scented liquid. I'm a chemistry major, so I'm predisposed to like it, but I think most everyone found it enjoyable and low-stress.",
    "This was a good course that helped to clarify how some of the reactions we learned in lecture actually work.",
    "It won't add much more than 221L did but take it if you have to. Be prepared to write things like 5 times for each lab.",
    "Lab experience depends on the TA. I enjoyed orgo lab because I had a really helpful TA. It can be a lot of work, especially the lab reports. However, there are only two lab reports in the second semester.",
    "Chances are you don't have much of a choice if you're thinking about taking 223, but rest assured that it's a very good class. The fact that the labs were pretty cool and that the class environment was very chill and amiable made me enjoy coming to class every week. The Experiment Plans are kind of a drag though, as it feels like most of it is just copying the procedure and the chemical information for each chemical used.",
    "Yes! Let's face it, you are going to take this class because you have to so there is really no point in me recommending this lab to you. Do know that if you have a great TA (easy grader) and you alot a certain amount of time to lab each week, you will be fine.",
    "Great course! I really enjoyed the experiments! : )"
