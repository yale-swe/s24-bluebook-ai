    "Take this class if you're interested in 16th and 17th-century poetry! It's not exaaaactly for the faint of heart, since some of the poems are highly theological (etc) but Prof. Manley does a lovely job of placing each author in his (not her, unfortunately) sociocultural context. Discussion is often a little sluggish, but that didn't bother me! Our group vibe this year was encouraging and friendly and I felt very comfortable inhabiting the silence. The workload isn't too bad, a total of 20-25 pages of written work! Marvell, Sidney, Donne, Shakespeare, Herbert: all such great poets!",
    "I would recommend this class because the workload was very manageable, the material was interesting, and the teacher was accommodating.",
    "This is a well-taught, well-structured class. Take it!"
