   "comments": [
    "This course is an unparalleled opportunity to read some of the greatest poetry ever written under the guidance of a truly incredible professor.",
    "This course is a survey in some of the most notable authors of anglophone poetry from John Milton to Hart Crane (including Blake, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson, Browning, Yeats, Stevens). These texts are difficult, but if the group of students is committed to engaging with them, you will learn a lot. Professor Bloom has studied and written on all of these poets, who are some of his all-time favorites, so his insights and knowledge of the works are incredible. Between the syllabus and Professor Bloom's challenging, thought-provoking questions, this is a great course.",
    "This course introduced me not only to an entire host of great English poets, but also illuminated the connections and influences between great artists from Milton through Hart Crane. I learned how to read poetry and provided me with a better understanding of how to navigate literary criticism. Most importantly, this course instilled in me a true love of poetry that I've never before experienced.",
    "The course, unlike any other, tests those at its table to walk to the edge of the bounds of human abstraction--- to discern the wildly different step of the darkest and lightest chapters of the English language, and to pump our own spirit to the echelon of its verse. It reads canon: that is, it vests its students with an ammunition to uniquely challenge canon. The 9 students admitted each have a unique veto vote in the democracy of ideas that lives organically: ideas are sharpened in tutorial with Bloom at his home (over tea and cookies), but these knives are surrendered in a caring effort come seminar to engage and grow the ideas of peers, until the final breaths of the class breathe with a felicitous love of the art:life to come.",
    "Everything. Just listening in this class was incredible. This is the kind of class you go to Yale to take."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is simply an experience not to be missed.",
    "The syllabus is fantastic and there are few professors more qualified to teach these authors than Harold Bloom. His choice of poems to focus on is great, and all the questions he asks get students to think more deeply and engage more critically with the texts. The weakness of the course is its great dependence on technology. The Skype wasn't working well for the first few weeks, making the experience rather unpleasant. Once these technical difficulties were addressed, things improved. Also, students were very shy and reticent to participate at the beginning of the course, despite Professor Bloom's encouragement. It took them a while to warm up. Having a grad student auditor in the class to facilitate the discussion and contribute thoughts when the undergrads were hesitant helped introduce new insights and make the students more willing to participate.",
    "I cannot heap enough praise upon this course. I entered this class feeling somewhat jaded about the ivory tower and academia and felt jaded about the value of studying English. I left with a newfound enthusiasm for the study of poetry and a heightened sense of intellectual curiosity. Professor Bloom made poetry feel... well... real. Learning about the nature of poetic influence left me with a fuller understanding of the entire English poetic canon. Moreover, the emotion that Professor Bloom himself brings to poetry is contagious. Though I will never have the same relationship with poetry that Professor Bloom does, seeing him in action and watching him connect to the text made me feel just a little bit closer to the things we were reading. The class also reintroduced me to literary criticism. Throughout the class, Professor Bloom encouraged us to read various pieces of criticism on all of the poets we read. From this point forward, I don't think I will ever be able to read a single poem without also diving into the critical discussion surrounding it. There is one logistical weakness I would like to identify with this course. First, there were, throughout the semester, many technical difficulties. As the class is conducted over skype, the audio transmission would often cut in and out, making discussions difficult. Perhaps having a technician or a tech savvy TA in the room during seminars could remedy this issue. Though the technical difficulties never really detracted from the quality of discussion, it often served as a recurring distraction. Regardless, this class was incredible. One of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale and certainly an experience I will never forget.",
    "This class was incredible. The Skype format took some time to adapt to, but Professor Bloom is unbelievable and the class works at a high level.",
    "Strengths: Breathing room to think about the poems in whatever ways feel most motivated; fortifying and difficult questions to expand your thinking on them; professor who's clearly a prodigious reader and passionate about every text on the syllabus; fellow students with deep care and respect for literature. Weaknesses: The last few poets (Hart Crane, Wallace Stephens) felt a bit rushed, given the particularity of idiolect, its rewards and challenges."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, this course's syllabus is fantastic--must reads, whether or not you're an English major--and of course Professor Bloom is a world-class scholar of this subject matter. He loves these poets, is really passionate about the literature, and is incredibly willing to listen to students discuss and contribute their own thoughts. Especially with a strong group of classmates, you can get a lot out of the course.",
    "Definitely take it if you can. It seems like most people who apply get in, so don't worry too much about that. Class discussion is similar to many other seminars, but obviously Bloom has some interesting things to say; the Skype format is less weird than you'd expect also. He also strongly encourages everyone to come to his house throughout the semester, so you'll get to meet him in person. These in-person meetings are interesting - they are always very short (15-20 minutes) and generally you just talk about your life instead of about literature. As for workload, there's a manageable amount of reading each week plus a very open-ended final essay.",
    "YES! This is the best class I've taken at Yale. I can't say enough good things about it. Truly an experience not to be missed.",
    "Harold Bloom's status among the greatest luminaries of the modern day cannot be understated; it evokes the best of his class. His piercing gaze into literary argument, both in tutorial and his 9-person seminars, is matched only by the deep and caring interest he takes in every student (and family!) that pass through his doors. The course is a paragon of what University ought to be -- unbridled intellectual freedom, cheerful debate of the daemon in our lives by the proxy of poetic canon, all the way down to weekly tutorials with Harold and Jeanne at their home. The course, unlike any other, tests those at its table to walk to the edge of the bounds of human abstraction--- to discern the wildly different step of the darkest and lightest chapters of the English language, and to pump our own spirit to the echelon of its verse. It reads canon: that is, it vests its students with an ammunition to uniquely challenge canon. The 9 students admitted each have a unique veto vote in the democracy of ideas that lives organically: ideas are sharpened in tutorial with Bloom at his home (over tea and cookies), but these knives are surrendered in a caring effort come seminar to engage and grow the ideas of peers, until the final breaths of the class breathe with a felicitous love of the art:life to come. The course has portent for those in any major or discipline. No course at Yale gives the opportunity to so think at the edge of human capability (with every student in the 9 holding a unique veto vote in the democracy of ideas), and no less it achieves it in a way consistent with a Life of love.",
    "Absolutely. Please, please, please take this if you get in. This class changed my Yale experience entirely, and I'm so lucky to have taken it.",
    "Yes if you want to take a class with a Yale legend!",
    "Spiriting class. A chance to air your thoughts on some wonderful poems with people who will probe, question, cherish them alongside you. Though there was attention to genealogy (the influence of poetic influence) particularly when Prof. Bloom intervened with commentary we mostly let the poems take us wherever they did. Discussion was always free, and often revelatory. What I didnt expect to find as meaningful as I did, though, was just how emotionally invested in the readings Bloom was. You get the sense that its not just scholarship; its living. Be prepared to think, but be prepared to feel, too."
