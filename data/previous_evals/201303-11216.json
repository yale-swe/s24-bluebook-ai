   "comments": [
    "YES! An amazing class. Schubert is the best, this team of teachers is the best.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Studying Schubert with Jonathan and McCreless was the most we could ask from a senior seminar.",
    "Great senior seminar, and you get to learn about both vocal and instrumental music.",
    "If this course is offered again, definitely take it for your senior seminar! Who wouldn't want to study Schubert and at that study him in such a way that you probably haven't before?",
    "This is a great class to take if you want to have class discussion about some of the best music ever written. If you have any interest in Schubert, or want to become more interested in Schubert, take this course.",
    "An in-depth look at aspects of much of Schubert's biggest vocal and instrumental works (and some obscure ones, too)! I would definitely recommend this course; I learned so much and found it enjoyable every step of the way. The music was beautiful and the discussions interesting.",
    "You will get out of this class as much as you put into it. There is a ton of preparation work assigned each week which ends up not being that useful in the discussions, but you'll be exposed to a lot of music that you otherwise would not likely know about (the idea is that voice students will get familiar with Schubert's instrumental pieces, and then instrumentalists will get familiar with Schubert's voice pieces). If you have the time and interest to participate in high-level academic analysis and discussions with experienced scholars, then this course would be a great opportunity to do so. If you don't have the time, it will be less fulfilling.",
    "If you have ever for one half-second believed those hissing whispers that Schubert was a composer of inconsequential or inane music, you're wrong and it's important that you take this class to see why.",
    "I would readily take this course again! And I highly encourage any student of music\/history\/aesthetics to take this course. It is a special and rarified subject, taught by an inspiring professor! A must take!"
