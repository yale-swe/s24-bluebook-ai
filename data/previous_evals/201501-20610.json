    "I would recommend this course to other students.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students. It's a nice class for anthro students in any sub-field.",
    "I would recommend this to any student in anthropology particularly those who work with material culture, so all archaeologists. It will get you out of your comfort zone, but you'll be better off for it. Be prepared to read and read critically, there will be stuff that you will not understand that will come to light as you complete the other readings for the week and\/or in class. It is theory heavy and sometimes you may not see the point of some readings but it will come.",
    "I would highly recommend ANTH 637 to another student. Discussing materiality in both the light of cultural anthropology and archaeology allows for a vast array of new perspectives. This class will also help students to think further about and engage more with museums and music culture."
