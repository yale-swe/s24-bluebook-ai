   "comments": [
    "Spanish and spanish grammar. Mostly a review from L1 and L2.",
    "It's quite boring and going to class every day is obviously a bummer but if you want to learn the language well and aren't motivated enough\/don't have time to do it on your own, yeah, take it.",
    "Take it if you have to to fulfill your requirement. If you have a good teacher (hint: Lissette Reymundi is great) and good classmates, class time canbe fun. Although it isn't the most exciting material, you will get better at speaking and understanding Spanish, although my writing didn't improve too much.",
    "The course was great to hone your Spanish abilities. The professor was great and the stories we read in class were usually interesting. I would recommend Spanish 130 to a fellow student if they are looking to review a lot of grammar and improve in their Spanish skills.",
    "This spanish is great for anyone looking to improve on their conversation and writing. It's not too hard but not too easy. Tests seem a little much at first but it's easy to adjust and you'll learn so much about spanish.",
    "This class is fun if you like the language. Will make much better than how you were coming in if you do all the work and talk as much as possible",
    "Spanish 130 is basically like any other high school Spanish class with slightly harder tests. I would recommend it because Spanish is fun and you'll need to take a language class anyway (and if you're placed in Spanish 130, you don't really have a choice). You do learn a lot in this class and Sra. Reymundi goes over certain specific rules that I didn't learn in high school, so that's helpful. THe only issue I have is the ridiculous grading system for homework; an unnecessarily high number of points are taken off for grammar errors, and since homework is worth 18%, it seems a bit harsh. Every grammar mistake is approximately 2% off the final homework grade...and trust me, it adds up.",
    "Its a great class for getting your Spanish back going if you've taken a break for some time, and provides you with the grammatical and linguistic tools for having basic and general conversations with Spanish speakers.",
    "This class is twice as much work as Span110 or Span120, but you probably have to take it anyway. Search around for a good professor, and good luck!"
