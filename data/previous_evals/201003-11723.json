    "There were intriguing academic speakers, but I would also have liked more speakers that were not in academia.",
    "I liked the co-sponsorships of lectures this semester.",
    "I liked getting a broad sense of what was going on in EMD. There were a lot of speakers and different places and times to keep up with which weren't convenient.",
    "The seminar consisted of different guest lecturers every week. While the guest lecturers were good, I was not interested in many of the topics and, therefore, did not absorb a lot of the information. Many of the issues focused on global health and vector-transmissible diseases. While it is understandable that public health focuses on many issues in the developing worlds, this may not an interest for all students.",
    "The seminar in EMD was a great opportunity to see what other people in this field are doing with their degrees, and we had a lot of really great talks over the semester. It would have been great to be able to give feedback on what subject areas we would have liked to hear about and have more time to interact with our guest speakers, but otherwise it was a great course.",
    "Very interesting!",
    "Great in every way.",
    "The course provided exposure to current research in infectious diseases, the challenges researchers faced and how they overcame them.",
    "Interesting speakers, good variety, I also enjoy the lunches.",
    "I enjoyed EMD seminar. I thought they brought in some really great speakers.",
    "Great lecturers and interesting topics.",
    "Most of the lectures were great. I wish that they would always be at the same time each week, or that if it is moved, that it be optional to attend that week. Also, more food should be ordered so that people don't have to feel timid about taking what will fill them.",
    "Strengths: Getting students and researchers togetherWeaknesses: Lack of variety in research topics (way too many vector-born diseases); lack of involving students; wasn't student-oriented; to many co-collaborators, rather than leaders of their fields (I expected more of Yale).",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the seminars every week. The speakers were very engaging and inspiring. I looked forward to seminars.",
    "The seminar series was very interesting this semester and I enjoyed the lectures. I was disappointed when lectures were not held at their normal time on Thursday at noon since most of us have busy schedules and cannot attend at other times. At times, I was unsure if we were having lecture or not, so communication could also be improved.",
    "It didn't feel well organized or that engaging. I would have enjoyed more discussion on study design, and how researchers set up their experiments. The epidemiological study on the island was the best presentation for this reason, since it focused on process.",
    "I think this is a great class to expose EMD students to research going on. I would like this class to maybe give more insight into the internships available in the field of EMD."

    "It is important to attend the seminars because they help you get a look into public health research in EMD.",
    "A good broad overview of topics in EMD. Not necessarily helpful always, but good general info. Lunch was a huge plus!",
    "First of all, the seminar is required for first years. While not all of the topics may be of interest to me, it is helpful to learn about the current major issues in public health and public health research in infectious diseases.",
    "Its a seminar",
    "The seminar in EMD really made me excited to be here because I was able to see various ways that researchers\/doctors\/academics are applying the knowledge we'll receive from EMD in productive ways. The spectrum of speakers was wonderful, and it was a great way to interact with my department right after arriving at the School of Public Health.",
    "Great.",
    "I recommend taking this course every semester to develop a breadth of exposures to current research in epidemiology of microbial diseases. There really is no reason not to go: very interesting, faculty interaction, and free lunch.",
    "The seminar in EMD provides students with exposure to current infectious disease research and can give insight to how to conduct reseach in infectious disease research.",
    "The course brings in lecturers doing various work in public health related to Epidemiology of Microbial Diseases. It was interesting and I enjoyed listening to the faculty ask questions. It helped me to think differently and analyze the research being presented.",
    "Go to the lectures - they are usually very interesting. But get there early because they never order enough food for lunch.",
    "n\/A",
    "Excellent. I would gladly attend those lectures again."
