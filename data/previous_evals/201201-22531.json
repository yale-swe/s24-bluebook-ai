    "Chinese 155 is harder than Chinese 154 (last term). Zhou laoshi ups the standards: Homework is posted only in Chinese, and grading is harsher. Still, I would recommend the class. I enjoyed it a lot!",
    "Great class, very interesting topics, Zhou laoshi is by far the best ! I found myself being able to express my actual thoughts and opinions on so many political and social issues I was amazed by my progress ! Definitely take it if you want to take your chinese to the next level !",
    "It's a good way to learn more grammar and improve your written\/reading Chinese, but my speaking has definitely gotten a lot worse this year. Overall, if you want to keep your Chinese up a little bit, take it. You need to go to China to really learn more and improve at this level.",
    "Great class - easy transition from the 150\/151 series. Topics get more interesting than previous years - lots of useful vocab. If you want to continue Chinese just take this.",
    "YES! The class is amazing and it does a great job in getting you interested in modern Chinese culture and language without too much stress. You will really enjoy the class if you take it.",
    "Great for keeping your Chinese skills from deteriorating and for more in-depth learning about Chinese culture and discussions, but don't expect huge leaps forward in proficiency."
