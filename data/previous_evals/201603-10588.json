   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture could have been more interactive",
    "Being a brand new course, the biggest weakness was defining the nature of the course and trying to establish a direction. I think the initial mantra of trying to find overlap between different groups of \"others\" was great, but that vision was sort of lost towards the end of the semester as the categories of \"others\" became more abstract. The discussion was also a bit stagnant and at many points it felt like a graduate seminar that undergraduates were observing. I think deciding between a lecture and seminar, or perhaps making one day a discussion day and the other a lecture might be worth exploring, as Professor Gerow's lectures were excellent, and when the whole class did get going on a discussion, they were lively and exciting. Professor Gerow also had an excellent syllabus both in terms of films and topics explored. Staying a bit more rigid on these themes and not letting the grad students move the conversation into realms where far more background knowledge of Japanese media is required to follow it is necessary, though. This really only became an issue in the last few weeks of class, but there were a few moments where, despite having attended the screening and done the readings, I didn't feel like I could participate, as the discussions felt insular.",
    "I should have paid more attention in class, but the class also should have been either a lecture or a seminar, not a \"leminar.\" Also, the three grad students were great and knowledgeable but took what discussion there was to a level beyond what the undergrads could contribute to in a useful way.",
    "Sometimes the watchload got to be a lot with the weekend viewing.",
    "This course's major strength was its diverse selection of materials - films, books, articles, essays, clips. I actually can't think of any major weaknesses.",
    "The subject and films were extremely interesting, although the course felt a little rough around the edges--understandable given it's new. Keep in mind the films are selected for their relevance as representations of others in Japan, not necessarily because they are good movies."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in Japanese culture and cinema then yes, also, there often just isn't any other East Asian-focused film courses which is something THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE.",
    "Hmm. Possibly not. If you want to watch cool films from Japan, ones you might not find on your own, it's a good time for that. If you want really engaging discussions about those films, probably not.",
    "This class was a great way to learn about Japanese culture, minorities in Japan, as well as Japanese film. Each week was devoted to a specific type of other. The screenings were always engaging. There were two papers and a creative group project.",
    "An interesting class,",
    "Yes, this is an excellent introduction to wonderful and obscure Japanese filmmakers.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in Japanese sociology. But, for film majors the class could definitely be more focused on the films instead of just the societal others of Japan.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone even remotely invested in film studies, Japanese cultural studies, or studies of ethnicity and nationality. I think the course would work as well for those with little to no experience in its subjects as for those with plenty of experience.",
    "Yes."
