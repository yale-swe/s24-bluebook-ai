   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0It took an enormous amount of time and effort to coordinate all six required course. The school could have predicted that, no matter how little each course requires, having six courses makes delivering quality work difficult, at times impossible. It felt strange that studio, not until BP and studio merge at least, was NOT the core of our study. In the future, this problem could be avoided by making Site&Climate a one time seminar with a couple of evening lectures. And Visualization assignments should be closely coordinated with studio workload.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Besides BP, fairly unsuccessful.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Besides some deadline conflictions, it was very good. I liked how vizualization got incorporated into studio this semester and how studio was a logical progression into building project.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0I don't think there was much of a crossover between studio and other classes.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0The whole semester, practically, focused on housing and building\/making, and I enjoyed getting a comprehensive understanding of that, but it made it difficult to reconcile the imaginative studio projects with the realism of building techniques. I felt that I was being told contradictory things when on one hand BP encouraged us to learn proper building codes and requirements, and on the other, studio asked us to invent nearly impossible living arrangements. It was frustrating trying to listen to both sides.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Crossover was not apparent",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0The semester had the potential to synthesize the work in all courses in a compelling and fruitful manner; however, the courses were not efficiently coordinated leading to extensive \"busy work\" and miscellaneous production.",
    "Instructor: Amy Lelyveld \u00a0good crossover between structures and studio.also some good discussions in urban regarding BP.The BP course and studio for the most part worked well together.",
    "Instructor: Amy Lelyveld \u00a0Perhaps this is the best box to comment on the overall balance of the courses this semester. As many are aware, our semester was over loaded not in that there was more work than the previous semester or any other semester but that the work was chopped up into many little pieces. The goal I believe was to cover a wide variety of subject necessary for building a house but sacrificed any substantial investigation. Breadth certainly beat depth this semester.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0The Vis III class had a large impact as we moved forward with BP. The understanding of material properties and how things are fabricated and ultimately assembly helped greatly. Building Technology had the same effect. Structures also had us looking into the structure for our BP house. All of the classes were really great except for Urban Planning. That class did nothing but take precious time away from the other pertinent classes.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0This crossover is an imagined concept that is at odds with the strictly proscribed projects and timing of class material.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0There seemed to be a fairly high level of coordination between the classes and instructors in the second semester. The instructors were in communication with each other and seemed like they were making an effort to connect themes and topics. In some cases, however, that coordination fell through and, with a SEVEN class course load, I personally felt inundated with work and deadlines that were simply unfortunate, both to myself and the quality of work.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0There was crossover content between studio and several other classes, including building project, site and climate, and structures. The crossover with structures was especially helpful, as it allowed us to evaluate our design projects based on the structural concepts and equations learned in class. This was especially critical during the building project design.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0crossover was really not a winner for this semester. the knowledge was pooled individual to each class, and what was passed over was just general knowledge. Doubt true crossover can occur at this school unless the professor is contiguous through multiple classes.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Though the replication project supposedly had correlations with the critical connections project of visualization, it otherwise didn't really have that much to do with the subject matter of the other classes.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Obviously the auxiliary BP course directly related, but there was little else in terms of valuable crossover. I do not see this as a problem.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0The only class I felt overlapped with studio well was my VSBA in Context class, which is an elective.Also, Visualization was relevant because we learned to mill.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Any crossover themes\/issues\/material were all only skin-deep. Any attempt for exploration beyond one class was never truly followed through and was always dropped pretty quickly into the assignment.However, I am not sure how valuable crossover truly is. Courses either need to be completely integrated or they need to be separate. The superficial crossover is just a hindrance to both classes. If there is going to be no follow-through with the crossover, then it shouldn\u0092t be there in the first place.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0I believe that there was a great disconnect between some classes (such as visualization, site and climate, and building technology) and the studio assignments. There is certainly a great possibility to connect these classes with the studio projects, however, I did not think that any of them did it in a successful way.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Good. The visualization class and Building Tecnology crossed over nicely with Studio.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Structures and building tech were well co-ordinated with studio; topics dealt with in this class lent themselves to BP especially as we dealt with a finer level of detail. Urban Studies and Visualization\/fabrication had very little to do with studio.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Great integration with building project - the nature of the studio projects (program, scale, etc.) was directly relevant to the issues of bp. Compared to first semester studio, this semester explored more specific and concrete issues related to constructibility, which works quite nicely in conjunction with structures, site\/climate, building technology, and even visualization.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0I do appreciate that an effort was made to crossover between this class and others in regards to theme, construction logics, etc. I do think it can get better and stronger, but given the relative newness of classes like Viz III, it is just a matte of studio instructors talking with the instructors of other classes \"before\" the semester actually starts.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The crossover was not as strong as it could have been. That the Building Technology and structures crossed over was very valuable for the design process of the building project. However, given the practical nature of this semester, that integration could have happened earlier.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Much better co-ordinated than in the fall semester."

   "question_text": "Comment on the most and least valuable aspects of the studio",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0The most valuable aspects of the studio must be pin-ups and desk-crits with Alan. The least valuable aspect, if I dare to be very specific on this answer, was the outside expert we invited to Transmogrification. It is not only embarrassing but also unacceptable when an invited jury only started to read the specs of the project DURING the review. Some of the comments we got from that review, both from the invited jury and from some of the section critics, were completely irrelevant.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0The most valuable aspects of studio were the pit critiques that were open to the entire studio. This was partially a personal desk-crit, as well as an opportunity for the studio at large to learn from the work of their classmates. Also, the most successful project introductory exercise was with Co-Habitation, where we presented three different conceptual models. This was a fantastic way to begin a project because we were able to establish a conceptual framework for the design early on and then move forward toward higher levels of resolution.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0The outside experts were great. Having Bryan Bell come in as a juror for BP was amazing. All of the guests (Lyndsey, Chris, etc.) were extremely helpful and came in at the right time. One of my favorite things about Yale is the ability of the faculty to call on these knowledgeable people to come in and speak with us. The faculty have to cover all aspects of the design with us so to have specialists come in that can direct our attention to one area (structure, sustainability, etc)and relate it to the broader designs spoken about by the faculty is really helpful.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0All of the desk crits, pin-ups, and reviews were valuable. I felt that the assembly of critics in this studio was very good. I valued the opinion of my critic (Benner) and the feedback he shared with me during desk crits. I found Organschi's feedback to be refreshing and encouraging. The only time I did not find reviews to be productive is during BP team progress reviews. The various collection of critics who would change from meeting to meeting and slip in and out during review led to the same points being brought up that had already been previously discussed and it felt, at times, that we were moving backwards instead of making headway.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0The most valuable aspects of studio in the first half were one-on-one desk crits and pinups with the critics. It was especially helpful to talk to multiple studio critics in order to get more diverse feedback on the design work. In the building project portion of the studio, the pinups with the same two critics every week were not as helpful. Some of the feedback became repetitive and unhelpful, and it was often difficult to arrange meetings with the other critics. It would have been more helpful to meet with different critics throughout the process.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0The most valuable aspects of the studio = pin-ups with other critics as well as desk crits. The variety in level of detail between the different types of evaluation methods were very valuable.The least valuable aspects of the studio =",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0The sheer number of critics across the studio was distracting, misleading, and unnecessary. \"Design by consensus\" comes to mind. There were also too many projects for such a short time; rolling two projects together would be better.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Lectures and juries were decent. All else is related to section critic, see below.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0I felt this studio was great overall. I enjoyed all the projects, there just wasn't adequate time for them. At least one or two should replace the first-semester studio. However, I think the projects this semester were enhanced because of the critics. A vast improvement over first-semester.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Midreviews tend to be the most helpful. It is at this point when you can get another critic\u0092s opinion and also have time to do something about it.The LEAST valuable thing about studio is when they bring in a critic that either does not understand the project or is decidedly set against it. The main visiting critic for our Transmogrification project was horrible. He was not onboard with the project, nor was willing to look creatively at the assignment. After asking 10 students to work non-stop for 4 days making one huge model, the best way to bring down morale is to have a guest critic like that. He was neither helpful nor pleasant and it ended the entire project in a sour note\u0097not a good way to go into the Building Project. It is thestudio organizers\u0092 responsibility to bring in guest critcs that can aptly address the assignment and can encourage and inspire students to continue working and learning. A review like the final for Transmogrification frustrate the students and only add resentment for an already intense project.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0The least valuable aspects, in my opinion, are the group pin-ups. They waste valuable time and do not provide the kind of feedback that one can get from an individual review with his\/her critic or from a final or mid-review with invited outside critics. I found the desk-crits and mid-reviews to be the most valuable. During the desk-crit one can discuss the ideas and progress or concerns with the critic in great depth, many times arriving on solutions and ways to proceed. Mid-reviews are great for testing these ideas in front of a larger group of people and getting an outside perspective from invited critics.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Most valuable - juries.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Pin-up desk crits were very helpful and I got the impression that the critics this year were invested in seeing our projects work and helping work through issues. There were not enough class discussions; I think more input from classmates would be invaluable.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Pin-ups were most valuable, especially when two or more critics were present. There was a great diversity in personal style and approach to teaching amongst the critics this semester, and it was beneficial to hear multiple (often divergent) criticism, especially with regard to building project.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The most valuable aspect of the class was the desk crits as apposed to the many formal pin-ups. These pin-ups involved a lot of time wasted on producing presentation quality images and final models when simple sketches and sketch models in the context of a desk crit would have been just as helpful in the realization and development of an idea.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The group projects I found to be very interesting this semester. Learning to navigate such a difficult group process was very rewarding."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0I thought that the studio was important to get us thinking about issues of housing prior to the start of BP. I also thought that something like Transmog was a great counter point to BP. It gave us the chance to explore a housing project with none of the restrictions that we faced in BP. It was also good to have a dry run for working in a large team.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Too much work in other classes. Work load in other classes interfered with my design studio. This is a serious problem, which needs to be taken seriously by the curriculum committee.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0The sequence of projects was great - the real problem was the coordination of external courses in relation to the studio curriculum.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Scheduling 6 classes during this semester is ridiculous. I couldn't focus enough time on studio because I was busy tracing fuzzy satellite images in autocad for urban planning. Everything about studio was great. I just wish I could have focused more on it.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0This studio was much different than first semester studio, and the change in direction was welcome, personally. I think the critics here, on the whole, are more focused on giving us real and actual suggestions to help us move forward with our projects.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0This studio was very well organized and all of the projects were stimulating and thought-provoking. In particular, the Replication project provided a challenging program and enough time to develop it to a degree of resolution. Unfortunately, the number of weekly assignments due in other classes and lack of coordination between classes often made it difficult to devote sufficient time to studio work.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0strengths and weaknesses lie both in the concept of the political studio. from that, the great lessons are learned, good or bad.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0I believe the schedule for the first part of the studio is rather ambitious, but doable without distractions from other classes. Visualization being such an intense course in the beginning was rather detrimental to the production that was expected of us.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Studio is\u0097an should be\u0097considered the most important aspect of our time here at Yale. This is why we have come and a large part of what makes us better architects. However, this semester was a complete disaster. This may not be the studio organizers\u0092 fault, but probably more of an issue with the school in general, but this seems to be the best place to address the issue.The first year schedule is ridiculous. It is taxing and impossible. The constant emphasis on production in each class means that no aspect of production is done well. Every design program we took on in studio this semester was interesting and helpful; however, because of our overly-intensive schedule, we could not do our best work. Co-Hab was an interesting concept and fit perfectly with the scale of the projects in the studio this semester, but because of Viz, the project was ruined and no one finished what they were hoping. It disheartened the students when, after pulling an all-nighter for Viz and then one the next night for studio, the critics came down so hard on us for a issue of coordination that was not our fault. Transmogrification was a good first attempt at teamwork, but the review and guest critics were not helpful. Replication was the most successful project this semester. The reviews were helpful and it was a great way to lead into the BP portion of the course. However, because of all of our other classes, most students felt that they did not get the level of completion they desired in the project. The amount of work in other classes and the lack of coordination between the studio and other required courses end up hurting all of the courses, as well as making each student resent the school and its classes.If Yale is going to ask us to take 6 classes second semester (structures, studio, Viz III, urban, BP, building tech\/site analysis) then each class needs to not have a project due each week. This is already too many classes to take at one time, but to then insist that each student do a project for EACH class EACH week is absurd. The morale of the studio by the time Spring Break came around was so low that many people were strongly considering not coming back. When that much work is required, no student can do his or her best job at each project. Our class is full of Type-A personalities. When we are asked to produce this many projects each week, we end up submitting things that are not our best work. This only results in low self-esteem and frustration.If the school does not start taking the morale of students into consideration, it will soon not be able to pick from the best students. It is good that we were all so busy during Open House; no one was in the mood to portray Yale as a place someone would want to be. There were two instances in which a prospective student was asking about course load and a current student told them not to come here because of the focus on quantity of the classes and not on the quality of the education. This is a serious concern for this school and hopefully they will adequately address it.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0I think the studio is the most important and valuable course in the architectural education. It teaches one how to approach a given problem, how to formulate a solution, and how to execute that solution. Along with learning how to work with different tools (software and fabrication equipment), students also learn how to verbally and visually express their ideas to the outside critics, how to work in an intense and stressful environment, and, if applicable, how to work in groups (negotiating with peers and critics).I think the Cohabitation assignment and the Replication one were successful in terms of getting us to think about some of the issues that came later in the design of the house. I do not think that the transmogrification exercise was as successful, although I think the value of it was in the group work, getting us prepared for the much larger project at the end of the semester. I wish; however, that it would be done as a third project, after the replication. I felt like it broke the rhythm of the studio, separating the two other projects, cohab and replication, which I thought were more closely related to each other.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0It is very focused on making and production, which is a great thing. Its weakness is the extreme focus on representation techniques versus ideas. Sometimes the presentations we produce seem superficial in the end because so much time has gone into producing\/ representing underdeveloped ideas.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0The projects and their sequence were very well-designed. Issues that one project investigated often resurfaced in subsequent projects. The schedule was a bit too compressed - given that many of the projects asked to explore issues of structure\/materiality\/constructibility, it would have been beneficial to have more time to resolve some of these issues.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0This studio was very strong and well organized if viewed as a single class. When combined with other classes, esp. Building Project and Visualization III, there could have been more coordination. I do feel that the projects were a little rushed given that a full semester studio is condensed to fit into only about 3\/4 of the time. But I guess that is just the nature of the beast."

However, I expected to learn more from examples of analyses of different housing projects - i.e. this would have been appropriate for the 'analytique' i.e. transmogrification section.I do believe that such a studio would benefit from more analysis in particular with regards to program organization and that this could probably be worked into cohabitation or even replace it to provide a more rigorous approach rather than an experimental one.",

At the beginning I found him a little prescriptive, but later I realized it was only because he knew my project, my interests, and my background so well that he could give out constructive advice from the very first desk-crit. Alan is not only an amazing designer, expert in building and construction, but also an outstanding teacher who is completely capable of translating what he knows to what we can learn.",

This was the most valuable aspect of studio this semester.",

    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Alan is really nice and usually provides useful criticism in a positive way, which was especially refreshing after my experience first semester with a very tough critic. However, I sometimes wished that he were tougher or blunter when it came to offering design advice, because often it was difficult for me to formulate ideas novel ideas about housing and I wasn\u0092t receiving suggestions that forced me to take a strong position one way or another. What would have been helpful, something I did appreciate from my first semester critic, was some assistance in creating design concepts\u0097at least to begin with, so that I could then develop them on my own. I felt that Alan was trying to be careful not to be too pushy with his own ideas for my work, but that was the kind of advice I needed that I didn\u0092t receive.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Alan is clearly a great designer. His advice was almost always good. However, I felt tremendous stress working with him because his expectations for the amount of work I could produce each week were too high.",

    "Instructor: Amy Lelyveld \u00a0Hi Amy, this is Avi. The behind the back slander or praise has always sat ill with me so I shall speak to you directly. I write this after having read your responses all of which I thought were fair and astute. I very much enjoyed working with you. Your interest in the domestic scale and effect of architecture was a welcomed if difficult perspective to with which to compare notes. As much of academic architecture continues to further fetishize the diagram, a coherent single (usually simple) idea, you opened the doors for us to appeal to the humble human experience. This was much harder for me to know how to represent and I imagine much harder for you to evaluate.I leave this semester frustrated with my own production and not exactly sure to what I can attribute that. I am beginning to realize how little I know about beginning. Much of the intelligence in the project (especially in these quick projects) is in how one begins. I lost much of the replication time to frivolous formal explorations which were not rooted in a substantial architectural thought. Concerning those lost 2 weeks, I could have used a swift slap in the face, however I am well aware that had you provided me with such a slap I would now be complaining and writing how I wished it wasn\u0092t so severe. There is no winning.Overall I lament not producing at a higher level but that burden falls on my shoulders not yours. I lament the lack of closure and wonder why our section was the only one that did not have exit interviews. I think a group dinner or personal interviews would have gone a long way in helping digest the manic semester. I very much look forward to staying in touch. All the best.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0I tend to work instinctively with some basic concepts that I evolve as I move forward. My critic would ask me just the right questions to make me articulate what I was trying to do which would help clarify the ideas to myself. I always had a vague idea of what I was trying to do and after my desk crit the ideas were solidified and I had a clear idea of how I wanted to move forward. Andrew knew that somewhere deep down I knew what I was doing and he knew just the right questions to pull the info out of me. Andrew never told me what to do or gave me the answers. He used his Jedi mind tricks to pull the info out of my head. Honestly the best studio critic I have ever had. I don't like being told what to do, because they are my designs, and I don't like random off the wall comments that are useless. Andrew gives the perfect critique that forces me to realize my own designs and forces me to think about how to expand upon those designs. I can't say enough about amazing Andrew is as a critic. When it comes to being a great studio critic, Andrew has the formula.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew is very well equipped to guide many different types of students as a studio critic. His demeanor is respectful and encouraging of students at all levels of experience. I believe this makes him especially well suited for the first year studios.He could be an even better critic if he made his own point of view clearer. While he does a fantastic job of avoiding the pedantic displays that characterized other critics this semester, sometimes it was difficult to tell what he thought of our projects. If his point of view was clearer more often, it would provide a more concrete base for students to react to (or react against).",

    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew was very good at looking at my project and understanding very quickly the intent. In some cases when I began to feel that I had reached a roadblock, he was helpful in making suggestions on how I might proceed. His suggestions were always sound and encouraging, which I appreciated.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew was an excellent critic. He encouraged us to pursue our own ideas and always gave thoughtful and largely helpful advice for pushing our concept forward. He was especially good one-on-one. In larger group sessions, such as Transmog and Building Project, he was less vocal and not as encouraging as on the invididual projects. Overall though, Andrew was a knowledgeable and helpful instructor.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0I believe that my section critic is very detailed and practical, which is rather perfect for this semester. He is not very heavy handed at all in guiding my design, but sometimes I do wish that he would give more of a stronger opinion. All in all someone who is dependable, supportive, and consistent.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Andrew should consider being more opinionated in his criticism. I would recommend more precise, directed comments. Also, I consider one of the primary functions of a critic to be his\/her ability to inspire better work; trying to find ways to critically frame the project which are exciting.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0The section critic was the worst I've had in my architectural career. I have little to no respect for him due to his blatant lies, hyperbolic speaking, and poor grasp on the subject matter. He crossed the line of appropriateness several times in the studio, and demonstrated a clear lack of interest in certainprojects and processes. He operates as though he is in constant competition with the students, when he should raise above the need to one-up everyone, and be an earnest critic.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb was amazing. His helpfulness was priceless, his attitude and enthusiasm always high, and his interest in our work very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Joeb was very helpful as a section critic. He was always engaged and available for longer discussions or extra meetings. He involvement with his practice as well as the school allows him to give relevant and practical suggestions, a plus when designing projects of this scale.Joeb\u0092s main weakness would be that he talks over the students. He often commanders the conversation, both at desk crits and reviews, and does not allow the student to get out his or her full thought. This can result in the discussion going in a direction that does not interest the student or is irrelevant to the project. He always has interesting things to say, but needs to make sure to say them after the student has finished speaking or has stated his or her full idea.Overall Joeb was a great critic and we were lucky to have him this semester.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Working with Joeb was absolutely amazing. He, more than any other faculty member that I've encountered at Yale thus far, is truly a teacher. In general, I have felt that the faculty here -though very strong on other fronts- are somewhat lacking in teaching skills but this is not true of Joeb at all. He dedicated a tremendous amount of time, energy, and engagement to teaching this studio. He was always willing and able to address my projects in the language and conceptual format that I presented but he also had a clear vision of the direction he thought my development should take and he consistently challenged me to step outside of my comfort zone in a way that has, I feel, greatly improved my skills. Joeb is also a critic who is able to engage projects on several different fronts. He has helped me to improve my diagramming, my understanding of structural systems, my perception of social elements, and the conceptual basis of my work. I cannot say enough positive things about him. I'm so glad that I was able to work with him this past semester and I really feel that his influence has been formative in a positive way.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter is a good person, with extensive understanding of building and architecture in general. I wish he was more honest and direct. If people are heading toward a Low Pass, it is his responsibility to communicate that to them in no uncertain terms.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter was very disorganized. Every time he sat down with me for a desk crit I had to remind him what my project was and what the studio requirements were.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter is excellent at resolving spaces and awkward architectural moments, and is generous in sharing his wealth of technical knowledge. However, there could be a better balance in his teaching between resolution and provocation (i.e. more provocation).",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter's main strength is his willingness to help student with his\/her project, not trying to force his own architectural agenda. As an instructor, he is very encouraging, open, and willing to share from his extensive experiences and accumulated knowledge. He seemed to encourage a very open, unguarded line of communication between him and his students. Simply put, there were no mind games. This was refreshing.His one weakness might be that he didn't challenge students as much as needed. I recognize this is a hard line this walk given that his main strength is his openness. But I do feel a little more push-back on ideas could have taken some really good student projects and made them great.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter de Bretteville brought a patience and knowledge to the studio that was well suited to the problems we encountered while investigating the residential scale. At times, however, it felt that we were not addressing the conceptual questions enough in the discussions. In other words, Peter always expected a strong conceptual foundation, but that was not always part of our studio discourse.However, overall, it was a great experience to study with Peter this semester. Heworked very hard to introduce us to the idea of synthesis in design, and encouraged working through iterations to resolve seemingly irreconcilable trajectories.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter unfortunately was the weakest part of my studio experience this semester. Although I got along with him great and thoroughly enjoyed discussions with him unrelated to my studio projects, as a studio critic I found Peter lacking.Peter would continuously provide positive reinforcement lulling me into a false sense of security regarding the state of my project rather than ask the necessary difficult questions. In the end, I felt he did not really understand my projects or the ideas behind them until the final review.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Peter was disappointing as a studio critic. He did not offer much during the course of the semester and saved most of his criticism for the exit interview. It was difficult to illicit responses or productive suggestions from him before, during, and following reviews for each project. He did not seem interested in knowing all of his students\u0092 projects to the same extent, and those in which he was not initially engaged did not benefit from attentive criticism, but instead suffered from apathy. I suggest that Peter be more direct with his students and that he host more pinups where students might more regularly see the progress of their colleagues\u0092 work. I also suggest that he more directly offer suggestions of relevant precedents to consult."

    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0Studio should NEVER count for 3 credits when the workload and expectations are the same as first semester. Even when the course was consolidated with the building project, there was more than 6 credits of work involved. We definitely needed more time for the cohabitation project, since no student in the class managed to complete the assignment on time.",
    "Instructor: Alan Organschi \u00a0I had problems this semester as a result of the absurd workload - health issues as well as the breakdown of a personal relationship. I take my work seriously, but I also need time for other things: loved ones, friends, family, exercise, sleep, etc.",
    "Instructor: Amy Lelyveld \u00a0More time given to analysis and or replication project.Doing 3 projects in half a semester (by mid-term) sets up a frantic pace - in particular with the workload this semester. As such it felt like it was going by too quickly for me to learn as effectively as I could have been.",
    "Instructor: Amy Lelyveld \u00a0As I have discussed with Alan, I wonder whether having 2 critics assigned to a building project team is the most productive. The other alternative is having the studio critics rotate around. I understand that there are benefits and drawbacks to both systems but I do think it should be given further consideration.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0Nothing. Great semester.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0During BP teamwork, our team was assigned to two sustained studio critics, and I felt we could have benefited from some progress reviews with other critics, and Alan. The method of having two critics and then a number of various and changing guests each time was confusing and seemed unproductive, at times. I think it would be best to have some variety in the critics, but in a more consistent and organized manner.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0The studio was excellent overall. My one complaint is that due to the extensive class time and weekly assignments for other classes, there was never enough time to devote to studio, especially during the week.",
    "Instructor: Andrew Benner \u00a0I believe the whole curriculum could do with a little more communication between the courses. Studio coordinators and teachers from other courses should have a mutual understanding about when each class expects a high level of production and work with each other to create a schedule that is practical.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0More time on projects.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0PLEASE work on scheduling! We did not have enough time to do justice to our projects this semester which was endlessly frustrating, especially considering how engaging and intelligent the design problems we were faced with were.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0See end of my answer to question 5.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Coordinate better with other classes. The expectations were often unreasonable and more in line with a hazing than education. Why?",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0There needs to be an open, school-wide discussion to assess what BP is really to achieve. Many students are jaded by the rhetoric about affordability and experimentation. I came to Yale hoping to build a truly innovative and affordable house, and be able to gain insight to those challenges from my peers. Those topics were never discussed. I think the students have many thoughts about what BP should be (ie where, who's money we should use, what kind of urban issues we should address etc) that are dismissed from the outset. That was a major disssapointment for me which I think should change. Students would be much more invested, excited and intellectually challenged if their voices were considered from the very beginning of the BP project. Perhaps BP could begin earlier and we could forgo a few of the very short studio exercises in the beginning.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0PLEASE - more realistic schedule and list of deliverables taking into account the fact that there are five other classes.",
    "Instructor: Peter de Bretteville \u00a0Like always, the time coordination with other classes could be improved. I know that this was attempted, and while this was extremely appreciated by students, there is still ample room for improvement. Simply sitting down and comparing syllabi and calendars would red flag overlaps in due dates and highlight possible crunch times. Many students feel that their best work is not coming out in the studio work because their energy and time is too divided amongst other classes."
