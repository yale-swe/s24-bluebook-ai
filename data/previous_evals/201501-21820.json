    "I highly encourage any heritage learners to follow up CHNS 152 with this class. Not only do you learn a lot of Chinese at a quick but reasonable pace, CHNS 153 is also where some of the interesting lessons in which you learn more about Chinese history and culture come in. Xu Laoshi is also a fantastic professor who is supportive, really responsive to questions, and good at explaining and adding onto what is covered in the book lessons.",
    "If you've taken first semester, you know what it's all about. The words get harder, but overall it doesn't feel much harder (except maybe at the very end) because your grammar is better than it was a semester ago. Even if you're not applying for Light, if you liked 152 then keep going with it! You get tons of language gains after building up a semester of foundation.",
    "This course was a continuation of CHNS 152 so be sure not to forget too much Chinese over Winter Break. That being said, not as many students take the class second semester so the class sizes are much smaller and the classes move at a slower pace than before. Xu Laoshi really does care about her students and if you put in the work then you will make great improvements in all areas,"
