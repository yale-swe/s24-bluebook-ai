   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend the class and Professor Storr in particular. You will not be overwhelmed by work, but you will be inspired enough by class that if you are an outside-of-class-artist, you will want to produce drawings. And in-class you will approach drawing from several angles, a perfect introduction or refreshing recap.",
    "A drawing class for everyone-beginner to advanced.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want a low stress interesting class where you make some drawings and chill.",
    "It's a great class! Though during the class I wasn't sure how much I was learning, I now feel like I've come to look at drawing in a new way. Robert Storr doesn't teach you how to draw, if that's what you're looking for, but it will give you new perspectives on what drawing and \"good drawing\" is. I would have preferred more personal critiquing though.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class, I think it's a grade booster, but also it's really relaxing and interesting and makes you a better thinker. Don't take this class if you aren't good about coming to every class though.",
    "YES YES YES! This is the BEST drawing class. You always leave class feeling so refreshed and accomplished. He also encourages you to analyze modern (and classical) art in a new way. There's no homework in the class except for the final project, but this is only Storr's section. All other sections have a ton of homework, but I don't think those students really improved as much as our class.",
    "I highly recommend this course with Professor Storr. The workload is very manageable (your only take-home assignment is to draw 100 demons by the end of the semester), and Professor Storr makes it a very low-stress environment so you really get to enjoy and appreciate drawing. It really taught me to look at art in a different light.",
    "I think this class might be enjoyable in a different section, but I did not like the class as much as I thought I would. This was mostly due to the fact that Prof. Storr seemed inattentive, and offered little feedback or suggestion to the students on an individual basis. This section has no \"homework\" so it's very low commitment if that's what you're looking for. A lot of the in class work is insipid and sometimes just plain boring. I made little improvement in my artistic ability in this class, and the little progress I did make I think was mostly due to the practicing in class rather than from any instruction I received from Prof. Storr. The final project was to draw 100 monsters, which was fun to a point, but borderline tedious. If you're more concerned about light course load, then this is the section for you. If you're looking to become a better artist, I would look elsewhere.",
    "Yes. Great way to get a humanity credit and work the right side of the brain.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!",
    "Highly recommended for art and non-art majors.",
    "It's not going to teach you \"how to draw\" if by \"draw\" you mean \"draw realistically\". It may teach you how to think about your composition, though, and if realism isn't your thing, Storr is great about explaining why other styles are just as valuable and interesting. Also, do your 100 monsters during the semester. 100 is actually a very big number.",
    "Excellent class. As an MB&B major, I felt like the class had a good balance of art and other majors. Storr is an excellent instructor and only gave one assignment to be done outside of class. All major drawing was done in class. It's a little unnerving that we didn't receive any grades all semester and that the final grade depends entirely on keeping all of your drawings and returning them at the end of the semester to be graded. However, if you turned in all of your drawings, \"didn't play hooky too much\", and made an effort, Storr said you'd be fine, grade-wise. Storr's style of teaching is rather unusual, starting out the first two weeks with \"calisthenics\" and emphasizing representing objects in the most simple way possible throughout the course. He's obviously a big fan of minimalism, and often related class tasks not only to modern artists, but also calligraphy and minimalist music.",
    "Absolutely. Great class whether or not you are an artist--you learn a lot about visual perception and the way you think about space and art."
