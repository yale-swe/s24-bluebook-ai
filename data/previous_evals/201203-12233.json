    "Fun class to take for credit. Problems can get quite confusing but Prof. Polak is an awesome lecturer and is very engaging with the class.",
    "Definitely take this course!",
    "If you've already taken all the core economics classes like intro and intermediate micro and macro, this class is fun and easy. Otherwise this class would probably be more challenging, but still lots of fun. Even though the lectures are online, I would recommend taking this class while you're here at Yale because you really learn the concepts (which are often quite deep) by doing problem sets, and you probably won't be motivated enough to do them online and there is no answer key. Also it's far more fun to play the games yourself in class than to watch others play the games. However it is nice that the lectures and notes are online because if you don't understand something in class, or you miss lecture, youcan watch it online because most of the content is similar.",
    "I enjoyed Econ 159 and would certainly recommend it, but it is definitely not as much of a \"classic Yale course\" as I thought going into it. Very interesting material, and Professor Polak is a pretty good lecturer, but the psets and tests were tricky. It was difficult to get full credit on a problem set, even after answer every question essentially correctly.",
    "Great class, but be ready to work.",
    "would recommend. tougher class towards the end of the semester, but worth taking. if you're not ready to do a bit of work, credit\/d this bad boy",
    "A little overrated, but the material is pretty cool and the problem sets aren't unmanageable.",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Yeah. It's a pretty fun econ class. The grading is tough because it's a less generous curve than other intro econ classes and at least for our midterm, most people clustered around the mean.",
    "It's interesting and requires a good amount of thinking, but I don't think it's too hard hard. Requires more logic than math skills. I would recommend it; great class.",
    "An application of game theory to games and models that are common in both economics and in general life. If you are willing to work a bit, I would highly recommend the course.",
    "Absolutely an amazing course. As a senior, easily ranks in my top 3 favorite at Yale. Well taught, and teaches you how to think about problems differently. Great for anyone facing brain teasers or case studies in upcoming interview.",
    "This is one of those 'bucket list' courses at Yale. It is a fun course that is accessible to wide audience. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class is 100% more interesting and better taught than econ115. Ben Polak is pretty entertaining and clear overall. If you are a QR person, this class will be a joke (problem sets 1-2 hours once a week, andthe tests are straightforward). If you are not a QR person it will be harder but it's all straightforward and the problem sets are well designed to help you learn. Take it!",
    "Very interesting but also very difficult. Final exam was very hard and problem sets were always tedious.",
    "Game Theory is hard, but totally worth it. I have to admit that this is the class I stressed out about the most this semester, but I also note that it was the best\/most fun and interesting class I took this semester. I am not a math genius or an econ master, so I struggled quite a bit in this course but I learned so much and the games are so fun. Prepare to put in a lot of time for the psets though because the psets are pretty hard. If you are not in a position where you desperately need this course for some requirement, it might be a good idea to Cr\/D it since all my stress came from the fact that I was letter grading it (the curve is pretty tough).",
    "It's a great class! It was challenging at times, but thinking through the problems was enjoyable and a good learning experience. Polak is a great and entertaining teacher, and you definitely shouldn't doubt the teaching style\/quality. The game theory way of thinking is also pretty interesting. Take it!",
    "Take it if you're excited by the idea of a class in problem-solving and thinking strategically. I found this to be a wonderful introduction to game theory that made me eager to take future game theory courses at Yale. The problem sets can be difficult, but in a way that reinforces your understanding of the material. One of the rare courses that is really enjoyable to take and yet you are definitely challenging yourself. And you play games in class before analyzing them.",
    "Take Credit\/D if you are not an Econ major",
    "Great class! Must take at Yale to understand the world and how it works. Do not need any previous econ background. Take it credit\/D. The Midterm is not an accurate representation of the final grade.",
    "Game Theory is a very interesting, well-taught course. If you have any interest in the subject, I think it's definitely worth taking. The problems sets were consistently slightly harder than the material in class, but were always doable (just try to avoid leaving them until the very last minute, because some take longer than others). The exams were very fair.",
    "Game Theory was the most challenging course I have taken. For the first time, no matter how much time I spent studying, there was no guarantee that I'd perform well on the test. This is because the elegant techniques we learn in Game Theory (techniques that make the most complicated,impossible-seeming problems seem manageable), have infinite varieties of applications. Despite the fact that I will probably get a lower grade than I'm used to for all of the work I have put into the class, I have to admit that I have learned so much in Game Theory; it has trained a whole different part of my brain: the intuitive, strategic part. Game Theory is very hard. Expect to go to more office hours than you can imagine for the problem sets; that being said, if you go to office hours, they are very helpful and you will definitely be able to do the psets after them. Also, if Young Rao is still a TA, you MUST END UP IN HIS SECTION!!! He was the most caring, brilliant, well-prepared TA of them all (there's a reason why his office hours were always the most crowded). All in all, take this class. It will change how you think, and what you learn from this class will be deeply ingrained into your brain forever. This is not superficial learning. This is the deep stuff.",
    "This class was not easy. You have to go to office hours, go to section, and go to lecture if you want to do really well. That said, the material is fascinating and Professor Polak is a great lecturer. If Young Rao is a TA again, definitely try to be in his section - he was great. I took it without having taken ECON (intro micro or intro macro) and it's definitely doable, but a background in concepts from intro micro is really helpful.",
    "this is a good class. be prepared that the exams are hard but they are hard for (most) everyone. you will learn some great thinking tools and it will change how you approach and critically think through problems. also, you don't have to do any reading to do the PSETS and if you miss a lecture they are on Yale Open Courses so that helps a ton. The PSETS are hard but you go to office hrs and they will explain it to you. Pollack is good about having safety nets in place. Take it for a grade if you hella confident in your abilities or don't mind getting somewhere in the B+\/B range.",
    "Yes, take it. You learn to think though word problems. A great addition to your toolbox.",
    "This is a great class! You definitely do not need to have taken an econ class to understand the material, and Polak is a fantastic lecturer. If you can do algebra and think logically, you will be just fine. Homework is not too bad, section is not mandatory, and the exams are tricky but fair.",
    "Polak is a very good and funny lecturer. Workload is not too bad (psets that take maybe 4 hours per week), and the midterm was alright as well. The final was a bit more difficult and time-crunched, but overall manageable. Take it Cr\/D if you want it to be low-stress.",
    "This is known as one of the must-take classes at Yale, and it absolutely lives up to expectations. I was not the best student this semester and could not make it to class as often as I had liked. (You have that luxury thanks to Open Yale Courses, though I don't recommend you exploit it.) But when I could go to class, do the reading and understand the homework, I loved it. It is taught at a slow pace and in a British accent. The tests are very fair. And it's fun.",
    "I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Good class. Look online at the open yale courses it's exactly that. The homeworks are all basically what's online. Use office hours if you are unsure on any of the homeworks. It will help a bunch. Section is not mandatory. The exams are a little tricky. Careful for all the C\/D\/F people taking it. People do well on all the assignments, so your grade comes down to how splayed out the grades are on the final.",
    "A great course that will give you problem-solving tools that will probably stick with you for the rest of your life. If you're interested in it, take at a look at it on Open Yale Courses. The grading is fairly tough because you can't really prepare for the exams, but if you're sharp enough there's no need to take this class Credit\/D.",
    "I would recommend this class ONLY if you're an econ major, or you're into Game Theory. I come more from a humanities\/history\/lit background, and didn't love the class as much as everyone else did. I thought the syllabus got more interesting as the semester progressed. But I just feel like Econ Dept. classes in general don't teach you very much in terms of expanding your knowledge and pushing your abilities. The midterm and final were hard not because the concepts are inherently difficult to grasp (if I had more time I would've figured it out), but rather bc the word problems were really long, full of little wrenches to take care of, and required you to think very quickly.",
    "Classes seem straightforward, but the final will come and make you cry. I cried, even after studying a lot for it.",
    "Great intro course for game theory - you will learn several new interesting ways of breaking down complex problems and modeling strategic interactions.",
    "A really fun econ class for both majors and nonmajors. Not much math, great lectures, and a interesting way to look at problems. The start of the semester is typical game theory, but by the end you are solving long \"riddle\" type problems.",
    "I would take it. The curve for flat As is a bit strict, but if you're not worried about getting an A-, you've got it made. Plus the material is really interesting. Expect to spend ~3 hours per week on the problem sets.",
    "I'd recommend the course if you appreciate difficult puzzles and want to really work for answers. If you want a high grade, beware. Many upperclassmen take this class Cred\/D\/F and for good reason.",
    "Really interesting, but tough class. Suggest Cr\/D unless you are a Econ person.",
    "If required, take it. If you want an easy credit\/d course, take it. Otherwise, just watch the lectures on line because you'll have to put it quite a bit of work on relatively simple concepts.",
    "A weekly problem set, not bad. Definitely take it with friends or make sure you know someone in the class as the psets do get challenging and you'll want someone to go over them with you. It's not an easy class. Most of the material is logic and brainwork, not so much math and very little (if any) use of a calculator.",
    "Game Theory is a general introduction to strategy decision making. Professor Polak is a very good lecturer, and his British accent is wonderful. During his weekly office hours, he basically does the problem set for you, which is a plus in the short term but perhaps detrimental int the long run. For a course called \"Game THEORY,\" it was was pretty light on theory. You can learn the general concepts in a few hours perhaps, and as a result much of the course is spent doing examples and applications. This has pros and cons. On the plus side, some of the examples are very interesting and have real world importance. On the other, some problem sets are pretty impossible because since the concepts aren't that hard, the examples can be very difficult in order to compensate. This is especially a problem on the midterm and final (70% of your grade). In order to make a curve, the final was very difficult and very long. It wasn't a test of our knowledge of the theory, but rather if under the massive pressure we could come up with a little, often commonsense, trick, to solve the problem. The course also feels more impersonal than most. Perhaps it is because the course is identical from year to year (literally no change in anything on the problem sets), perhaps it is because it on Yale Open Courses, perhaps because of its massive size (~250 students), but I didn't really feel that connected to the course. That's kinda fruity, but take it for what you will.",
    "Great class that has been taught for so many years Polak has perfected it. I am an econ major and having spoken with faculty in the department, all said of all economics courses, this is the course to take. Though the material is not necessarily applicable to real life, it's very interesting and teaches you another way to think about the world. Between Polak's lectures, OpenCourses, and the three recommended books, there is plenty of material to learn from and refer to. It's challenging and not for everyone - I took it and I am definitely not a 'logic' person - but it's rewarding. I didn't take it Credit D and looking back, I wish I had. I also suggest going to Polak's office hours. I found them very helpful.",
    "Great class, teaches you to think in a different way. Pretty applicable to anyone.",
    "Great course. A must take at Yale, but beware that it is not an easy course. The final is ridiculously hard. Polack is awesome and make sure you go to office hours",
    "Great course! Professor Polak is a wonderful lecturer and the psets are interesting. The final exam was a tough. Just give yourself enough time to do the psets.",
    "Game Theory is by far one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It completely changed my way of thinking about strategic situations, and taking it was one of the best decisions I have made. Polak is an amazing professor and lecturer, and he is very approachable with questions. I benefited greatly from attending his office hours every week. The problem sets and the material of the class in general is not easy by any means, and doing well certainly requires a lot of hard work on the psets. The exams are difficult, but doable. I definitely recommend this class--it is difficult but highly rewarding. Take it!",
    "Take it! Regardless of your major, class year, or whatever, you will learn a lot from this class.",
    "Yes! Take it! It's not that difficult and is definitely important information.",
    "Take it. Next to no work - psets are a breeze, no real \"material\" to study per se so tests aren't stressful (albeit a little challenging). Prof has a great accent. One thing: relatively few of the \"games\" we learned about in class are \"games\" in the way you would think of one (e.g., tic tac toe, nim, other simple games whose solutions are within our skill sets).",
    "Take this class if you like problem-solving or if you're an econ major. It's fun, tricky, and not too time-consuming with work. Definitely one of my Yale favorites.",
    "Yes, recommended to any student (not just econ). It is an intuitive approach to game theory and explains a different (and probably more correct than, say, Econ 115) way of looking at economic and real world problems. Polak is smart, engaging, and funny. Be prepared to have a bit of fun but also work and think hard (especially on the exams).",
    "Great class and great professor. The concepts were interesting, but not difficult. The exams were fair, although the final was much harder than the midterm. I would recommend this class to any student. It seems like a lot of people take it Credit\/D, but I think the curve is decent, although the midterm ended up really not meaning anything because everyone did equally well.",
    "Standard, important and very well-taught.",
    "Of course. Great class.",
    "Game theory is such a great course! It really gets you to think in a different way. No matter your major, this is very much a course worth taking. If you are looking for a SO credit, or even if you aren't (I wasn't), this is the one! And Ben Polak is such an entertaining lecturer.Disclaimer: despite the reputation, this course is not a gut. The lectures are fun and for the most part easy to grasp. However, Ben does an excellent job of designing assignments and exams that test your ability to apply the intuitions and tools he gives you in new, unfamiliar, and often challenging applications. But it is so very much worth the work. Just don't underestimate the problem sets.",
    "A fun survey of problems and techniques in game theory. Not really applicable to the real world, but a good way of thinking about life nevertheless. If you have any ability in math, logic, reasoning, etc., take the class, but don't take it Credit\/D -- you will get an A or at the very worst an A-. The class starts off slow and builds up slowly, so it never gets overwhelming or too confusing.",
    "It's a fun class. It's kind of math-y but in a friendly way. The exams are hard so don't feel bad if you don't understand anything. Going to Polak's office hours is really helpful for figuring out how to do the problem sets.",
    "Yes but be prepared to put in a lot of work. Not an easy curve.",
    "Good class. Utilize the open course notes and videos!",
    "I would recommend this course. It's the best undergraduate game theory course, as I understand, and it touches on econ, polisci, even sociology and biology. Professor Polak is always on the ball and quite engaging. He cares deeply about his students and will keep you laughing and interested, even a player in a class game. It's not too hard but certainly not a gut.",
    "Final was hard. But the class was amazing. I would definitely recommend this course to everyone. Game Theory truly is a fun subject.",
    "Game Theory is a great course to take if you have an interest in the subject matter and are looking for a Credit\/D. Professor Polak basically doesn't give anyone a D so you are guaranteed Credit and the material is really interesting. Not to mention, his lectures are phenomenal. If you are taking the class for a grade, the final is pretty difficult so make sure you study a lot for it because that is where the grades for the class are really determined.",
    "Game Theory is good. Take if you need an econ credit or are interested in learning about Game Theory for its own sake. Don't make the mistake I did and think that it has applications to your life outside the classroom -- it does not. That being said, if you are willing to put in the effort (go to lecture, keep up with the material, work hard through psets), the curve is generous and you'll probably do well.",
    "Take it. Polak is a really good lecturer, probably one of the best in the economic dept. Problem sets challenge your thinking, but not to the point where you are stuck for hours over the problems. Course is well-structured, class if usually funny and entertaining (although as the course progressed, I started to feel it dragging at times). If you need help with homework \u00e2\u0080\u0093 office hours, office hours office hours (it is like a review of the current problem set).One midterm, one final. However, both are extremely difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0093 don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go into the exam thinking you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re fine if you just did the homework, because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in for a rude awakening. But otherwise take this course for anyone even mildly interested in economics and\/or game theory.",
    "I really enjoyed the class, despite its challenges. I would recommend taking the class if you are at all interested in economics, psychology, or anything involving decision-making. However, I would emphasize that the class is indeed a challenge.",
    "Definitely take it. It was the best course I have taken at Yale. The lectures are engaging, the problem sets usually point out something interesting, and you will walk away from the course with a new outlook on everyday interactions. The problem sets are usually not that bad as long as you think before attacking them. Section is not mandatory, and the final and midterm were difficult, but reasonable.",
    "This course was a ton of fun. I took it purely out of interest, and it definitely was a good choice. It can be a lot of work, and it moves quickly, but Professor Polak is great and makes everything interesting. For people who haven't done a lot of economics, I would recommend taking it Credit\/D; I would have saved myself a lot of stress by doing so. But I recommend this to anyone and everyone; it was by far my favorite course this semester.",
    "It is great! Pretty manageable if you are an econ major, may be hard if not. Polak makes it really accessible though.",
    "Absolutely! From the perspective of a QR major, this class is pretty easy. But it's also very interesting and pretty applicable to thinking about a variety of real-world problems. Lecture is fun to go to, and easy to follow, so it makes for a nice elective. I think only ~15% of the class gets a straight A, though, so be aware of that if you're deciding to do it Cr\/D\/F or not. Workload is one problem set every week, only takes a few hours and is usually fun to do. Readings and section are completely optional.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Polak is an engaging lecturer. Problem sets and exams are challenging, fair, and enjoyable. One caveat is that exams require a fair amount of critical thinking and be long. Some highly quantitative students may want to try the more mathematical game theory course in the economics department.",
    "ECON 159 WAS GREAT! take it take it take it. Polak is incredible and the class is so interesting (for anyone, not just econ majors). the problem sets can be challenging but the TA's are helpful and so is Prof. Polak. The tests are the reallly hard parts but there is a generous curve on all of it. Take this class. you will love it.",
    "This is one of the great Yale classes. Polak is a really fun lecturer, and manages to keep lecture pretty engaging, even on days that constitute little more than review. It can be hard to take notes on occasion, as he writes fairly small and not super legibly, but this shouldn't pose much of a real problem. I took this course without having ever taken any calculus and while I definitely had moments of confusion, I think I came out just fine on the other side. Worth Cr\/D\/Fing if you have that luxury, I did not and really think my grade could be anywhere from A- to B-, which is a bit unsettling.",
    "A fun class.",
    "The class is wonderful. The professor is interesting and engaging and the material is (dare I say it?) pretty fun. Beware though, it gets quite a bit harder after the midterm and the test questions become less of \"have you studied\" to \"do you think in the 'proper\/game theory' way\" and that makes studying an overall frustrating experience.",
    "Good class. Polak is an engaging lecturer. Final is harder than the midterm. If you're an Econ major it shouldn't be too much trouble.",
    "Take this course!! Psets and lectures are both very enjoyable. Polak is great.",
    "I REALLY WISH I HAD TAKEN THIS CREDIT D! Don't make my mistake.",
    "Fun engaging class with average-difficult weekly problem sets and difficult exams.",
    "Yup, awesome course.",
    "Game Theory is one of the few large, 75 minute lecture courses I've truly enjoyed at Yale. Professor Polak is engaging and covers interesting material in lecture each week. The weekly problem sets aren't too difficult, although they pick up in intensity towards the end of the semester. The mid-term and final are challenging but not impossible. A student will learn basic strategic concepts that can be applied to almost any profession or decision in life. I would definitely recommend taking it to anyone looking to be exposed to a cool field of study, although it may be a bit too math heavy for non-quantitative types.",
    "Enjoyable, engaging class. Polak is a great, funny lecturer. The content is difficult \u00e2\u0080\u0094 exams feel more like athletic matches than written tests, in that you have to be on your game and perform well in the moment.",
    "Very challenging course - lots of work. But definitely worth it. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale both for the professor and the class content.",
    "YES - a definite yes. Please take this course if you are interested in the most famous economic theory in modern times. It is mentally challenging, in a good and rewarding way. The terminologies discussed are highly applicable to everyday issues.",
    "This is a very interesting, but challenging econ class that has lots of applications in other fields. Professor Polak is a funny and engaging lecturer. The problem sets and exams are pretty hard though - a decent class to take Credit\/D if you're curious about game theory, but you'll still have to work for it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it, and it's a must take for econ majors. But non econ majors should also take it. It's a great course that is so different from other courses and really fascinating.",
    "Solid class. The lectures are great, and the notes and recordings of old lectures are all on open Yale, which is nice. It's sort of hard to study for the exams since you only have your problem sets to go off of, but solution are not provided. Curve can be somewhat difficult as in any Econ class, but overall a very fair course. This year in particular the professor and TA's went out of their way to make sure the grading was fair on the final exam, since there was a mess up with not printing enough exams that put some students at a disadvantage. It says something that Polak will go the extra mile in that regard.",
    "A must-take class before you graduate. You'd be dumb not to take this class, whatever major you are",
    "A course that will give you a new framework to think. Definitely worth taking, but you have to put in the work to learn the material through the psets.",
    "You should probably take this course. Absolutely no econ knowledge is required (I knew none going in), and you learn interesting ways to think and approach problems you never knew existed. In general the pacing is good and Prof. Polak is a pretty fun lecturer. Weekly problem sets are hardish but not impossible.",
    "Yes, but not for students who aren't interested in economics or are more humanities-based. This course is certainly challenging, and you have to really commit yourself to the problems.",
    "I would recommend Game Theory to another student. Don't worry too much about the grades. Do it for the learning.",
    "wonderful. learned to think smarter",
    "This course is very over rated. I have learned quite a bit but far less than I had expected based on the evaluations that I read before taking the course. Unless you are prepared to take a course that lacks a method and depends solely on your game theory intuition, don't take it. Professor Polak cares a lot for his students but he does not always explain things in a way that makes sense and he is quite disorganized. He does not make each topic clear at the beginning of each lecture and by the end of the course you feel like you have learned a bunch of random things without any sort of method. He overestimates his students' ability to understand game theory so, as someone who was completely new to the topic and who had a bit of a hard time understanding some concepts, I was extremely frustrated. The TAs, with a few exceptions, were also not helpful at all.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in business or economics. I'm not an econ major, but I loved the class. I found the material to be interesting and the lectures to be great as well. There were a few slow lectures, but not many. However, the material can be difficult, so be prepared to work through a lot of problems that you need to understand to do well on the midterm and final.",
    "Definitely take this class, it's fantastic!",
    "yes",
    "Game Theory is definitely one of Yale's best courses. Take it ASAP. Professor Polak is amazing, the material he teaches is amazing, the problem sets are fun and mind-tickling...there's really nothing wrong with this course. If you're afraid of the level of quantitative thinking, take it credit\/D...you will not regret it, the course is quite enjoyable.",
    "Excellent class, but pretty difficult. I would recommend taking it Credit\/D - you'll still learn a lot, but won't have to stress as much over psets and the midterm\/final.",
    "Take this class! You don't have to be an economics major to grasp the material.",
    "Take it credit\/D because it's super interesting but that pressure of knowing and understanding absolutely everything will not be there if you don't take it for a grade.",
    "I would probably only recommend if you're truly searching for an interesting, mildly entertainingly class at the end of your yale career. It's not easy and the problem sets can become burdensome but altogether its very accessible due to the online video lectures and other online material. altogether, looking back I'm glad I took it but I definitely wouldn't take it again.",
    "Take it. The best economics class I have taken at Yale. It also sharpens your critical thinking skills by giving you a taste of more analytically rigorous ways of looking at strategic problems. Polak's lectures are phenomenal.",
    "Amazing course. Taught me a knew way to think. Workload isn't too taxing, but the midterm and final are difficult. However, that's only normal, since the professor aims to have a large spread. The curve is generous. Polak himself is entertaining, engaging, and intelligent. He's also very kind and light-hearted. Wish I could take a seminar taught by him. He conveys ideas clearly and effectively.",
    "Take it! Some weeks were slower than others, but on the whole, it was a very enjoyable course.",
    "Game Theory is a thoroughly engaging, deceptively mellow lecture course - while the pace and workload at times feel low-key, the material is often challenging and cumulative, so that if you fall behind it can be difficult to get caught up. Professor Polak is an excellent lecturer - entertaining and warm, and clear in his presentation of material - and the weekly problem sets are generally manageable and never overwhelming. I took the class Credit\/D\/Fail, and never regretted it - I was able to enjoy the intellectual gymnastics without worrying about individual points and percentages on problem sets and exams.",
    "I will recommend it.",
    "I would summarize Economics 159 to another student as a frustrating excuse for a class in game theory. I would not recommend it to anyone unless I am aware that this person particularly enjoys tedious algebra games.",
    "Fun but quite a bit of work.",
    "As a non-economics major who is a fairly quantitative person, I very much enjoyed this class. The classteaches a new method of thinking about the world, is manageable in workload, is a pretty engaging lecture, and probably has a lot of your friends in it.",
    "Yes. I highly recommend it. Take it seriously though. The exams and psets aren't easy. Yet, for me it was certainly worth it.",
    "This is a great class that will teach you a new way of thinking. That said, it isn't easy. The curves on exams can be tough, and the material is tricky. But figuring out how to solve the problems is very gratifying, and the lectures are great!",
    "This course can change the way you think about the world in 12 weeks; aka, a great Yale course. Polak does a great job with lecture, and the problem sets really help you to understand the material being taught. Section is kind of useless (I never went) but Polak's office hours are really helpful if you are stuck on a problem.",
    "Game theory is a fantastic course. Ben Polak is an enormously entertaining lecturer, the workload isn't excessive, the exams are fair, and the material is fascinating. I looked forward to coming to class and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an interest in economics.The work does get progressively harder as the semester goes on. Be sure to take advantage of the fact that an earlier version of the course is online.",
    "Great course! Fairly math heavy for a social science, but as a physics major that made for a great way to get my last So. Polak is a clear and entertaining lecturer. The exams are fairly difficult -- you shouldn't expect to finish -- but the curve is generous. It says that micro is a prereq, but you really don't need it.",
    "Take it. As a non econ major I would recommend taking it credit\/d\/fail. The material is not easy but it is more than worth the work. One of the most fulfilling classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely. Even if you aren't an econ major, this is a fun and useful class to take. Take is Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "Yes! This is a class that one should absolutely take!",
    "Interesting class. helps that all the lectures are on open courses. however the class is really big and can be hard to do well because tests are tricky.",
    "Game theory is an excellent economics class that doesn't require too much math and can definitely be done by non economics majors. i found the topics covered to be very interesting, and would overall recommend this class highly to anyone.",
    "Take it, even if you're not an econ major, it has applications to many fields and its just plain FUN. The math is not too bad, but if you really hate it, the concepts are usually accompanied by a little math. Exams were fair, though the final was a bit different to previous years. Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it.",
    "Take it!",
    "Game theory is pretty neat. Not to complicated if you're a math major or have a solid math background and it's a cool way of looking at the world. You only need a basic knowledge of economics so don't worry about that",
    "I was enjoying the class so much that I'd forgotten it was an ECON class. Polak's great, if you go to lectures and office hours you won't even need the textbook. Take it.",
    "Great course, interesting strategy games and pretty much all the lectures are online in case you miss a few.",
    "Course is all right. Basic intro to game theoretic concepts. The curve is kind of harsh at the top, and the final was pretty long in our year, so many people I know didn't finish and are pretty sure they moved down to A-'s as a result. Doing well in the class is totally feasible, but you have to prepare hard for the exams in case they're more difficult than you think they'll be, which is what happened this year.",
    "I would recommend it as long as you are ready to spend significant amounts of time on the problem sets.",
    "Game Theory is a great course! It is fairly challenging and if you are already acquainted with quantitative reasoning and math, you will easily understand the concepts. The second part of the course is a bit more challenging and fast, but it is easy to keep up with the course -- the lectures are online, you get practice midterms and finals fromprevious years etc. Mind the final! Also, it is smart to take it cr\/d if you're not an econ major!",
    "Game Theory is a challenging, but exciting class dealing with word problems of strategy and their theoretical \"ideal\" solutions. If you like problem solving, math, puzzles, or games, and want to learn how to make the best of them, you should take this class!",
    "Definitely take it if you have time. No matter what grade you get, you will learn something really interesting and enlightening. Also the professor is fantastic.",
    "A must take.",
    "Do not graduate Yale without taking this course. Very interesting material, and is applicable to almost anything you do in life; if not directly, it at least gives a new perspective to rationalizing choices."
