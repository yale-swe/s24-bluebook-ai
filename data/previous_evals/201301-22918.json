    "This class was definitely way too hard. The online quizzes were too difficult after only a week or so of being exposed to the material. In the future it would be better to start with the in class\/easier quizzes to get the students warmed up to answering thought provoking questions.",
    "Great course! You learn how to think genetics.",
    "My least favorite module. Felt like I didn't really learn anything. Overall though it was good to take, I now know not to waste an entire semester in Genetics.",
    "A good intro course for genetics and developement. Be prepared for a lot of textbook reading and weekly quizzes.",
    "BIology 103 was definitely my favorite module of the yearlong sequence. It had a fairly equal emphasis on genetics and development. Professor Slack was great: his lectures were always interesting, and he was an engaging lecturer. The online quizzes were stressful, and the final exam was difficult. Weekly problem sets were not bad. Of all the modules, the workload was definitely not too much.",
    "It's not easy, but it is very interesting. Take it if you want to be a bio major or premed (because you have to); if you haven't taken a biology course before, this might not be the best way to start.",
    "Take it! Everyone complains but it's actually enjoyable and fair.",
    "Only take if necessary.",
    "If you're really interested in genetics and think you want to go into some field that will require this course, then definitely take it. But it's not an easy, gut science class, so take that into consideration.",
    "It was a weird mix between the first two modules. Like Bio 101, it tried to be a good intro class, but it didn't do a very good job of that, like Bio 102.All of the bio modules need to decide whether they'll be actual intro classes, or something between intro and intermediate, because right now, they don't seem to know.I had a very good background, so to be honest, this class was basically a waste of time to me.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "This is one of the more do-able modules of Bio, and it is quite interesting.",
    "The best of the 4 intro bio series modules. Very interesting, lectures are easy to follow. Professor Slack is GREAT!",
    "General biology class. Weekly quizzes (some online, some in class). A majority of the people in the class are there because they have to (pre med, bio, neuropsych). However, the class is still well taught and I enjoyed it.",
    "This class was engaging and I would recommend it for someone with an interest in science. The topic may be a bit advanced for someone without prior biology knowledge.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 103! I did feel like I learned a lot and the material was interesting. My advice would be to attend lectures and keep up with readings, since the course is pretty hard otherwise.",
    "Only take this class if it's a pre-req, or if you really like genes and\/or development.",
    "Only take it if you have to. I think they are working on it to make this class better, but as it is now-- it is still a way too large intro science course that won't be wildly exciting.",
    "Very rewarding, but with a decent workload and a little confusing in the beginning.",
    "Biology 103 was probably my favorite module of the introductory biology sequence so far. As far as prerequisite intro courses go, it's interesting, although definitely difficult.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in biology or the natural sciences, though I would caution that a good high school background in biology will make your life a lot more bearable.",
    "Take Bio 103, probably the best out of the four bio modules. Slack is an amazing professor and offers a very well-structured course.",
    "Professor Slack is a good professor, but be prepared to be in a HUGEEE class. It doesn't really matter whether or not I recommend it since you basically have to take it if you want to take higher level bio courses. It's not awful, but it's not super fun either unless you're REALLY into genetics (I'm not talking Punnett squares, but more like experiments and stuff with c. elegans, which is also useful to know but still).",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. They tried to revamp the whole intro bio sequence to make it more manageable, effective, and less of a deterrent to prospective science majors, however the workload, difficulty, and overall time management of this class make it so that I will be very surprised if significant alterations are not made before going forward. The goal of the class is sound; but they treat you like high school students with what ends up being nightly homework that you have to do.",
    "For the topic of genetics, I think it is a good course. Better than 102 and 101, although it can be a little dry sometimes. It's not a deadly class and you'll be able to do alright if you're willing to put in at least respectable effort",
    "Absolutely. Opened my eyes to many important experimental techniques needed for anyone wanting to pursue higher education in the genetics\/cell biology fields. I was so glad that I took this course this semester - it was my favorite of the four modules!",
    "C. Elegans",
    "Bio 103 was my favorite of the intro bio sequence. To do well you should definitely go to lecture, as a lot of information can be learnt by simply listening to Slack's explanations. He is a genius in this field, so I really enjoyed hearing him lecture.",
    "Easily the best module of BIOL 101-104. It's still a total s**t show, and I would NOT take this unless you absolutely need to. Frank Slack may win a Nobel Prize in a few years, so he's an awesome instructor.",
    "This class aims to introduce genetics and early development. I would recommend this course for a student with a limited biology background.",
    "Biology 103 (genetics) was probably my favorite of the 4 modules. Very straight forward lectures, we read some interesting papers and did some problem sets.",
    "don't take it. This was probably my least favorite of the entire bio sequence (Bio 102 was my favorite), although the material was certainly interesting. However, the course seemed to be disorganized and the material bounced around from topic to topic. With better organization and a more clearer approach in the topics, this class could be greatly improved. Additionally, I abhorred the take home quizzes which were long and timed. The shorter quizzes in class near the last half of the semester were much better stress-wise. Take home quizzes required you to find a giant block of time (30-40 minutes) when you would not be bothered, something that is actually much more difficult in practice than in theory.However, Professor Slack seems like a very nice guy.",
    "I would recommend this class for people who need take a biology course, but not for people who need a science credit. It was definitely the best module out of the four. For upperclassmen who get to take the modules out of order, this is not the one to skip. Weekly quizzes, finals, and psets, but they really help you to further clarify what you have learned in the class.",
    "It's a requirement. Keep up with the work and the readings as much as possible because it helps in the long run and in your understanding of the lectures.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. This is the requirement of several more advanced classes and I learned a lot from the material that I probably would not have explored given the choice. However I do not regret it.",
    "Hard don't take it unless it is required",
    "It is a great class and helped me understand my outside research a lot better; I learned a lot of applicable material that is common to lab research. Workload isn't too bad, and the final was reasonable.",
    "Biology 103 was a drag. Students had to slog through genetics starting at a pretty high level, and for the most part had to pull themselves along without good guidance from the teaching staff.",
    "You probably need this course. This was the first year it was taught so they are still ironing out some kinks in regards to the modules. Overall 103 was one of my favorites, as I find development really interesting. Currently there is a lot of work: weekly quizzes, psets, exams, mandatory sections, readings for sections. Grading didn't seem super strict.",
    "Average, basic",
    "only take it if you need too",
    "I'd definitely recommend Bio 103! The material is really interesting and relevant to a lot of things people will almost all encounter in their life (for example, genes related to cancer). The lecture is interesting, and the workload is not impossible.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but it is great. Prof. Slack is a great lecturer!",
    "Biology 103 was the easiest of the intro bio modules; there was plenty of time to understand what was being taught and there were in class and online quizzes (1 per week) and while the online quizzes might seem good it was easy, at least for me, to forget to do them because they were assigned on a day we didn't have bio.",
    "The best of the four bio modules. Professor Slack is funny and easy to pay attention to. Probably also the least intellectually challenging of the modules, along with 101.",
    "The quizzes are difficult, but overall the course is balanced and the material is clear.",
    "This class is a typical entry science course but there were some kinks in the way the class was set up. Its a difficult class but the subject is interesting.",
    "I would recommend the class. It's definitely interesting and the topics are fun to learn about. Also the professor was great at generating excitement for the material that needed to be learned.",
    "A survey course that discusses developmental biology, this course gets you thinking like an evo-devo scientist. The lectures are interesting and the work load is fair.",
    "Take Biology 103 if you didn't take AP Biology. Even if you did it will challenge you by making you apply your knowledge of genetics to solving clinical problems.",
    "I would not take it unless you have to. It's a fairly difficult class and some of the material can be a bit much unless you really enjoy developmental bio.",
    "YES! I loved this course so much. Professor Slack is a great lecturer and I cannot say enough good things about this course. I didn't understand the point of online quizzes though. It's good that we had more time (think about an hr to do a 4-question quiz), but hard to find quiet spots. Even in the library, people will come up to talk to you. The quizzes were challenging but not impossible and I enjoyed studying for Bio 103. Was so sad when it ended. Before, I have never even thought of biology as a major. But now I am. Bio 101-104 are a lot of work so do prepared to work in this class. However, the quizzes are nice b\/c you study as you go so there is not too much cramming in the end. The papers were a nice way of introducing us to scientific literature, and the visit to his lab was great. Professor Slack is one of the best professors I've met at Yale. Definitely take it!",
    "I loved this class! It was a lot of work with the weekly quizzes, but I learned a lot and enjoyed every lecture.",
    "Overall, very interesting. Hard intro course. Only take it if needed.",
    "Much more enjoyable than the first two modules of the Bio sequence. Easier to understand because of the concise and eloquent professor and interesting, relevant topic.",
    "Bio 103 was the most clear and interesting module of the four. I highly recommend taking it especially if you want to major in the sciences because it provides a good background on genetics. I learned a lot of information that was never covered in high school AP Biology. Professor Slack is also good. His power points are clear, and he is good at explaining them.",
    "no",
    "Clearly-structured course, good overall survey of developmental bio- pretty dry though.",
    "Bio 103 is in my opinion the best in the entire sequence in terms of course content as well as organization. Frank Slack explained things very well and he left no surprises. The quizzes were useful in keeping up with the lectures and the psets and labs were very reflective of the information provided.",
    "This is an interesting class, but I wouldn't recommend you take it for fun.",
    "This was my favorite course in the Introductory Biology sequence this year. Professor Slack made material very easy to digest and understand and the homework assignments were mostly focused around reading scientific literature, which is a valuable skill that I developed. Lectures were always interesting and easy to follow. If you pay attention during all of the lectures and read the papers, you should have no problem doing well on the quizzes and the problem sets. I did basically none of the textbook reading and just relied on Professor Slack's lectures because they were so clear. Overall, a great course.",
    "Biology 103 was exactly genes and development. We focused on a few model organisms, such as Drosophila flies and nematode worms, but it was great because we really solidly learned the material using the examples the professor liked to use, and then he made it interesting by adding other material that we didn't need to know quite to such a detailed extent.",
    "A good and interesting module. The best one out of the 4 in the year-long sequence. A fair bit of straight memorization, though. Lectures are boring, too.",
    "I would recommend it- the course material was very interesting, although the class size is very big. Many people have already had experience with Biology, so it is fairly hard to do well.",
    "It was hard; don't take it and expect to ace it, unless you do a ton of work. If you want to understand biology and you like it, go for it! If you're on the fence, don't take it: it's abstruse and time-intensive.",
    "I would recommend 103 to a student relatively new to genetics. The grading is fair and the teaching assistants tend to be quite good. More experienced students may find that this course doesn't bring any huge revelations.",
    "I actually enjoyed this class, but only because it was about genetics, which I find very interesting. It, like all of the other bio modules, was a big lecture class and if I loved the subject matter less, I probably wouldn't have liked it too much. Like all of the other bio modules, don't take it unless you plan to major in bio or are premed. Seriously, it's not worth the pain.",
    "I would not recommend unless it was changed. I liked the professor and the material was interesting but I think the new biology modules are not very good in general.",
    "Okay this goes for all modules:Take this class if:-you are premed because you have to-if you like the idea of A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION-if you didn't die in high school science, even if you think you're a humanities person, take this class to get rid of your Sc reqs. It's work. But you learn SO MUCH and you really understand a lot more about how everything works. It is awesome. And there are a million resources to help you if you're struggling at all.-if you chose Yale because you wanted to dip into a myriad of topics and not JUST study western art history between 1678-1692 if you know what I'm saying.BIOLOGY IS KICKASS. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Biology 103 is a class that studies genetics and its impacts on development. This course is a must for any biology major and is immensely helpful to any premeds. I recommend this course to anyone interested in genetics and development as well as to anyone who would better like to understand the scientific method.",
    "Biol 103 was a more interesting module of the 4. The quizzes were challenging.",
    "In a desert of extremely challenging, heavy workload, not-actually-intro-level bio modules, 103 was an oasis offering digestible lecture material and moderate workload, leading to reduced biology stress levels. That's not to say it was an easy class (obviously), but it was a nice break after 102. If you took the first semester, don't give up yet! Take 103! (And then you might want to drop before 104 but that's your call). Frank Slack's a chill guy who's actually pretty interesting to listen to-- you won't fall asleep (cough, 101) as he tells you about all the ways to make eyes grow on flies' legs. I don't think anyone I know found this class uninteresting. Definitely worth the effort to keep making your way through the intro sequence.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in biology, but prepare for way more work than a half credit course should have.",
    "Still a challenging course, especially the problem sets, but I would say it was much more fair than 101 and 102 in the sense that everyone was on a more level playing field. Students who already had 5s on the AP Bio exam or years experience conducting research in labs, still had to work, which made it a lot nicer for someone like myself with minimal knowledge of the subject.",
    "This was a straightforward, good class to take. I learned a lot from it and would say that it was worth it.",
    "Interesting material, sometimes with overarching expectations of material grasp prior to testing.",
    "Biology 103 is without a doubt the best quarter of biology 101-104. Topics are interesting, assessments are fair, it's clear what we need to understand, and the teaching (between Frank Slack, TFs, and all the student questions and TA\/instructor answers on Piazza) is excellent.",
    "Bio 103 was just a straightforward module with not much variation. the quizzes were very hard and the final was even harder. I studied an incredible amount for it and was not happy with my grade..I would not reccomend this class however, most have to take it to finish the bio sequence.",
    "It's an intro bio course. It isn't particularly fun, but you need it before you can get into the cool MCDB electives.",
    "This class was interesting, though hard to follow at times. It was hard not because of the content, with enough reading and studying that was manageable, it was more like the presentation of the content that made things a bit difficult. However, it was a useful and rewarding class to take.",
    "Yes! You are learn more than you realize! The paper quizzes and final were fair, and the teachers and professors were great!",
    "BIOL 103 was a great intro to both genetics and development at the same time. It's difficult for a professor to combine those two parts into the same course, but Slack does that perfectly. I really enjoyed this module of the bio sequence.",
    "It's required for MCDB (unless you pass the placement test, good luck on that) so you have to take it anyway. Not too much work or reading, but the homework\/quizzes are deceptively hard. Take this class seriously from the beginning or you'll regret it!",
    "Absolutely! Biology 103 is a satisfying class that teaches a wealth of knowledge relevant to most careers in the sciences.",
    "Overall a solid course; I enjoyed it a lot-- especially lectures of ectopic limb development and cancer.",
    "This class is a must for all biology majors. You will learn basic genetics and devlopment in this class.",
    "Lots of work, challenging, but overall interesting and rewarding.",
    "Biology 103 was what you would expect from an intro bio lecture class. The topic was interesting but not always presented in the most engaging way. I wouldn't really recommend the class to anyone who isn't required to take it.",
    "Great class, good understanding of genetics and populations",
    "I thought it was really interesting but I wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't have to take it for pre-med or a major, because if you're just looking for a way to learn this awesome material, spend a full semester on it so you don't feel rushed.",
    "This was probably my favorite module (out of the 101-104 sequence). I actually stayed awake during ALL of the lectures and learned some interesting things about genes that I did not previously know.",
    "I don't like the idea of modules. I enjoyed the content and professors, but this course would have been better and more effective if it was a semester long.",
    "I don't think this is a class you should take because you think you'll enjoy it or because you think you'll learn things that are really productive. Take it if you have to, it's not bad, it's not too difficult, and you will learn things, but they're probably more specific than the generalities you may expect from an intro course. Hopefully it'll be better next year too!",
    "Take only if necessary or vastly interest in biology.",
    "Good course, worth taking!",
    "Biology 103 taught about the genetic makeup of a cell and cancer.I would definitely recommend it to other students. It teaches essential knowledge that everybody needs if going into a scientific career.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 103-- it will be great for a science major, and a different look at the chemistry and physics of biological systems. For a non-science major, it will be stimulating and make them think in different ways.",
    "If you don't know if you like genetics before you take this course, you will know after.",
    "Biology 103 taught us a wide range of topics in genes and development, and I enjoyed it. It is more work than a typical intro course, but you will learn many applicable material.",
    "Biology 103 involves two lectures a week, plus a discussion section. The lectures are actually entertaining, since Professor Slack is organized and thoughtful in his approach. The assessments basically consist of six quizzes (one per week), the final exam and homework assignments which were either reading responses or problem sets. You also get points for participating in discussion section. If you're going to take the introductory biology sequence, Bio 103 is byfar the best module of the bunch. It is the most organized, educational and fair in the way you're graded, so I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in genetics and development. I'm not a bio major either, so don't be afraid to take this class even if you're not a science person! It's not exceedingly difficult, but it's also not a cake walk. If you put in a decent amount of effort, you really learn a lot of relevant, applicable information.",
    "Introductory to biology that will push but not overwhelm students.",
    "Difficult, but interesting. Tricky quizzes.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "This class is an interesting survey of genes and development. It wasn't as broad-scope as I'd hoped, instead focusing more in specific examples to give us more of a \"feel\" for the general topics, but was still very interesting. I would recommend this class if you want to get more exposure to topics in genetics (the class focused more on genes than development) and learn what interests you, but maybe not if you are looking for something to gain large amounts of facts from. It is useful for critical thinking and interacting with more complex ideas in biology.",
    "Unless you pass out of everything, I would recommend taking this. It'll be a good refresher for higher level courses.",
    "Intro to genes and development. Do not take if you are looking for a regular science credit - they cater to pre-meds or people who are taking this for their major. It wasn't fun but it wasn't my worst class. Doable amount of work. Not too hard.",
    "Take it is you have to but I wouldn't take it for fun.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "I would recommend this course to someone else.",
    "A course that will be taken mostly by those who need it but it is a great class for those with a marginal interest in biology. If not taking it for a major, it should be taken credit\/d\/fail because it can be difficult but it should be pretty laid back if taken for credit.",
    "Take it if you must... this one isn't particularly interesting, and it's the hardest of the intro sequence. But you will learn, and if it's a requirement, embrace it and get it done.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed Biology 103 and I feel like I learned a lot from the course. I thought the professor was fairly engaging, he taught at a very good pace, and I found the material very interesting. I liked having weekly quizzes because it allowed for grading to be more spread out and it encouraged me to consistently think about and study the material on a weekly basis, such that when the final came around, I had already studied most of the material at least once.I would recommend Biology 103 for another student.",
    "BIO 103 was definitely one of the better intro bio modules. It was interesting and the assignments were not too difficult. If you need to take the intro sequence or the module, then take this class. Otherwise, there are more interesting ways to fulfill distributional requirements.",
    "a course that should only be taken if you have to. quizzes were designed to trick you",
    "I would recommend Biol 103. The professor is a good lecturer. You are assessed frequently, but at least the information is available in the slide handouts. Overall, I found the class interesting and fair.",
    "Bio 103 was my favorite module out of the intro bio sequence. Prof. Slack is great, and he keeps the material relevant by connecting it to recent scientific issues and scientific papers.",
    "Biology 103 is a good foundational course in genetics. While it may be dry sometimes, you will learn plenty; Professor Slack is a good lecturer and his slides are well-organized and useful.",
    "A fantastic overview of genetics, with a lot of freshman students. Really enjoyable class with a great professor. Definitely take this if you have to fulfill a Biology requirement.",
    "The course was a fair introduction to genetics and signaling pathways. I liked it because the material taught beyond the basic material learned in high school. I also liked how we were exposed to research methods.",
    "BIOL 103 is one of the better classes in the intro bio sequence. Professor Slack is an excellent lecturer and makes class time both varied and interesting. The papers covered in discussion section are somewhat difficult but a welcome challenge to work through. Not too much work or reading required, but the quizzes can be moderately difficult. Make sure to study for them, or they will sink your grade big time.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in learning more about the phrases \"up regulation\" and \"down regulation\".",
    "To be honest: everything is an improvement after 102. That said, given how much I thought I loved genetics, this course was not that great. Professor Slack is great, though!",
    "Bio 103 is a great class that focuses on genetics and how genes really are crucial in development. I would recommend this class, because you learn a lot and it's interesting.",
    "Biology 103 was a very straightforward approach to a biology class, much like the Biology 101 course. I would recommend the class.",
    "Developmental biology is a difficult topic butit is extremely well taught in this course. If you are at all interested in the study of development, definitely take this class. The Professors and the T.A.s do everything in their power to make sure you understand what is being taught. This includes reading relevant research papers, quizzes, and lots of lab examples on the slides.",
    "Easier and more interesting than 101 and 102. One of my favorite modules.",
    "Biology 103 is an intro level biology course focussed on genetics. You'll hear some great lectures by Professor Slack and you'll get to read and analyze a lot of scientific papers. I'd recommend the course\u00e2\u0080\u0094you learn a lot, and the day to day work is very interesting.",
    "I would recommend that you take all four modules in sequence, since they more or less build upon each other. 103 is taught well, and I found it to be a good class.",
    "Not great. Not terrible. Take it if you have to.",
    "Biology 103 is a required course. I would recommend it to all premeds and to anyone introduced in developmental biology, but who has not taken AP Biology and does not want to take the more intensive Dev Bio course.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Not too much work, but interesting material.",
    "No I would not recommend it. It wasn't so memorable of a course and did not further my interest\/love for biology.",
    "103 is yet another one of those horrifyingly large intro modules. Hopefully they will have decided on a quiz format, as the inconsistency of quiz media and points really affected the grading. Professor Slack is a phenomenal lecturer, however, so lecture is pretty clear and somewhat enjoyable.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. The lectures were engaging, despite the large number of students, and the material was at the correct level for an introductory course on genetics. Professor Slack was great, and this module was my favorite of the BIOL 101-104 sequence.",
    "Yup, it's required and it's a decent class with good rigor",
    "Online quizzes way too long. A horrendous introduction to Biology. A good higher level Biology course. The class expects its students to have taken AP Bio in high school. Great lectures. Inordinate amount of work. If you have to take it for credit, I'm sorry. If you don't but just want to learn Biology: audit it, audit it, audit it!",
    "A very good introduction to genetics. Definitely would recommend it - the best of the 4 Bio modules for sure. Frank Slack is a great teacher.",
    "You have to take it for intro bio. I do not like the format of the modules they are confusing and I feel that I could have learned more with different course setup.",
    "Biology 103 is a great class especially if you are at all interested in genetics. I took this without taking BIOL 101\/102 and my last biology class being a pretty janky one freshman year of high school. At first, it was a very scary idea to jump into this course. But the thing I learned is you need to be on top of your game. Join enrichment section, be open to going to the biology tutor, make sure you understand all the lectures after they happen. There are a lot of resources to help you with the material, but you have to put in the time. Otherwise, definitely take it - it got me thinking about my interests in biology.",
    "This one was honestly the most painful out of the four. Frank is goodlooking and has a great accent, but genetics as a subject is HARD. Get a good TA who will explain the concepts to you.",
    "BIOL 103 is a great intro for developmental biology and, like the rest of the introductory module, provided both a breadth and depth of knowledge. I would definitely recommend BIOL 103.",
    "Yes, because the lecturer is brilliant and the material is awesome. All the way!I would say that it is an in depth lecture on genetics and development, way beyond the level of AP Biology, but still very manageable.",
    "The class was good. It wasn't my favorite or the most engaging out of the intro modules. I also greatly disliked the online exams. But I learned new things.",
    "Biology 103 was on overall positive experience since the content was very interesting and well-taught! The powerpoints were structured and organized very nicely. The online quizzes caught me off guard at times, since some of the questions were tricky, but the in-class quizzes were fairer. I am now interested in developmental biology and I believe that is partly due to the way Professor Slack taught the class in an enjoyable manner.",
    "This class was generally pretty interesting and easy to follow. The way the course evaluates your understanding of the material is a bit more difficult than simple information regurgitation but it was a fine course.",
    "Good course but can be difficult to understand what material we were responsible for knowing",
    "BIOL 103 is an intro to genes and development.",
    "103 was the best of the bio modules. Lectures were full of cool real-life examples, powerpoints were helpful for studying.I felt like I learned more about modern experimental method and research than any of the other modules.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise super basic.",
    "BIOL 103 is a very challenging and engaging class that requires students to study and review material every day to understand it. It is imperative to get a good understanding of the concepts at the very beginning of the class, because each concept builds upon the one before it. The more a student solidifies her understanding of the material early on, the better off she will be.",
    "A vast amount of information gets crammed into 1\/2 a semester. It's overwhelming and it really feels like too much. The information is interesting. You get to learn all about embryogenesis (organogenesis etc) but really the intrigue of the information is overshadowed by the AMOUNT of information you have to process. I would recommend this with caution. If you like biology don't take this class especially if you've already got the qualifications to take harder classes. If you HAVE to take this class, then take it but be prepared for the horror.",
    "Take it if you have to. Necessary evil for bio majors and precedes who didn't place out (which a lot of people did for 103).",
    "Bio 103 was soooo much better than 101 and 102. Section and quizzes all enforced the knowledge I had gained from lecture, and Professor Slack is a cool guy. If you're looking for a good introduction to the genetic aspect of biology, this is a great course for you. If you have to take this for premed requirements, don't worry- it'll be fine (maybe even enjoyable).",
    "Very interesting content - Slack's lab is one of the most groundbreaking at Yale and it's really interesting to hear him talk about his work in class. It can be difficult if you've never taken bio before, expect to put more effort into this class than your peers (who somehow all seem to have taken the class in high school!)",
    "If you have an interest in genetics, this is a good introductory course. Not ridiculously challenging, but still engaging and thought-provoking.",
    "It is a required course but it is well done in general",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in genetics, whether or not it is a requirement.",
    "If you have to take it, do it.",
    "Biology 103 is a challenging course, but is enjoyable as well, comprising of engaging lectures and manageable course work as long as you stay on top of things. It was a good course, if not a favorite, and I would recommend it. A very solid, reasonable course for a major.",
    "Out of all of the biology introductory course modules, Bio 103 was my favorite, and it is also the module that I would most recommend to any other student as an interesting science course that would likely appeal even to nonscience students. The material is all very interesting; Dr. Slack is a great professor; the information is presented in an easy-to-comprehend manner in lecture; and the assessments are mostly all very fair evaluations of the material covered.",
    "Pretty good class. I already knew a lot of the material from AP, but the professor was very clear and organized and it was easy to learn from him.",
    "Bio 103 is pretty interesting and isn't that time consuming because the frequent tests make sure that you pay attention in class and read the necessary material throughout the course instead of cramming at the end.",
    "it was a good intro class, and interesting stuff if you like basic genetics. i would recommend overall.",
    "Biology 103 is definitely a course worth taking. It provides a very strong overview of how our genes affect our lives through our biological development. It may sound like a bit of a niche topic, but it actually covers a wide variety of subjects and is an interesting new perspective to have. It's not an exorbitant amount of work, and with consistent application you'll definitely learn a lot about the topics. Professor Slack is a good lecturer, and the TFs are all excellent. I'd certainly recommend it to students who are interested in biology, especially those who are interested in medicine and evolution.",
    "Definitely!",
    "yes",
    "this is a course intended for majors in biology or chem.",
    "Unless you place out of BIO 103, this class is necessary as a prerequisite class for many biology majors as well as for pre-medical studies. The class is pretty straightforward but the combination of online quizzes and in class quizzes can be pretty stressful. Grasping key concepts is key.",
    "Bio 103 is great, definitely my favorite in the sequence. For me, this was really the only one of the courses to cover new material a majority of the time (this is coming from someone who never took AP Bio). Slack knows what he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking about and as long as you pay attention to his lectures, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be fine in the class.",
    "All of the BIOL modules were much harder than any type of bio done in high school. I'd only recommend this course for someone who has a great passion for biology.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. It's not that bad. In fact, it's one of the more interesting introductory Biology sequences. I liked 103 and 104 best."
