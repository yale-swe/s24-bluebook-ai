   "comments": [
    "If you have some creativity and are looking for an outlet, this is great--when else at school do you get to weld?? But if you already know that you are not artistic, you may be frustrated. Ann does not grade on innate talent, but she does look for quality.",
    "This class is awesome. Welding is so fun, and Ann is a character. Take.",
    "This seminar is a great class to take if you want a basic introduction to metal working. I would definitely recommend it, even if you aren't artistically inclined. Most of the techniques you'll learn are for midsized sculpture, not the really fine or really large metal working. It's a super fun class and you'll leave with several projects that can be quite beautiful.",
    "It was really fun and even therapeutic. I loved it. YES",
    "Making Metal Sculpture is a great introduction to the practice of making metal sculpture in all of its forms for non-art majors. You make five different projects throughout the semester and one final project that can include as many or as few of the different processes you learned. I would definitely recommend the class to someone who wants to take an art class, but is worried about a) getting in or b) being graded against other art majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is not an art major but wants some insight into the art of sculpture making and the difficulties\/concerns that surround it",
    "Class is a ton of fun to learn the techniques and make sculptures. The reading\/writing assignmentsd are a little all over the place, but definitely a worthwhile class!",
    "Take it! It's a nice brain break - though not easy, you just think about things that you probably wouldn't in other classes. Also really cool to see what you make, and little to no work outside of class.",
    "This is a fun class that is totally different from anything else you are taking. Overall recomendable.",
    "This course is a great break from the usual textbook or lecture course. You get to use a completely different kind of intelligence and be very creative. It really didn't feel like a class at all.BUT there are two (surprise) papers \u0097 one written about a book of lectures \u0097 a final written report. None of the work was that big of a deal, but I had no idea it was coming when I signed up for the class."
