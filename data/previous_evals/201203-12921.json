   "comments": [
    "I definitely enjoyed the course; not too difficult, great professor (Loewenberg). I thought the course could have been more rigorous, then I remembered that I'm a senior chemical engineering major.",
    "Most likely required if you are looking at this class. It's a fine class, workload is not too heavy, and the course is well-run this semester.",
    "This is a requirement for the chemical engineering major, so most people take it for that reason. It isn't difficult if Loewenberg is teaching it, and probably less of a workload than other chemE courses.",
    "Overall separations was actually an interesting class, and Loewenberg is the absolute man. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very chill and makes sure that you know exactly what he wants you to learn. Problem sets and exams are both reasonable. A bit more structure might have been nice, but this class would be a good one even if not in the context of the miserable chemical engineering curriculum. Within that context, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unbelievable.",
    "McCabe-thiele diagrams, ternary liquid diagrams, stages and their efficiency. More diagrams."
