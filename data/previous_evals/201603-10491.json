   "comments": [
    "I gained a better understanding of how my own theories of parenthood and child rearing hold up against those preferred by the academy. Outside of how to be a better adult playmate, I don't think I learned much more than what I already knew beforehand, but that is likely because I focus on developmental neuroscience and have plenty of background in both development psychology and neurobiology.",
    "This class gives a comprehensive overview of child development. Through the guest lectures, we gained insights from a variety of different specialists. The practicum was undoubtedly the greatest strength of the class. Spending 3 hours a week in a classroom as a participant-observer greatly added to our learning and application of the material.",
    "The practicum is the best part. You don't realize how much you can learn just by observing kids in a classroom. The lectures in class were a good supplement to what we saw with our eyes. The second half of each class is a breakout session, and that's a really good time to ask the instructors about specific behaviors you notice in the children and they can give you individualized analysis.",
    "This class fundamentally changed my conception regarding the complexity of child development and childcare. I learned fascinating things each week, from how and why children develop language, to what role their parents have in facilitating development, to how toys and playtime are actually crucial ways for children to learn. They say that you learn by doing, and it was a fascinating exercise to be thrown into an environment with 1 and 2 year olds for the first time. Everyone at Yale-New Haven Hospital Daycare is incredibly kind and helpful and supportive when you comebut they also push you out of your comfort zone to make you grow as a person. The journal assignments and final paper are likewise perfectly crafted to supplement the firsthand experience that you get week to week. They are perfectly reasonable in length, and challenge you to fundamentally transform how your view childcare when you see how much attention and detail is purposefully paid to everything from the books kids read, to the toys they play with, to the way that teachers interact with kids. The final paper is a reasonable length and well-supported opportunity to explore one specific topic that you found interesting during the semester.",
    "I learned about the stages of children's development and what sort of activities and care are necessary for that development.",
    "This course taught me a lot about child development and also how to be a participant-observer in a classroom.",
    "This class taught me how to be an effective observer and participant as well as how to think critically about child development. The lectures on atypical development helped solidify our knowledge of how normal development leads to healthy children and the types of circumstances that could prevent this normal growth as well as how to intervene.",
    "I learned how to be a participant observer - how to be objective, to pay attention to your own responses to what the children do, and how to draw from the literature to interpret behavior.",
    "I got insights into the child development process, especially in the context of how they learn and interact with the world.",
    "I learned how to become an observer with as much objectivity as possible.",
    "I gained more knowledge about the developmental processes of children and learned about the importance of early education and certain key components of its structure, such as play and language development.",
    "I developed observation skills in addition to learning the course material. The weekly observation at a daycare and the introductory lecture on how to observe shaped how I think about children's actions and their development. Writing about the observation improved my ability to write objectively and analytically by connecting observations with readings.",
    "I gained a lot of skill in the way I objectively observe the interactions of children, and I also learned how to use my subjective feelings as a way to evaluate my own reactions to my observations. I learned a lot about the importance of child care in the early years, and I feel I will be a better parent as a result of having taken this course.",
    "As a psychology major, this class doesn't provide too much new technical information (especially for students who have taken developmental psych) but it does provide plenty of observational experience which is definitely valuable. I'd say the main knowledge I learned from this class would be how to apply technical information to real life observations.",
    "How to observe children in a way that assesses their development, parental skills, looking at play and daycare on a new light. Great class!!",
    "I learned about all facets of child observation through the different perspectives of child development experts throughout the entire course. Through daycare observations, I learned how to objectively observe and subsequently reflect on child behavior. This course made me think critically about the state of early childhood care in our nation, and compelled me to use both clinical and theoretical child development perspectives in thinking of ways we could improve life for children. This course offers extremely useful and relevant insights for everyone."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The daycare observations are the core to the course. Without it, I feel the course would serve little value because you would not be able to see how well the theories hold in reality. The practicum is so valuable. However, the lectures are hit-or-miss.",
    "The main strengths of the course are the diverse array of speakers and the weekly practicum in a classroom.",
    "The practicum can get a little onerous once the journals are submitted, especially because the morning preference time is difficult to get to. Bringing the reading into the lectures more might help students be more engaged with it.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the field experience at the daycare. They say that you learn by doing, and it was a fascinating exercise to be thrown into an environment with 1 and 2 year olds for the first time. Everyone at Yale-New Haven Hospital Daycare is incredibly kind and helpful and supportive when you comebut they also push you out of your comfort zone to make you grow as a person.

They are perfectly reasonable in length, and challenge you to fundamentally transform how your view childcare when you see how much attention and detail is purposefully paid to everything from the books kids read, to the toys they play with, to the way that teachers interact with kids. The final paper is a reasonable length and well-supported opportunity to explore one specific topic that you found interesting during the semester. As for the instructors, Nancy and Carla are great facilitators who radiate wisdom, warmth, and support. They knew when to challenge your assumptions about children, what questions would provoke interesting conversation, and how to bring in their and your real life experience into the mix. Lynn, at Yale New Haven Hospital Daycare, is likewise amazing. I dont think that I could have learned even near as much as I did if not for her support on the grounds. The one weakness of the course is the lectures. (Nancy during one of the first sessions definitely said something along the lines of Research shows that lectures are one of the most ineffective methods of actually getting people to engage with and remember the materials.) Nancy and Carla have done a great job curating a variety of interesting speakers and invested community membersbut the lectures tended to be hit or miss. Some of the guests are really amazingbut other times, it felt as if people were literally reading words off of a powerpoint, which was pretty disengaging. If there was some time for group work, or just another way of breaking up the consistency of the lecture format, that could take this class to the next level.",
    "I really enjoyed the guest lectures, especially Michael Kaplan's two lectures. Otherwise, the lectures felt too long at times... could have been improved by doing a short activity or discussion etc. to break up the lecture time. My favorite part of the course was the time spent in the daycare center, where I felt incredibly welcome.",
    "The practicum portion of the course helps you apply the knowledge from lecture to the real world setting. I also think that the structure of the class, which divides class time into lecture and section, was helpful in providing an opportunity to explore the material in the context of our specific classroom observations. One weakness of this course was the dissociation between class and the readings. Although we were supposed to incorporate the readings into our journal entires, I think it would have made the readings more meaningful if they were also mentioned in the context of class. This would have helped contextualize the readings and apply them to real-life situations beyond what we were doing indecently in our journal entires (there were a lot more readings than space to write about them in the journals).",
    "I really enjoyed the observations and discussions, but did not care for the lectures. As someone who has had a lot of childcare experience, the material was a lot of review.",
    "The integration of classroom observations with lectures made this class one of the most engaging and rewarding courses I have taken at Yale. I would encourage the professors to have students do their observations after the weekly lectures (either on Thursday or Friday) if possible because it helped me to focus on what we had talked about in lecture and witness child development principles in action. I enjoyed the content of the guest lectures, but having many guest professors in a row did disrupt the continuity of the course at times.",
    "Strengths are the weekly discussions and the weekly observation sessions where we got to see the kids. Weakness could be the fact that the classes are almost 2hrs long so there is no way you can listen to all of it.",
    "The lectures for this course have apparently been given year after year for a few years now, and they felt kind of stale for it. The practical portion of this class was incredible, it was so much fun and so informative to observe the children at the schools, but the lectures could've used a bit more energy or freshness, that was often my least favorite part of the course, especially compared to the high-energy, exciting practicum visits.",
    "Amazing course that definitely taught me how to understand the behavior of children.",
    "This course featured some really incredible guest speakers, which was great because we got to get insight from the experts in their respective fields. The observation component was probably the main strength of the course; it was the highlight of my week and I learned so much from actually being in the classroom. The only way I think it could have been improved is if in the future, students can figure out ways to go to their daycare on different days of the week and\/or different times of the day. That would provide a much fuller picture of the classroom\/the individual children, which is valuable when writing journals and final papers. I also would suggest including more video clips during class, since we are observing only one age group and sometimes can't conceptualize what a younger\/older child demonstrating a certain developmental skill looks like without a visual aid.",
    "I enjoyed the design of the class and how it was split up into a lecture and discussion. The guest lecturers were great. My favorite was Dr. Michael Kaplan who spoke with energy and clarity about his field. The observation component of the class was a practical way to learn and see child development each week and shaped the learning of the class. A weakness of the course was the time commitment. The class required a large devotion of time from the observation to writing six journals and the readings. I think if the journals were split up better like one every 2 weeks or 2 every 3 weeks, it would have been easier to manage time.",
    "The observations are a HUGE strength of this class that really makes it stand out, and the professors are all knowledgeable and passionate. I'd recommend more seminar discussion time and less lecture time, only because a lot of the lectures overlapped information making them seem a little too time consuming. The only other recommendation I'd give would be more explicit descriptions of what you're looking for in the journal responses and final paper. (Journal responses especially) At times it felt exceedingly difficult to write them, not because of lacking information, but because the guidelines were very vague.",
    "Very engaging and interesting! Sometimes lecture would be long and not that interactive but section was a good addition",
    "Strengths: Amazing, thorough, and caring professors and daycare directors, interactive daycare observations every week, fantastic guest lecturers throughout the semester, a combination of lecture and discussion in class, manageable workload, and ability to apply course knowledge through daycare observation journals. Weaknesses: perhaps not enough engagement and in-class discussion of excellent readings assigned"

   "comments": [
    "Nancy is wonderful and so are the daycare providers. Be aware that this class does take up time since you've got to trek all the way up to your daycare center then spend 2.5 hours observing then walk all the way back. Spending time with the kids is definitely the highlight (so cute! so many cuddles!). Not a lot of work (6 responses and a paper) and you pretty much never have to do the reading.",
    "If you would like to spend a few hours every week in a daycare observing children growing up at the preschool and pre-preschool age, this is definitely the class for you. However, the theories presented (early on) may be a little outdated and conservative for those who are more interested in the innovation in childhood, but information starts becoming contemporary by the latter half of the course.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to child development and child psychology. I'd highly recommend it for anyone who is interested in teaching or psychology broadly.",
    "Yes, absolutely! If nothing else, do it for the adorable kids, who become attached to you in a relatively short time. The practicum is the best part. You don't realize how much you can learn just by observing kids in a classroom. The lectures in class were a good supplement to what we saw with our eyes. The second half of each class is a breakout session, and that's a really good time to ask the instructors about specific behaviors you notice in the children and they can give you individualized analysis.",

    "Yes, if you're interested in learning about children, or taking a unique course that allows you to spend time in day care center.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in understanding child development. It provides a nice way to learn about child development from a theoretical perspective and then observe the application of those theories in a day care classroom.",
    "Observations are fun, the lectures didn't engage me but other people seemed to enjoy them. I have had a lot of instruction (formal and informal) around child development, so it was a lot of review for me. Having to purchase a reading packet was a big expense, especially given that we weren't really tasked to read or discuss the assignments except for in the journals.",
    "Yes.",
    "If you have any interest whatsoever in learning about children, you should definitely take this class. The weekly observations gave this course a practical application that made learning the material a rewarding experience. The professors care very much about the students and support them in the classroom and daycare settings.",
    "Absolutely. You have the chance to learn from titans in the field with great guest lectures, and have small group discussions about things you're seeing in your observations. The observations are the best part of the course--nothing better than hanging out with kids for a few hours each week and you learn so much.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in learning more about hildren then definitely take it.",
    "If you want to actually work with children once a week, yes for sure take this class, it's an incredible opportunity. If you're more interested in learning about the theories and research in child development, a lot of the course material feels outdated and the lecturers really vary in quality, so this may not be the course for you.",
    "Take this course! Such a great experience to interact with children and learn from professors who are so experienced in this field.",
    "YES! If you can get in, TAKE IT! This class was one of my favorites I have ever taken at Yale, and solidified my interest in working in early education. The observations each week will take up a significant amount of time, but are so worth it and so much fun. You will learn a LOT about the development of the children you observe, and the course lectures (with amazing guest speakers!) will provide a lot of theoretical background and insight. Although the journals and final paper are left mostly up to yourself to structure, they are really valuable because you have the freedom to delve into the part of development\/early education you're most interested in.",
    "Take this course if you are truly interested in learning about development of children. This course does require more time and work than others because of the weekly 2.5-3 hour observation. The commitment does pay off with the vast array of guest lecturers and learning from Professor Horwtiz and Dr. Close who are experts in their field.",
    "If you are not a psych major and interested in child psychology (especially childhood education\/daycare) then without a doubt take this class and learn some cool stuff and get to have wonderful observations in the preschools. If you ARE a psych major then it's a trickier question. I am, and I ADORED my observation times and the opportunity to apply all the information I've learned in a real life setting. But, the lectures, while well done, are entirely intro level stuff. If you've taken a lot of psych classes (and REALLY if you've taken developmental psych) you're gonna already know most of the material. This can be a plus if you're looking for an easier workload, (and the observations are really worth it) but if you get distracted or bored easily then the class can become tiring if you already know most of the material.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in child study, children or even just being a parent!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students! The daycare observations are unforgettable, amazing experiences -- something I looked forward to every week. The professors and directors of the daycare centers are all amazing and extremely thoughtful and caring. While lectures may not be as engaging as they could be for a seminar, the discussion portion and the daycare observation opportunities more than make up for it."
