    "a lot of time spent on learning the language, helpful for some and not helpful for others",
    "if you're willing to do 1.5 hours or more of homework everyday, you'll be fine in this course!",
    "Francois Expert is a wonderful teacher to have since he is a native speaker, and he is pretty chill about deadlines. For those who have trouble understanding spoken French, his class might not be the best option, since he speaks fairly quickly and in the native fashion, but personally I thought this was excellent practice. L3 French in general is a pretty fast-moving class if the concepts are new to you, but I never found it to be too much. It is really a lot of work, what with the audio exercises that sometimes take a hour and a half (but on average, probably budget about an hour and a half a night for all the work for this class).",
    "I'd encourage anyone to continue with french! It's a beautiful language, and the french department is pretty organized."
