   "comments": [
    "I hated this course, but, unfortunately, you have no way out. Be careful about scheduling other classes that meet before Wednesday crits-- you'll often need that time to finish a project (or catch up on sleep).",
    "You have to take this class. It's the junior studio for the architecture major. Just try to focus more on steps in your process, because those seem to determine your grade.",
    "Studio teaches you many skills, especially how to analyze and design an entire site.",
    "This course did little to further my understanding of theory, design, or craft. It was poorly organized, ill-conceived, and incredibly frustrating. Dean and Joyce refuse to work together, which is problematic for a grave number of reasons. If this class is not being reconsidered next year, I will be extremely surprised and disenchanted with this whole going-to-yale thing.",
    "Not really, because is not coherent enough. Well, you cannot choose anyway.",
    "In theory, ARCH251 is supposed to introduce juniors to the issues of site and context. The projects themselves, while addressing these issues (and sometimes hitting you over the head with them), has very little relationship to the design principles from first semester. There is very little acknowledgement of formal design and building construction, and the drastically conflicting pedagogies of the two professors makes the studio difficult to tolerate.",
    "Required.",
    "It is mandatory for architecture majors.",
    "In light of the wonderful (if intense) studio experience of first semester, part II of methods and form was immensely disappointing. The course was disorganized, the curriculum not thought-out, the professors disengaged and unhelpful. The TAs were the lone bright spot. The first two assignments were especially disheartening--they did not seem planned out, nor did they result in personal feelings of progress. Crits with Joyce and Dean did little to advance ideas, and I do not want to use either of those projects in a future portfolio. Critics invited to judge our projects often had never participated in a studio critique before, adding to the feeling that the projects were not at all architectural in nature. The assignments did not feel sophisticated, nor did they seem to be pushing us toward any sort of academic discovery or struggle. The third project was much better, although many students felt too much emphasis was placed on site--we did landscape design for three weeks and then a hurried building design in about two days, resulting in developed site plans that reflected improvement in considering different approaches to site but not any progress in connecting building to site.",
    "You have no choice. Good Luck.",
    "obviously you have to take it. the course is somewhat in flux so it's hard to provide a description that will hold true for next year. what will likely remain, though, is the emphasis on site\/context in the design process. first semester focuses on formal principles-- design in a vacuum, a top-down approach emphasizing grand ideas. second semester looks quite literally at the ground out of which buildings arise; research and analysis lead to form-- or, at least, lead to the strategies which lead to form. representation also played a very important role our term... usually to the detriment of physical construction.",
    "Yes, but you have to know that you cannot depend on reviews. You have to make decisions by yourself.",
    "As the second junior studio, ARCH251 does a good job of introducing the concept of site on a macro and micro scales through the three assignments. However, the over-emphasis on urban design rather than design itself is sometimes less effective.",
    "If you have gotten through the first semester studio and are reading this review then you are already committed and there is really not much advice to give you. Do your best to think happy thoughts and remember Emmanuel's class when things get rough.",
    "Only take this course if you are an Architecture major. The professors have been switching up the curriculum in the past so I\u0092m not sure if you will have the same syllabus. My year the class took more of an urban studies approach to architecture different from most of the architecture studios I had taken in the past. In addition much of the drawing was also done on the computer."
