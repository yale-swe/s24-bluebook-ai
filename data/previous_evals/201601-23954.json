    "A general overview of contemporary Africa and recent history. Would highly recommend for someone in need of a social science credit, I took this as an MCDB major and it ended up being my least stressful class, which was a big relief as I had no idea what to expect. Not much work at all and overall pretty engaging discussions with the right classmates.",
    "Take it! Not much work and a lot to learn!",
    "I highly recommend the course.",
    "AFST 217 is an interesting introductory course to contemporary issues facing the African continent. I would recommend this class to students who seek to engage in critical thought regarding the African continent. Much of the learning for this class takes place during the paper assignments on topics of your own choosing. These papers were the best means through which I grasped issues on the continent."
