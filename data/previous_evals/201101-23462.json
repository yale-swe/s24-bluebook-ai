    "I am glad we have a course on this important and interesting topic, but it has a lot of room for improvement. The whole semester long course included only 7 lectures by the instructor plus one guest lecture. The professor states in the beginning of the course that because this is a graduate school class, the learning should be self motivated and she is just there to guide us with some lectures. I initially appreciated this attitude, but later realized that it is mostly an excuse not to put a lot of effort into teaching us. The midterm is an Epi study critique, a la Tong's assignments in Environmental Epi, and the final is a study grant proposal. These assignments are good Epi exercises, but do not require you to know anything about hormones. (I would even suggest that Epi be a pre-req for this course.)",
    "This course was not my very best experience.I am more interested in reproductive health, and had much higher expectations for this field. Very little of this subject was a part of the course. Endocrine disruptors and birth defects was not even mentioned.",
    "I think this course focuses on a very interesting topic, and the lectures were very clear and informative. The overall organization of the course was also excellent. My one suggestion would be that the course might be more interactive. For example, students could practice for the midterm and gain experience critiquing scientific articles by answering questions in class, in a discussion format. This might help break up the lecture portion of the course a bit, especially since it is almost 2 hours long."

    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Yawei is very nice and does her best to be responsive to students in class. She does not hold office hours, but encourages students to make appointments to stop by. She is the type of professor who is clearly teaching only because she is required to but prefers and prioritizes her research.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Prof Zhang was always very welcoming to the students.The individual sessions were really useful.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0Very Kind.",
    "Instructor: Yawei Zhang \u00a0The instructor of the course is extremely knowledgeable about this subject, and able to talk about her personal research efforts in addition to the work of others. Her lectures were well organized and very clear, though making more space for students to participate and practice articulating the issues and critiquing studies might be considered as potential ways of improving the course in the future."

   "comments": [
    "This course requires very little work. A good second-year second-semester course when you really need to be working on your thesis, not on your classes. If you are in the MPH program and know your Epi, this class is very easy. If you don't have any Epi background, then you will probably have to put more effort into it since all of the assignments are Epi based. If you really want to learn about environmental hormones, then prepare to be self-motivated and put the work in on your own time."
