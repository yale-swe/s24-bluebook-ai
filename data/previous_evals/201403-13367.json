    "This was an excellent course. The readings were always fascinating, and I liked how they were from such a diverse range of cultures and time periods. The mandatory reading responses made us really think about the readings, and ensured that our seminar discussions would be productive. And honestly, the discussions that we had in this course were some of the best of any seminar that I've taken. Everyone was so engaged and passionate and intelligent, and Prof. De did an excellent job of guiding the discussion so that it flowed naturally and still addressed the main themes that we were meant to learn. My whole perspective on and appreciation of the field of law has been entirely changed by my experience -- I definitely looked forward to every class! Truly an amazing course. Beware though -- it is a lot of work (lots of reading and a 2-3 page mini-essay every week, and then a 15-page final paper).",
    "Take this course if you like talking about history AND the law, but not if you ONLY like talking about the law. It's a fantastic seminar -- well organized, quick, and interesting -- but it isn't a poli sci course. The professor shuts down discussion of philosophical and ethical issues pretty quickly in favor of the \"hard history.\" You'll also get more personal attention from Professor De than you would from most other history instructors. He takes his class seriously, and takes the students in it seriously as well.",
    "Not really.",
    "I would definitely recommend another student to take this class because it is so interesting.",
    "Yes, take this course! The readings surprised me - a lot of them are dry, but some are very odd and funny. You'll actually want to read all of them, if you have the time. Prof. De is great too; very nice and very knowledgeable. The discussions can digress sometimes though - that's both good and bad depending on the topic we are talking about.",
    "This was a unique and fantastic course that served as a comprehensive introduction into the study of legal history, a fascinating discipline and one that appears not to have been taught in Yale College until this course. While this was a history seminar and most of the class were History majors, Professor De admitted students from other backgrounds, such as law and Political Science, into the course, which allowed for highly interesting normative discussions and debates that complemented our insights into legal history. The course culminates in a legal history research paper, which allows students to work with the tools and processes of an actual legal historian. Definitely take it if it is offered again.",
    "Absolutely - made me think about how the law works in a whole new way!",
    "This was a really great class. A broad approach to issues of law from a historical perspective. Highly recommended.",
    "This is a class that requires you to really be serious about it -- you will not get anything out of law & history if you don't do the readings and listen\/participate in section. And you must be at least somewhat interested in the concept of law. If you are willing to make the effort, though, it's SO valuable and you'll get to read really amazing parts of history that you've probably never thought of and discuss them in very poignant & relevant\/fascinating lights.",
    "An excellent course. This class fills a gap in the history department's offerings, and I would encourage everyone to take it. There is no one focus of the course other than the law itself and its multiple iterations across cultures, regions and time periods, and that means that everyone will find something familiar, unfamiliar and fascinating about the readings for each week.",
    "I would definitely recommend it -- to avoid getting bogged down in the readings, choose one or two and do them very carefully."
