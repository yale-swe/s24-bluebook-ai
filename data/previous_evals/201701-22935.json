   "comments": [
    "The course was the second part in a sequential on statistics and quantitative methods. It was helpful to talk about various methods (regression, matching, etc) and their strengths and weaknesses.",
    "I got a very good sense of the main quantitative techniques in political science and the assumptions that underpin them. It was also nice to have more almost philosophy of science-type discussions throughout. I particularly liked the opening lecture's smoking discussion on how one of the important skills for scientists is to learn when to believe even in the absence of watertight evidence. (It would have been nice to return to that theme a little more in the later parts of the course, where the focus was again very much on how and what *not* to believe.)",
    "I better understood how causal inference and research designs function in the context of potential outcomes.",
    "I developed a clear understanding of statistical and theoretical foundations relevant to political science analysis now.",
    "Causal inference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, longitudinal analysis, with a hint of philosophy and sociology of science.",
    "I learned about the theoretical justifications for much of the mathematical stuff I had come across in scholarly work - it allowed me to understand existing work better while providing me with the tools to start thinking about how to do research of my own in a principled manner.",
    "During this course, I learnt about topics including missing data, causal inference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity design, and longitudinal data.",
    "I received a great overview on different methods for causal inference.",
    "Concepts and computation related to: missing data, causal inference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, fuzzy regression discontinuity, etc. How to identify different types of quantitative research methods in political science research. How to evaluate the usefulness\/appropriateness of different types of statistical methods (and whether they match onto substance).",
    "I gained an understanding of various approaches to causal inference, and I think most importantly, the assumptions that undergird them.",
    "This was a great course in demystifying the more intimidating aspects of statistics, as well as cogently and clearly laying out the intuition behind commonly used techniques.",
    "Learned a great deal about core concepts and mechanics of causal inference using statistics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The updated slower pace was helpful. The course could be improved with more worked examples in class.",
    "It was a good course that did all the basic things well, and the instructor responded to student feedback. The main point of improvement, especially compared to 500, was that the class and the sections sometimes did not really overlap or complement each other.",
    "I think it would be useful, particularly for the first half of the course, if there were slides. Not so much for the material (to which we had great access), but to make sure that the lectures are organized. There were many times where we got distracted and the main points of the lectures seemed forgotten about.",
    "The strength of the course was the intuitive and approachable way the instructor presented the material. It could be improved by more problem sets.",
    "Difficult to strike a balance between students who get the material and those who are struggling. Sometimes the lectures would be too slow for some or too fast for others, though Peter does a great job catering to different learning needs.",
    "Course was oriented around maximizing learning instead of maximizing assignments - was a refreshing change. The ability to redo exam questions at home really drilled in core concepts. Instructors emphasized the integration of quantitative and qualitative methods. The slides worked well, flipped classroom experiment from the beginning not so much. But Peter was able to understand and adapt to student requirements well. The assignments were returned to us much later than we submitted them - by then, I had sometimes forgotten what I had written and why, which hindered full learning, even though the feedback when provided was good. The assignments were too concentrated towards the end of the semester where the number of problem sets in the last 4-5 weeks of the course were the same as the number in the first 10 weeks. While we had been informed that the course picks up later over the semester, the spreading out of assignments would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths of the course: (i) It covered the concepts especially causal inference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity design very well. (ii) Adequate time was spent on each concept to ensure that we were learning it thoroughly. (iii) The problem sets were very helpful to understand how to apply the concepts we learnt. (iv) The opportunity to re-do at least part of the in-class exams and the take-home component of these exams, was especially conducive to learning. I think the course could be further improved through: (i) More timely feedback on problem sets. (ii) More practice - either through more problem sets or other practice material.",
    "Peter is incredibly smart and kind, and he tried to first use a workshop based approach, then adapted it more to slides. He listened to feedback and was very approachable about everything. His slides were amazing too.",
    "The content and organization of the syllabus was fine although it seemed we covered fewer topics than may be typical for this course. The primary weaknesses were related to the instructor and style of instruction (as described below).",
    "Strengths: Very strong on teaching concepts and reviewing the core components in class. I really appreciated the discussion-based component, and found the lecture slides very helpful for reviewing. Weaknesses: Class sessions frequently got off topic or meandered slightly. I did not always feel prepared for the problem sets, even if I did find them helpful later on. One other thing I might have appreciated was a closer attempt to tie in what we were learning with using R to address relevant problems.",
    "A bit chaotic in the beginning, but Peter was very attentive to student feedback and corrected course immediately.",
    "Strengths: clear transition from the previous semester's quantitative methods course; focus on core concepts was crucial as I hadn't had any engagement with quantitative methods previously; rigorous engagement in the second half of the semester Weaknesses: clearer, more concrete syllabus would have been helpful; delay in getting grades on assignments; dearth of problem sets limited ability of students to practice and learn independently"

   "comments": [
    "Great course to set you up to do quantitative research or to evaluate others' research methods.",
    "Yes, it's a very good way to become a critical consumer of the vast majority of quantitative political science work. Especially for students with less of a technical background, the course is very good for becoming literate in statistics.",
    "I think this course could be great, with a few adjustments (more organization during lectures, quicker feedback on problem sets). The framing of the material is particularly useful for empirical research in political science.",
    "Yes, anyone who is in the social sciences.",
    "Peter is a delight as a professor and genuinely invested in teaching quantitative methods in a way that speaks to people.",
    "Definitely clarifies many of the concepts from Stats 500 and expands thought processes and considerations in doing quantitative analyses.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is a very valuable course for learning and applying concepts such as causal inference, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity design and longitudinal data. The most important skill this course teaches a student is to be able to understand and critique recent (and current) scholarly works in the political science discipline which make causal claims.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "I would recommend this class insofar as it is required if students are interested in completing the quantitative methods sequence or taking the quantitative methods field exam. The course, however, was uninspiring in many respects and the quality of instruction was problematic.",
    "I would, but with some caveats. I think it's absolutely necessary if one wants to understand quantitative approaches to social science, but for students who do not plan to be especially quantitative, they should be prepared to be confused by certain disorganized and\/or seemingly extraneous portions of the class. I would highly recommend the conceptual component of the class.",
    "Definitely. A crucial course for every student--and not just Political Science PhDs! Anyone who might read papers that include anything quantitative should take this course.",
    "It's essential for anyone hoping to use quantitative methods in their own research."
