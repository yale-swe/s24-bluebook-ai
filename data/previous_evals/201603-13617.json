   "comments": [
    "I felt that this class helped me to develop a better understanding of storytelling in general but especially the craft of screenwriting.",
    "I learned how to craft a screenplay and how to employ the fundamental aspects of storytelling in telling this screenplay. I also learned about how to navigate the business of screenwriting and film.",
    "I learned various screenwriting skills, a ton of screenwriting terminology, and some insider's knowledge on the field.",
    "Learned the fundamental elements of a good movie, how to structure a screenplay, and really helpful professional advice on how to sell your screenplay!",
    "I came in not knowing how to write a screenplay, left writing like a pro. Brian Price knows what he's doing.",
    "This was my first screenwriting course, so I learned quite a bit. Of course I read my first screenplay, and I wrote the first 15 pages of my first screenplay as well. On top of that, I gained an intuition for the structures of films in general and the formatting for screenplays.",
    "The ins and outs of screenwritingeverything from craft to all the preparation necessary before putting pencil to paper. In general, the course is a reflection on contemporary storytelling in the context of Aristotle's Poetics. Some valuable talk of the business of screenwriting concludes the course.",
    "This class gave me a simple yet sophisticated understanding of story, and plenty of screenwriting skills and tips.",
    "I found this to be a terrific course. One not only comes away with an understanding of screenwriting but also the beauty and foundations of storytelling on a much larger degree. One knows the intricacies of what makes a good story and how to apply it to the most current medium of storytelling, screenwriting. In addition, the philosophical underpinnings of why we enjoy stories is discussed to increase one's knowledge. In addition one is able to walk out of the class with the structure and beginnings of a screenplay.",
    "This course provided an effective survey of storytelling generally and screenwriting specifically. I appreciated using Aristotles Poetics as a guide for the course.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about dramatic theory, the art of storytelling, and the strategies for converting unshaped creative energy into concrete story ideas and, ultimately, a screenplay. I also gained fresh insights about the culture and operation of the filmmaking\/screenwriting world. Professor Prices decades of professional experience provided ample insights and stories."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great insight from Professor Price. I would've liked to be able to write more of a screenplay or be able to try out different screenwriting ideas.",
    "I thought Professor Price was very high-energy and engaging. I really wish that there was more content packed into the class though. It was an easy fifth class, but sometimes I felt like I wasn't learning as much as I would like. This is especially true in regards to the couple classes that we spent largely watching a movie.",
    "The course was absolutely wonderful. I thought it was at its strongest when we were discussing the principles of screenwriting, and specific examples from movies. I would have loved to have had a bit more opportunity to read and critique other people's scripts. To make room for that, I think perhaps some time could be shifted from the discussions about Aristotle in the beginning of the course. But overall the class was fantastic, and I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to learn from Professor Price.",
    "This course was clearly intended to be low-stress. I liked that. I liked that a lot. However, I would have been fine with more reading, especially screenplays (or even excerpts from screenplays) each week. The main weakness of the course was that a lot of students (and me!) admitted to feeling stuck with their choice of original screenplay from early on in the course. I wish we could have had more of a chance to brainstorm ideas or dig deep enough into multiple ideas at once to compare them. For instance, a two-page treatment for three different loglines wouldn't have been too insane an assignment and would have allowed students to look deeper into movie ideas.",
    "This course is exceptional in construction. The stepped approach allows students to give great attention to the parts that amount to a greater whole.",
    "The strengths of the course are that it is a seminar which allows one to truly engage with the material and the professor along with having their material workshopped. There are no weaknesses to the course.",
    "Strengths: focus on storytelling and plot\/characters was very helpful Weakness: perhaps spending a bit more time on the mechanics of screenwriting, e.g. how to write good dialogue, how to pace and balance dialogue and description, etc. would be helpful",
    "Strengths: -I thought the syllabus was incredibly well-structured, starting with the basics of dramatic theory and story structure and then proceeding seamlessly from there. I also appreciated that Professor Price started each class by recapping what was covered during the previous session. It is a small thing, but it makes a big difference. -The classes were well-paced. Professor Price did a nice job of balancing the need to follow his lesson plan with the natural tendency of discussions to take on a mind of their own. -I appreciated the thorough and thoughtful feedback on every assignment. Areas for Improvement: -I wish we had an opportunity to watch and analyze a few more films. I know class time is limited, but perhaps there is a way to weave in a few more film analyses. -I wish our class had developed a stronger sense of comradery. To encourage this, it might be nice to have a class dinner during one of the early weeks of the semester; we could even see a film ahead of time at a nearby cinema and then discuss it over our meal. In addition, for those interested and able to attend, it might be fun to visit a writers room and\/or film set in NYC. Possibilities abound."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this class provides a very solid framework for learning the art and craft of screenwriting. Brian Price is a very strong writing teacher.",
    "Absolutely. It was my favorite class I've taken so far. It was a lot of fun and very interesting.",
    "I would recommend it to people who want a very easy fifth class and want to pick up some screenwriting knowledge.",
    "If you get the chance to take this course, you should absolutely take it!",
    "YES! This class was fun, did not require a lot of work, and really is a great crash course in learning how to write a screenplay. I had never done it before this but I feel so much more confident in my abilities and really enjoyed the opportunities to share my work with other classmates, received really insightful feedback, and get the chance to see other people's work.",
    "Don't take this course if you don't like amazing classes that you'll forward to going to each week",
    "Not sure if this will be offered again, but if it is, it's certainly an enjoyable and low-stress course. You kind of get out what you put in (although this is true for most courses, it's especially true for this one), so if you don't engage with your choice of screenplay very well you will likely be disgruntled and underwhelmed. However, if you're excited enough about film to be excited about this course, you'll probably be excited enough to put in enough effort to get a lot out!",
    "Even if you don't anticipate entering the film industry as a profession, you will learn the indispensable craft of telling a good story and, with Brian at the helm, from an excellent human being.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in screenwriting -- I've taken several courses in screenwriting before, and this was probably the best. Lots of interesting and relevant assignments, and a fun atmosphere.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student as storytelling is such an important aspect to life in many different fields whether one pursues screenwriting or not.",
    "Yes! If youre interested in screenwriting at all - regardless of how much background you have - this class is fun and accessible introduction to screenwriting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. If youre at all interested in screenwriting and storytelling, this is a must take class. In short, the CSEJ 350 teaches you how to convert unshaped creative energy into concrete story ideas and, ultimately, a screenplay. The course begins with an overview of the core elements of dramatic theory (as outlined in Aristotles Poetics) and then shifts to the modern craft of screenwritingscene-o-grams, character bios, beat sheets, etc. Through all of this, the course is extremely well structured and flows seamlessly from one week to the next. In addition, Professor Price is a total gem. Along with his impressive command of the subject matter, he is sharp, witty, charismatic, affable, and attentive. He leads well-paced and engaging classes and provides thorough feedback on every assignment. He also isnt a harsh grader, which gives students the room and confidence to take creative risks. As the cherry on top, Professor Prices decades of experience in the screenwriting industry provides valuable real-world perspectiveand no shortage of entertaining stories. In sum, definitely take this class!"
