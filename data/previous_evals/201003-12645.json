   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in History and art. The workload is very manageable. It is imperative that you get a good and interesting TA, if you don't, the class could be a completely different experience.",
    "yes. I enjoyed the pace and coverage of the class. It gave you a broad survey of art throughout a large part of human history, as well as giving you a chance to personalize some of your experience with the pieces.",
    "An easy survey class with a decent amount of reading. I would recommend it to students genuinely interested in the subject. If you are not interested, you will not do any work, and the class will become tougher than it has to be.",
    "HSAR 112 is great! Take it! You learn about an expansive period in the history of art and it is fascinating to watch art evolve over time and appropriate influence from the past.",
    "Definitely take it. Great survey course and you may really like art history.",
    "I was pretty apprehensive about taking this class at first, given the vacuum that the retirement of Scully left behind. However, I had fallen in love with the class and the professors by the end of the first lecture. I definitely recommend it!",
    "Yes i would recommend it. If you like painting and architecture, take this class.",
    "Yes, but a warning: you will have memorize literally hundreds of images for the exams. It's not easy.",
    "It is a great survey course in art history. I wouldn't leave Yale without taking it.",
    "I would recommend it! This was the first time this pair of professors has taught the course, and they seemed a bit rusty, but they are both very knowledgeable and I learned a lot from the course. Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in art history or the formation of western culture.",
    "It was an interesting class with a nice visual aspect. It was hard to memorize all the information about the pieces of art for the finals though.",
    "I loved this class. It covers a wide range of topics in art history, and the information is presented in an interesting way. It definitely helps that the Professors were very enthusiastic about the material, helping me understand this era of art in a completely new way. The textbook is also a good supplement to the class, and pretty easy to read.",
    "This course is an excellent survey of art history for both art majors and people of other majors who simply want to learn more about art. The work load is reasonable, and the lectures are quite interesting.",
    "History of Art is great because it broadens your understanding of the visual realm and how to analyze it.",
    "This year was a little rough, as it was the first after Professor Sculley retired. Professor Gaiffman was interesting and pretty smooth, while Professor Jung followed the textbook a little tooreligiously (you almost didn't need to come to class). The final was significantly harder than the midterm (if you're thinking of starting it CR\/D and switching) but the workload was light and what you come away with is well worth it. If you're a HSAR major, if you plan on traveling at all in your lifetime, or if you're vaguely interested in art, take this one and Nemerov's in the Spring - basically, get cultured.",
    "Very great course, everyone should take it before they graduate. Make sure you have time to devote to it because the midterm and final need a lot of memorizing.",
    "Take it if you are willing to put a little more into the course than it requires. The more you put into the course, the more you will get out. It's an easy class to slack in and not reap the benefits.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to any student who is looking to acquire a basic knowledge of art history.",
    "History of Art 112 was an awesome class! It wasn't stressful (only 2 papers, a midterm and a final) and I never dreaded going. The only tough thing is memorizing the ID for every slide for the tests but other than that, the point of the class is to teach you about art history, not to overwhelm you with work or trick you on tests. All in all, if you are interested in art history, I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes! I learned so much about art history and am absolutely in love with the art we studied in class. Professor Gaifman is a very passionate lecturer, and Professor Jung is exceptionally eloquent. I enjoyed all of the lectures. Take this class if you want to be a better viewer next time you go to the Met.",
    "Take this class! If you're at all interested in art history, or think you might be, just do it. The lectures are interesting and it's not a huge amount of work if you keep up with the reading. Also, it really changes the way you look at the world around you-- especially with the architecture portion of the course.",
    "Yes, this class will give a broad overview of art from prehistoric stone carvings to gothic cathedrals, etc. It was very interesting to listen to the lectures and sections were fun.",
    "I wanted to branch out from the social sciences before I graduate, so I took this course as a good way to acquaint myself with a subject I knew relatively little about (and knock off a humanities credit as well). If you just want a humanities credit or a filler course, do not take this; you need to put in A LOT of work into this class both to really enrich yourself and get a good grade as well. That being said, if you're potentially interested in the material, give it a try. You'll learn a lot, and it's a different kind of class experience from most Yale courses. In the end, I'm glad I took it, and am considering rounding off my survey of the Western art world by taking the second half of the HSAR survey course.",
    "Lots of memorizing--sometimes you may feel that it is nothing more than that, because the lectures are not very exhilarating. The papers are easy to do well on, as long as you are very creative and clear. Take History of Art 112 if you want to learn more about art.",
    "Very interesting and fun introduction to art history",
    "It is a great class, I would definitely recommend it if you wish to know a brief overview of prehistorical to renaissance art, or if you are interested in one of the cultures the class covers. Studying for the exams may seem daunting, but other than that the workload is very light.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Both professors are engaging lecturers and make showing up to class worthwhile. Although I took it Credit\/D\/Fail, I acquired some useful skills from this class. It enhanced my appreciation for art in a way that I couldn't have done on my own. I am reminded of the value of this class when walking around campus. Yale's resources, when it comes to art, are incredible. If for no other reason, take this class as a way to fully appreciate your surroundings. The gothic architecture is just that much better. Oh yes, and the workload of this course isn't terrible either."
