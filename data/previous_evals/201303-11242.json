   "comments": [
    "It has intense readings. Yes. For those who really like history.",
    "The title Historical and Political Thought may seem ambiguous, but that's kinda exactly what the class is. We read historians' histories (Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus) and philosophers' (Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas) political writings. It centers around questions like: what is the natural evolution of the state, what is religion's role in the state, what is the best constitution\/government, what is the value of history, etc... In the process, you learn much of Persian, Greek, and Roman history. Great class.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to other students. I believe that reading literature from the past enables us to understand how the ideas and literature of our own time. When else in your life will you have the luxury of devoting the bulk of your time to study of the classics? The negative side of DS can best be described by a metaphor: I love chocolate cake, but I don't love eating 10 of them at once. Sometimes, the amount of reading assigned is so great that it's hard to enjoy it. Nevertheless, I think it's really worthwhile to take DS and get a strong foundation before continuing your studies at Yale. Being in tiny seminars with a bunch of students who chose and want to be there is amazing.That said, first semester H&P sometimes feels like an amorphous mish-mash of everything that doesn't fit in the other two DS courses. The most fun parts come from discussion of historiography, the least fun when avoiding talking about the philosophy that seems key to some of the texts because it isn't philosophy class. Still, I think first semester H&P is necessary to one's understudying of political thought going into second semester.",
    "Steven Smith is an absolute legend, he's always surprising in class. He loves bringing in texts we haven't read for the course (Hobbes, Machiavelli, Lincoln) and asking us to respond in light of what we read, which makes for interesting section discussions that usually diverge significantly from what is covered in lecture. Smith will ensure that you improve on every paper.",
    "I would recommend it. My ideas on political philosophy and history changed infinitely. I think anyone who is interested in getting a knowledge base of how the world functions must take this class.",
    "I would recommend DS History and Politics if you are interested in classical political philosophy but don't have much background. Don't expect to learn much history, per se. Though you do become familiar with the broad outlines of Greek and Roman history, this is not the focus of the course. Instead, it is a course about ideas. Professor Smith is very well-read and knowledgeable, but he doesn't take the kind of personal interest in his students as some of the other professors. His grading is harsh, but then again, so is the grading of most of the H+P section leaders. At times, it seems like he is just going off his notes from previous years and has not read the text recently. Overall, you'll learn a lot from him, but don't expect to forge that great student-professor relationship you hear about from DSers.",
    "DS H&P, as anyone will tell you, is not a history class. Sometimes it suffers from a lack of historical background, but overall, it is an interesting syllabus that will take you through Ancient and Medieval political philosophy, as well as a few different approaches to writing history. This is probably the weakest of the three DS classes, but it is still worthwhile, and you will come out with something of a working knowledge of politics in the Ancient world.Professor Smith is usually a decent section leader, but sometimes he will come to class to argue a thesis, or occasionally ask questions that lead the conversation nowhere. But overall, a good class. You'll be glad you took it.",
    "I would highly recommend it. This is, however, not a History and Politics course and as such should not be advertised as one. This course is Historical and Political thought. You will learn a lot of history, but this course should not be thought of as a history course. It focuses far more on historiography and how we think about history and politics. This is, of course, much needed in our present discourse, and it would be helpful if more people took this course.",
    "Historical and Political Thought was an immensely rewarding class. I had read noneof the works before beginning the class, and was skeptical that I would find the material interesting, but the works covered really lent themselves to some of the best discussions I've had so far at Yale. H&P has a lot of reading, so be prepared to skim where necessary, but DS' chronological, seminar-style progression through the works was a perfect fit for the material covered in this class.",
    "I would recommend the course. I think it gave me a new way of looking at history, and it was incredibly gratifying to look back at everything we read and see the threads that link all of the works. We covered a lot this term, and I loved seeing all of it come together. One thing I would warn prospective students of, however, is that the course focused a lot more on political thought and historiography than on history itself. I certainly wouldn't recommend going into this course expecting it to be a history course because that mindset is not conducive to getting a lot out of H&P."
