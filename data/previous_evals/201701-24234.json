   "comments": [
    "I developed strong writing skills and critical thinking.",
    "This course taught me a tremendous amount about playwriting, musical theater writing, storytelling, and life in general. Each week, I felt so enriched by Marsha's class and I am overjoyed that I was able to spend an entire semester learning from her.",
    "Not only did I learn about the nature of the musical theater industry from an industry professional herself, I also gained so many insights about how to live my best life as a theater artist, and as a person who oftentimes gets so wrapped up in daily life that I forget to ask myself questions such as what collaborations in your life have been successful and why? and how can you know when a project is not worth your time? I learned that every good musical is about trouble in the family business.",
    "Grasp of the structure of musicals, important elements of plot and form, what works and doesn't work in collaboration, choosing a project, and storytelling.",
    "I learned a lot about how musicals work and why they are so effective. I also learned a lot of practical tools that are useful to being successful as a writer.",
    "This was an interesting course in that while I didn't actually write a libretto, as the title would suggest, but I learned exactly how you would go about writing one. It was fascinating and really wonderful to learn from an industry professional."

   "comments": [
    "This class is perfect for students who want to go into the field of musical theatre.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. I don't have too many complaints.",
    "Marsha Norman is a fabulous, caring, and wonderful instructor. She definitely makes the course what it is; our discussions were typically engaging and lively. A part of me would want to see the course incorporate some more group assignments throughout the semester, so that we can implement what we are learning, but so much of this courses strength is how it relies on student\/Marsha Norman engagement to direct the conversation.",
    "Marsha Norman is the strength of this course--so knowledgable and skilled at communicating what she knows.",
    "This was a really great course- the only thing I think could have improved it would be more regular writing exercises to practice what we talk about in class."

   "comments": [
    "An incredible chance to learn about the intricacies and inner workings of musical making from one of the preeminent musical makers. Marsha is an incredibly generous and genuinely inspiring teacher.",
    "This class is hands down the best class at Yale and trust me I've taken class in so many departments. The professor is wonderful. The class is fun and engaging and its a happy but smart group of people in that room with you.",
    "If you get in, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's pretty much a Master's Tea each week with one of the most prolific, prestigious playwrights and storytellers in the country. Marsha is the best person you'll ever meet. I can't possibly recommend this class more.",
    "Absolutely! If you have the chance to be in this class, take it. I think someone on the student evaluations described the course as therapy with Marsha Norman, and while its accurate, this class is therapy specifically for musical theater\/theater artists in the best way. You will learn as much about yourself as you will about the secrets of great American musicals.",
    "This course was incredible--I learned so much about musical theater as an art form, -'d about life.",
    "Would definitely recommend taking this course if taught by Marsha Norman. She is a joy and a privilege for any artist to study with, regardless of whether you see yourself as a playwright. If you love musicals and storytelling in some medium, there is so much to learn from this class.",
    "Y E S TAKE IT",
    "This course is much more of weekly hangout with Marsha Norman than an actual course. That being said, it's an excellent time and she's a gem - I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Really, you need at least some background in musical theater if you want to be able to participate in class discussions. Also, just a heads up: you won't actually write a libretto in this course. You'll learn HOW to write one theoretically, and get tons of super valuable tips and information about how to work in the professional world of libretto writing. This is a really valuable, holistic course about collaboration, communicating with an audience, and finding an artistic, meaningful voice in heavily corporatized industry. If you can get in, take it. Not much work, and Marsha Norman is someone you must know. She's wonderful and class discussions are great."
