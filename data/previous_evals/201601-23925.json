    "Since it was the first year, the course was rather disorganized, and the primary \"takeaway\" points were unclear. We had some interesting visitors, but we had limited time to hear from them or to ask them questions since students were presenting most of the time. I think presenting on one thing (like one trial, paper, or case study) would be better so we can really discuss it fully with the visitor instead of rushing through three presentations. The final project is a good idea in theory, but I didn't think it was an appropriate topic for this class. If you look on the site, most Gates Grand Challenges projects involve inventing new biomedical technology like a new diagnostic test or a new medication. Both of the two examples that were sent to the class were on inventing new diagnostics. The class is almost all MDs and PhDs who don't have the technical\/lab skills to come up with a project like this. As a result, the final project ideas all aimed for an odd mix of innovation and research and didn't succeed on either front. Another project, like a typical NIH research grant or even a literature review, would teach more relevant skills. The flow of the class was also awkward, so that could be improved: almost every week, the first 2 presentations took longer than planned, then the 3rd presentation would be rushed, and we'd end up running over 10-15 min.",
    "This is an exciting course that integrates all aspects of public health. I do recommend the topics to take on the current challenges in Public Health instead of historical successes (although it's important to learn from the past)",
    "Good course, potential to be fantastic course - Dr. Ko is very open to feedback, but it was a difficult course to run in its first year. I think doing the presentations in a more question and answer format will improve class participation. Sometimes it was frustrating that people did not participate in class. The class attracted great faculty\/experts on the topics - I got a great depth and breadth of information from this class and came into contact with some truly great people working at yale who I wouldn't have otherwise met. It's a shame many of the people in the course had to be there and didn't seem to put much effort into participating.",
    "Strengths: Visiting instructors from various department bringing opinions from different fields Weaknesses: Could be more tightly structured and straight to point.",
    "Very good course. The readings were well chosen and the visitors were great. I liked when we switched later in the semester and heard more from the visitors. Having the trudge through classmates' presentations during the first half of the semester was not very inspiring.",
    "This was a new course, so some of the organization seemed unstructured. I enjoyed having experts in the field as panelists every week. The class seemed rushed in a way because we tried to fit in 3 presentations per week.",
    "A very wholistic view to public health, learning about a whole variety of public health issues, lots of learning and readings. A little more organization is needed",
    "The strengths of the course are its knowledgeable instructor and the scope of the course. It also takes a contextual perspective on Public health successes and challenges. The grand challenge was a bit tangential, but allowed me to be creative and thoughtful about public health interventions and was worth it in the end."

    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Gooooooooooooooooood!",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Albert really cares about his students, and he made a point of being very available even though he's busy. He made changes to the class based on the student concerns. He wants his students to learn, and he was very helpful. The one suggestion would be to have a paid TF, instead of asking Eri to help out.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0One of the smartest\/brightest people I've met at YSPH. Takes the conversation to another level of intelligence. Respectful and insightful.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Very good - a challenging course to run, but he was very honestly open to feedback. He also gave great feedback on the Gates proposal outlines. The only thing that was frustrating was that sometimes he would cut-off students\/the guest professors because of time constraints or because of a thought he had. I think the challenge for next year will be to determine how the papers will be presented each week - the format at the end was definitely an improvement compared to the set-up in the beginning.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Albert is a excellent instructor. He asks sharp questions and really drive the students to think in public health. His teaching can be improved if his statements can be more concise and straight-forward. I believe he can be better if he focus more on the big picture, at least at the start of each lecture.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0He had very good insight on so many different topics. His teaching will be improved if he could manage time better. The class went over time most of the sessions, and presentations and discussions felt rushed at times.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable, very smart",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0knowledgeable, more interest in students rather than the professors who were invited as guests to specific topic lectures.",
    "Instructor: Albert Ko \u00a0Dr Ko is a brilliant man. He was thoughtful throughout the course. As this was his first time handling the course, it took a while for dust to settle but it was an enlightening course."

    "Weekly meetings where most of the time is spent on student presentations on a wide range of public health topics. The class is currently rather disorganized, so I probably wouldn't recommend it right now, especially if you have a background in public health. The workload is light most weeks when you only have readings to do, but it takes a lot more time when the midpoint and final papers are due and on weeks when you present (every 4 weeks or so depending on the number of students).",
    "This class is very research oriented, not what I expected.",
    "Great course - take advantage of the opportunity to come into contact with great public health people at Yale while also dealing with a very reasonable workload!",
    "Yes for someone want to get an idea of public health and know some current big issues in the field, because of how the class is composed.",
    "This class depends a lot on your classmates. Some people actively participated and had higher-quality presentations, but it can be frustrating to try to have a discussion when a large number of classmates don't seem to have even done the reading. It's definitely worth it to have a structured opportunity to meet important public health researchers at Yale and ask them questions about their work, though. So, overall, I would recommend the course.",
    "This course covers many important topics in public health that I did not know about before. You will have a great opportunity of having interesting discussions with experts in the field. You will not have a new concrete skill set coming out of the course, but will have a broader understanding of public health in general.",
    "Great learning",
    "It takes a contextual perspective on Public health successes and challenges. The grand challenge allows students to brainstorm innovative public health interventions based on the format of the Gates Grand Challenge. I would recommend."
