   "comments": [
    "Take the course only if you've taken the first lesson.",
    "One of the most effective language programs you'll likely find on a college campus. I've learned so much in such a short amount of time, and I feel very comfortable speaking the language after only one year of study. This class is truly unique.",
    "If you are really passionate about learning french then 100% take this class because it will help you do that, however if you are taking this only for a language requirement then don't take French because it is one of the most vigorous languages.",
    "This is a great class if you can really devote yourself to doing nightly homework, weekly compositions, and weekly tests. However, you learn a ton of French. While French in Action may be cheesy, you actually get really invested in it, and I was sad we didn't get to watch it all in this semester. The workload is heavy if you put it all off till the last minute, and you need to consistently study for the tests, but it is a great way to really learn the language.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are really interested in french, I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course. From what I've heard, French is one of the hardest languages at Yale, because the department expects a lot from the students, but I have enjoyed it.",
    "French 120 is a good continuation of Beginner French. The class can be difficult if you do not do your homework on a regular basis, but if you do the review exercises when they are assigned it is fairly easy to maintain a good grade in this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student"
