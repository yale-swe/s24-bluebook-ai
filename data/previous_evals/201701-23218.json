   "comments": [
    "I learned to think of how to crate a mathematical framework to understand cooperation in the real world. The class taught me a new way of thinking.",
    "A better understanding of game theory and how it relates to various concepts in psychology. Learned how to apply skills from economics to better understand and explain human behavior.",
    "Evolution of Cooperation teaches you various answers to a question I had never thought to ask before: \"How did cooperation evolve?\" By definition, cooperation is individually costly, so how did natural selection select for cooperation? There are a multitude of answers ranging from kin selection and group selection and assortment, to reciprocity and reputation concerns. Each explanation has some very cool research supporting it, but there are still unanswered questions which I think makes the topic even more interesting. Rand himself is also doing some really interesting research on it. The class looks at the evolution of cooperation through game theory. I had taken game theory 2 years ago, and didn't understand a lot of it, but this class made it easy to understand and much more interesting because it was just a tool to understand a cooler phenomena. Lastly, the second half of the class uses the game theory models to explain other interesting phenomena like heroism, religion, and bias. Overall, great class covering a lot of interesting topics, and not super hard.",
    "This class gave interesting insight into how evolutionary game theory works and how traits (like cooperativeness) can be adaptive and, thus, become pervasive in societies.",
    "Conceptual frameworks and real-world examples of cooperation",
    "I learned how to look at psychology through economic \"game theory,\" a lens that I had never thought would be applied in this manner.",
    "I learned a lot about human behavior. The class combined economics and psychology to explain cooperation and selfishness. The first half was more math and modeled based and then the second half was more analysis and psychology and looking into primates (usually humans) behavior. I now have a much better understanding what can promote or undermine cooperation.",
    "This class provided me with a language for the factors that exist in decision-making. As a result, I feel more able to identify personal and societal responses to another person or institution's actions. The class also gave me the ability to think about behavior in quantitative terms, which was exciting as a very qualitatively-oriented person!",
    "I feel like taking Game Theory after taking this class will be easy because I know so much about the prisoner's dillema and the math involved now.",
    "You're going to learn all the basics of game theory. After the midterm, everything becomes more theoretical, and it's not so mathematical. You'll have a pset once every two weeks, so that's like 5 for the semester. The psets are difficult, so start early and reach out to your TF. You'll have to attend a section for the course. Lecture slides are put up after every class, but I recommend that you still go because some of the material can be confusing. One midterm. One final during the last week of classes.",
    "I have never taken a psych class before so I found the material very interesting",
    "Learned a lot about several fields (econ, psych, biol) and looked at ways to quantitatively analyze games and situations.",
    "We learned the game theoretical basis for cooperation and how different mechanism of evolution might increase cooperation.",
    "I learned how to apply game theory principles and evolutionary biology ideas to human cooperation. I learned lots of example scenarios and results.",
    "This was one of he very first psych classes I have taken at Yale that has provided me with a mathematical understanding of how behavioral theory works. Unlike other psych classes, I felt as though I had a true understanding of the logic behind each theory. Additionally this class gave me the tools to reason through different types of problems, both abstract and those relating to real life instances. Overall a really cool new way to approach a psych class",
    "I gained insight into many of the theories explaining how cooperation may have evolved in humans. I also learned more about the valuable theoretical tool of game theory, as well as the experimental evidence surrounding cooperation in humans and non-human primates. This course has given me a new lens with which to look at cooperation and collaboration. Additionally, it has helped provide me with knowledge of many psychological phenomenon and familiarity with research methods in the field of psychology.",
    "Learned about economic game theory within the frame of psychology, learned more about motivating behaviors behind human interactions (how and why people cooperation\/act the way they do)",
    "In taking this class, I learned the basics of game theory--the frameworks, equilibria, and evolutionary dynamics of standard economic games. On top of this conceptual foundation, the course provided insight into how human cooperation can be described in game theoretic terms.",
    "I had previously taken game theory, but this course really connected those concepts to group psychology and evolutionary theory. I gained quantitative and qualitative skills used to analyze different situations and draw conclusions about social interactions. I also learned a great deal about development of cooperation and social norms on both and individual and group scale, from both evolutionary and sociocultural perspectives.",
    "I learned how game theory can be used at a predictive tool for psychology and how experts think about coordination and the problems surrounding that seemingly simple task.",
    "A deep understanding of the types of lab experiments that have contributed to this field, especially the decisionmaking games. Also a broad picture of the evolution of cooperation, as well as many smaller contributing theories, and a better understanding overall of human intelligence and development. Fantastic class",
    "Great class! You get a full introduction to game theory and social dilemmas as well as insight into how these theoretical discussions and tools have been used by\/explored in experimental psychology.",
    "It was a good overview of the psychology of evolution."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class was well taught and engaging. I felt that Professor Rand was a great instructor and that the lectures were well organized.",
    "This class a pretty well organized and the material kept building off of previous information really well.",
    "Strengths I liked how it was split into 2 halves, with the first half covering the game theoretic models and the 2nd half applying the models to real world situations. Both were equally interesting, and each would have been incomplete without the other. Grading scheme: The 5 problem sets and 2 midterms were good checkins to see if I was really understanding the material, but not overwhelming at all. Professor Rand was awesome, and kept lecture fun. I always looked forward to going. Weaknesses Sections weren't always super helpful. The games we played in them were somewhat fun though.",
    "The strength of this course was how interesting the theoretical models of game theoretical evolution were. The weakness was the psychology studies discussed for most of the second half of the course.",
    "Fascinating course, can be a bit confusing at times with the game theory stuff",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses; this was honestly one of the best courses I took at Yale",
    "PSETs were not reflective of the exam\/felt a bit underprepared going in. Overall, the topics were very interesting and new, but the sections could have been spent talking about challenging problems a bit more (like instead of grappling with applying concepts from class during an exam where there is time pressure, it would have been much more useful to talk it through in section). Generally really enjoyed the professor and the content!",
    "This was an excellent and unique class, not too much needs to be changed. Maybe more mathematical examples of game theory so that everyone stays up to date with the material.",
    "This course had a very manageable workload. It had 5 psets and interesting and short readings. We had to do reading responses for each reading but they were fun to do and helped you think about the lectures. The class went by very quick as it was 50 minutes and section helped to unpack the lecture and discuss the readings. Professor Rand was amazing. He was a great lecture - very interactive, funny, and informative. He clearly knew a ton on the topic. My one improvement would be to unpack the psets after we submitted them and talk about the game they were based on and the concepts involved",
    "I found that lectures were sometimes so fast-paced as to be difficult to follow, but the conversations, discussion sections, readings, and even P-Sets were incredibly interesting!",
    "Strengths: TFs seemed nice and willing to help. Julia was my TF, and if she is helping out with the class next year, sign up for her section! Professor Rand was a nice guy, and he knew what he was talking about. Weaknesses: Lectures are a little dry. Psets are challenging. You're expected to not finish the midterm and final during the allotted time (so strategically get your points), but that may change next year. This was the first time the course was taught, so I imagine that things will be different.",
    "I really liked how the class cover a lot of new studies",
    "The class was interesting, but the second half of the course didn't feel very structured or purposeful. It honestly could have been summarized in one class. I think it could be improved if the professor focused on more practical applications. I expected to learn a little bit about how to encourage cooperation in real life settings, but it never really came up.",
    "The course does a wonderful job of introducing complex ideas and methods to a general audience. Professor Rand is engaging and clear. This class is accessible to anyone who wishes to take it. Perhaps this is just because I am a more analytical thinker, but I think a little more material could have been fit into the course. On the other hand, I also heard of some students for whom it was still plenty difficult keeping up.",
    "Since this class was both a mathematical and theoretical based class, lectures were primarily devoted to theory while section was primarily devoted to the mathematical aspects. While this provided me the opportunity to learn both, sometimes I wished that they were a bit more integrated, especially so we could discuss\/debate theoretical aspects in section. Overall it was really good though and felt like I left the class with a solid understanding of both. Also, after studying economic games, we actually got to play them which was so cool to see how these games played out in real life situations.",
    "The course's biggest strength is Professor Rand, who clearly put a significant amount of time and effort into it. He was always well-prepared and extremely knowledgeable about the subject, and his enthusiasm for the material was contagious. Another strength of the course was its ability to bridge the gap between game theory and practical applications, connecting the theory to the real world and showing how it can be used to interpret the current state of research. One way to improve the course would be to assign one teaching fellow to grade each problem set or exam question - which could ensure consistency - rather than having each TF only correct the exams of their own students.",
    "Very clear lecture slides and problem sets that test the concepts learned in the first 2\/3 of the class, the last 1\/3 was more centered on application of the concepts\/theories we had learned very grounded in the current discoveries happening within the field of cooperation\/human interactions, I felt as though I could not have learned the material presented without this class - Dave and his team are some of the leading researchers in their field and he consistently brought new and interesting discoveries to our class meetings Additionally, both the teaching assistants and Dave were more than willing to sit down and chat with us about their research or any questions\/further information we wanted on the lectures",
    "This course was strong in that it accomplished its stated purpose: to lay the foundation of game theory and then approach it through studying cooperation. Its premise was interesting and successful. It could be improved through an extension of the applications section, and potentially a student project investigating a particular application of cooperative game theory.",
    "I really liked the grading criteria. Problem sets were very fair and for the first time at Yale I actually felt like I was learning while doing a homework assignment. Lectures were awesome - Dr. Rand is incredibly engaging and he threw in examples of his adorable twins which was great. Reading responses seemed generally pointless (a bit too freeform\/unguided) but I see the value in an easy assignment to make sure everyone read. Otherwise, no weaknesses - I loved this course!",
    "I think one weakness is how mathematical some of the problem sets appeared to be. Most people expected a survey psych course and got a problem set class that required analytical thinking. However while this might have been an issue of branding, I really think these aspects are the strengths of this course. I was able to build up a very usable model of cooperation which I will be able to use going forward. Very impressive for a low-level psych class. However, The test style is honestly a very poor assessment tool for a class that prides itself on teaching you how to do things over just memorization, having a long test with short time forces the student to rush and therefore not fully express themselves. If someone needs to figure a nuance of the question out but cannot under the time constraint then that is a problem.",
    "Strengths - lectures were awesome, very engaging. Sections were also very helpful for review purposes and often pretty fun when we played games. Problem sets were a good way to review what we had learned to prepare for exams, which were for the most part fair Weaknesses - there could have been a bit more hands on help with problem sets, though TA's were always willing to give extra help which was great. Readings were in general good, but often seemed superfluous as they were summarized in the next lecture.",
    "Strengths: The problem sets are fair, the lectures are interesting, the material is super useful Weaknesses: The exams didn't feel like they really assessed my understanding\/mastery of course material since there was so much time pressure, it seemed like each section was taught very differently, the readings were unnecessary and were never discussed in my section.",
    "It was an interesting class. A quantitative psychology class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. This course makes you think about human interactions through a mathematical lens and gives you a unique framework for looking at social decisions.",
    "Yes! Great class. Average amount of work but David Rand is great and you learn a lot of cool things!",
    "Absolutely. This class is awesome for people in any discipline. It's pretty easy and very interesting, and everyone could benefit from learning a little more about cooperation!",
    "This course has a very manageable workload and is super interesting if you like that kind of thing. Prof. Rand is super cool and has done fascinating research! Go to his office hours! He's cool. Tests and Psets are manageable and the class is interesting. Take it!",
    "Yes. Great course, interesting content, fantastic professor and TAs, workload isn't bad.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would recommend this class to another students. It's not too difficult if you attend all the lectures and sections with a willingness to learn, and you will be rewarded with a unique take on cooperation in society.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot about human behavior. The class combined economics and psychology to explain cooperation and selfishness. The first half was more math and modeled based and then the second half was more analysis and psychology and looking into primates (usually humans) behavior. I now have a much better understanding what can promote or undermine cooperation. This course had a very manageable workload. It had 5 psets and interesting and short readings.

He was a great lecture - very interactive, funny, and informative. He clearly knew a ton on the topic.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course! I learned many important skills of behavioral analysis through this class, and also found the access to current research on the topic exciting for my future.",
    "I would recommend if you're interested in game theory. It's not a gut class. You're going to have to work hard on the psets, and you need to study to do well on the midterm and final. That said, it's a doable course, and there are people that are willing to help you along the way. The lectures are taught in a logical manner, and the content isn't completely incomprehensible. It's just that the difficulty of the psets hit you out of nowhere, and you're like how did we get from lecture to this?! The TFs will help you with the homework, but you have to take initiative to reach out to them.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class for any student in any major.",
    "There is no arcane, dense textbook or long, tedious readings which is nice. Because of this, the class workload is extremely manageable. At times, however, it is difficult to grasp everything as you are learning in lecture alone, so a good TA is crucial to the course. Also if you have learned a bit of game theory before or have a keen mind for algebra, those are very helpful.",
    "It's not a must-take course, but it's not sort of interesting. Don't take it expecting to learn how to get people to cooperate with you.",
    "Definitely take this if you need the social science credit! Professor Rand is leaving after the end of the 2017-2018 academic year, so Fall 2017 will be the last time the course is offered. Take this class for the lectures; if you wouldn't come to them, then don't bother with the class. Professor Rand does an excellent job explaining course material in a logical and well organized fashion, building on tools and principles learned earlier in the course. There was one pset every two weeks and they were always pretty short, focusing on the numerical and game theory tools to come to some pretty intuitive conclusions. They make you realize why and how people tend to behave as they do in situations of social cooperation.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! Professor Rand was amazing! He was clearly well versed in the field and very excited about what he was teaching. The class in general was a very interesting mix between economics and behavioral psychology and real world phenomena, so it had aspects that spark a diverse range of interests. Overall I would say this is a very unique course with a very engaged professor, and I would highly recommend it!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who enjoys thinking about psychological phenomena both in terms of theoretical models and experimental evidence. The first half of the course was dedicated to teaching game theory and using it to model cooperation, and the second half applied these insights to recent psychological research in many different areas. The course was thought provoking, and while challenging at times, it is accessible to psychology majors and to others who are comfortable with a bit of math (no calculus) and who can finish exams quickly. The professor is always very well prepared and invested in the course, and the teaching fellows were very committed as well.",
    "Yes. I felt as though I could not have learned the material without this class (just because of how new and constantly changing the field is) - Dave and his team are some of the leading researchers and they consistently brought new and interesting discoveries to our class meetings. Would recommend in particular to psychology and economics majors",
    "If you are interested in learning about game theory through a psychologically fascinating lens, this is the course for you! Dave Rand is only teaching it next semester, and then moving to MIT, so take it while you can!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this course! It is your only opportunity to take it since Dr. Rand leaves next year, and it is one of the coolest and most unique classes I have taken at Yale. Lectures are entertaining and TFs are awesome. It combines psych with basic game theory (definitely not too challenging) and evolutionary theory. Dr. Rand is an awesome lecturer and the course is structured so that everything feels like it has a unique point to it and nothing is redundant (problem sets, sections, readings, etc). All the content is super interesting and manageable as long as you keep up with weekly assignments. I highly, highly recommend this course for anyone interested in social interactions or just a unique class at Yale",
    "This is a good course. Be warned that there is some math required but by math I mean basic high school algebra. If you are interested in psych and can handle this math this is a very valuable course it actually provides the framework for a theory of cooperation development which is worthwhile. Also, professor Rand is a very good lecturer and worth getting to know if you are at all interested in this subject.",
    "This is a fascinating course on such a specific topic and had a very reasonable amount of work. 10\/10 would recommend if you're interested in the evolution of cooperation and the reasons behind it. It is more mathy than I expected, but it was all very conceptual and logic-based, no prior knowledge of math was required.",
    "Great class! Very interesting and useful material. You gain a comprehensive understanding of game theory and the last third of the course is about how these theoretical topics and tools have been applied in experimental psychology. The problem sets are fair and the readings are short and you can usually just skim them. However, the exams are very hard.",
    "I think it was structured for people who had a background in math\/economics. If you are a psych major without a lot of quantitative coursework, this will be challenging for you. The exams have a strange format."
