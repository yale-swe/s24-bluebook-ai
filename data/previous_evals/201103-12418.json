    "I would recommend taking this class because it's a unique opportunity to work together on a class project.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Very little work, and you learn a good amount.",
    "Would summarize it as a fun and unorthodox yale course which allows you to get creative",
    "Awesome class! Literally just 2 quizzes, a peer review, and a (albeit large) final presentation. professor bolanos is such a great guy and really understanding!",
    "Great Class",
    "I would summarize it as a course that exercises your creativity. Something that has been put on hold too much at Yale. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "While this class is very easy, it frankly does not teach you much. The weekly lecture is at best a repetition of the textbook chapters (which are very disorganized), at worst an unrelated tangent. The tests and problem sets don't even require that you've read most of the book. This sounds like a good easy fifth class so far, but believe me, your time and Yale tuition are better spent elsewhere. I am an engineering major and took this class with the hope of learning how the industry works and \"inventing\" something new. I did learn a few useful concepts that I've actually seen mirrored in real companies - but these could have been taught in one hour-long class. The group project, which determines a large part of the grade, can largely be (and will most likely be) completed in two days. Pick your group carefully.",
    "If you're looking for a gut class, then take it - it can be fun and requires almost no work. But if you want to learn valuable material, don't take it.",
    "Unlike any of my other classes at Yale. Take it if you can get in.",
    "Great class. Take it, if you can get in",
    "Yes. you learn a lot of real world stuff in a very relaxed and fun evironment.",
    "Take it"
