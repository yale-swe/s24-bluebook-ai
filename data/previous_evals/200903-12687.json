   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class. You can go from being a complete idiot on modern Greek history to someone who has at least a basic grip on the recent history of this very important country.",
    "There is a normal amount of reading for a history seminar, but it can get hard to tell the difference between names and dates. I would advise keeping a timeline or chart of some sort throughout the course to help out. Konstantina is really helpful - definitely talk to her about your paper. The quiz isn't bad at all if you have done half to a majority of the the readings.",
    "The professor is very good and I would recommend it b\/c it is a good course for anyone interested in Greek history.",
    "HIST 205j covers the history of modern Greece from the fight for independence in the nineteenth century to developments at the end of the twentieth. I would absolutely recommend this class because Greece's modern history is both amazingly complex and incredibly interesting, and Professor Maragkou does a great job of making the class enjoyable and informative.",
    "Great seminar. It is very interesting and more enjoyable if you do some of the readings. The Professor doesn't ask too much from the students. As long as you try, do some of the reading each week, and put effort into your essay and small presentation, you will do very well. I definitely recommend it. Even if you have no knowledge of Greek history, it is an important period to study because it will enhance your understanding of World War II, the Cold War, the EU (especially Greek-Turkish relations). Take it!"
