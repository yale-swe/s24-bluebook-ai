   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone interested in environmental policy. Also if you want an A. Go to class though or you may have to do well on the final!",
    "A great class to take as an Econ Seminar. The exams and problem sets are graded harshly, but the material is fun to learn",
    "Econ 412 is a basic introduction to the intersection of environmental and international economics. It is boring but not wholly unpleasant, especially if you need an econ credit. The slow pace is partly a result of the structure, which is mostly textbook-based and very rudimentary, as well as all environmental, then all international, then all papers.",
    "Great senior seminar to take. You'll learn a lot but you won't have to work too hard.",
    "Good intro, not an amazing class tho.",
    "No - the class could be really great but is lackluster. That being said, super easy, so as an economics senior seminar, it's about as close to a gut as you can find.",
    "If you are interested in pursuing a career in either environmental studies, economics, or any field relating to those, I would definitely take this class. Shapiro is very intelligent. Otherwise, the course might get boring.",
    "The material in this class was relatively interesting, but the format was poor. The first half of the semester, when the class was taught by the professor, was better (albeit far too condensed and not nearly in depth enough for my liking). The second half of the class, which was filled with student presentations, was incredibly boring.",
    "Would recommend. First half is a standard Econ class; you learn a few theories and do a couple problem sets. The second half you read papers, and students present on the papers every week. Midterm and final. The whole thing is pretty boring, but if you care about environmental issues it's not so bad. The second half with the presentations is no work until you give your own. Overall pretty light workload.",
    "I would recommend Econ 412 to any ECON or EVST major. The material is extremely relevant and incredibly interesting. In addition, you get valuable experience reading and thinking critically about research papers and economic research.",
    "I would recommend taking this class to get a sense of how governments and organizations relate economic principles to real environmental problems faced by humans today.",
    "This course is ok, but not great.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. You learn a lot about empirical economics, and this is important whether you're going off to do a PhD or even entering the working world. Critical thinking is an important take-away from a liberal arts education and this class has given me the confidence to engage and critique work, even that which is done by academic heavy-weights.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in the environment. It gives a very good overview"
