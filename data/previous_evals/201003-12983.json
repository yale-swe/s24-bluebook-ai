    "Definitely take L1 french IF YOU ARE QUALIFIED FOR IT. Please don't take this course if you have prior knowledge of French and could pass L2. This puts beginner French speakers at a huge disadvantage.The main problem had to do with our instructor. Mary Ann is a very friendly person, and was always open to answering our questions. However, there were some serious flaws in her instruction of the course:1) She spoke in English for the majority of each lesson. I believe that the Capretz method is based on learning French from the context of conversation rather than direct translation, and she did just about the opposite.2) She cancelled class numerously, twice with notice the morning of.3) Our exams were not returned promptly, and we never received our grades for the last few exams (chapters 15 to 20, perhaps even for a few exams before that). At the moment, no one in the class knows what their average is.4) We were not given weekly quizzes, which was a disadvantage in terms of studying for the weekly test and the final. We were also not given any external sources of exercises.",
    "I would recommend anyone to take French 110 01. It's a very well taught entry level course.",
    "I would recommend French 110 to another student who has no previous knowledge of French and wants a quick introduction. I'd warn them that this is a very time consuming course (homework, exam every week, etc.).",
    "Fun language to learn."
