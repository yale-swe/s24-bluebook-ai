    "Easily one of the best classes I've taken in my four years here. Doug Rogers is the man: he facilitates discussions flawlessly, he's extremely knowledgeable, and he genuinely wants everyone to succeed. The case studies we read on Nigeria, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, etc. were all interesting and led to good discussions. Provided you don't start the reading on the last night, the workload's pretty manageable (weekly reading, a six-page midterm, and 16-18 page research paper due at the end of reading week). Even if you're not an anthro major \u0097 most kids in our class weren't \u0097 take this class if you have any interest in global energy and the modern world. Rogers is great, your classmates will be great, and you'll learn a ton.",
    "If you like the topic yes, but I'll caution that this is very much an anthro course so you'll be considering these topics on that level. Prof Rogers is great, the reading list is not as great, but on the whole I thought it was a solid seminar.",
    "Overall great class with a phenomenal professor who seems to really care about his students. The readings could get a bit theory heavy on occasion, but were generally decent. Mostly non-anthro majors. Workload is fairly light: a book a week some weeks, or 3-6 readings on weeks without a book. 8 page midterm paper, 16-18 page final paper. Class discussion was probably the best I've ever had in a seminar. Prof. Rogers never forced discussion, but was able to expertly guide it along.",
    "TAKE IT. Great readings, new perspectives on oil, really interesting class discussions.",
    "Very interesting course, especially given the diversity of students it attracts and the applicability of the topic. As someone with very little background, it was sometimes hard for me to participate, but I definitely feel like I learned a lot this term. Take it! Assignments: midterm paper, final paper.",
    "YES TAKE IT! I was so sad when this class ended. There are weekly readings (no reading responses, woo! But you\u0092ll want to read them because they\u0092re interesting!), a midterm essay and a final essay. Professor Rogers is awesome \u0096 he is accessible, interested in his students and knowledgeable. Most importantly, he obviously cares a lot about his course. This class was one of my favorites that I\u0092ve ever taken at Yale. The only thing to be wary of is the general make-up of the students in the seminar. I think one of the reasons that this course was so great was because Professor Rogers did a great job of picking an interesting mix of students coming from very different perspectives. I could imagine that this course could be lame if there was not a good mix of students in the seminar. Scope out the class and then TAKE IT!",
    "Doug Rogers is one of the best seminar leaders at Yale. He creates a great atmosphere in the class, encourages wide participation, and strikes the perfect balance of letting students respond to each other versus giving his own opinions (he does much more of the former, which I liked). As for the material, you'll definitely know this is an anthropology course, but except for a few readings it isn't over the top. The class discussions are very much aimed at theory, of power in particular, but few of the readings are pure theory. Certainly interesting to learn all the different ways one can see oil. Makes you think about meaning in other things too.",
    "definitely! fascinating topic that explores oil from different countries around the world. class discussions were enjoyable. workload very reasonable - readings each week (around a book each week), no reading responses, one midterm paper (8-10 pages), and a final paper (16-18) on your own choice. makes you think about oil in a completely different way - pertinent to the modern world",
    "If you're prepared for often dense readings that require notetakong ahead of seminar and sometimes overwhelming, theoretical discussions, then you're prepared. The topic is certainly highly relevant and fascinating, which makes the work worthwhile.",
    "Take this course!",
    "Definitely recommend. A phenomenal class that forced me to think about oil, and how it intertwines with culture and power, differently. Prof Rogers is incredible--take it if you can.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in any\/all of the three title words. It is an amazing class that helps you look at the world in a different way. Every day I walked out of class brimming with new ideas. Take it, but you must do the reading, and really think about the reading."
