   "comments": [
    "I would take this course if you're interested in furthering your study of how music is put together. It is sort of a survey course where you spend some time with intervals, some time writing counterpoint, and some time with chords and analysis. I thought it was a great experience - especially for musicians who wish to learn how to better interpret music they play.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. As long as you can read music, this class is for you. Easier concepts are reviewed in the beginning of the course, so if you're not too confident, you can just catch up then. Everything we learned seems quite useful!",
    "If you have played an instrument\/sung\/know how to proficiently read music but don't really know much \"about\" the ins and outs of music, take this class (assuming you want to learn more...). It starts at a very basic level and progresses into counterpoint, and harmony. You learn about the functions of all the diatonic chords (I, ii, iii, IV, etc. in both major and minor), and from there do some four part writing. Then you learn about applied chords (V\/V, IV\/ii, etc.) and learn about musical form. Having known very little about music theory, I can definitively say that I learned more in this class than any other this semester. Totally worth taking.",
    "This class opened my mind to a new way of listening to and understanding music. As a singer with no theory background, I had a weaker foundation than some experienced instrumentalists, and sometimes felt behind in the fast-paced class. Although keeping up demanded a lot of extra review and practice outside of class, it was well worth the effort. Writing exercises were detail orientated. Analysis assignments were labor intensive but rewarding. Overall, this class was challenging but stimulating and enjoyable. Shop multiple sections for a professor\/TA that you enjoy!",
    "The course covers counterpoint, 4 voice writing and theories of composition. It also covers formal analysis. I would recommend it as a great overall foundation of music theory.",
    "I originally did not enjoy MUSI 205. John Muniz was quite nervous at the board and had quite a strict teaching style. The class is also designed to make you memorize hundreds of tedious rules, sapping most of the creativity out of the class. I felt like I was in a math class more than a music class. Over time John Muniz became more comfortable with the class, and his quirky sense of humor lightened the mood. He is a piano genius, which permitted him to supplement his lessons effectively by whipping out impromptu piano performances. Overalla pretty enjoyable class.",
    "I'd recommend this course to anyone looking for a thorough introduction to music theory, or to any musician without a background in theory looking for a fun, not-too-hard course. The different sections are not all taught the same way, so it's especially important to take the time to find an instructor you like."
