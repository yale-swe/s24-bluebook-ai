    "Thermodynamic, acid-base reaction, redox reaction, precipation and complexation.",
    "inorganic chemistry applied in water chemistry, problem solving methods based on the water chemistry",
    "Concepts of water chemistry and how I can apply that to my research. Which, I have already done several times since taking the course!",
    "Redox, tableaux, complexation",
    "So many useful skills for research as well as life such as problem solving etc. Water Chemistry topics were taught in depth instead of skimmed which I appreciated."

    "I had difficulty following lecture, mostly because the pace of it. I would have preferred pre-written notes.",
    "Organized in a logical manner, well-taught, and generally very enjoyable.",
    "This was a great course. I learned a lot and Desiree was one of the best professors I have ever had. However, this course was so much work. My hand would be tired after every class from writing so many notes so quickly. Also, I have never had a course that had a Final exam, Final Project AND Final Presentation. The homework was also really hard, but I learned a lot from them.",
    "This class is very helpful and interesting! I'm fully engaged!",
    "Strength: lots of examples, easy understanding lecture, Weakness: homework is time consuming, and the wording is confusing sometimes I think the final project is unnecessary.",
    "Strengths: superb material with a great teacher who will be missed Weaknesses: organization was ok, but not great. Improved organization could definitely help absorption of the material during homework.",
    "More practical",
    "Classes were extremely engaging, topics were interesting, workload was high."

    "Yes, I think it was a good class.",
    "Absolutely, I learned a great deal about water chemistry, but also a wide variety of other relevant topics, like carbon sequestration and medical waste, that showed how these processes are important outside a lab. The class was enjoyable and extremely well-taught.",
    "Yes. Desire makes learning fun and engaging. She also is good at explain complex concepts.",
    "Yes if they are working with water related topic for research or are interested. I learned a lot from the course and I believe the topics we covered are necessary to know if we are working with water related topics.",
    "Yes! This class is really helpful to do water and metal related research.",
    "Very much so. You learn a lot of useful skills if you do anything that requires knowledge of the type of chemical interactions that take place in water\/aquatic systems.",
    "Yes",
    "YES! I would definitely recommend this class. My favorite one from Yale!"
