It helped me building more confidence and learn my cultural tips that are pretty important to navigate at F&ES and in the american environment. The practicum classes were very important to use the knowledge got in class. The presentation guidance and practice were very helpful!",

    "Having some american TAs to practice during some classes would be great.",
    "There are some topics that should be more explored, such as vocabulary, presentations and speaking practices with native speakers. The pronunciation class was very tiring and long and not as important as other aspects of spoken communication, that's why I think this class could be shorter or especially focused on the students that have more difficult. The class about wiring an e-mail was very obvious with a intuitive content, so I think that William shouldn't have spent a entire class on this topic. About the practicum, it could be more organized to allow students to practice for the same amount of time. There were classes that some students were not able to present their homework because of the lack of time remaining for them.",
    "It could be more helpful to have short weekly writing assignments and\/or brief speech deliver. I think that one 5 pages paper was not as helpful as could have been a weekly one (or half) page essay."
