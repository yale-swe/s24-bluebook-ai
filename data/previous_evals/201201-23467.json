   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it as a relaxed way to explore some topics in Latin American history. There was a movie every week, which really enhanced the readings, and Ezer was not incredibly demanding with work. We wrote a journal entry every week, were responsible for \"leading class\" (very casually and with other class leaders) three times during the semester, and have to write a 15-25 page term paper with primary sources.",
    "the course was a bit haphazard, readings spanned a very wide range of topics, types of readings and countries. not too much work up to the research paper at the end. professor really wants to have a discussion and let students take more leadership, but sometimes that backfires when people are reluctant to speak up",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn about Latin America. It offers a really broad sweep of the countries, even the Caribbean, which I really appreciated.",
    "Overview of law and power relations related aspects of recent Latin American history.",
    "It is what it's called: law, crime, and punishment in Latin America. You examine a variety of facets pertaining to how law is exercised and how people have perceived the law historically. It's a solid course, and Ezer is going to be a great professor one day. Recommended.",
    "Interesting class, but a little dry. Tons of reading, but there are really fun movies too.",
    "Yes-but only if you're interested in learning some legal history on various Latin American countries."
