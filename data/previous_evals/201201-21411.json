    "YES take it - film major or not!",
    "This was by far the best class I took this semester. It's a very well structured and engaging course. The discussions every week were incredible and I really got a lot out of listening to other people's thoughts as well as Professor Gregg's. I really can't fault this class at all, if I could I would take it again!",
    "This is a great course! Take it if you can. Professor Gregg is amazing, and the movies are really enjoyable. Even if you aren't a film studies major, you can definitely appreciate the class. There isn't too much reading, and what there is gives good perspective on the films. Coming out of this class, you'll have a good knowledge of two classic filmmakers, as well as of the history of Hollywood in the twentieth century.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. The movies are brilliant, Ron Gregg is a genius, and the workload is totally manageable. You'll watch some of the best classic movies ever and talk about a whole range of topics -- from cosmopolitanism to sexuality to gender studies to 20th century history to music in film... The list goes on.",
    "Great film class with an emphasis on women's sexuality and censorship code. Focus on Lubitsch and Wilder movies. Prof. Gregg is awesome. Flexibility with paper topics.",
    "This course is amazing! You learn to really appreciate Silent& Golden Era Hollywood like no other course allows you to. It's great that you get to focus on two directors, this way you really get to understand their oeuvres. The reading can be a little bit heavy but the screenings and responses are more important. Ron is the most thoughtful, caring professor at Yale.",
    "After a two-hour screening each week, you meet for a two hour seminar to discuss the films, relevant readings, and any other relevant films, clips, or historical context. The film analysis can go quite in-depth, but don't fear if you aren't a film studies major- this class has great appeal for history or American studies scholars too.",
    "If you have an interest in the history of romantic comedy or in either of the directors take this course. It is fun, interesting, and substantial seminar.",
    "This class is great, mostly because of Ron Gregg, who is amazing. There was a variety of experience with film studies in the class but everyone could focus on their own field of interest, which was great. Teaches you to really understand film on a different level, since you look at two director's works and evaluate them over time."
