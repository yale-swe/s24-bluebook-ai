   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to develop more comprehensive and strategic reading techniques that hone in on a history books main argument and intervention. These reading techniques also made it possible to broadly think about the conversations that scholars are engaged in as opposed to solely reading a book as its own entity.",
    "I am now better aware of the current literature for American Studies and am better able to envision my own scholarship in the field as a whole.",
    "From indigenous studies to Asian American studies and everything in between, this course provides students with a thorough overview of the areas of American Studies that concern race (i.e. everything). Each week was a great way to develop a deeper understanding of a particular area and to practice reading for questions, argument, purpose, and audience.",
    "Race and Races helped me develop a robust foundation in the field of critical race studies. From obtaining a sense of the genealogy of the field, to getting a taste of the interplay between critical race studies and other fields, I walked away from the course feeling better equipped to situate my research interests within the current state of scholarship."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was flexible and allowed students to create their own reading lists. Although I enjoyed this flexibility, at times I also felt a bit lost by it as many students were reading different books and engaging in different conversations. Additionally, the course was primarily a History course and made it difficult to partake in discussions that were not solely centered on the field of History.",
    "The biggest strengths of the course came from the extensive reading list and the ability to customize the readings depending on your own interests.",
    "I like the alternative readings option and think it leads to much richer intersectional conversations. I do think there could be a better way to facilitate those conversations. I liked how in the end, the person in charge of introducing started synthesizing more for people who didn't read, but I think a way for this to happen naturally is by having the person also introduce a primary source or archive along with the reading as a way to start the conversation more naturally. It was sometimes difficult when a majority of the people didn't do the primary reading, so the primary source (be it a past or current source) introduction could help mediate that.",
    "I appreciated having the option to read different texts each week, and I thought that the critical journals were an incredibly useful form for moving through the books. There were certain weeks when it felt challenging to have a seminar-wide conversation when too few people had read the main text assigned for the week. I wonder if in-seminar conversations might have felt more organic had there been four or five weeks during which students were required to read the same text. While I appreciated doing the critical journals for my own learning, I also wondered if it might have been helpful to obtain feedback on at least one of the critical journal assignments over the course of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Understanding constructions of race in the US through the field of American Studies is extremely important in the current political moment and the professor's emphasis on taking what we learned through these different pieces of literature out into the streets was key to the course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to all grad students. Great preparation for orals!",
    "Yes! I was appreciative to have a graduate-level class broadly on U.S. critical race studies, and the seminar helped me obtain a sense of how critical race studies as a field has gotten to where it is today."
