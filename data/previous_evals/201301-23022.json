    "The biggest thing for me was the wide array of very enjoyable readings (readings are a lot, but they are healthy readings& very enjoyable). You don't get this kind of good mix of readings in any other class. Also, we were lucky this year, but this year we had a lot of interesting people who made the discussion experience very enjoyable. Writing assignments, although light, really force you to be concise& creative& analytic. I enjoyed doing them, as it is fulfilling to pour your intense thoughts into two pages. Overall, very chill class with interesting readings, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to any students who are interested in the subject matter. (Oh the main themes of the course can be summarized as special-interest theories (regulations demanded by the regulated), historicism of political science studies, application of economic concepts to the understanding of politics, etc.)",
    "Unfortunately, this was one of the more frustrating courses in my time at Yale. We jumped around different material without ever delving into any of it. Certain topics were overly technical to the point that class discussion seemed lost and unhelpful. There was a lot of readings and it was obvious that many people simply could not devote the necessary time to the very complicated texts that were chosen to gain anything from the course. The intersection of politics and the market is an extremely important topic to learn about, so it is sad to see that the class really does not live up to the interesting area it claims to look at.Also, Professor Swenson continuously gives you the impression that he is not excited to be teaching or to be reading the papers that students spend a lot of time writing. Especially at a 9 am seminar, you really do not want to feel like the professor does not want to be there. On top of that, it appeared that students who agreed with Swenson and would write papers along his point of view did better in the class. Definitely not what Yale teaching is supposed to be about.",
    "Yes. The course covers a lot of interesting and engaging material.",
    "Sure, why not.",
    "This course is great for two reasons. First, on a purely academic level, Professor Swenson compiles an incredibly good reading list - it is seriously worth your while to read most if not all of the readings for this seminar because they really do tend to be foundational pieces in the literature for any given topic. The workload is also not that large -- five two-page papers -- but you are expected some kind of innovative argument using the readings, which can take some thought if not all that much time with regard to writing it up. Second, Professor Swenson cares a lot about the class, and that comes out in the way he engages with each person's ideas in class. The discussion in the class this year was incredibly, even hilariously casual, very unlike any other seminar I've been in. But it was fun to literally argue with whomever you want. I'm not sure if that was because of this year's student dynamic or that Swenson's seminars are just like that.A few caveats: I found in class discussion to be superficial at times because we were discussing such broad topics as the 'causes of the financial crisis' or 'politics in healthcare policy' in just a two hour timespan. In that sense, this is a seminar version of a typical poli. sci. lecture. You very much can BS your way through if you'd like. Do the readings though, it'll pay off in terms of your getting anything out of the class.",
    "A great opportunity to examine the backroom negotiations that lie behind important political decisions. Coalitions, regulators, lobbying, etc. Examines the structural incentives for political decision making. Money in politics. Etc. Offers you a new perspective on familiar material.One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Go for it!",
    "Its a course that looks at the varying intersections between politics and financial markets from an economic historian perspective. The course is very grounded in liberal thought, though the readings to allow conservative opinions. I would not recommend this course to anyone unless you are extremely self motivated and have a thick skin to deal with Professor Swenson's comments.",
    "Very broad readings and overview of everything related to politics and markets. Healthcare, agriculture, campaign funding are all covered and in a refreshingly historical way.",
    "I really liked this course - it's a mix of history and current policy that gives you a really good background of a number of different issues. Each week focuses on a different issue (e.g. campaign finance, banking, agricultural regulations, etc.). There is a fair amount of reading but if you do it class will be really interesting.In terms of the five two-page papers, Ididn't find them to be too bad (though I heard a few people complain about them). I don't think the grading is hard if you just understand the way Professor Swenson wants the papers to be written: he values originality above all, I think, and he sees the papers as a chance for you to advance an idea or proposal that is somewhat new and interesting. It's okay if the details of the proposal aren't perfect, and I found the short papers to be a great way to engage the readings each week. It's also nice that you don't have to pump out a 10-20-30 page paper at the end of the course, as most seminars have you do.Quick warning: I heard one or two people complain that because he's so liberal, he'll grade you more harshly if your papers advance more conservative ideas, but I don't know if this is true (mostly because all my papers were pretty liberal haha). Just watch out for that I suppose.",
    "Great, especially if you need an EPE seminar and you haven't taken other courses with material that overlaps. Very comprehensive."
