    "It's a great class. Although I think there could be more hands on learning, the assignment to solve a crystal structure was hands on and allowed me to get some great insights into how crystal structures are solved and what things to be careful about when viewing a solved crystal structure."

    "Coming to Yale I was very interested in protein crystallography so this course was a great introduction. I only wished I could spend more time in this class to learn more."
