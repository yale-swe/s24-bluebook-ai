    "It's less painful than 410 and Griffiths is a great book that can teach you a lot, but the time spent in class is often not used very efficiently. Although Professor Le Hur is kind, intelligent, and certainly a pretty good sort in general, the lectures were often not the clearest, despitethe fact that they followed Griffiths closely. I had trouble paying attention in class.",
    "This course introduces quantum mechanics, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, stationary states, 1-D quantum mechanics applications, 3-D applications such as the hydrogen atom, angular momentum, and spin. At the end, we also got glimpses of more advanced topics such as the Aharonov-Bohm effect, entanglement, and Bell's inequality.I recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn quantum mechanics. Of course, being a 400-level physics course, it's only really accessible to people majoring in physics or similar fields, and these peopleprobably would have taken it regardless of my recommendation. Still, I liked it a lot and I think I learned introductory quantum mechanics quite well.",
    "Karine Le Hur is a woman who understands",
    "math i had taken:MATH 120ENAS 194MATH 222MATH 250MATH 300 (concurrently)phys i had taken:200\/201205\/206410phys 440 is the continuation of the physics major series- intro to quantum. if karyn le hur is teaching, she is really nice but the pace is really slow, so its a pretty easy class. you could probably take it with phys 430 no problem. griffiths is a great textbook, it was fun just doing problems out of that book. make sure you have taken some kind of differential equations andlinear algebra before hand.",
    "This course is obviously necessary for the intensive major, so many people will have to take it sophomore year. However, if you are not locked into the intensive track, I would suggest waiting and taking this course with another professor (it seems they rotate instructors). Karine Le Hur is very nice and knowledgeable, but I did not feel I took much from her lectures, but rather learned mostly from the book. Workload is pretty light compared to other physics courses, especially 410, and there was only one homework which I found difficult.",
    "Definitely some language barrier issues with Prof. Le Hur. Also it didn't really seem necessary to go to class since she follows basically exactly along with Griffiths, who explains things better anyway.",
    "Eh...The professor is really uninspiring, if you have a chance take it with Skiba. Just read the textbook. You can come to lecture if you want to but it is by no means necessary or life-changing.",
    "Yes, even if you are not a physics major. The course is manageable as long as you have a good math background.",
    "Phys 440 was a good quantum mechanics class. I certainly learned the necessary basics of quantum mechanics, but I felt that the class dealt too much with long mathematical proofs instead of delving into the ideas and intuitive explanations of what the theory predicts. Also, Professor Le Hur's accent took a little getting used to.",
    "It was adequate but not great. Take it if you want to learn the basics of quantum but it is not the best physics course you'll ever take.",
    "Take it because you have to but it is not too fantastic. You really end up only covering two chapters and just need to read Griffiths in order to do well in this class.",
    "Take it if you're majoring in intensive physics. Take pchem if you're not.",
    "The course taught with Le Hur will cover only the beginning of Griffiths, so second semester may have to move a lot faster. The class wasn't that much work.",
    "Do you plan on graduating from Yale without taking this course? Think again. You should be ashamed of going into the real world without Quantum Mechanics and Natural Phenomena I on your transcript. It would honestly be less embarrassing to have \"HARVARD\" across the top of the ol' grade report. But in all seriousness, this class is about how our real world operates at the atomic and subatomic level. That's more important than all the history or literature or speling in the wurld. You do need a bit of math background, but that's the price of Truth. In more seriousness, lecture is not terribly exciting, but it is extremely straightforward. Griffiths is a very fun and understandable read. Problem sets range from incredibly easy to quite difficult, but all very doable with enough time spent or consultation. The exams are extremely straightforward and simple, so no worries on that front. And, Professor Le Hur knows how to juggle. So, I ask again, do you plan on graduating from Yale without taking this course? Thought so.",
    "It is a good course. If you have the background for it (either Physics 401 or 410 works) and are interested, you should take it. If you do, be ready to do the second semester also. The first semester, though interesting in its own right, seems decidedly incomplete. You learn a couple of fundamental principles and solve a few special cases. There is no grand synthesis, however; for that, you need the second semester.",
    "This was a pretty good class. Prof LeHur's teaching style may or may not suit you, but she is very nice and accessible for help out of class. The exams were very frustrating, as they didn't really test what we learned, more figuring out problems we had never seen before.",
    "This is a fairly routine course. Le Hur can be a frustrating lecturer -- fortunately, she follows the sequence of topics in the book fairly closely, although she often emphasizes different things. The key is to have a good TA, because ours wrote all the psets and even the exams, so as long as they know what's up you should be fine. Not the most fun course I've ever taken, but tolerable.",
    "Take it if you have to. If you can, I've hear this course is better with Professor Skiba, or try the applied physics version. This course will teach you basic ideas of quantum mechanics but you won't understand it any better than you did in your intro class.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It was a very interesting and well taught class."
