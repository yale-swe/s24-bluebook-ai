    "ENGL130 is one of those classes that changes your life if you engage with it fully - and with reading that oscillates between 200 and 400 pages a week, it's nearly impossible to survive this course without engaging in it fully. What is great about this class is that it transforms the way you look at literature; it was not until I took ENGL130 that I realized how interconnected the classics are with more contemporary writings. I don't know if I could have fully grasped this lesson if the workload was any less intense. You can tell what an undertaking the class is simply by looking at the syllabus, but the professors know that the workload is intense and they are there to help you get through it. It's unfortunate that Professor Neuman will no longer be teaching this course, because he stands out as one of the most understanding teachers I've had. I highly recommend taking ENGL130 for anyone with even a vague interest in literature; it will totally change your college experience for the better.",
    "Take it if these are books on your list--Ulysses, e.g., I wanted to read but knew I wasn't going to read outside of a classroom. It's a lot of reading, so definitely know that going in. It is seminar-style, so definitely read the reviews for all the different teachers and choose accordingly. Professor Neuman was great.",
    "Great seminar discussions, but read the books over the summer before taking the course.",
    "This course is a lot of reading and the more of the reading you actually do, the more you will appreciate the course. It is possible to pass by without doing much work at all, but you will not enjoy the class.",
    "An amazing course. Don't be overwhelmed by the sheer volume of reading, it ends up being totally manageable. I learned a lot by working with these books and would totally recommend the class to someone else."
