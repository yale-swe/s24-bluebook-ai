    "Stratigraphy is stratigraphy. You get what you pay for with this class. The trips are amazing experiences (grueling, but fun) and Leo Hickey is one of those must-have professors at Yale. The material at times can get pretty dry, but he does his best to keep it interesting. I would recommend having taken a G&G class before this one; I really think it would help. This class should totally be worth 1.5 credits though, with the amount of time put into the labs. It's a lot of work, but it was a good class.",
    "Stratigraphy has been the best course that I've taken at Yale. The course description may seem a bit dull, but the material is actually tremendously exciting. Through the application of a few principles, it is possible to understand the contemporary records of all sorts of depositional environments. After completing this course, I feel as if I understand a great deal of material of which I was completely unaware. The field trips are exciting opportunities to synthesize your knowledge, and incredibly necessary. Prof. Leo J. Hickey is an amazing professor, guaranteeing an enjoyable and thoroughly educational experience. Study a lot for the second midterm :) Also, you'll enjoy the course a lot more and get a lot more out of it if you can devote your full attention to it, so avoid brutalizing yourself with other difficult courses.",
    "It's all about sedimentology and stratigraphy (the study of sediments and the study of layered rocks). At first, I didn't think it would be very interesting, but you learn a LOT and it gets really interesting the more detail you get into. Be prepared to work hard, but Prof. Hickey will help you out however he can.",
    "I would recommend Stratigraphy if you are a geology major or extremely interested in the subject matter. The course is not easy and not meant to fulfill a science requirement, but was definitely a rewarding experience. The lab requirement is included in the class and there are a few weekend field trips, but Prof. Hickey is great and you will learn a ton.",
    "Stratigraphy is a geology course that covers the formation of sedimentary rocks from their small beginnings as little clasts, transportation, deposition, diagenesis, and so one. The last portion of the class examines the different types of information one can glean from different rock records. The course is structured very well, starting with the grain and ending with the basin system, even connecting to plate tectonics and geologic cycles. Geologists, archaeologists, paleontologists and enthusiasts in those fields should DEFINITELY take this class!",
    "Take this class!! If you're remotely interested in Geology, this class is essential. Prof. Hickey is an engaging teacher and so much fun! It may seem boring, but this subject is much trickier than one would imagine. Stratigraphy was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. AHHH TEAM CHRONOCOPTER!!"
