    "chill workload. learn a lot about auctions. sometimes pretty dull",
    "Good class. First half of the course consisted of lectures during which the professor explained the theory and derived things; the second half consisted of student presentations on various topics. The grading was 1\/3 presentation and participation, 1\/3 referee report, and 1\/3 literature report. There were no problem sets or exams.",
    "Very interesting and comprehensive class on auctions.",
    "The class format was strange. The first half of the course was spent going over extensive proofs, which were never put in practice. Second half was student presentations. There were no grades throughout the course with 66% of course materials due on the last day of class."
