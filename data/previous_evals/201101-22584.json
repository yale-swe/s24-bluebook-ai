    "Course was probably around the same level as the other courses. Most students try to get Ngames's class but if he's not your cup of tea, then have no worries about taking this one.",
    "French 120 is a very effective course. I'm surprised by how much I am able to speak, write, and understand after only 2 semesters. Mlle. Adele is awesome. I always looked forward to class, with the nice variety of activities without too much rote filling-out of worksheets. You'll learn a lot but have a lot of fun.",
    "It is a very hard class but I speak french much better now than after first semester, and will continue on with french. Just know that it is a lot of work to get to that point.",
    "Take it. Do it.",
    "I would recommend it",
