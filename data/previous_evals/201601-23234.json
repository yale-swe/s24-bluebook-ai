    "Justin Hawkins is a great guy and, like Adam Eitel, cares for his students' well-being. Justin was insightful, good at creating discussion, a fair grader, and overall a stellar person to have class with. I think Justin and Adam made a great team.",
    "Justin did well to steer the conversation and provided concrete ideas for students to work with and then apply. I found that his enumeration of the conditions of Just War were extremely helpful. Writing things down on the board is underrated, generally, and Justin used this simple technique to great effect. He was also careful to keep the conversation on topic, which I appreciated. I learned a lot from Justin's teaching of the material.",

   "comments": [
    "He was great at leading the discussion section of the class. He had excellent points and knowledge of the texts we engaged with, and he was very good at explaining them.",
    "His weaknesses are few. Justin did a great job dissecting the material and presenting it to us in an easily digestible form. He was at his best when applying esoteric concepts to practical situations (after explicitly spelling out the complex concepts first). He was a tough grader of papers though. I think he expected a bit too much when it came to refined writing, especially for those of us who have never studied philosophy or ethics before. I think his grading will eventually level off once he is exposed to more student papers.",
    "Justin, like Professor Eitel, is extremely knowledgeable and did a great job of conveying to the class. I find that he was always well prepared and provided valuable feedback on papers.",
    "Justin was genuinely excited and invested in the subjects of just war and pacifism. He was also very knowledgeable of the subjects at hand.",
    "Justin was tremendously helpful in understanding the different texts we were reading and in leading discussion sections with people who disagreed strongly on the issues we tackled in the class. He was a wonderful instructor and an excellent scholarly companion who is well-read in so much beyond the narrow areas we covered that it felt like he was helping us connect the dots beyond the class to everything else that we study at YDS.",
    "Fantastic at leading discussion. Perhaps the best conversation facilitator I have encountered at YDS. Also a fantastic lecturer, although this was more evidenced in Christian Ethics this semester than in this particular course, as is appropriate for a seminar.",
    "Highly professional, highly knowledgeable, asks good questions, encouraging of student engagement. Very strong blazer game.",
    "Justin was a great TF. In the beginning of the semester, he spoke too much while leading discussion but I think he really settled in as the semester went on. I felt that he was a great addition.",
    "Justin was good at leading class discussions and helping to bring out different ideas. I was taken back, however, when he announced that due to a class discussion he had shifted his position on just war and embraced pacifism. My issue with this is not that he embraced x over y, but the fact that his opinion was so quickly changed leads me to believe that this was likely not an area in which he had previously put a great deal of thought. Although, perhaps I am being a bit harsh; and, in an effort of full disclosure, this could be because I felt that his reading\/understanding of one of my papers was questionable. All in all, I think he did a good job leading class discussions, but I was not thrilled with his reading of one of my papers (even though he gave it an 'H-,' I disagreed with the comments left on the paper).",
    "Justin did an excellent job handling the class\/section discussions. He asked questions, drove conversation, and encouraged us to synthesize our thinking. Above all, he knows the material, and did a great job presenting it. Yale is lucky that Justin is sticking around: professors and students will continue to benefit from his presence.",
    "I really liked Justin! He was a great facilitator. There were a couple of sections when, instead of allowing people to speak, he would present his own opinions in a disorganized manner, so I would encourage him to take more of a facilitating role of people's opinions.",
    "Justin did a nice job facilitating discussion. He seemed to be enthusiastic about the material which was encouraging. One thing that I think Justin could improve upon is refraining from shaking his head in disagreement when a student is speaking. I think it is discouraging to do that and it is much better to wait until the student finishes to verbalize any disagreements.",
    "Excellent facilitator of discussion and small group leader Good teacher",
    "Passionate and always present! I did not follow his train of thought or teaching style. He kind of rambles very quickly and is not linear. Some love this style, but I did not follow."
