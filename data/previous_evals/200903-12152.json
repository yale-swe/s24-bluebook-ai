    "Yes I would definately recommend this class, especially if Kuc is teaching it. It combines interesting material with a great professor. Also would be interesting for Comp Sci majors and non-majors with a solid quanitative backround. We went over some really interesting stuff in class - data encoding, sound production and manipulation, the basics of data and information transmission. Great class.I would also just recommend taking any class that Kuc is teaching He is great and in the end, classes are really made by the professor not the material.",
    "Good course - very interesting material and taught to just the right amount of depth. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in how information is encoded, transmitted, error checked, etc. You'll really feel like you learned a lot in this class. Additionally, the work load was very reasonable (much less than other qr's I've taken).",
    "The material covered in this course is pretty interesting, and Professor Kuc is an amazing lecturer. If you are even considering EE, this course would be a good class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course--the material is interesting and Kuc makes it a fun experience without too much grunt work.",
    "Take this if you're confident in math and interested in the concepts detailed in the course description.",
    "EE 202 provides an introduction to signal processing with applications to electrical engineering such as digital filter design. Some other EE-related topics, such as bar codes and data compression, are also covered. The course was very interesting. As a non-EE major, I was satisfied with the course, although I was somewhat disappointed that some of the topics in the course description (e.g. robotics and image processing) were not actually covered."
