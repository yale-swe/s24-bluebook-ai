    "I think the course was great and allowed me to develop skills during my practicum that i had not had before.",
    "Phenomenal learning experience.",
    "Good course for public health practice, but time is to short, which lead to an intense schedule for this course",
    "Great opportunity to get community health experience",
    "Excellent opportunity to perform virtually independent practical project in the field of public health",
    "Excellent course to introduce APMPH students to public health practice. Dr. O'Keefe and Dr. Frankel-Gramelis are very knowledgeable in the field and could provide additional insight for each student in their placement.",
    "Excellent",
    "I think the practicum is a great component of the course, but it definitely requires planning time. If it is not planned well ahead it can turn into something other than what you want it to be.",
    "This course might be more effective is spread over the fall and spring semesters. Many students had a hard time achieving what they needed to with only the spring semester to work with (especially if IRB approval was needed)."

    "Great course if you want to do something autonomous. Great capstone for the end of your MPH where you can prove to yourself that you definitely can utilize the skills that your academics has taught you.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Good course to practice and build connection",
    "I would recommend this course because it is the one of the few courses that allow you the autonomy to run a whole project on your own using all the public health skills you have learned",
    "Your experience will depend on your chosen topic and individual mentor but the current YSPH practicum faculty (Elaine and Diane) are outstanding and very skilled in understanding the practical and public health aspect of each student's project. Note that 12 weeks is not enough to finish a major undertaking especially if it involves an IRB approval but this is not a main point of this practicum and will not count against you, highly recommended!!!",
    "Great course to immerse yourself in public health practice.",
    "Plan ahead so that the practicum can be a relevant experience. If prepared for, this can be a great class to take.",
    "Great if you have an existing project you wish to work on independently.",
    "Would highly recommend"
