   "comments": [
    "It is a brilliant course, providing a great introduction into rigorous mathematics. It totally changed my way of thinking about math and algebra. Professor Auel is perfect. A fantastic lecturer and a very friendly person, he always presents material in an interesting way, showing both its mathematical beauty and applications outside the realm of pure mathematics. His class is extremely interesting, and it provides a great introduction into rigorous mathematics. Now, reviewing the material for the final exam, I feel so grateful to him for teaching me all this cool stuff and showing me the beauty of algebra. Regardless of how hard the final exam will be, I will surely consider this class one of my best experiences at Yale. I really liked psets, which were hard and challenging, and therefore very helpful in understanding the material. Exams were pretty easy and were definitely not as hard as psets.",
    "I would recommend MATH 225 to anyone who wants a glimpse of what math can be beyond calculation. Definitely take it over 222. You still get a lot of applications, but with a clearer understanding. That said, it is a hard class and psets take many hours each week. The midterms (and pop quizzes!) were straightforward, but don't expect the same on the final.",
    "I would recommend this class - don't be intimidated, everyone will struggle with those PSETs. But it is a very fair class, very interesting, and I never fell asleep - even though it was a 9 AM.",
    "An excellent course on linear algebra! Professor Auel is awesome, and he strikes a great balance between giving us a solid theoretical foundation and ensuring that we were familiar with applications. The couple of sessions on Google's page-rank algorithm was one of the highlights. Be prepared to put in the necessary work to understand the material and do the psets. But it's definitely worth it if you do!",
    "Math 225 is a lot of work, requiring a lot of focus to follow the lectures in class, and a lot of time to get through the often 10-12 hour problem sets. It's very rewarding if you are able to swallow the material, but otherwise you will probably feel lost and frustrated most of the time. Take this if you really enjoy careful, in-depth, proof-based math. If not, I would direct you towards 222, as I almost immediately wished someone else had done for me.",
    "The class is difficult, but it is one of the \"rewarding\" classes, where you definitely get a lot out of it.",
    "This is an amazing course - I think it was my favorite class of the semester. I emerged with a strong understanding of Linear Algebra (computations and theoretic computations). I also am much more familiar with how to think about and do proof based math. Professor Auel was mostly responsible for this - he is clear, engaging, and accessible professor. If you didn't quite feel up to 230 but are still interested in a class about theoretical foundations, this is a class for you. A word of warning though: it is A LOT of work, with 10+ hour long psets. However, they are a lot of fun, make you think, and really help you understand the material (unlike math 120 which was repetitive computational problems). You get a lot of help on them too: there are a lot of office hour slots and there is an optional discussion section which unlike most was engaging and really helpful (Flor, the TA, was great). My recommendation would be to try it for two or three weeks. You get a much deeper understanding of linear algebra than in 222 (and in my opinion this class is also more interesting and fun). If it looks like it will be too much, you can drop back to 222 anytime before the first 222 midterm.",
    "If you like math, take this class. It's not too much work and it's interesting. Both the professor and the TA are also great. You learn things much more conceptually and in depth than I've heard you do in 222, so for math people, it's worth the 9 am trek to Hillhouse. However, if you're not a big math person, 222 is easier, satisfies the same prerecs, and is less work.",
    "This is a challenging but rewarding course. If you are choosing between 222 and 225, keep in mind that this course is known to be more challenging than 222. However, if you are willing to put in the work, then it is a very rewarding course as it will give you a much deeper understanding of linear algebra. The P-Sets take a lot of time and are usually quite difficult, but exams are generally more doable.",
    "Math 225 is a introduction to both linear algebra and proof-based math. It is an amazing, well-taught class for those interested in math and willing to put in the time required to digest complicated material and complete long problem sets. For people who satisfy these two conditions, the class will be a blast, but for those who lack one or the other, the class will be a struggle. Professor Auel is great and is really interested in the subject matter.",
    "Take it if you really like hard, proof-based math. I would not take have taken it if I knew 5 months ago what I know now but that's more of a subject matter \/ early hour thing.",
    "If you're considering majoring in math, take this course. If you just need to fulfill a linear algebra requirement and don't care as much, take 222. If you're willing to put in the effort, this is a very rewarding course.",
    "My best math class yet at Yale! You're enjoyment of this class depends greatly on what kind of math thinker you are. This class if for those who love math for the sake of math, who get pure enjoyment out of proving statements that might not always have a clear application. Understand that if you're not in this camp (and I know several people who took this class who are certainly not!) then this class could be incredibly onerous and difficult. In short, you must honestly assess yourself. Asher was a wonderful teacher, and his enthusiasm helps humanize the abstract material of the class. P-sets are decently difficult, so you probably shouldn't do them the night before (it's possible, though). This class has the ideal balance between challenging proof-based p-sets that help you learn, and easier application-based midterm\/quizzes\/tests that ensure you know the core concepts of linear algebra.",
    "It is very difficult unless you are extremely good at math. I would certainly recommend it if grades were not a factor - I am not anticipating getting a good grade in the class because I didn't do that well on the (extremely difficult) exams. That notwithstanding, I feel like I have acquired a really in-depth knowledge of linear algebra, which I am immensely grateful for.",
    "Math 225 is a comprehensive introduction to linear algebra, but I did not enjoy the course due to the overload of homework. I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I would prepare him\/her to do a significant amount of work, but also to learn how to think like a mathematician. I have only taken this one linear algebra course, but I believe it is the best option for learning linear algebra, since it respects linear algebra as its own discipline within math and carefully develops all of the theorems, lemmas, and procedures just from 8 axioms for vector spaces, 4 axioms for fields, and 4 axioms for inner product spaces. I would recommend taking linear algebra in the first place because it is the language of math. Many concepts that seem very complicated, like the idea of Fourier coefficients, become very familiar after one learns linear algebra.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anybody who is interested in majoring in mathematics or a math related field. The class takes a lot of time and work, but it is definitely worth it. Professor Auel is amazing and the class teaches you a lot. It is also an extremely good introductory class for proofs, if you've never taken a proof based math class before."
