    "Before I ever took a class with Chauncey one of my friends described him as a \"wonderful human being\" to me, and that is pretty much all you need to know about the guy. From the amount of time that he spends caring about students' lives, reading student papers, involving himself in on-campus student life, discussing your ideas, remembering everything about you, etc., you would never know that he is in fact one of the most accomplished historians of our age. So, to take a class with Chauncey is something that you simply must do.I did enjoy this class thoroughly and learned a lot. Having said that, I want to caution you that this class is what you make of it. The readings are pretty light for a junior history seminar, and it's easy to skim them or not work hard on the paper -- you can do so and scrape by just fine because Chauncey is so damn nice. At the same time, you're not going to get a lot out of this class unless you realize that the reason Chauncey assigns so little is that you're supposed to read carefully and deeply. At the end ofthe day this is also a class in the \"how\" of history, and so the idea is that you develop an analytical eye on a subject where so much is hidden from explicit documentation. If you put in the effort, you will most definitely develop that skill, and the class is invaluable. If you just want to take a gay class because you're gay, this is not for you.",
    "If you take this class, don't expect it to be much like the lecture course. It's pretty interesting, but it has a heavy emphasis on methods rather than historical content. Also, almost everything you study is before gay liberation, so if you have a strong interest in recent history this might not be the class for you.",
    "Selected Topics in Lesbian and Gay History structures the course around different kinds of primary source documents and how they can be used to analyze queer history. The seminar assumes some knowledge of gay and lesbian history already, and the class isn't organized chronologically, so it helps to have some background in the subject matter (like Chauncey's lecture course). Professor Chauncey is a fantastic professor - brilliant, great seminar leader, incredibly kind - and the fellow students in the course were all brilliant and brought their own areas of expertise to the table.",
    "Worth it because you get toget to know Professor Chauncey better, but otherwise, just take the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class with the caveat that it is not the lecture course and do not expect it to be. It is very much self-guided learning, but if you take the chance to learn from Chauncey and the other people in the class, you will be rewarded.",
    "This course delves into the stickier historiographical questions surrounding the study of lesbian and gay history. While much of the class assumes basic to moderate knowledge of lesbian and gay history, the readings in the course discussed a variety of topics, including how one can access this history that was meant to be hidden from view for much of recent decades. I would recommend the chance to work with Professor Chauncey. However, this course was frustrating at times, as there was often more reading than could be discussed in class, and the discussion could take unhelpful turns that would avoid some of the bigger questions at stake for the week.",
    "This class was wonderful. Really fascinating material, good class discussions, great professor. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "The seminar delves into some of the main topics of Gay and Lesbian history (including cross-dressing, anti-gay policing, the lavender scare, and gay life in urban areas) in depth with a strong focus on reading primary sources as a historian. I would recommend this class to all history majors, if only so that you can get to know Chauncey better and complete a research project with his guidance.",
    "Yes yes yes, a million times yes. The course analyzes in great detail the progression of American society's understanding of sexuality and of the development, etc. of gay men and lesbians. Also, Chauncey is wonderful to work with.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof. Chauncey is more dedicated to his students and their lives than any other professor I\u0092ve met in my three years at Yale. He\u0092s a joy to learn from; we adored him. He is also the leading scholar in his field; the opportunity to take a class from him is too good to pass up. In the class, we learned to sharpen our research\/methodology skills, spending time in the Beinecke working in pairs on mini-research projects. This year, Professor Chauncey assigned far more reading than we would ever discuss, and discussions often lost sight of the central theme or question. If this would frustrate you, don\u0092t take the class. However, if you\u0092re passionate about the topic, it won\u0092t be a problem.Also, know that the course can attract a particular kind of student; several of my best friends also took the class, which made the experience very personal. Students came at the topic from a variety of academic backgrounds, but we shared a common basic background of Prof. Chauncey\u0092s lecture course and most had some WGSS experience. We also got a long very well together, helped each other, and discussed course material at great length outside the classroom. The learning environment was unusually personal and positive, which for me provided a great experience. However, the experience might be different for a student not as passionate about the topic.",
    "I would recommend this course. However, if you're only going to take one course on gay and lesbian history, I would take the lecture course.",
    "George Chauncey is the perfect seminar professor. He was able to facilitate discussions well, and incorporated much time in the Beinecke to look at primary sources. Your writing will definitely improve with his papers, which are heavily focused on argumentation and primary source research. The discussions were at times draining because we had so much reading and because the conversation often would dwell unnecessarily on something. But, I felt the seminar was so well designed, and I enjoyed the company of my classmates. Student presentations were always informative (never BS'd, really) The atmosphere can be a little forced, but I think friendships sincerely grew from class. I definitely recommend this class."
