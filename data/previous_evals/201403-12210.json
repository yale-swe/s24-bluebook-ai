   "comments": [
    "The course shows how ancient Near Eastern texts, history, and traditions provide critical context for understanding the Hebrew Bible, as well as simply providing an opportunity to sit down and thoughtfully read a text whose historical importance as well as aesthetic value cannot be overstated. Hayes is fantastic, and brings the text to life, turning sparse lines of writing into vivid and complex situations. You'll never look at the Bible the same way again. Even if you are committed to denouncing the hegemony of the project of Western civilization, your understanding of that hegemony will be all the richer because of this course. Finally, no summary of this course would be complete without saying that it will prove valuable not just in your other coursework, but in your efforts to live a meaningful and purposeful life. This is not because it will make you convert to any particular religion, but simply because the dilemmas the Hebrew Bible responds to (often with many different answers) are timeless parts of the human condition.",
    "Great class on the Bible. Definitely a lot of reading so don't fall behind. Go to her review sessions for the final paper and exam because they'll help a lot.",
    "Awesome classHayes is a an engaging lecturer that talks fast (thank God, no droning on and on here! She speaks quickly enough that you'll have enough time to write down what she's saying but not enough time to drift off into lala land) and makes the bible feel a lot more relatable\/human. The flipped class room component is actually super useful in that if you miss something, you can just rewind. Lectures are also so much easier to watch and absorb than additional secondary reading, although do be aware there is a LOT of secondary reading, as well as (duh) the Bible readings. You read the whole bible so like, be prepared. It's worth it thoughyou'll come away with so much knowledge which is gonna basically help you in everything, from english courses, to art history courses, to life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned a ton, and it was very entertaining and enlightening. However, I would only caution that there is a lot of reading, and you have to listen to the lecture online before every class, so it was more time consuming than I had initially thought it would be.",
    "An introduction to the Bible with a manageable amount of work.",
    "I came into this class with very little knowledge of the bible and I learned a ton. It focuses exclusively on the Hebrew Bible (The Old Testament) and you learn a lot about the sources that make up the text and the different motivations by the biblical editors\/redactors. Very good at stripping away the myths surrounding the text and getting to the point. The class is a LOT of work. It's a flipped course style so you are responsible for either watching Hayes' lectures (or reading \"Introduction to the Bible\" which I'd recommend) along with a lot of reading. Each week, we broke into a discussion section - there are study guides so you always have the option of being well prepared for that. Grade was determined by participation, mid-term, final essay and final exam. The final essay was difficult because I'd never written anything like it but Hayes offers several review sessions to prepare you for it. Overall, would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the topic; just be prepared to do a lot of work.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. This is one of the most thoughtfully, well-structured classes you will ever take. That, and Christine Hayes is a goddess. You will want to hear her lecture for hours.",
    "I would recommend it 100%. It's a lot of work for just a fifth fun class, which is what I did. However, I still think it's worth it and you can always Cr\/D\/Fail it.",
    "The Bible is an amazing course. If you think you know about the Bible, think again: Professor Hayes puts this strange library of texts into its ancient near eastern context and introduces students to different exegetical schools of thought, and it is mind-blowing. I did not want this course to end. Definitely take this course.",
    "This class is a close look at much of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament ), through various lenses. I would recommend this class to any student--it is entertaining, thought-provoking, and relevant to pretty much everyone.",
    "The course is an introduction to the Biblical text (or library): the emergence of Hebrew, and later, Israelite-Judean and Jewish culture; the importance of personal experience of God in the development of \"biblical religion\"; differences between Israelite-Judean practice and biblical religion; different modes of criticism like source criticism, form criticism, redaction and canonical criticism, midrash and early Christian interpretations as well as modern interpretations; the texts on their own (literary) terms. I would recommend the course, not only because the Bible has been crucial in the development of \"Western civilization,\" but because the Bible is great fun to read.",
    "This class was an amazing experience - one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. We acted out the Book of Job, and I played God. We put King David on trial. We learned how to think about the Bible and Bible stories like you've never learned before (even if you have a standard liberal\/secular Jewish education - it's still worth it to take the course!). Don't think that you shouldn't take the class because the lectures are online. You'll watch\/read the lectures (it takes 20-30 mins to read per lecture, or ~50 mins to watch) before class, then come to class for more lecture and\/or an engaging discussion.",
    "This is a must-take class at Yale. If you have any doubt, just watch the first Open Course lecture and get a feel for Professor Hayes engagement and dynamism! If youre thinking that you can get a way with watching the Open Course series and not taking the class, youre wrong! In flipped classroom style, the online lectures are watched for homework, and the class time is devoted to active exercises and Professor Hayess lectures on new material. This means that the course is continuously dynamic, something it needs to be when taking on such a large text as the Bible. A variety of different approaches to the text are undertaken: relationships between different biblical authors, comparisons between contemporaneous texts of other societies, a historical grounding, and a literary reading. I found, as a student that had little to no prior experience with the Bible, that it was a challenge to approach the texts for the first time in the company of some that were already very familiar with the writing. But it is certainly a manageable challenge and one worthy of being taken!",
    "Please take this class. You will not regret it. Your world perspective will grow and never be the same. Professor Hayes is the most incredible professor I have ever had. She knows everyone's name by the second week of class. She is brilliant, and so knowledgable, and truly in love with what she is teaching - and that makes all the difference. YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT!",
    "This class delves into the history of ancient Israel and how the Bible is truly an anthology of works by many authors and redactors seeking to make sense of the political, social and religious context around them. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student. Professor Hayes is wonderful.",
    "The course does a great job of tearing down a lot of our presumptions about the Bible, and forcing us to critically rethink and reapproach the Bible in new ways. It's not necessarily an easy class, but it's worth the effort.",
    "A very solid introduction to Biblical scholarship. If you do all the readings, which is not that easy, you end up reading almost the entire Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). Prof. Hayes is passionate and excellent - she is a professor you would want to have for any course. The course's focus is on reading the Hebrew Bible and actually seeing what is in there - not so much on how various people took what they saw in it. Hence anyone with any background should take this course if one wanted to study the Bible.",
    "The best class I've taken at Yale, better than any of the courses with big name professors. It's a LOT of work, (a midterm, a final, a 10-page paper, and a LOT of weekly reading that you MUST do) but worth every minute.",
    "The Bible was an introduction to the old testament from several different angles ranging from a historical perspective to source criticism to looking at the bible as literature, etc... and this class was AWESOME!!! Christine Hayes was the best teacher I've had at Yale because of her talent for mixing engaging lectures with great classroom participation activities. I would recommend this class to anyone who likes history, anthropology, and\/or literary analysis- this class teaches you how the bible is a treasure trove for all of these fields!!"
