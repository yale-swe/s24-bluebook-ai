   "comments": [
    "One of the few CS courses here that actually measures up to those at bigger CS schools. Still, it doesn't take as much time as they say it does. A bit disorganized, which might frustrate you at times. Take it! It'll be one of the highlights of your undergraduate career.",
    "TAKE IT. Especially if it's still taught by prof. Ford. You will learn so much. This course touches on so many interesting topics. If you can, take it together with compilers. It will be difficult but so rewarding.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "The course is a fantastic course! Professor Ford is an excellent teacher who has a deep understanding of the material and the history of Operating Systems. His lectures were in depth, detailed, and informative. He is very open to questions; replies often lead to greater insights and depths into OS and programming assignments. As its reputation, the course is extremely programming intensive. Time spent per problem set ranged from 20 hours to 50 hours for one. You work in teams, which is nice and helps to spread the workload. You get to build some amazing things over the stretch of the course: boot-up code, process management, scheduling, memory management, basic file system, and a few networking features. This is definitely a must take course. With all that said, I would suggest coming in prepared to spend a lot of time debugging and coding. I would not suggest taking another programming intensive course alongside this.",
    "I think it's a good class, but just be ready to spend 20+ hours\/week in the class."
