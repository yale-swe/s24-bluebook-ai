    "Covers too little contents, especially in the finance part.",
    "We were the guinea pigs for this class, and it sucked. Although Prof. Antle is a great guy, he was not a great teacher. I never felt like I got the foundations of finance and accounting. I often felt like we were thrown into things without really know why, so I learned the mechanics of completing problems, but only to a certain degree. If I couldn't get the right answer, I didn't know why.There is also homework due every class in the second half of the class. Most of the assignments were easy, just answering questions after reading a chapter, but others were intense and took ~2-3 hours to complete (especially in the beginning of learning about balance sheets and income statements).Strengths - nice professor. The TAs were amazing, and I couldn't have gotten through the class without them. They provided really great outside material, and explained things really clearly. I think I learned more in the 2 hour sessions they had than in the many early morning classes I attended.Weaknesses - very poorly taught, teacher goes into long tangents every class, doesn't understand the level we're at when we begin, not an introductory course at all.",
    "Good course for introduction to accounting",
    "I enjoyed the course. I only wish that we would have had more application to health care organizations.",
    "Strengths- weekly assignment helps you learnWeakness- Instructor fails to make a difficult course interesting",
    "The course material was difficult to follow at times. Homework problems should be briefly gone over in class.",
    "This class need improvement. I don't like the fact that this class talks about both finance and accounting but too little about both. I think it should be either a pure accounting class or a pure finance class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I think it's a great introductory A&F course for students who will probably not use it directly, at least in their early careers. While I don't think I will use this material explicitly in my career, it is nice to have this background and foundation. I personally thought that the pace was great. It really gave me a chance to digest and understand the material. My greatest challenge with this course was the daily homework's towards the end of the term, where I was spending hours on just one problem. While that was frustrating at the time, I do understand why they had to be included as part of the syllabus and they did enhance my learning. Professor Antle is great; he is very approachable and really wants you to learn the material. He is also responsive to students needs and requests and will try to accommodate them into the coursework. The TA's were also great and were very available for help.",
    "Good overview of finance and accounting. The class has a nice practical perspective.The accounting portion was a bit overwhelming -- I would have liked to see as much material (through cash flow statements), but with more simple transactions. Since we weren't studying to be accountants, it would have made it easier to learn the financial statements. And it seems like all the basic concepts can be applied to the more difficult transactions with more accounts if we saw them later in life. Also, I needed a bit more hand holding at the beginning - a detailed explanation of each account and what kinds of transactions go in it. Less context in the accounting lectures -- the finance lectures provide that. Good to check in with big picture for 5, but not 45 minutes. Also, I would really like to see the class get through full examples when doing them in class, even if it means making the problems shorter. It's just really hard to figure out the last part to every homework on your own.",
    "Unfortunately, finance portion of course fell prey to the dominating accounting portion of the course. Should have been 50\/ 50 split with accounting taught first.Daily problem assignments in the latter portion of the course were inappropriate in length and due dates. Assignments were disproportionate in length of time required to complete, especially considering the proximity of due dates between Tuesday and Thursday classes. Would have preferred if both assignments were due at the end of the week as opposed to right before each class.",
    "More regular assessment needed as opposed to one end of term evaluation. Requirements\/format for end of term evaluation were not quite clear.",
    "This class wasn't that great. I kind of regret taking it. I took it thinking it would be useful, not because it was a requirement for me. The finance part was well taught. The accounting part left much to be desired. To begin with, the homework took forever and was due twice a week.And in class, it was hard to follow the professor. I think it would have been helpful to work through examples in a straightforward manner, in an Excel sheet, like we would be doing at home, from the beginning. He was writing things all over the board and I couldn't follow what was going on and then went to do it on Excel and had NO Idea what to do. It was very frustrating. It would have been helpful to get a template from the beginning and be shown how to fill it in as a class."

    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Very nice guy, but not best at teaching. Has trouble focusing on more important issues.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Rick Antle is such a sweet and friendly professor, I really enjoyed his personality in class. However, he poorly taught this class. We were not taught at an introductory level - or perhaps we were, but I never learned the basics. Prof. Antle often compared accounting to 'learning a language' - in languages, we don't start off with jumping into creating sentences. We start off with colors, numbers, articles of clothing, etc. We never went through this in the class. Instead, Prof. Antle would jump ahead, figuring we understood the basics, and try to complete a balance sheet. I felt incompetent when first competing the sheets because I didn't understand the different accounts and what was happening. Class time was also not spent efficiently. Prof. Antle often went on really long tangents, especially in the beginning of class, and would then rush through what we really needed to go over. I couldn't learn how to do an income statement in the 10-15 min we had left of class.The book we used for accounting was also really bad. It was really vague and I didn't get anything out of doing the readings. The book that the TAs used in their previous classes was much better and I finally understood things when I looked through it and attended their sessions.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Excellent instructor",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Rick is incredibly friendly and brings liveliness to the class. I thought he was very opened to amending the course schedule to focus on the areas that we needed particular help with.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Instructor fails to make a difficult course interesting. Class needs to be more interactive",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Rick is a great person and a very capable instructor. However, he sometimes makes things a little bit confusing.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0See comment above.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Good -- interesting lecturer, brings lots of stories and interesting perspective.A but long-winded in giving context at times, and not always focused on completing lecture. But, interesting nonetheless.I would love to see office hours offered though! I think, especially for the accounting part, people would really use them.I'm not sure there was always great communication between TAs and professor - good to just make sure they always know the structure of class, what assignments we'll have, etc.Professor Antle was super helpful in answering questions from students.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Strengths-knowledge of material-flexibility to accomodate students needs-quirky humorWeaknesses-indefinite material for evaluation in final till the last minute-inconsistent class slides format",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Nice guy, but difficult to follow instructional style -- it is clear that the instructor is a gifted accountant but has not yet mastered drilling down on concepts enough to teach at a beginner level. Further, every lecture included at least 1 tangential story. In short, the lectures unfortunately felt like an opportunity to get other work done while TA instruction was crucial to understanding concepts and applications in assignments.The in-class portion of the final exam was very left field compared to the types of problems we received instruction on and worked on via class assignments.",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0Great professor. Made content very interesting!",
    "Instructor: Rick Antle \u00a0He is a very nice guy who cares a lot about his students. I really do like him but think it's just been awhile since he's taught a very intro-level accounting class and needs some tuning.I think he has all it takes to teach a good class, but needs someone to watch him teach, give some feedback about organizing the layout of accounting section, and have a TA system work in the class (set office hours, etc.)He also tends to ramble a lot about things not pertaining to the class. Sometimes it's interesting, and he's a nice guy, but when it's 9am and I'm tired and confused about accounting, i don't appreciate it all that much and would much rather just stick to the point.For the TA's:Giselle and Ashton were both very nice and knowledgeable but I feel like their involvement with the class was very ad hoc. I don't get the impression they met with Antle ever and they never came to class. Would have been helpful to have set office hours each week."

    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless it is drastically improved. I took it as an elective to learn more about the subject, and was very disappointed with the knowledge I came out of the class with. Prof. Antle is very nice, but he is not a good teacher at the introductory level. You will not leave the class with asolid foundation of finance&accounting, but rather with a frustrated outlook on the class and the subject. I spent many early mornings in class but did not learn anything; I learned the most in the few TA sessions they held.",
