   "comments": [
    "If you're a music major.",
    "I would recommend it to someone as the basic starting course of music theory - we covered the intro material of 110 quickly and moved on to somewhat more practical and useful things.",
    "A great introduction to basic topics in theory - just make sure you have some keyboard experience or voice leading can be EXTREMELY difficult. Recommended for all!",
    "I would recommend music theory 205 to someone who is a musician or is involved in music in someway outside of class, and who wants to learn more about what they are playing\/singing and why. Obviously if you are considering a music major you should take this class. There is also a small bit of ear training (with dictation) but I think there are other classes more focused towards that skill if that's what you're looking for. Workload isn't too bad (two worksheets a week and one short paper), and the midterm\/final aren't bad either.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Learning theory is very interesting and important if you want to become a musician.",
    "This is the perfect class to take if you have played an instrument seriously for many years but have never taken music theory. I feel much more able to evaluate music and the intent of its composer now that I have taken this course.",
    "Have you ever wanted to know about how chord work together, what musical periods are, how basic counter-point works, or just want to be forced to learn scales? This is absolutely the course for you. It is exactly what is sounds like in the description, and if you come in just knowing how to read music, you will work hard. (NB. If you're an acapella singer with great pitch hearing who knows lots of stuff instinctively already, this might not apply to you.) For the rest of us - you will know your basic theory by the end, how chords work together and how to analyze standard classical compositions. Make sure you pick your teacher well - it makes all the difference. Shop around, and DON'T take it with someone you don't immediately warm to. It'll be a long semester otherwise."
