    "If you're an earth science person with a focus on environment, this is a must take class.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to, but if you have to then definitely take it it's a hoot.",
    "A difficult class, but ultimately a rewarding one. It requires less chemistry knowledge thank you would think, but it definitely takes you deep into current academia. This class is centered around piecing together concepts you learn in order to explain phenomena, and your ability to do that is tested by reading and evaluating current literature, as well as proposing your own alternatives. There is a lot of material (which can be daunting), but it's pretty interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course, but probably only to someone who is majoring in G&G (or maybe chemistry). It is a fascinating topic, and you learn about all of the really cool things you can discover from chemical signatures in rocks."
