   "comments": [
    "This course was absolutely amazing. Exploring and analyzing Black Politics throughout various movements to construct a longer narrative is always a difficult task but with Professor Gonda leading the way it is doable, enjoyable, and intellectually stimulating.",
    "Absolutely. The teacher and material are very engaging and entertaining. A must take.",
    "Gonda is leaving this year, which is shame because he was fantastic, my best professor even though he's actually a PhD student. Engaging discussions, fascinating self-driven papers, and the books are things you would want to read anyway. Eye-opening material on what really happened during the Civil Rights Movement. If its taught again with a different professor, I'd recommend checking it out because the content has potential if the prof can deliver on it.",
    "This was an awesome class! I feel like I have a much more solid base in the civil rights movement history than I did before taking this class. The books we read were interesting and informative, especially the book about Ella Baker. The two papers allowed me to focus on two different aspects of the movement that I was interested in and I'm glad the class was structured that way.",
    "Super interesting material, taught by a very knowledgable professor. Take the class!",
    "AFAM 328 was a really interesting class. The material gives you a fuller picture of the civil rights movement from all different sides. There is a lot of reading, but if you do all of the reading, class discussion is really fun and interesting.",
    "YESSSSS!!!Some of the things I learned in this class are things that I will never forget, and this is one of few classes at Yale about which I can confidently make that statement."
