    "The professor is clearly extremely knowledgable about the subjects addressed but needs to structure the class more soundly in order to actually convey his knowledge in a helpful manner. The lectures were scattered and sometimes repetitive. Most of the slides were examples of general theory that was often not clearly addressed. The stories being told were very cool, but how to harness that knowledge to do better work on our own was unclear.For most students at this level, much of the material was also repetitive of earlier classes. Either more in-depth theory or, at the very least, more complicated analysis of primary literature on the material would make the class more engaging.I believe the course would also benefit from more work--perhaps a midterm as well as a final, or a paper and a takehome.",
