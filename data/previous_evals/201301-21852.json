   "comments": [
    "German is a great language. I really enjoy it, despite my dislike for the curriculum.",
    "I would recommend this as an intermediate course to any student taking German (obviously). At least in my case, this was the course where I started to feel that I could speak and understand a passable level of German, perhaps thirty or forty percent of what I hear, or a bit more--though of course I'm not fluent yet, not dreaming in German or anything like that.",
    "Very similar to 110. More of the same.",
    "Yes! German is great. This class is really fun (even though the homework is not).",
    "If you did well in GMAN 110, you'll probably enjoy and benefit from taking this course. The curriculum isn't always well planned, the assignments can get a bit annoying, and the textbook (same for 110) doesn't make a lot of sense. As long as you have a good instructor, though, you'll absolutely be fine. German is a great language, if you have patience for its nuances.",
    "I would say definitely take it. It is a great class",
    "The class was mostly focused on grammar. The workload isn't too bad, although the homework is pretty irregular and can be hard to keep up with sometimes."
