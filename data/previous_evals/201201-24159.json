    "Don't take it.",
    "It was a good course yet too specific to fill a whole semester.",
    "The seminar is a great opportunity to delve deeply into the academic research on a topic that politicians and the general public throw around as a catch-all solution to any foreign policy issue. Professor Marinov is a good seminar leader and can spark some interesting discussions about the moral aspects of trade and about methodological issues in studying sanctions (and foreign policy tools in general). However, like most classes on such narrow subjects it can get a little repetitive and dry towards the end of the semester. It is a good class to take alongside more general international relations classes.",
    "This is a great way to study a single issue in great depth. Professor Marinov knows how to encourage students to think about many aspects of each issue that don\u0092t immediately meet the eye. He also is very responsive to student interest, and will direct class to accord with student interests.",
    "Take it. It's not a super heavy course and the readings are interesting so if you are at all interested in the subject matter you should do it!",
    "You will thoroughly understand economic sanctions.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it was extremely constructive in learning about economic sanctions even if it wasn't the most dynamically taught class.",
    "A worthwhile course if you are specifically interested in sanctions and would like to understand some of the theoretical grounding of the subject and academic assessments of their efficacy.Professor Marinov though is not a particularly strong professor. Poorly directed discussion and lack of accountability in doing the readings can be frustrating."
