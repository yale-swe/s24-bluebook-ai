    "Critical reading and thought, writing skills for organization and content",
    "Understand political theory",
    "This course is an incredible introduction to modern political theory. There is a wide range of thinkers covered, and you get a great sense of the history, and development of politics last couple centuries. Additionally, you learn to further develop the way that you write H&P essays.",
    "I think I really learned a lot about political theory. Some of the latter authors, particularly Du Bois, were extremely interesting and may guide my future studies and interests.",
    "This class improved my participation skills in a seminar-based setting. This course also improved my writing skills and taught me to write clear, analytical essays.",
    "I developed a greater capacity to critically examine historical texts in the context of current political systems. I grapped the whole semester with the question of how much impact theory actually has on the day to day workings of society.",
    "Better understanding of the political views and arguments of multiple authors Good comparitive analysis between different authors Main themes",
    "Critical reading, analytical skills. historical knowledge and skills. Thematic and conceptual understandings of Western political thought and historical movements."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is comprehensive, interesting, and informative. The extent of the readings is so dense that it can be hard to fully engage with or pay attention to an individual work or author. It could be made just a little bit lighter on the reading amount for deeper engagement and discussion.",
    "Excellent style of teaching with good balance of discussion and lecturing",
    "The breadth and speed of this course is, for me, the biggest strength and weakness. The speed and breadth allows you to cover an amazing scope of ideas. I think that the scope of DS as a whole is one of its most valuable qualities. However, that speed doesnt come without its difficulties.",
    "This course requires students to read a variety of authors, which strengthens one's foundation in the major works of the Western canon. However, because we cover about one author per week, we only gain a superficial knowledge of each of these authors, and often the works that we read may not be representative of other works the authors have written. Furthermore, this course requires students to read a substantial amount per week, but often over half the material the students read is not discussed in seminar or even appears on the final exam. Also, some readings were different from the syllabus and changed one or two days before the reading was due, which was due to irresponsible planning. Overall, the Directed Studies program requires more organization and standardization. Across all of Directed Studies, people have vastly different experiences across sections with different professors, though we are all taking the same course. Some students miss major discussion points of the work because the professors have such different areas of focus. There is also a lack of standardization about the essays. Each professor gives different prompts though we are all reading the same works. Each professor has a different vision for what the essays should look like, but this is different than the goal of Directed Studies which is for students to learn how to write a strong, standard analytical essay for Historical and Political Thought. But the views among the professors about how that should be executed varies greatly. I do recognize that it is impossible to completely standardize this and that each professor wants a degree of flexibility in how she teaches. However, the degree of variety is too great. We also all receive the same final, which is counterintuitive if we had different areas of focus in our seminar experiences.",
    "Strengths: Lots of text in one semester, you really learn a lot. Compared to the first semester of DS the material might be more germane to the modern word; you see the ideological clashes between authors manifest in the differences between many states in the modern world. Weakness: Since you deal with one text a week, you might not achieve a high level of depth with each.",
    "I loved the worksheets provided and the cohesive comprehension I felt like I gained of all the works and authors. Something I might have appreciated being different would have been a attempt to address how much impact each work had on the political workings of the time.",
    "Very good course!"

   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend DS H&P to another student provided that they are willing to dedicate the time to the reading and the papers. It is amazing to see the course of political thought across history, and Professor Renaud does a wonderful job at making that comparative analysis interesting.",
    "Definitely take it with Professor Renaud. Great teacher.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It is a fantastic continuation of the ideas of first semester.",
    "Definitely. I took DS largely because of the H&P syllabus and was not disappointed.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is interested in history or political science, but is unsure of where they want to focus her studies. Because this course offers a wide variety of different authors and areas of political thought, it will offer an overview of each field and give the student an idea of where she may want to specialize. This course, as a part of Directed Studies, will provide a strong foundation in the major works of the Western canon. I would also recommend this course to anyone who wishes to improve her writing, as this course requires three papers a semester in addition to six other papers from the other two Directed Studies courses. However, because these papers are only five pages and with the rush to write one paper a week, students cannot really explore the depth of these works in their writing.",
    "Definitely consider continuing DS. The second semester rounds out who historical and political thought in the Western world has evolved through the ages.",
    "Yes, if you want a study of historical theory. Not if you want a study of intellectual history or historical survey of the time period. Also, not if you don't want to only read white male political thinkers.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend this course because the seminar was extremely well structured, the professor guided our learning through helpful worksheets and the discussion of specific quotes from the readings and the class discussions were well-facilitated so that every student had the chance to contribute to the conversation. The professor was also very knowledgeable and gave useful historical background information and political analysis that helped me understand the readings."
