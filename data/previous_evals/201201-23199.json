    "yes. very good course",
    "I would recommend the class for someone with a History background or a penchant for military affairs. It is a nice topic in that it allows for a close case study of a single country rather than a region or functional topic. Thus, it provides greater level of detail."

    "yup",
    "I found this course incredibly helpful, especially the lectures. The readings for the seminar and the discussion were useful as well. I feel that I have come away with a much better understanding of German history, and I feel better equipped for my own research as well. In terms of the strength of the historical narrative and the intellectual agenda conveyed through the lectures and seminars, this course has been the best of my time so far at Yale. More than other courses, I came away with an understanding of the broader historical narrative, which is more difficult to obtain in a course structured by themes as opposed to chronology. I appreciated this approach very much and encourage Professor Tooze to continue to teach courses with this framework in the future."
