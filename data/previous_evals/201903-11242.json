    "I gained a deeper understanding of calculus through this course. This course especially focused on theorems and specific ways to determine derivatives, which I feel like gave me a deeper understanding of how derivatives are applicable to real life situations.",
    "I developed new insights into differential equations and improved my overall skills with calculus.",
    "Calculus level I.",
    "Calculus at a college level.",
    "Learned most of the skills taught in AP Calculus AB.",
    "I developed a better understanding of calculus and a better way of approaching different problems.",
    "I believe I mastered Calculus concepts both conceptually and technically.",
    "I gained a greater knowledge of the larger concepts behind calculus and added problem solving skills to my tool belt.",
    "I was taught how to use the theorems of calculus to solve real-world problems like the rate at which objects heat\/cool and how to optimize resources, given the amount of it available.",
    "I realized the opportunities provided at Yale for receiving help on concepts and units that you are struggling with. Also, I realized the more practice problems you do the more effective you become at knowing and understanding the material. I comprehend Calculus I a lot better than I did in high school because I actually had to learn and understand the theorems instead of just utilizing the formulas. The true and false questions were really really annoying, but I do feel like they better helped my learning.",
    "Newtons method Rulers method",
    "I developed my quantitative skills and I created a good work ethic. I not only learned math, but I also learned how to adapt to different teaching styles and how to effectively learn the material.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course's strength was that the class was a small class size, giving everyone the ability to frequently ask questions. I appreciated the way that the professor would make sure that our questions were answered before moving on to a new topic. The course could be improved by focusing on more applications of the materials that we were studying because it was hard to fully understand concepts without doing example problems (for example: learning how to take derivatives or form anti derivatives).",
    "The ximera biweekly homework assignments were sometimes too much and didn't really enhance my knowledge.",
    "This course is well organized. I dont like that your grade is primarily based on the 3 tests that you take throughout the semester.",
    "Strengths: course went really well and concepts were explained really well.",
    "I think that the structure of Yale math course overall could be improved. Most classes are very fast paced which does not work for everyone and even though there are options for office hours it can sometimes be hard to work meeting with professors into an already hectic schedule.",
    "I believe the structure of the course was appropriate, yet I believe that the grading of piece-sets was at times not equal among the sections.",
    "This course spent a good amount of time on each concept, not moving forward too fast or slowly. There were a lot of outside resources that helped students (extra coaching, peer tutors, review sessions).",
    "One of the biggest strengths of the course was that it had a lot of outside help offeredpeer tutors, office hours, special tutors.",
    "The strengths of this course is it helps you get accustomed to lecture style classes while still providing you with one on one sessions that are offered in seminar like classes. Furthermore, there is plenty of opportunities to further get help. The weaknesses of the course are the handouts provided because I think learning from writing notes are a lot more effective then relying on a handout with all of the information present. Furthermore, the weaknesses are the true and false questions without any explanation. The true and false questions that require you to provide an explanation at least gives the test taker a chance to explain his thought process and obtain some credit.",
    "Goes too slow",
    "This course was poorly taught. Only two of the instructors were actually professors the rest were grad students. I had the pleasure of having two of them (my first one left). This class is supposed to assume no previous calculus knowledge which is not how it was actually run. Most of the students in this course have taken calculus before, giving them a leg up on the rest of us who actually took the course with no previous experience. The instructors know this and teach the class as if you've already taken a calculus course, leaving those who haven't to struggle.",
    "This course offers a lot of extra help if you need it, but some of the lessons could be explained better. Sometimes the professor didn't make sure that we understood the material.",
    "Examples and notes were sometimes easier than what the class requested"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they have taken a similar level of calculus in high school. The course assumed calculus knowledge that otherwise would have been very difficult to learn in one semester as well as the applications taught. Overall, this is a good introductory course for calculus with very good peer tutors who helped aid the gaps in the class.",
    "Weekly workload not too bad, but the midterms and final were way too hard and very different than the type of work we did in class.",
    "If they are a first year and need the credit then yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I would definitely because it is a great course for anyone trying to master single variable calculus.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. This course is a good course to improve\/refresh calculus skills and prepare for future math classes.",
    "This course definitely teaches you a lot in a short span of time. If you are interested in refreshing\/learning calculus skills, this would be a great place to start. To successfully complete the course, be sure to ask for help with complicated concepts, as much of the course involves building on previously learned material.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student because it is not too challenging while remaining a good introduction to higher level mathematics. You can get a lot of help if needed.",
    "No, especially not if you took BC Calc in high school. Goes too slow.",
    "yes",
    "No, but you probably have to take it anyway. The workload is very heavy with three psets (one official pset and two online Ximera assignments) a week.",
    "Yes, great calc foundation."
