    "I love this class.",
    "It is a ton of work, but has been by far and away the most worthwhile class I have taken at Yale. You learn so much about companies, from their inception up until very late stages in their life. You also learn about what happens in board rooms and in bankruptcy. Take it if you want to learn the fundamentals of analyzing a business.",
    "Hands down. If you're interested in investment banking, private equity, hedge funds etc., it behooves you to take this class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in going into a career in investing and are prepared to do the work.",
    "You learn all about private equity investing from a guy who knows this material in practice.",
    "Best class at Yale. If interested in business\/finance, definitely take the course. Be prepared for the workload--it's heavy at the beginning but lightens up at the end--but definitely manageable. Knowing basic accounting\/modeling would be particularly helpful",
    "ECON456 is both the best course and hardest course I have ever taken at Yale. If you take this course, it will consume a lot of your time, and you will learn an incredible amount about private equity investing for that time. If you put in the work needed to do each reading closely and do each case well, you will have an excellent foundation on which to build your private equity investing acumen over time. Professor Schmertzler is an extremely high quality teacher and investor. He cares a lot about his students and will teach you a lot not only through his planned course material but also his anecdotes (which may also be planned course material). As a side note, modeling experience will definitely help, but its not entirely necessary if you have a solid understanding of accounting and are willing to put in a bit more work to be able to model well. If youre up for a great challenge, absolutely take this course.",
    "Take it if your willing to put in the work.",
    "Private Equity Investing was a challenging but ultimately rewarding course. Prof. Schmertzler was a phenomenal professor - easily one of the best (if not the best) professors I have had at Yale. He demands that you put in substantial effort and produce high quality work, but is also cognizant of and compassionate about the challenges of the course - he cares most about seeing the trajectory\/growth of your learning. Prof. Schmertzler is also very dedicated - he offered multiple opportunities throughout the semester to grab lunch or get together after class, where he would provide stories from his experience in banking\/PE\/VC\/running biotech companies, as well as give career guidance to anyone who requested it. I came into the class with minimal accounting or finance background but left with a thorough appreciation and understanding of the private equity industry. Note: if you are worried about lacking the requisite accounting\/modeling background, carefully go through Prof. Schmertzler's Accounting Appendix Chapter that he provides before the first week of class - it provides a solid foundation (also, as Prof. Schmertzler says, this course isn't meant to be a modeling course - the key takeaways he wants you to focus are NOT based on modeling but understanding the different underlying aspects that drive the value of a company). The workload starts out intense, with several weeks of LBO cases that can take 20+ hours; however, after that, the cases lighten up significantly. Overall, the course was exceptional in both its breadth and depth; the title of the course undersells the amount of content in the course, which covers early-stage startups, VC, growth capital, LBOs, debt, lending agreements, corporate structure, leadership, IPOs, and fund economics\/raising a fund. If youre interested in any of those areas, theres no better course (or professor) at Yale to take.",
    "Great course on private equity and even covers venture capital. Corporate finance is a prerequisite - you will be challenged even if you have a banking background",
    "Definitely recommend - absolutely take this class if you get in. The course is pretty demanding (~10 hours per week), but it's definitely worth your time. I don't have plans on going into private equity, but I'm extremely happy with how much I learned about analyzing investments overall. Professor Schmertzler is also fantastic - he has tons of experience, which he's happy to share in his stories, and he made class a pleasure to attend.",
    "This class is tons of work but will reward you with a good amount of practical business knowledge. It is not a training class for banking or PE. Instead, it teaches you more fundamental skills that will hopefully be relevant throughout your finance career."
