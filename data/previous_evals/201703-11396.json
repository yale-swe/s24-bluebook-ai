   "comments": [
    "I have learned so much about a field that I have never experienced before in one semester.",
    "I gained a general knowledge of furniture (woods, joinery, styles, trends) from this class. I was able to practice my public speaking through our weekly presentations.",
    "I learned to view the world around me more critically. I took furniture for granted for a large majority of my life, but now I am able to better understand its construction and purpose. I also now find it entertaining to identify pieces and think about their history.",
    "I became a much better writer",
    "I learned how to analyze a piece of furniture and draw from that analysis conclusions about broader trends in American society and history. I learned how to make my writing more clear and concise. Through class presentation I gained confidence in public speaking and I learned strategies for engaging the class in my presentations.",
    "I gained much greater appreciation for decorative arts and learned to consider art in a greater social context.",
    "presentation skills, knowledge of furniture and development of furniture, furniture jargon, writing skills and organization",
    "Learning the basics behind furniture. Never took a woodworking class in high school, and didn't feel under prepared taking this class. Learned about different time periods in american history by looking at furniture.",
    "So many! This course really teaches you how to interact with objects and care about something you had previously probably given very little thought to.",
    "This taught me how to examine and analyze material in depth. Also, taught me how to connect little tangible objects to the real world and how life is at that time in history."

   "comments": [
    "The course is interesting and the readings are not too long. Maybe if the course is given at a later time of the day, I would have enjoyed it even more.",
    "I think a strength of this course was definitely the level of student engagement required with the presentations. The structure of the class made it so that each of us had to be attentive and active, which also really allowed us to get to know each other much better. I overall really enjoyed the course but I think that a potential weakness could have been how little we outwardly discussed the readings each week. A lot of the information was relayed through student presentations, but it would have been nice to have ten minutes each week to really discuss the time period of study.",
    "The course is taught alongside a huge collection of pieces, which is a huge strength as students are able to interact with the pieces in person. A weakness is that some students never did the readings which did not help in class discussion at all.",
    "It is wonderful to be able to research and look at the individual pieces of furniture each week. However, as the class is a writing credit, it might have been helpful to make the written assignments a little bit longer.",
    "This course was very well designed. We covered three centuries of American furniture, but it did not feel rushed. The Weekly presentations keep me engaged and distilled the large information dump of an entire era of furniture down to a single more manageable piece. I honestly can't think of improvements for this course it really was incredible.",
    "I think the course is structured very well.",
    "Every student is given opportunities to express themselves in the classroom. Perfect amount of engagement and professor talking about the topics.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging, feels student-directed. Weaknesses: Readings are sometimes VERY long. Also, sometimes you have to go to Haas to read the books and I feel like those should be scanned in.",
    "Strengths: Great course, fun, interesting Weak: Repetitive"

    "Yes, this is the best art course I have taken so far.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It was fun and interesting and a great way to get to know other students.",
    "Yes, this is a very interesting course, it had a light work load, and I felt I learned to look at furniture in a brand new way.",
    "Yes! It is a course that one can't find anywhere else but Yale.",
    "Yes",
    "Take this class! It is a great opportunity to get to know a fascinating professor and work with a really interesting and valuable collection. You really will never look at furniture the same way again.",
    "My friends make fun of me because I talk about this course so much. Whenever some one asks me what my favorite course was without hesitation I say furniture. If this course were to run again I would tell every freshman I knew to take it.",
    "Yes, it exemplifies the diversity of resources that you can take advantage of at Yale.",
    "Definitely, Professor Cooke does an amazing job engaging his students. I gained a genuine interest in many of the case studies that we did and I feel as if I learned a lot on the subject as well as improved my writing.",
    "I definitely recommend this course. Professor Cooke is wonderful and does a really good job of explaining the material. Once you get into the groove of the class it becomes very fun and engaging with fellow peers. Enjoyed this class very much.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, great course for people who want to know a lot about the world through furniture."
