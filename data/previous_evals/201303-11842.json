    "Johannes is one of the sweetest people I have ever met! He is also an incredible artist (look his work up) and a well of good video art. My only regret with this class is that I didn't have more time to ask for more recommendations and watch more. Really crazy fascinating experimental greatness. Re: time, it's really really entirely as much of a time commitment as you want it to be. And on that note, the class is very self-directed.... So if you want to make good work, or you want to be exposed to a lot of great art, or you want to learn the programs, you will (putting in time, asking Johannes). Anyways, great great class and fantastic professor and you should take it if you're interested in video art!",
    "This is an unquestionably fun course; the professor is fresh and engaging and the material is digestible. However, about halfway through the semester, this class transforms from a class about the technical side of \"digital video\" to a class about \"video art.\" The problem is that, about halfway through the semester, the objective of the class changed from one of mastering the many different cameras and softwares (which we'd had very little time to learn--the class moves too quickly) to one of pleasing our professor. The professor is a visual artist himself, and seemed to care far more about our content than our ability to create it.In sum: the class moves to quickly, doesn't contain enough intermediary assignments to prepare us for the large final project, and needs to be re-focused (either on content or technical ability).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to other students as well. i believe for art students this course would give them a place to produce and experience in video making and also see a lot of highlights of video arts from the past."
