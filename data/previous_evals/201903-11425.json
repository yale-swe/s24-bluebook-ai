    "During this class, we read and discussed 20th century Arab writers and read from parts of their main works to gain insight into their ideas and points of view. We learned how to discuss issues facing the Middle East today through the lens of these ideologies and how to extract the main idea from complicated and sometimes obscure texts.",
    "I learned a lot about Middle Eastern politics in this class.",
    "We learned a lot about the diverse intellectual positions in the Arab world from the ottoman to the modern era. We explored organization of government and society, Arabism, looked at current affairs and nation building. My arab improved immensely in this course because we were reading more advanced texts and discussing it in Arabic.",
    "We learned about various Arab political thinkers and their ideologies. We also discussed historical and current political climates in the Middle East.",
    "Great introduction to a variety of Arab political thinkers. This class offered a number of authors and was interesting to read a variety of thought."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The selection of writers and variation of background of each of the writers was a strength in the class; we were able to cover thinkers from across the region and engage with questions such as the role of religion and government, Arab nationalism, and culture. Also, there was a really great class environment where we were challenged to think about hard topics in Arabic, yet also made to feel comfortable with messing up, knowing that we could work on concerns as a class. I think one of the weaknesses of the class was that sometimes we did not get to cover all of the readings and sometimes they could be quite difficult. Having highlighted sections in the last two readings was very helpful and possibly to be able to read more important passages, highlighting might be helpful (or alternatively, shorter passages?). In addition, especially with harder readings, it was not always helpful to do the discussion questions. If a reading will take two days, it may be better to have the discussion questions due after the first day so that there is an idea of what the topic is about.",
    "I loved how this class was a small seminar so the students got the opportunity to interact closely and learn more efficiently.",
    "The professor did a wonderful job making sure that students really understood the material, and would even read the parts that were confusing with us in class. I think the course can be even better if the discussion questions we did after each reading were actually addressed in class so that we had time to talk about the readings and frame them with guiding questions. Having students prepare different discussion questions each week might be a fun way to do this.",
    "Strengths: I think this is a great class that has interesting material and facilitated very engaging discussions about the politics of the Arab world. The people were great and the class was fun, and the professor provided great insight. Weaknesses: Some of the readings were too hard and at times the weekly responses and readings were too time consuming.",
    "I liked the reading selections. However, it was really hard often and sometimes the scans were not the best quality. In class discussions and going over the readings were good, but I would have appreciated more of an emphasis on a few key points of each author."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to another student who is very confident in their Arabic skills and is interested in Arabic political thought. It can be a bit challenging at times, and not necessarily a class that is directly mean to improve Arabic grammar knowledge.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Yes, anyone who already has a solid grasp of the grammar and feels like they can understand a lot of what they read\/hear in the news would benefit from this course in terms of language improvement. It is also great that students get to read a lot of primary texts that laid the foundation for a lot of arab thought in the modern day, and seeing how these texts apply to the current context is interesting, as well.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. I think it was a great class and I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the discussions we had and the conversations it sparked among classmates. The material is interesting and deals with important issues. There are readings and reading responses that can at times be time consuming, but the major assignments of the class are two essays that weren't too hard to write. But also just a warning that some readings are very hard. But really good class overall.",
    "Definitely--the class itself is really hard, but very engaging and grading is forgivable. Sarab is a wonderful professor who cares a lot about her students' learning and this was one of the best Arabic electives."
