   "comments": [
    "It's a class you have to get through if you want to take acting classes or major in theatre. That's why most people take it. That said, you can find ways to engage with the material and make the class worth your time.",
    "Only take this course if you have to for the Theatre Studies major. The plays that you are barely covered at all. Instead, The class covers more of a loss of the art history and the important figures in theater history. This is interesting in itself but comes off as just disjointed as the class is trying to cover so much. The class is thus ultimately unenjoyable.",
    "If you want to know about theater history or are a theater major, yes. Otherwise probably not.",
    "I wouldn't recommend THST 111 to anyone who's not taking it as a prerequisite for the theater studies major. I imagine there are much more specific theater studies, and even English classes, that offer the kind of in-depth text and historical study I was looking for that I'd sooner recommend to someone.",
    "Professor Dorfman is an engaging lecturer, but the structure of her lectures is very difficult for note-taking. The exam format is really the worst: there are \"clusters\" which can include anything from a definitive quote from a major play, to a picture of some playwright's ex-lover that was upon on the screen for a few seconds. Studying for the midterm and final was extremely (and unnecessarily!) difficult, and as a result many students got grades that they did not feel they deserved.",
    "So. If you are looking at taking this course, I am going to assume that you have already looked at or taken THST 110. Well, this course is basically the same thing, only now over a much shorter period of time historically and less clear definitions. The tests are difficult, the reading is exhausting (though occasionally interesting), and, once again, the content is largely conceptual, not interactive, and quite honestly not what a performer\/director\/practical theater person might want from a theater class. For instance, Stanislavsky, the father of modern acting, is never brought up. At all. But, despite all, that the course is required for the major and you will definitely learn something. It'll just be more art history than actual theater. But if you want this, if you want to be a theater major, if you want to have a profession in the performing arts, if theater is your passion, than nothing I've said could possibly change your mind. Nor should it. Follow your dreams. And if this class will help you achieve those dreams, then by all means, take it. If not, perhaps it's time to look elsewhere."
