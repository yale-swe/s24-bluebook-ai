   "comments": [
    "The course is well-organized, with the first half of the semester being devoted to design issues and the second half on statistical issues. It is a good introductory course, but did not go into the depth that students who will eventually be working in this area might require. However, since YSPH offers an Advanced Clinical Trials course, I think this course is fine as is since students from a variety of backgrounds\/divisions take it.Several guest speakers were invited to the class to lecture on specific topics. It would be interesting to have an additional speaker from the FDA in future classes, since a lot of class time was spent on discussing the role of the FDA. Dr. Makuch did an excellent job of integrating the more practical applications of clinical trials during the lectures, and spent a lot of time talking about current issues in the field. Overall, good course.",
    "This course is quite good.",
    "This course was good, however there was a lack of cohesion between the lectures, readings, and assignments. For example, the assignments often times did not correspond with the reading.",
    "The course topic is interesting and the readings were relevant, although the more technical readings were difficult to follow and not helpful to me. The instructor has a wealth of knowledge and more importantly experience that truly brings the course materials to life. His examples of clinical trials he either was involved with or knew about really made the course materials relevant and understandable to me.",
    "The course is good. If more papers and topics for discussion can be provided, it will be better.",
    "My overall evaluation of this course is very good. I liked the contest of the course and the way it was conducted. I liked that many examples were provided to support the theory.",
    "This is a good and important course for those of us who want to do clinical research. Topics covered were well-chosen and gave a good overview of important concepts. A more useful structure might be to assign the trials referenced in the lecture as reading, or have us read and critique the trials before the lecture, to get us thinking and reading critically. Also, the homework in this class is useless in terms of gaining knowledge. It is graded as \"completed or not\" and therefore the actual answers you give do not matter. A couple of times there were comments on my answers, but often it was just checked off as complete. The TA's answer solutions were not helpful and often seemed incorrect (see below). A better approach would be for us to actually hand in more extensive, weekly homework assignments that are graded, more like a standard biostatistics course, so that we are more responsible for the material and can use the opportunity to learn the material better. These homeworks could also count for more of the grade, which would help as well, because the current grading scheme is heavily skewed toward the poorly-worded midterm and final (see below).",
    "interesting course, but a little bit difficult to get high grade and get everything in class",
    "This class was not at all what I expected it to be-- this was realized after the midterm, when the material we were tested on did not really reflect homework or lectures. Although open book and open note, the midterm and final did not include material covered\/stressed in class, nor did it really test homework skills.The homework wasn't too demanding, however, there was no real feedback from the TA or professor. There was also no guidance as to what should be studied for the midterm or final.I was disappointed in the class, since I did not feel like I really gained much knowledge, other than what was read from the textbook.",
    "The course was full of real world examples\/applications and incorporated a good range of topics relevant in clinical trials. A strength of the course was that it required students to teach themselves which was important in solidifying the information and developing proficiency with the material. The main weakness in my opinion was that reading and homework assignments were often not posted in a timely manner. This improved somewhat later in the semester but I think that in the future it would be helpful to have all reading assignments and and homework assignments listed from the onset.",
    "Clinical Trials is unlike any other class I have taken at YSPH. I thought the subject matter was very interesting and I have learned a great deal about the process and regulations of conducting clinical trials. However, I thought that the class material could have flowed better from week to week. It seemed we were jumping from topic to topic quite quickly.",
    "While the material was interesting, it slowed down considerably in the second half of the course. I think it would have been possible, and more useful, to have covered additional material. Also, I think the work would have been more meaningful if presented in a more realistic format. For example, provide students with a study and ask them to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses.Also, I feel it should be stated that the final exam was not reflective of the material covered in class.",
    "The course is a good overview of the fundamentals of clinical trials. The first half was primarily descriptive, while the second half of the semester focused more on analysis, which involved more biostats and SAS programming. So people who shop the class should be aware that there is a significant amount of biostats involved, but not until the second half of the course. The midterm and final are open book, making it easier and less stressful, and the weekly homeworks are graded pass\/fail. The book was very detailed and proved to be a helpful resource when the powerpoint slides were confusing or lacking. I enjoyed the first guest lecture (claude petit from BI), since it helped us gain a industry perspective on some of the issues, but the second guest lecture (Maria) was way over my head and should be scrapped (or at least should not focus so much on the statistics).",
    "useful",
    "The strenghs of the class were the homeworks, class discussions and office hours. Did not find any major weakness.",
    "i wish the powerpoints were more specific with regards to the matierals that the prof wants us to learn. powerpoints are just outlines and not specific enough to guide self-study",
    "The professor had great real life storeis which enhanced the course. However, I did not feel that the concepts were well explained which made the homework difficult.",
    "I love this class the most out of all my classes this semester. Very interesting material and I definitely enjoyed makychs little FDA stories here and there. Moderate workload but very useful.",
    "Advantage: flexible and interesting.disadvantage\uff1aOut of class, the instructor is too busy to have adequate time with us .",
    "The class was an awesome multidisciplinary class that allowe for the variety of strengths of students to show and benefit thir peers. The class should be repeated or mimicked in subsequent years since every student benefited and their perspective of the subject was enhanced in a unique way.",
    "This was a very interesting course, however the final was extremely difficult and way too many mathematical questions were asked that were not discussed in class and were not on any of the homework assignments thus making many of the final exam questions extremely difficult to do. Also, the SAS portions of the class were difficult and I think that there should be TA lab sessions for those couple of weeks where SAS is required for the homework.",
    "This course did not teach me as much as I would have liked. The lecture slides are very disorganized. The only useful parts of the class were homework sets, which were not graded or gone over in class. The final gave us problems that we had not encountered before. Though that is \"fair game,\" I expected the class to prepare me more for the final. I was not clear how the course was structured or what was expected of the students. The book is not an easy read and has quantitative jargon that bogs it down."

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch has years of experience conducting clinical trials and it was apparent in the course. Discussions of currentissues (i.e., Avastin) was interesting and helpful in applying the material presented in class. He was well-prepared for each class and the class material was presented in a clear, organized manner.No specific comments related to improvement.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Professor Makuch is very good at teaching.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch has a wealth of experience that really makes the course materials come alive; however, the powerpoint slides were very hard to follow at times and and the explanations of the key statistical concepts were lacking.I think Dr. Makuch thought we could figure it out on our own, but I felt I could benefit from his walking us through some of the key calculations and interpretations of the SAS output. Most other students I talked to felt the same way.I think the homework assignments should have been reviewed IN CLASS for a better understanding of the material. I didn't make sense to put all the time into the homeworks and then never go through them.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He can explain some concepts very well.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is very knowledgeable and knows how to interact with students to draw their attention. I found his teaching interesting, engaging and sometimes funny. One weakness, he is not too good with troubleshooting computer problems but otherwise he is excellent.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch is a smart biostatistician who clearly has experience and expertise in the world of clinical trials and regulatory affairs. He sometimes assumes that his students have more biostatistics experience than they actually do, and therefore does not always explain his methods or the statistical tests as clearly as one would like. He can be condescending at times. His tests are unfair (I do not use that word lightly) and poorly-worded, though he does not think that the wording is poor and therefore does not give helpful clarifications of the wording. The final exam for this term, for example, contained questions on calculating statistics and variances that we never covered in class. Questions were worded in a way that made the desired power and significance levels unclear -- generally, those are values that are easy to discern from the question stem. The examinations, which account for 90% of the grade, are only moderately correlated with the material that was taught in the course.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0nice and funny guy!",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I think that the professor should cover in lecture what he plans to test the class on, or at least indicate what is important to know. We were all very upset with his teaching style after the midterm and especially the final.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The professor was very knowledgeable and did a great job of tying in real world examples\/applications. The only suggestion I have would be to incorporate more in class problem examples. Although homework solutions were provided they often just gave the answer with little demonstration of the steps taken to arrive to the answer.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I particularly appreciated Dr. Robert Makuch's personal anecdotes in the field of clinical trials. His many years of experience was most helpful in understanding and applying the material. Occasionally, the anecdotes distracted from the material. More structure to the lectures would have been nice.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The professor, while knowledgeable, was extremely inaccessible. He had no office hours and did not respond to email.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He's a good, knowledgeable professor, with a relevant background in clinical trials. As such, he has many stories and examples of the different aspects of clinical trials. Because of this, however, he is known to go off on tangents for 30-40 minutes. The stories and examples he gives are very interesting, though, and I would prefer to listen to those than to his powerpoint lectures, which can be dry at times. Despite his tendency to go off on tangents, we did make it through all the lectures, without it feeling rushed, except perhaps the last lecture on data monitoring committees. His midterm was fair but the final was definitely more challenging. I wouldn't say it was unfair, but it was unexpected since it emphasized topics which were not emphasized in class. The homework assignments were fair, but they were almost never provided a week ahead of the deadline (which they were supposed to be). Instead we would get them a couple days before they were due. Even though they were pass\/fail, this still made it stressful to get it in on time. Answer keys to the homework were also often posted long after they were due, including the day before the final.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0He's great.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0I was very happy with the professor's availability to interact with students during and outside of classroom. Also going over the midterm was very helpful to further our understanding.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0should talk about the details on the slides more and guide us through actual examples",

    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Lovely and smart",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Very good in teaching, even better if spend more time answering questions.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0The instructor was dedicated and passionate about the course and she was willing to adapt and morph the class as the semester continued.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Great instructor and very interesting to listen to. He clearly knows what he is talking about. However, I don't think he is very sensitive to if students are not understanding the material or if questions on the homework were understood or not.",
    "Instructor: Robert Makuch \u00a0Dr. Makuch has extensive experience in clinical trials and loves to talk about his past work and experiences, which are interesting. However, the basic concepts are not taught well and he lectures very colloquially, assuming that we have had experience with clinical trials. Lectures often do not follow the already messy powerpoints and begin covering the material after half an hour of digression after class begins."

    "I didn't have many interactions with the TA, Janky Patel. I e-mailed her with one question regarding homework but never received any response.",
    "The TA's job in this class was essentially to post homeworks and lectures on classesV2, and post solution sets for the homeworks. There were no separate sessions taught by the TA. At times, her method of calculating the homework solutions was unclear, and a couple of times I think she was actually incorrect. I would say that there was no added value to having a TA in this course, which is unfortunate because a good TA can really be helpful. Perhaps restructuring the course with proper homeworks, as noted above, and potentially even separate TA sessions (every other week?) would be helpful.",

    "This is an introductory clinical trials course that covers the following major topics (but not limited to): randomization, study design, sample size, and statistical analysis issues. There was also an introductory lecture on longitudinal data analysis. This is an appropriate course for students in all divisions, but like mentioned above, BIS students who are interested in the more theoretical aspects of clinical trials dealing with sample size, analysis, etc. should consider taking the Advanced Class. Overall, I would recommend the course",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to students who are interested in clinical trials.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, with the caveat that they should be prepared to figure much of the statistical concepts out on their own. The readings at times were also quite technical, which makes sense for biostatistics students, but not necessarily for the rest of us.",
    "I will recommend it especially to some physicians to get an idea of clinical trials.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students who want to learn about designs of clinical trials, some basic statistics to compute sample size, power, significant levels. The course is well organized, informative with many examples.",
    "This is a good course in which to learn about the design and conduct of clinical trials. Dr. Makuch is a good lecturer, as are the guest lecturers that he brought in. Unfortunately, the homeworks are a joke and the exams are poorly-worded and only moderately reflective of the content covered in the lectures. This course could be improved by making the homework more prominent, and by re-designing the examinations to more highly correlate with what is actually covered in class.",

    "Nice overview and introduction to clinical trials.",
    "Clinical trials is a course that outlines the planning, process, and regulations involved in a clinical trial. After completing this class, students should be able to understand and plan out a clinical trial.

    "This course was an introduction to practice of clinical trials and the interactions between private companies and theFDA.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about clinical trials in this course, but you also have to be somewhat self-motivated if you really want a good grasp of the material -- that means reading the book chapters, and going over the lecture slides. You can get by in this class without doing those thingssince the exams are open-book, open notes, but you will get more out of it if you do the readings and absorb the material and make sure to fully understand the homework assignments.",

I found the classes interesting and the book pretty good, however, I missed the connection between what we were supposed to know and what was the most important to extract from the course because the evaluation process was based in finding the best formulas to calculate sample sizes and Z values.I though that there are much more important issues than formulas and tables to be discussed about clinical trials in practice, and actually it was discussed in many classes, so that is why I think the course missed focus.I also wished it has had some paper discussion in groups and more information about how to builda clinical protocol.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course.",
    "This course does not do a great job of preparing students for working in clinical trials. It was disorganized and did not give us much practice doing problems in clinical trials. I would have gained more from a different course."
