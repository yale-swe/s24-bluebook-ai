    "This is a great course on all of Milton. Rogers has a knack for weaving threads through all of Milton's writing-- from his prose to the most famous passages of Paradise Lost.",
    "knowledge of Milton's major works",
    "I loved this class, and I think the thing I took away is an understanding of how older literature connects to new.",
    "How to read volumes of Extremely Serious blank verse with a healthy bit of levity. Tons of googling Biblical and Greek allusions, fervently hoping Milton turns out to be a feminist, and writing thesis statements based on whether lines are enjambed or not.",
    "I learned how to think critically about John Milton's works. I observed themes and patterns in Milton's works that I hadn't previously considered, and was exposed to literary and psychological analyses of his works.",
    "Good breadth of Milton exposure. I gained a sense of how to intensively study a single artist."

    "great class! Professor Rogers is a very engaging and approachable lecturer.",
    "John rogers is phenomenal teacher, and the lectures are very engaging.",
    "An enjoyable class, with manageable and well-organized readings.",
    "The class was very well organized and humorously delivered. I think this class relies on lecture slides to get its messages across (which works, in large part), but a deeper student engagement with course material might be facilitated by more question-and-answer sessions during lecture, or small student discussions at the end of each class.",
    "The course is well paced and the readings and lectures are great, I could have done with more study of Milton criticism, though."

   "comments": [
    "I absolutely recommend this class! Prof. Rogers is so charming, and more importantly, his lectures are fantastic. He takes care to put forward an original, often daring argument for each lecture--and whether or not you agree with his argument, this style 1) allows Rogers to weave together great amounts of material from Milton and secondary sources in each lecture and 2) provides a model for the sort of criticism\/creative argumentation that makes for great papers. I truly adore Prof. Rogers' style and recommend it strongly, especially to seasoned English majors who want a meatier course (though not necessarily harder) for their pre-1800 req.",
    "Professor Rogers is brilliant and interesting in lectures. One of the best professors in the English department. Even if you don't particularly like Milton, Rogers makes the subject engaging. But it is a lecture so you will mostly be interacting with a TA, which can be hit or miss so if you don't thrive in section environments then I might not recommend the class.",
    "I would recommend this course because John Rogers is entertaining; however, if you're just an interested party (i.e., you're not using the course for WR credit or for an English major), there is a version of it online.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to students interested in delving into Milton's work, as well as his biography and psychology. I learned a ton not only about Milton's poetry and the poetic tradition in general, but also about the social, political, and religious contexts of 17th century England. Definitely worth the larger reading load.",
    "Only if you really like reading Milton\/17th c poetry",
    "yes - good to develop familiarity with important canonical poet",
    "Yes",
    "It's probably a good idea to have some familiarity with Milton first and know that you have at least passing interest in his work, because a semester is a long time to be stuck with a poet after you realize you hate him. And Milton is the type who inspires great passions on either side. But I love him and this class made me love him even more, so I recommend!",
    "Yes, if you're an English major and would like a lecture course; Yes, if you appreciate John Milton's works. Milton is a curious poet and John Rogers is a fun professor. The combination of the two made this lecture an entertaining spectacle.",
    "Yes, the lectures are fascinating and engaging and I got a lot out of the course."
