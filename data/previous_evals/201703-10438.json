    "-How to operate a DSLR camera, relevant tech knowledge on how cameras function -General lighting knowledge\/studio lighting -Photoshop skills: curves, masks, hue-sat, selective color, black and white, sharpening, and more -A working knowledge of the history of photography and well-known artists that work in the medium -Language to talk about photographs and formally analyze them -An eye for composition\/framing, and more attentive detail to colors (editing skills) -Sequencing photographs to construct narratives or string them together",
    "A new way of seeing and thinking about the world. This is not a class about taking photos as much as it is a class about learning to see poetry in the mundane and significance in the overlooked.",
    "I further developed my photography skills by shooting more and studying a number of photographers and their works. I developed technical skills in editing within Adobe Bridge and Photoshop, as well as, in printing photographs for exhibitions and critiques. I also gained insight into how to discuss my work, critique other's work, and design a project.",
    "This course was not your average introduction to digital photography class. Instead of just learning how to upload photos from your camera and do basic adjustments, I was able to really learn from an artist on how to \"see\" through the eyes of a photographer.",
    "Learned about what makes a good photo and the basic tools of Photoshop.",
    "Learned fhe basics of photoshop and taking photos.",
    "Technical photography skills, photographic seeing, photoshop skills, thinking creatively",
    "How to use my DSLR on manual settings. How to engage with photographs beyond just pointing and shooting, but actually understanding how I'm representing a subject through my artistic choices. How to use Photoshop and edit photos - particularly with regard to colour casts and using masks. How to talk about photographs, beyond just describing what I see, but also learning how to describe how a photograph functions."

   "comments": [
    "Really a fantastic course. Strengths are the good mix between tech knowledge and art history\/critical analysis that was taught. Perhaps there could have been more of a focus on the technical aspects of working with the camera as I would have liked to learn more tools to use in photoshop. At times it felt like there was a lot of focus on art analysis and critique, which while incredibly important to get everyone on the same page, also took away from time to learn these computer tools. But I think on the other hand, the stuff we learned on how to look at photos, how to talk about them, and things like form and composition, might be more life-enriching in a way than the technical knowledge such as photoshop. Ka-Man and the TFs (Kanthy and Evelyn) were fantastic, and really invested in helping us grow artistically. I appreciated the time they put into this class as well.",
    "Printing photos was a pain and probably the least enjoyable part of the course. Though I ultimately was proud of making good prints, it's not really something I cared that much about honing as a skill as it's usefulness is pretty limited outside of a photo class. I would have preferred to spend more time on learning photoshop techniques or critiquing and studying other photographers' works.",
    "I appreciated the assigned readings and projects in the class. They progressed nicely and set us up to be able to create and work on our own projects for the second half of the semester. One of my favorite parts of the course was viewing other photographers' work. By viewing a diversity of works from Vivian Maier to William Eggleston and from Rinko Kawauchi to Philip-Lorca diCorcia, I gained insight into the versatility of the camera and drew inspiration for my own photographic work. While I definitely improved over the course of the semester, I think something that my classmates and I struggled with was identifying and correcting color casts. Perhaps there might be some activity that could help reinforce this concept even more. I also would have liked to learn about tiling up\/creating test strips sooner in the semester, so that I wouldn't have wasted as much paper during printing in the early parts of the semester.",
    "This course is impeccably structured, with challenging projects spread throughout the semester, and lectures are always fresh and interesting, because they range differently from learning about many artists' work to working in Photoshop, to peer activities like editing. There is also clear feedback given that really makes you improve as an artist, not just as a \"picture taker\". In addition, the diverse assignments really help you identify your weaknesses and in turn fix those issues and improve.",
    "This was a very hands on course that requires multiple hours of work a week. Preparation for photography critiques are not as good as they should be and it felt more like an intermediate class than a beginner class in that regard, as students are expected to display a high level of work.",
    "professor was obviously very knowledgable and skilled and passionate about photography, however I think her expectations and standards for the students in this intro level class were a little too high. it put a lot of pressure on me as a student when it was just an introduction course for me to learn more about a subject i enjoyed. it got to be so stressful to the point that it became less enjoyable of a subject to me throughout the semester which is not what i expected. additionally, sections for this course varied so much in workload as I spoke to my friends in other sections of the class and i found that really unfair. also the professor was very unclear on what she expected but then got upset when we did not meet her ambiguous expectations.",
    "Strengths: Numerous assignments that get you to practice very specific and particular skills. Variety in class - sometimes looking at photo slides, sometimes working on Photoshop etc. Weaknesses: Absolutely no feedback was given throughout the semester and so it was very difficult to know where you were sitting grade-wise."

    "Amazing course! Take dig photo, and take it with Ka-Man. My only regret is that I wish I would have taken this sooner at Yale. You learn how to use a DSLR camera, photoshop, continuous lighting and inkjet printing. Ka-Man is a fantastic instructor who is incredibly invested in her students. The work for this course is also a different sort than other courses at Yale College, and the assignments for photography never felt like a burden. Plus Ka-Man is great about prioritizing students' self-care, health and safety. I would suggest that students take this course for a letter grade, rather than credit\/d. Though I'm not sure what my grade in this class is, I think it's hard to half-ass an art class and it's better to just put all the effort you can into the course -- that's the only way you'll get a lot from it. Photography is a considerable time-commitment and also costs a lot of $$$, but if you plan ahead for this, this sacrifice is totally worth it ***I'd suggest making sure to apply for grants in the beginning of the semester to fund the course, as the deadlines come up quick*** I also met some incredible classmates and MFA students through this course, and it helped introduce me to more events and resources at the art school.",
    "This class will probably change how you see the world and how you think. Take it.",
    "This course was a fantastic introductory course to digital photography. Starting with the basics of aperture and shutter speed, students were introduced to the fundamentals of digital photography and by the end of the semester were able to produce a 15-photograph series from a self-designed project. Although I had already been photographing for years, I found myself growing as a photographer from viewing professional work, my classmates photographs, taking more photographs and learning how to process and print my photos. While the course is a lot of work, it is fun work and I found it much better alternative to problem sets and other types of traditional homework. I also made a lot of great friends in the class, which was an added bonus!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course!!",
    "If you are interested in taking Intro to Digital Photography, take it with Ka-Man. You actually learn so much about art and being an artist in her class, and it is such an interesting class. She is not afraid to give you honest feedback, and because of this you grow so much as a photographer in this class. It is more than learning how to take pictures, this class will teach you about the whole process, from \"photographic seeing\" down to printing and learning how to participate in critiques, and is such an excellent class. Ka-Man is fantastic, and it is super valuable to learn from an artist herself.",
    "This course is great if you want to get a basic idea of how to operate a DSLR camera and how to use Photoshop.",
    "If you are prepared to put in hours of work on things that focus on the smallest details of color correcting photos and taking photos then yes. Don't take this class if you're going to slack off because the level of expected work is high and you will get railed during critiques if you are not prepared. The class was a bit subjective with regards to evaluation of work, but by the end, I do feel as I've learned the basics on photography.",
    "Would recommend, Ka-Man is an excellent professor. One warning being though that the cost of this class exceeds just the lab fee, printing is rather expensive. Overall, I truly enjoyed the class and learned a ton about improving my own photography.",
    "Good photography class but was not really an intro in my opinion, especially if you take it with Ka-man. She has very high expectations for her students and is usually very unclear about these expectations but then somehow expect you to reach them even though they are ambiguous and you have no clue what she wants. Also she is not very supportive of your artistic choices and gives you very subjective judgments on your work which may be helpful in learning the technical side of photography, but stressed me out a lot and put a lot of pressure on me and restrictions on how I felt like I could express my artistic voice. Also, keep in mind this class, while it's not very intellectually challenging as an art class, it IS A LOT OF WORK. At least 200+ pictures a week as well as multiple contact sheet submissions of you pictures at least once, maybe twice, a week. Also a lot of work to edit your critique pictures.",
    "If you're interested in photography and want to learn how to not only take photographs and use a DSLR, but also how to understand the function of a photograph and how to talk about them, take this class. Warning, it is a lot of work and unlike other classes where anytime spent doing work is most likely productive in some way, that's not the case with photography. You can spend many hours shooting and not come out with anything you like."
