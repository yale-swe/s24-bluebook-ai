   "comments": [
    "A decent class. Readings were interesting and class discussion, for the most part, was also engaging. Prof. Svolik is clearly knowledgeable but often can be dismissive of students' comments if they don't fit in exactly with the point he's trying to make. That's helpful when comments might lead the class completely off topic but restricted us from discussing some other interesting aspects of the readings. The midterm paper was short and fun to write - a 5 page review of a book from a list Svolik provides.",
    "YES! Take it if you get in, even if you are only mildly interested in democratization theory. The course is extremely relevant to international affairs.",
    "Take it!",
    "Take this course. Prof. Svolik is a great professor who is a strong grasp of the politics and science in political science. You will come away after 12 weeks knowledgable of the current debates about the efficacy and sustainability of authoritarian regimes. A must take for anyone interested in actually learning how political scientists do political science.",
    "yes. i'd emphasize that there is a fair bit of writing to do, but if you want to do it and like the subject material, then take the class. its literally a paragraph response to each reading a week (and there are around 4 readings a week), and then a mid term and a final. not a lot of writing at all. i did not find it hugely difficult (nor did many of my friends in the class), bu ti think that is more a function of the class attracting people who are so excited by the subject matter, they don't realize (or get dismayed by) how demand it is.",
    "Yes. Take it if you have any interest in the inner-workings of authoritarian regimes. This course will not only teach you a lot of things but also reveal irrational expectations often held about dictators and the politics surrounding them.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to students interested in politics around the world and especially authoritarian regimes. It definietly opens one's eyes to the world outside of Western democracy, which I think is more dominant and important to understand the world.",
    "Be prepared to read more than you would in a typical class and think critically about the reading. I would highly recommend this class because I learned so much beyond what I could anticipate at the start."
