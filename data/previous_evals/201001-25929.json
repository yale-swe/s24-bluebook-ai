   "comments": [
    "You read all the fundamental texts of Latin American intellectual debates. It's very relevant. It's a lot of reading, but not too much, and if you don't finish it all, it's no big deal.",
    "I would recommend it but advise not to save reading for the night before. I would also recommend getting to know the other students in the class and to be comfortable with them so that discussions open up.",
    "Yes, would definitely recommend to another student. This class is important for anyone interested in Latin America, but also for anyone interested in issues of nation-building, modernity, colonialism and post-colonialism.",
    "Take it. For the Fanon readings.I knew zero about Haiti, a country which has been of great importance in the formation of so many liberal ideas in the West. that was coolTwo short papers. Why not.",
    "It's everything you need to know to sound intelligent and offer an educated opinion when talking about Latin America. The class goes beyond the poverty and crime statistics that riddle a lot of U.S conceptions of the region and forces you to contend with the profound history of ideas that makes up Latin America's intellectual continuum. If you enjoy sitting in a class talking about Marxist aesthetics or the fallacies of the Western canon, if you enjoy the company of kooky people with the most ridiculous backgrounds coming together to discuss the psychic trauma of colonialism and the place of the intellectual in society, thus course is for you. TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! Sit back and be AMAZED!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone hoping to understand Latin America. Although the Latin American studies department is a bit small, this is one of the classes that students cannot afford to miss. You essentially learn about political philosophy, but its not longer about Hobbes, Locke, or Marx, instead its about Latin America's very own political philosophers. You analyze debates that have shaped society in Latin America such as the role of the intellectuals, the relationship of the continent with Europe, the creation of socialism, and many more. This class has thus far been my favorite at Yale. It's incredible to read texts by Bolivar, Mariategui, Guevara and many more, and then to discuss them in class is even more exciting since Professor Fradinger has an excellent ability to make you think critically about intellectual debates."
