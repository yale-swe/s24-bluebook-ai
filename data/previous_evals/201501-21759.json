    "If you like Brad, you'll like this class. Beware, it is a sizable amount of reading every week, as well as reading responses. Not as work-light as 183. Fun!",
    "If you haven't taken a class with Brad before, you should definitely shop 183 before you take this one. If you have taken a class with him, then you know what you're getting in for and you know whether you're interested or not. It's a fantastic class, but quite unlike most other course offerings here.",
    "Take 183 first.",
    "I assume you have taken CPSC 183 (if not, take that course first). You know whether you like professor Rosen's teaching style or not, and that's all you need to know when you decide whether to take this course. The only difference is that CPSC 185 is smaller, more intimate, and ultimately an even more fun class.",
    "More work than 183 and maybe save til you're older so you can appreciate it more, but if you've taken 183, just what you'd expect. Amazing.",
    "It's ridiculous amounts of fun, and you learn a lot without even realizing it. Brad is incredible. Unlike any class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "I'll say it again - you will learn more about life and law than in any other course at Yale. Oh and not to mention have the time of your life while doing so. TAKE IT. PS I've never been friends with my professor before (nor really wanted to...), but Brad is on another level.",
    "A super interesting, low work seminar. Take 183 first and if you like Brad, then 185 is a must.",
    "If you liked 183, you'll like 185. It's the Brad show but with even more Brad since it's a seminar. Super chill class, interesting readings and discussions. Take it if you can.",
    "Yes!",
    "TAKE IT. TAKE IT NOW. Discussions are always fun, Brad rocks, the assigned readings and cases are super interesting, the workload is definitely manageable, and Brad rocks. The weekly reading responses can seem burdensome at first, but when you're writing about topics like privacy law in the world of tech, you'll find it easy and enjoyable to write on whatever your thoughts are each week."
