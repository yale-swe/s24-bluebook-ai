    "Great class for art and non-art majors alike--though so much depends on who your teacher is. I had Natalie Westbrook, and it was fantastic. But others might be different. With Natalie, there was usually homework, though it was usually very reasonable, one or two drawings. The only time when there was a lot of hw was for the final project, when we had to do three regular drawings and then one huge drawing four times the size of a normal one.The class can get tricky, but it's a fun and challenging experience--and taking an art class at Yale is more than worth it",
    "Highly recommend",
    "Take it with Natalie. She is fantastic and ensures you come away loving to draw!",
    "Professor Westbrook's basic drawing class was excellent, because it was straightforward and addressed the main areas in which you would want to improve as an amateur. We began with basic hand-eye coordination and command, and simple shapes and lines. We moved towards perspective, and then began to deal with shading and depth. We ended the term on a more abstract and creative note. The progression was good and slow, but it seemed like everybody improved quite a lot. Honestly, I am quite relieved that I did not take some of the other sections, as it looked like they jumped around with much more complicated things and did not really stick to simple drawing as much as our class did. If you are looking for a basic drawing class that matches its title and will help you improve a ton, I definitely recommend Professor Westbrook.",
    "You get out of this class what you put into it. I feel like I picked up on some great concepts and ultimately improved the way I look at drawing.",
    "Wish I'd taken this sooner and not senior year! Opened up a whole new way of thinking and observing for me, showing me just how much I don't know about myself, my hobbies and what I might enjoy. It taught me how to experiment, how to let go, and how to trust my instincts.Natalie is wonderful. So nice, and gives constructive feedback. You feel she is interested in your development.I looked forward to going to class every time. You get to experiment with new mediums and I felt like I was growing and developing skills throughout the semester (more than I can say for many of my other classes).",
    "This is a very basic intro art class. Lots of class time but it is relaxing and enjoyable and nothing too stressful. I would definitely recommend it to mix up a schedule.However, I think if I were an art major or more experienced I might want a more rigorous art course.",
    "Drawing with Natalie was so much fun! Over the course of the semester, I definitely felt myself getting more comfortable with my artwork. The class isn't just simply drawing as we also did collages and worked with a paintbrush and ink. Good class to compliment readings and problem sets. Most work is done in class with small homework assignments each week.",
    "It's an intro to basic art techniques. The class will vary a lot based on your instructor. With Natalie expect homework once a week that will take a few hours to complete. A very relaxing and fun class.",
    "Wonderful class! Take it with Natalie if you get the chance. She is the ideal instructor if you want to learn to draw but you're also terrified of learning to draw: she is incredibly nice, and you learn so much. I would not have believed I could have made some of the drawings I did during this class if I had seen them ahead of time. Take it!",
    "You'll get out of Basic Drawing what you put in - if you take it Credit\/D and don't do any of the work, your drawing won't improve all that much and you'll feel stressed when it comes time to be evaluated. If you do the work (which is minimal), you'll find yourself improving quickly. Great course, everyone should take it.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Yes, for people who like making things with their hands. A good introduction to drawing techniques. The work is incredibly rewarding - you get to see the product of yur hours of labor, and you will significantly improve your drawing skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in improving their drawing skills or has never before taken a studio art course. It is suitable for all skill levels, however was never too demanding of those who have little experience with the drawing process.",
    "great chance to learn how to draw with a laid-back and helpful professor"
