    "Great class. Very interesting work, great discussions, and fascinating content. However, prior knowledge of the Middle East is required to fully and happily participate.",
    "I learned so much from taking this course. I went in with only very general knowledge about the Middle East and now I feel so much more informed about the regional dynamics. Sometimes the class felt a bit long and the discussions kind of lagged, but all in all I really liked it.",
    "Take this class to learn more about the middle east from a social perspective.",
    "Yes! Fascinating course, the best professor you could ask for, and a workload that doesn't get in the way of learning and wrestling with the material. No complaints. The grad\/undergrad mix is especially enriching.",
    "Highly recommended. Come away with a whole body of knowledge about the middle east many people don't have. Read the books.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is curious about various contemporary Islamic social movements. It might be difficult at first if you don't have much background on Islam and Islamic history (for which I recommend Professor Wyrtzen's Islamic Socities, Culture, and Politics), but Professor Wyrtzen will take care of you. Take this class! Not too much reading, manageable courseload, grading is NOT harsh."
