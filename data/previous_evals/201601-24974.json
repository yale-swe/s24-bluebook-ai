    "Overall came out with a slightly reduced fear of reading papers focused on ecological theory. Also came out with a pet theory to attach to my current research. The class not only broadened my knowledge of ecology (especially in those dark theoretical corners I typically avoid), but also sparked a genuine interest in the theoretical (abstract) underpinnings of ecological patterns."
