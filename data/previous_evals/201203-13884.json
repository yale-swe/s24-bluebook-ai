    "BEST class EVER!! Fascinating topics, fun and insightful assignments, and wonderful discussions.",
    "great topic! I can't think of another class offered at YSPH that would cover the breath of topics covered in this course.",
    "A-",
    "strengths: wide array of disorders are discussedweaknesses: one cannot go too much into detail with an array of topics as broad as thisimprovement: less contect discussed in more detail.",
    "Great course, wouldn't change anything.",
    "Great course. Very applicable for the study of public health.",
    "Topics\/readings were so interesting and relevant. I also found the assignments to be very worthwhile and thought-provoking. I looked forward to coming each week!",
    "I thought this was a really great course that covered a lot of interesting topics relevant to mental health care in the United States. I really enjoyed all of the lectures, the content, and the structure of the course. I liked learning about a number of the more prevalent or particularly relevant psychiatric conditions and specific issues within those. The student presentations were a fun, interesting component. I felt like I got a lot out of the class even if I wasn't specifically learning methods or tangible skills. The class exercises were thought provoking and interesting.Classes seemed sometimes like so much information I could barely keep up with it all, but I really wanted to absorb it all. I would suggest making the course 3 hours, so that it could all fit in at a slightly less hectic pace (and I'd happily stay an extra hour to hear it all!). Additionally, I would have liked to learn a little bit more about some psychiatric epidemiology issues in addition to social and cultural factors - a more in dept discussion of mediators and moderators, issues in counting prevalence or incidence of mental health conditions, issues in study design with mental health, issues withworking with vulnerable populations, etc.Overall, though, great course that continued my interest in this field!",
    "excellent class, i learned a lot. it's unfortunate that this is the only class offered at YSPH that focuses on mental health. in light of recent events, this is obviously an important topic and i think a greater emphasis should be placed on it",
    "This is one of the most fulfilling classes that I have taken during any of my higher education. The small class size allows for students to explore their thoughts and ideas with classmates and the professor. The curriculum design is also very well thought out and the lectures are very clear and direct.The class seemed to be heavier on theory and analysis of statistical data, but it also blended in applied methods to help us think critically about situations that we may encounter as public health professionals.",
    "This was a wonderful course! Megan covered a variety of pertinent issues in mental health, and always incorporated interesting class discussion and activities. I enjoyed both of the essay assignments which offered the opportunity to apply concepts covered in class to our personal lives and experiences.",
    "This course provided a broad introduction to many of the societal constructs influencing mental health and pathways that public health can influence them. Group discussions were interesting and individual presentations were a great way to look more in depth at specific issues.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken. The readings are heavy, but the most interesting of all of my classes so far. Class is a great variety of lecture, presentation, activities. Megan is awesome and super supportive.",
    "This is a good course. It covers a broad range of mental health issues, diagnostic criteria, etiology, statistics.The lectures were somewhat too dense and fast moving to really follow and understand everything. They are fact filled and will be good for future reference.I liked the student presentations, because they gave a good look at a variety of topics that you might not otherwise be exposed to.",
    "Megan is quite possibly the best professor I have had at Yale and also the most organized of them all. This class far exceeded my expectations - considering I did not have much background in mental health going into the class. Her major strength is the carefully planned syllabus and lessons - it was clear she put a lot of time into planning the class, and I appreciate that she used various ways to teach, was very interactive with the class, and really valued our thoughts and ideas. There are no weaknesses in this course, Megan Smith did an excellent job!"

    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan was the best instructor I've had at Yale so far - she was kind, very prepared, very helpful, sincere, professional, and very interested in her students. Her lectures contained really interesting information and statistics, and they were a nice balance between examples, videos, stories, statistics, and other content. I really liked that she met with each student before their presentation. I sincerely appreciated the chance to talk with her individually, learn a little bit about the field and her work, and that she took the time to learn a little bit about each of us. She was one of the most engaged and caring professors I have had. She had a great way of interacting with students and engaging them.Also, I really really appreciated her feedback on all of our assignments. She provided thoughtful comments and some of the most positive, happy feedback I have gotten from professors - I loved the enthusiasm she conveyed and her supportive and constructive comments on the assignments.",

    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Professor Smith is an excellent professor. She prioritized students and gave them her full attention. Talking with her during office hours felt like she was an advisor as much as a professor. She made students feel important, welcomed, as if they are active contributors to the learning environment.Furthermore, she is extremely knowledgable on psychiatric epidemiology. Her clinical background was invaluable to her ability to either answer questions or bounce questions back to students in a way that allowed us to think critically about the material.Thank you, Professor Smith!",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan was an excellent instructor. She struck a great balance between research and application, providing the class with readings and lectures that described mental health issues from an array of perspectives.

    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan was a great teacher. She was friendly, and obviously an expert in the field. The teaching could maybe be improved by focusing on a smaller amount of material.Also, although there was a lot of discussion about disparities vs. differences vs. inequities, it might have been good to have more of a conceptual discussion about those ideas.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0See above, Megan Smith is an excellent professor, very well-organized, available at all times for students, and overall taught a stellar class."
