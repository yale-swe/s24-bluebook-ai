   "comments": [
    "The class had an excellent structure and both professors have an incredible capacity to explain and break down complex ideas (also Benhabib's analytic way of thinking is perfectly coupled with Tooze's synthetic analysis). The class only suffered in the lack of direction during discussion. It would have been preferable to have more intervention from the professors to ensure more substantial dialogue and debate rather than what at times often felt like parallel monologues. All in all, amazing class.",
    "This was an intense but rewarding seminar for students who have already studied contemporary European political theory and feel very comfortable with the history of Western political thought. Background in European politics and financial\/economic policy would also be quite helpful. All in all, this was probably the most demanding course I've yet taken at Yale, both conceptually and in terms of time. That said, Tooze and Benhabib, both extraordinary on their own, made a terrific pair, and the material is endlessly interesting. Be warned that the seminar will probably be oversubscribed, and attracts graduate and law students who are eager to impress the professors (but who are nonetheless very smart and fun to be in class with!)",
    "Yes, but be prepared to read 600-900 pages a week and make yourself heard in a class of around forty students, most of whom are graduate students. Both professors are brilliant and the topic is fascinating, but for the class to be the engaging, enlightening experience it should be, it requires serious time and personal investment.",
    "It is a challenging course, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it. It offered different lenses to look at the issues of sovereignty. We discussed what are the understandings and criticisms of sovereignty from the perspectives of political philosophy, the project of the European Union, and in light of some dramatic events of the 20th century. We were assigned a lot of readings, yet the discussions were always productive. And what's more important, the professors were amazing. Both Benhabib and Tooze approach the topic from different angles and complement each other well. Overall, it was one of the most memorable experiences I've had so far at Yale.",
    "This course is absolutely excellent, and I would strongly recommend it, though I suspect that a lot of its quality was based on the instructors. Professors Benhabib and Tooze are both excellent and probably drew in a much stronger crowd of other students. As someone who shopped the class and decided not to take it the semester before, I can testify that there was a marked difference in the quality of the student population between those two semesters, and that seems to have been a contingent consequence of the excellent instructors, both of whom have a following among top-tier graduate students.",
    "Good class. Wish it were just undergrads though and not two profs.",
    "A truly outstanding class that provides an analytically rigorous overview of the concept of sovereignty, with special attention to the issues of human rights and economic integration. Very interesting texts and absolutely brilliant professors. It lies at the intersection of polisci and philosophy, so it is much more theoretical than most polisci classes (don't expect to read statistical studies or policy recommendations).",
    "Overview of sovereignty and cosmopolitanism. Historical, philosophical, and political science-y. Towering intellects leading it, too. Very, very excellent class. Be warned: lots of reading, though it's interesting. Take!"
