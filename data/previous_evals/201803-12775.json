   "comments": [
    "problem orientation, policy science, critical thinking, reflection. The list goes on and on. This course is the best offered at FES, preparing students for our professional and personal lives.",
    "The policy sciences are a very interesting field, and we delved deep into them during this class.",
    "Many. This was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "This class has transformed my thinking about policy process through understanding my standpoint and other people standpoint that will enable me to participate in the problem-solving process as a leader in the conservation and management of natural resources. It has also helped me think critically on a problem and importance of social and decision process in policy formulation",
    "Learned about the Policy Sciences, and how to apply the theory to resource management problems.",
    "I was taught a completely new way to think. It was very overwhelming, but good.",
    "I learned about the policy sciences and how to use them to be problem oriented and find integrated solutions.",
    "How to analyze social processes using the meta-framework for the policy sciences, specifically looking at natural resource issues.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights I gleaned from this course is great in magnitude and remarkable in depth, and I cannot write (or explain) it all in this space. I wont lie there were (many) times when I did not think favorably of the material taught in the course. In fact, Im still not entirely sure how I feel about it. But I can say with certainty that at no point over the course of the semester did I question whether this class was exposing me to an incredible array of ideas, observations, thinking styles, philosophies, and questions that the preceding seventeen years of education had neglected to mention. These spanned a wide range of disciplines, including social sciences, philosophy, psychology, and more. The whole thing was so far out of my comfort zone that its almost comical, but I definitely cant claim that my mind wasnt at least a little transformed by the experience, and that made the class absolutely worthwhile.",
    "The course was almost entirely focused on the policy process framework. While the idea behind this framework is sort of helpful, I do not feel like I came away from the course with any new knowledge or skills. It was simply a watered-down version of various environmental anthropology theories. Furthermore, we largely focused on one case study in Wyoming, which was interesting but really limited the scope of the class. I will say it was beneficial to be able to speak to and interview individuals involved in the case."

   "comments": [
    "Above and beyond expectations.",
    "I learned everything I expected to learn, and much more!",
    "Expectations were far exceeded.",
    "The course has helped to reflect on policy implementation in my country and it has helped me look at my research at a different perspective. This course is for natural resources management and any other field. Because it has empowered me that will help me address issues differently to make a better decision in the management of resources and myself.",
    "I wasnt entiresure what to expect from this course, but I am satisfied with what I learned.",
    "I didn't know what to expect coming in, but it was so much more than I could have anticipated.",
    "They aligned with my expectations well.",
    "Very well - the analytical framework is as helpful in practice as Id hoped, and is a practical tool that can be applied to any situation to more rigorously understand the social dynamics creating a conservation problem.",
    "I honestly had so few expectations for this course I think I actually started the semester with more questions than expectations so its nearly impossible to say whether they were met. That said, I suppose one could argue that I had at least one expectation: that the course would be more valuable for me than any of the other courses I could have taken instead. As far as that goes, I would absolutely that expectation met.",
    "They did not align at all. I was hoping this class would provide a unique perspective, but it simply presented a single framework that was seen as the 'correct' way of doing things. A"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It's my favorite course at FES. I wish more classes like this were offered.",
    "This class was great because we learned so much and asked ourselves very difficult questions.",
    "It was excellent.",
    "Although it is hard to follow through the class at the start of the semester, it becomes clearer as we dive deeper into the course. It enhances teamwork, and participation understand diverse knowledge and personality while working in a group dynamic",
    "Final project is great opportunity to apply what we learned, no obvious weaknesses.",
    "Working in a group was somewhat difficult as there was some group drama. Fewer group activities might have been preferable. The rest was good, though I was confused a lot regardless.",
    "Strengths: I learned a lot from this course about myself and about using the policy sciences. The trip to Wyoming helped me learn too. Weaknesses: disorganized schedule and freewheeling discussions during class, with little to no personal feedback. Final project was too much to be due on the last day of class - I had almost nothing due during actual finals week.",
    "The primary strength was really just the novelty of the topic, and the way in which it opened my eyes to thoughts and ideas that had previously never crossed my mind. I also loved that my fellow classmates were such an interesting bunch, because it allowed our in-class (and out-of-class) conversations to be truly fascinating and often enlightening. I am not willing to call out any weaknesses for this course. Thats not to say it was without fault it certainly wasnt perfect. But because the subject matter was so far outside of my grasp for most of the semester, and because I personally did not spend much time outside of class trying to rectify that (due primarily to a very heavy course load), Im now unable to say which difficulties were born of the course and which were of my own creation. I can say, however, that there are no glaringly obvious problems that are occurring to me now, which Id say is a good sign.",
    "The one strength of the course was the field trip to Wyoming. It was helpful to actually fully engage in the case study we spent the semester examining. I would say the biggest weakness of the course is the lack of depth. Not only do you only focus on one framework, but you also only read articles and books written by the professor. The course is basically structured in a way that presents the policy process as the be all end all. I also felt that when I questioned this, I was spoken down to in a way that indicated that I just simply didn't understand. I often felt that unless I agreed with the professor I was wrong, which was incredibly frustrating."

   "comments": [
    "You should 100% take this class if you can.",
    "Be prepared to unlearn everything you have learned so far!",
    "Take it!",
    "Students should take the course because it not only impart you with knowledge on social, decision and policy process but helps to reflect on oneself too",
    "Come into the course with an open mind and allow the material taught to wash over you without worrying too much about understanding everything at first.",
    "Be prepared to be confused, but also to learn so much.",
    "I would advise every student to take this class. It is a lot of work, and sometimes working with other people is difficult because of personality differences (not personally for me, but for others in the class). But there is a lot to gain from taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to do any form of environmental management, because the framework gives a practical way to analyze social dynamics that will help anyone thoroughly understand and better navigate the human elements of the conservation issue.",
    "The material will almost definitely prove challenging, largely because its so unlike anything were taught previously (or are being taught concurrently). To even have a chance at grasping this material, you first need to learn a new vocabulary, and the faster you can do that, the better off youll be. In addition, there will be many readings posted, which might be overwhelming at times, but do try to do as many as you can. Its definitely in your interest to get as much exposure as possible to examples of the policy-process type of thinking in action.",
    "I would encourage students to come into this course with a tempered expectation. If you do take the course, make sure you take other courses within the social sciences in order to gain an alternative viewpoint."
