   "comments": [
    "Great class ... you basically re-learn spanish (starting with Present tense) but now the grading is more punitive.More importantly, when she speaks in panish, she says things multiple times in different ways so that if you miss it the first time, you'll hopefully understand the second time around.",
    "I would recommend it if you need the language credit. The class is well-structured and I learned a lot, but it is a lot of work as it meets every day and you have homework for it every night.",
    "Review of L1 and L2. I found it much easier than L2.",
    "Instructor was very nice and helpful. Harsh grading however. This class only sucked because it met everyday and had daily homework. Otherwise it was fine and I'm glad to be done with it.",
    "I would recommend the class if it is necessary to fulfill the language requirement, and if you have to take the class, take it with Professor Reymundi.",
    "Take it with Reymundi.",
    "I enjoyed going to Spanish every morning. Professora Reymundi was very kind, helpful, and knowledgeable. She would chat with us in Spanish (the entire class was in Spanish, we once heard her speak in English, it was strange). The readings and movies were all interesting and had funny twists (although I was always waiting for the one with the happy ending and never got it). I felt very prepared for all the exams from in class assignments.If you're thinking of taking this class, you probably have to\/are going to regardless of the reviews, but try to take it with Reymundi. All the professors have the same syllabus and none of them actually grade the homework themselves, plus Reymundi is fantastic.",
    "Spanish 130 was a great continuation of L2 and solidifies a lot of the grammatical concepts from previous levels. Be ready for nightly homework assignments.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student; it's informative and really interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student if he or she truly desires to improve their knowledge of the Spanish language.",
    "It's language, What is there to say? i you are taking it, it is because you have to, or you happen to really like Spanish.",
    "It's an introductory class through and through. You cover the basics, and then you're tested on them. The highlight was watching \"Pan's Labyrinth\"."
