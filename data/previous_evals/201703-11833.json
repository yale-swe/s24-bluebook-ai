    "I developed a strong foundation in written and conversational Hebrew. I learned new vocab and basic grammar structures and rules.",

   "comments": [
    "The only weakness of this course is that some of the events and tables were unproductive and some of the homework was busy work. Otherwise it's an excellent course that makes it easy to maintain a high level of engagement.",
    "The class is very fast paced, but Orit does an amazing job of making sure everyone understands the concepts. The quizzes every week can be a bit tedious to study for, but they're worth it because they definitely force you to learn the vocab. The only change I would suggest would be eliminating or changing the meetings with Danny because they are not very productive.",
    "The class was organized and structured well, and Orit gave lots of feedback on ways to improve.",
    "The course is very strong and has very few weaknesses. It does what it is supposed to: create a foundation in conversational and written Hebrew. It has many opportunities to build this foundation. The class size is small, allowing the professor to give each student attention. The class is very interactive, which is great for practicing conversational Hebrew. The only weakness is that there are times that the homework seems trivial and unnecessary.",
    "This was a course that was both enjoyable and educational, I had no knowledge of Hebrew before the course, and now I know a little bit.",
    "The extremely small size of the class meant that every student got very personalized attention. The teacher uses a variety of different methods (such as videos, worksheets, interactive activities) that encourage comprehension and are very engaging. The only thing I would say is that the daily homework assignments can seem a bit like busy work at times."

   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent language course, and both Orit Yeret and Dina Roginsky are wonderful professors. I highly recommend taking this course to supplement an understanding of modern Israeli culture and prepare you for further study in either ancient or modern Hebrew.",
    "Absolutely. You learn so much in such a small period of time. The small class setting makes it really easy to stay focused and a lot of Israeli culture (and food!) is incorporated as well.",
    "I loved Hebrew andwoul recommend it to anyone who is interested.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a great introductory class for Hebrew.",
    "I would strongly encourage this course if you have no knowledge of Hebrew, or only know the letters of the alphabet as this is a wonderful introductory course.",
    "Yes, if you want to learn Hebrew definitely take Orit's class."
