    "I wasn't a huge fan of the course HOWEVER that's because I went into it thinking that it was a class about behavioral evolution in primates and it was definitely not: super focused on morphology\/looking at fossils. I thought the material was really dry because I am SO not into that, but if that's what you like then by all means take the class. Sargis is SUPER CHILL and nice and also the workload is pretty minimal.",
    "Critical thinking for reading scientific papers; identifying different morphological features of fossil primates; understanding the evolutionary history of primates.",
    "I learned how to look at fossils to understand the evolutionary of primates and how scientists go about collecting data and understanding evolution",
    "I gained a greater appreciation for paleontology and the role it plays in evolutionary biology. I also became better at critically reading scientific articles. I also got more experience handling museum specimens.",
    "It was a great course for learning general primate biology and morphology, and for gaining a critical insight into the fossil finds that have informed our views of primate and human evolution.",
    "I learned to read a scientific paper and the large debates and issues in primate evolution.",
    "I learned basics of primate evolutionary history, paleontological methods, morphology, and how to critically read the primate literature. The last topic was probably the most useful skill I developed."

   "comments": [
    "The discussions sometimes were pretty boring because the papers were very technical-heavy and I'm super not into bones. Sometimes I wish that we had gotten more of a chance to look at things other than fossils, but I guess that's not what the course was about. Super low workload which was nice. The grading was also extremely confusing...I have ZERO idea what my grade is going to be.",
    "The strengths are definitely professor Sargis, who is an incredibly clear, kind, and great teacher and the weekly labs. It was very cool to do such hands on learning with specimens every week! Improved? Maybe slowing down a bit in lectures to make sure the non-science majors can follow along with the jargon a bit",
    "This class is a perfect seminar with great engagement of all students and professor. It was a great addition to my semester.",
    "I thought the format of the class worked really well - I felt like I got a lot out of the papers we read through discussion, and I enjoyed doing the hands-on part as well, and class was never boring.",
    "Great course, loved the structure. Maybe a little more focus on hominid\/human evolution would be nice",
    "It might be good to vary the topics a bit more and talk about more than paleontology.",
    "I like that there is a lecture and lab portion to the class. However, there were many readings every week that we had to know in a lot of detail. It made it difficult to keep up.",
    "The strength was the Professor's great knowledge of the primate field, phylogeny and morphology, which was manifested in labs and intros\/lectures. Though we tried, the discussions we led tended to be weak in comparison just because we don't have as much of a grasp on this stuff. The labs were phenomenal in terms of the specimens we got to see, but I do appreciate that it was morphological themes and comparative biology and not just identifying taxa."

    "Yes, for non-science majors, this is an incredible science credit. Because it is a higher level class, you really get to engage with a topic in a serious way. However, it is still definitely manageable and Sargis is really wonderful to work with. Highly recommend.",
    "One of the best Yale courses I have taken. Absolutely recommend!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for the instructor, contents, and great opportunity to look directly at paleontological finds. However, be aware that this is almost entirely about monkeys, extant and extinct--you only cover hominids for the last class",
    "If you are interested in primate evolution and how it is studied, and want to learn how to read a scientific paper, then you might enjoy this class. If you are not, you will spend a lot of time talking about fossils and various parts of the primate anatomy and may not enjoy that so much.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are into primates and into fossils then do it!",
    "Not much work, but I wouldn't recommend. This is much more interesting for students who already have a background in taxonomies \/ evolution of life \/ paleontology. Really, the only thing I will remember from this class in the future is that fossil teeth can be very useful for classifying animals, and identifying their diets. I also appreciate that Sargis encouraged us to be skeptical of scientific papers, and try to recognize when theories are not robust. But overall, most classes were 1) student-led discussion of research papers (most students who were not anthropology-related majors did not really read them carefully) which were usually not that productive, 2) a short powerpoint-lecture by Sargis on some topic within primate evolution (this was not as interesting as you might expect, and is mainly filled with technical details about how to classify different Genera of primates), and 3) a lab where you go around looking at bones, and writing down answers that you remember from the powerpoints. Easy class, but not interesting for students unless you really will supplement this very technical knowledge with outside study (e.g. if you are an Anthro major or EEB)",
    "This is a serious class about paleontology and at times esoteric aspects of primate morphology. It is really cool for the evolutionarily inclined but I get the sense that people take it thinking that it will be cool and accessible because primates are sort of like humans. This is a discussion class and when we have discussions they will inevitably be a drag with a lot of the class lacking background, although we try very hard. There are much better \"science credit\" classes related to primate or human evolution that are actually much more accessible for non-majors, but for EEB majors it is very appropriate. The format of giving us lab answers during the lectures then having lab was not ideal; without them the labs would have been way too hard and with them they were less interesting. These facts shouldn't be secrets though (like tooth formulae, etc) since if we hand it in wrong we won't be corrected until long after we have forgotten the context, so maybe knowing the answers is more important than being \"tested\" in lab. Using labs to demonstrate concepts was best, like having three skulls lined up and saying which is the middle one more like in terms of several different features, since then the fossils really served as visual aids and became cool to look at. Scoring these traits in terms of reconstructed ecology or food preferences was interesting too."
