    "This course gets us started with understanding and exploring the research in related fields, which is important for graduate students. Listening to the lectures and presentations of the speakers from different institutes helps to broaden our sight in scientific research.",
    "This course is very interesting. It not only open our mind, but also provide us many opportunities to further our studies.",
    "The level of this course is beyond our scope. Since there is no instruction, it is hard for us to follow the guest speaker's presentation. It seems that we are the audiences to this course, since we couldn't learn anything from the seminar. The preparation session before the weekly seminar is very inefficient. Since each seminar's materials are really hard to understand, peer's presentation would not be able to give us a proper and accurate background information. Sometimes, since the peers themselves cannot fully understand the materials, their presentations are wrong. Therefore, I suggest that the instructor of this course should present the background information for the seminar.",
