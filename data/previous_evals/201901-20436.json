    "This course was a thorough survey of Marxs work and its theoretical and practical impact, up until the early 20th century. I learned an immense amount about important themes and points of controversy within Marxist thought, as well as the history of various social movements\/revolutions around the world.",
    "I learned about how to think about 19th and early 20th century history through the lens of Marxism, I learned about presenting in a way that facilitates discussion, and I practiced writing synthetically.",
    "How various socialist movements are connected to each other, especially in relation to Marxism How to probe into each thinker\/activist's philosophy implicit in his\/her writings How to deal with primary documents to build up some argument about social movement"

   "comments": [
    "This is a terrific course overall. There is a lot of material, and it is covered in an interesting and coherent way. Seminar discussions were often very interesting and struck the right balance between referring to specific textual passages and talking about ideas more broadly.",
    "I'm not a good judge because I took this cred\/d (needed a 5th course to graduate) and really didn't get to apply myself in the way the course warranted, but I would say among its strengths are Denning's facilitation and lectures and the amazing readings (many of which I wasn't able to do). Also, the flexibility of the syllabus allowed us to all teach each other in a way that was really fruitful. I don't feel I can speak on weaknesses given my lesser engagement with the course, but I will say that even if this was only one of 4 classes I was taken there's no way I would have been able to maintain the reading load.",
    "The professor's insightful elaboration upon the reading materials: how to engage with the texts and how to probe into deep philosophy of each thinker. I was always amased to see how deeply these readings could be read and how they could be integrated with each other."

   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to gain insight into how modern capitalism came to be, and the reactions that this revolution in the mode of production caused. Really, anyone who is interested in politics, economics, and the nature of social movements should take this course. It is difficult to fully capture all of the insight I gained from this class.",
    "I would! I think I'm especially excited to recommend the fall '19 follow-up about 20th century marxist movements. I think Prof Denning is an excellent professor and gives really thorough, thoughtful feedback on papers. I would not recommend people take this cred\/d though--this is a class you want to really give its due time and thought.",
    "Yes, especially I'd recommend this course to American students. I often have an impression that Marxism is stigmatised in the US in an unfair way, (too often and too easily connected to Stalin and Mao), but through this course, students can learn how Marxism provides meaningful critiques of the violent nature of modern society, how Marxism shapes our sense of social justice, and how our society is founded upon the legacy of Marxism and other social movements."
