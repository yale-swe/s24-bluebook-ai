    "Studying lectures and lecture slides and forming an opinion and using that information to craft a well reasoned response.",
    "It was interesting to learn about how the EU and its governance over different elements of society (economy, trade, security, etc.) came to be. I enjoyed the lectures on the World Wars the most.",
    "A thorough understanding of the development of modern Europe.",
    "I have a baseline understanding of the major events that have defined Europe since the onset of World War I and the contemporary crises that affect the future of the European Union.",
    "Nothing really.",
    "Honestly, the ability and patience to seat through extremely dry and boring lectures",
    "Learned about the history of European integration.",
    "I learned a huge amount about how the EU works: its various institutions, its levels of authority, its functions, and how they are shaped by its history.",
    "This course provided a strong survey of the historical and political trends that underlie the project of European integration. I found this course to provide a strong, albeit a bit too technical at some points, overview of modern European history.",
    "Understand Europe better",
    "You learn about the crises facing Europe and the history of the EU as an institution. You can learn and appreciate a great deal about the material by following the lectures extensively and discussing the readings.",
    "learned alot of relevant info abut modern europe",
    "Learned the history of Europe since WWI. Really interesting to learn about the long-term history of the rise of the Right wing movements in Europe. Good for critical thinking about the (uncertain) future of the EU.",
    "Did walk away feeling like I understand the recent happenings of Europe. Understand the EU much better.",
    "I learned a lot about the inner workings and the history of the European Union. I also understood the challenges it has endured since its creation, and the way it has responded to these challenges.",
    "This course gave me a comprehensive look at the circumstances that led to the European Union, the various precursor institutions of the EU, and honed in on certain issues that wrack the EU today. We began with World War I and World War II, and then moved on to the Cold War. The course was more than just a mere history of these events, but really demonstrated how they were intimately connected to the beginnings of an European Community. We then examined the challenges and motivations behind European integration, and how those problems persist in the lens of the democratic deficit, the eurozone crisis, the migrant crisis, Brexit and the rise of the far right, and so on. I thought it was an excellent examination of how the European Union functions and the challenges it faces today.",
    "General knowledge and history about the EU.",
    "knowledge of european politica",
    "I learned a lot about Europe and the EU and all the political institutions that make up Europe. This was very useful information that I will now have a further knowledge of.",
    "Interesting overview of the history of the EU and current EU news",
    "nothing.",
    "I finally learned what exactly happened to Yugoslavia! Also gained an in-depth view of Brexit's possible impact on the EU in the future.",
    "Great content about Europe. Detailed and comprehensive!",
    "This is the most informative course I have done this semester. It makes you understand all the European questions which are important and vital",
    "I thought the material was awesome and very engaging. Through experiencing the second half of the course, in particular, I was exposed to new perspectives on current pressing world issues that could ultimately alter our future.",
    "I learned sooo much about the ins and outs of the EU, and a digestible way of analyzing current European crises.",
    "learned how to compare past history and current events",
    "I learned alot about europe - quick overview but good general idea on the entire history from 1800 - present"

   "comments": [
    "The topics were fascinating but the lectures themselves were extremely boring and very hard to take notes in. We were inundated with information but not given enough time to actually record the information.",
    "Professor Cameron is extremely knowledgeable which is definitely something I find to be important when taking a history course. The New Europe is fairly all-encompassing (from World War to present) so it was difficult to really dive in to some topics when you are learning 10 years of history each week.",
    "There should be an essay instead of a final exam",
    "Lecture can get dry at times; readings not particularly helpful\/add too much information. Way too many \"red herring\" figures\/concepts\/individuals that make understanding the essentials of the class difficult at times.",
    "The in-class experience is disappointing. The prepared course material is fine, but I rarely enjoyed class itself. Less-detailed slides would be appreciated. Either make slides more accessible ahead of time, or don't make lecture feel like 75 minutes of slides that I can read on my own. I want to be a good student by going to class, but it's frustrating when I have peers who regularly don't show up because of how useless it feels.",
    "The course material is interesting, but extremely poorly communicated. The entire course is basically on the slides, with Professor Cameron reading from them every class in a way that was not at all engaging.",
    "The material is very interesting and relevant, and the readings assigned were all appropriate for the content of the class and engaging. The main weakness of the class is the fact that Professor Cameron, despite being a really nice person and a great specialist on the subject, delivers extraordinarily boring and dry lectures.",
    "Interesting class, but Cameron reads from slides, and it can be boring. Super nice guy.",
    "This course was a wonderful lecture, and its biggest strength comes from Professor Cameron's passion. I wish that it had had the option of a final paper in order to allow us to engage with the subject matter a bit more!",
    "I found Professor Cameron's lectures to be at times dry and unengaging. When the professor read off the slides, it felt that there was no need for me to attend the class. I recommend making the lectures, in particular, a bit more engaging or at least provide information beyond the slides.",
    "Not a lot of work, pretty boring.",
    "Professor Cameron is a savant when it comes to European institutions and his technical analysis is excellent.",
    "The material itself is very interesting but the structure of the course is such that there are so many specific facts presented in lecture that it is hard to get big picture ideas and themes. I think the course could be more engaging and effective if the lectures were framed in terms of big ideas instead of a history of specific treaties and in depth explanation of political structures.",
    "Strengths: the material is very interesting and the takeaways are clear. Weaknesses: the lecture very much followed the slide and thus wasn't as exciting as the material was.",
    "The lectures are incredibly boring, but the material is all online and is very relevant\/applicable for today. If you can read the material on your own, it's interesting stuff. If you get a good TA (I did), it makes the class much more engaging.",
    "The lectures largely consist of Prof. Cameron reading details off of his slides. The slides are packed with detail, while the extent to which you need these details for exams is much less extensive.",
    "Information and topic are very interesting. But lecture contains the same information as the slides.",
    "The course definitely provided a comprehensive look and copious amounts of information about the EU and its various issues. Especially since it is such a big topic of conversation today, and with updates from Brexit continuously happening, I was pleased with how updated the course information was. I thought the course was organized in a logical manner, such that each lecture built upon the preceding lectures and showed how each \"topic\" of discussion was intimately tied to other topics surrounding the EU. For example, even though at first I was unsure why we were discussing WWI and WWII, it soon became clear how the effects of these wars created a necessity for some sort of partnership between European states. As for its weaknesses, I think that there could have been more ways to delve deeper with the assigned texts (i.e. papers).",
    "It was a great class no improvements",
    "Professor Cameron seems like a genuinely nice man, but he is a horrendously boring lecturer. Lecture attendance was abysmally poor and it was obvious why. This really detracted from the course.",
    "good tf, slow lecture but interesting material",
    "I lost interest at times during lecture and it was hard to follow along a lot of the time but I understood it better after I looked back over the slides.",
    "Section was pretty good, but lectures were very long and hard to follow sometimes",
    "I felt like there were too few sections for this class. I couldn't fit a section for this class in my schedule.",
    "The lectures are very dry and boring and often very factual\/textual. However, the material itself is fascinating and more than makes up for the dryness of the lectures (just be prepared to study on your own time).",
    "Strgenths are the material. It is very interesting, howveee it is taught in a rather banal way of slideshows.",
    "You learn a lot about all the different European institutions. You learn about current issues facing the EU.",
    "\"The New Europe\" comes off as a \"gut\" because there is only a midterm and a final. Discussion section is optional and all the slides from lecture are posted online. However, to get a really good experience from this course, you can't approach it as a gut. This was my favorite class this semester (as a senior leaving Yale...SAD!) because the section leaders are amazing, the reading is light but very interesting, and Prof Cameron has a dad-like sense of humor. GO TO LECTURE. Only about a fourth of all the students enrolled actually showed up to lecture (SSS 114 looked pretty empty each Tuesday and Thursday) but it was worth going. The slides can be so fact-heavy and daunting, you will have a much better time going to class and having Prof Cameron break it down for you than staring at them for three hours before an exam. I barely studied for the exams, because I got so much out of lecture and section. The main strengths of the class: the ease of learning, the low stress, and the TFs (Ana and Izabela are gems). The weaknesses: lecture can get a bit dry at times and there's no accountability for falling behind. Maybe Prof Cameron shouldn't post the slides online (he's aware of this, though, haha). Section should be kept optional because it is self-selective and therefore really productive.",
    "strengths - implications of current events",
    "Its a good class. lot of students that take it. Not to much work. What you put in is what you will get out. Optional sections were great for the class"

   "comments": [
    "Yes because the course information is very interesting.",
    "If you are interested in learning about the history and formation of the EU, in combination with looking for an easy 5th course, I would recommend this class.",
    "Yes--good PLSC class!",
    "Take it for the PLSC credit. Don't expect any feedback on midterm essays.",
    "Incredible Credit\/D class. Add it as a fifth.",
    "yes!",
    "I recommend the course, but I didn't enjoy the course. The material itself isn't hard to understand. The major takeaways are repeated enough to be boring, but also repeated enough so that an average effort will mean that you learn something. It's not a lot of work to get credit. Most people don't go to class. I did, and I rarely felt like it provided more insight than the slides, particularly because David Cameron reads from them at least 95% of the time. He's a nice man; don't get me wrong, but he is by no means a captivating stage presence. Having an optional section that decreases the weight of both exams was a nice touch, too.",
    "If you need a fifth credit and are interested in Europe, this is an okay class, but don't expect to learn anything that you couldn't find on a read through of the wikipedia page on the European Union.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, if they need an easy social science credit. You don't get very much out of it, but the material is quite interesting and the readings assigned are all very good. The lectures are dry, but the exams are relatively easy and based on what's on the slides. The grading was done very poorly, with little feedback given.",
    "Good class to credit\/D. Low workload. Not necessarily that easy to get an A in though. First 1\/2 of class is on european integration and fall of soviet union, 2nd half is about issues like the eurozone crisis, brexit, refugee crisis, crimea, etc.",
    "Definitely take it. Super chill and interesting.",
    "Professor Cameron is a very passionate professor, and the poor attendance does not represent the quality of his teaching!! He was very nice. This is the kind of class where you get out of it what you put in. You can learn a lot if you come to lecture, and it's really interesting!",
    "Great class to forget you are in come the midterm",
    "Yes, a great course that takes less effort.",
    "Yep. 100%",
    "At the end of the day, I recommend this course. It can be a bit dry and unengaging at times, but the content and readings are well organized to provide a strong survey of the historical and political trends that underlie the European integration efforts. But, with the only graded work being the midterm and final, it is very easy for one to be unengaged and otherwise pass off this course. Take the optional section if you do decide to take the course. It adds to your grade and allows a bit more interaction with the course content. Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable, and I definitely suggest meeting with him outside of class. Overall, a good 5th course but don't expect to walk away from the class with an incredible, engaging experience and a vast new knowledge of the EU.",
    "Take it.",
    "If you like Europe take it.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, great class!",
    "This course is an easy credit\/D\/fail course but if you want to learn anything you have to really study the lecture slides. The material is interesting but there is just too much to really be able to remember anything.",
    "I would recommend this if you are interested in European history and European contemporary issues. You get clear takeaways for each current crisis we study.",
    "yes",
    "If you want a class with relatively little work and subject material that is relevant in today's world, take this class, but be warned that the lectures are insufferable so you have to do the reading and work on your own. However, as long as you know enough to answer the essay questions on the midterm and final, you'll be totally fine.",
    "This course is very easy and has essentially no work, but is not well organized or engaging.",
    "Yes. Very interesting and relevant, although lecture and slides are exactly the same.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the European Union and the various dynamics surrounding European integration and current day crises. Professor Cameron is incredibly knowledgeable and he really kept us up to date with every new occurrence surrounding the European Union, even when it wasn't necessarily the topic of discussion. I came into this course with a narrow interest in the Eurocrisis and German dominance within the EU, but soon realized that I didn't have a fundamental understanding of how the EU is structured, operates, or came about. This class really built up my knowledge from the ground up and has sparked further interest into learning more about European institutions.",
    "Yes, to be a more informed citizen",
    "Take it if you're using a credit D and want to do absolutely nothing all semester. Otherwise, don't take it, you will lose your soul.",
    "good easy not a lot of work",
    "This course was not as interesting as I expected, there was a lot of economic and political polices that were hard to understand but it was interesting and helpful in terms of keeping up to date with current issues in the EU and Europe.",
    "Honestly got a lot out of this class and am very knowledgeable about Europe since 1914 now!",
    "Good 5th class - take it if you are actually interested in the material and will want to read the books and lecture slides yourself.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot about the European political situation of the past 100 years.",
    "This class is a great way to break the monotony of a STEM\/prereq heavy schedule without introducing a lot of extra work.",
    "Yes. It's a very good course and most importantly you learn a lot about things you never knew about",
    "If you want to get the EU 101 course this is for you. This course considers the most up-to-date challenges the EU faces. For instance, we covered Brexit in detail this semester!",
    "YES TAKE IT. But please put in the work (which is not even a lot), if not, you will get nothing out of the class and probs dislike it. Go to section, because it is so laid-back and you learn so much from the TFs (Ana and Izabela were rockstars!) If you're not into European history or the bureaucratic workings of political institutions, then this class may not be for you. There is a lot of info, though all very manageable, but you should be interested in the matter before diving in. I really enjoyed this class, even as a senior poli sci major. It was fun, low stress and low workload, and I came out of it with a lot of new info and perspective on Europe.",
    "yes",
    "Probably not",
    "Yes i would. Interesting course that is not that tough. Interesting to learn - stay on top of what you are doing in class."
