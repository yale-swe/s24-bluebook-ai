    "A great class. The course readings are extremely interesting, and Prof. Weir leads incredibly engaging discussions in seminar. Her extensive experience doing research in Northern Ireland brings a really interesting perspective to the course. The course is not too much work - weekly summaries on all readings, one presentation, and a final paper. Definitely recommend taking a course with Prof. Weir.",
    "No, definitely not. Class lacked structure and the seminar seemed to be lead more by the students than the teacher.",
    "Summary: A great survey of civil conflict, its influences, and its implications. The reading load is what you might expect from a political science seminar, but it's usually relevant and pretty interesting. I would highly recommend it to others.",
    "Good class! Final paper was fun - very open-ended will allow you to pick a topic you are passionate about. It was helpful to use the troubles as a central case.",
    "Good class - lots of interesting material. I would recommend it if you have some background in Civil Conflict and want a more academic-literature oriented course. And there's a nice innovation of a final paper discussion - sort of like an academic conference. Prof. Weir is also really cool as a person, tells great stories - my only wish is that reading presentations in class were shortened, because we already had summaries of the readings to do.",
    "This is a great seminar -- thorough, rigorous, and taught by an excellent professor. The first half of the course is a broad, discipline-level survey of major questions in civil-war studies, including a lot of wonderful classic readings; the second is a focused case study of the conflict in Northern Ireland. Readings are generally manageable but can be up to a (long) book a week, with additional weekly response requirements; there's also one final paper and an in-class presentation on a reading of the student's choice. Overall, very highly recommended, especially for those with some background in security\/conflict studies who are looking to read a little more deeply."
