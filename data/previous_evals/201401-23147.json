    "If you have not taken a formal modeling or political economy course in the past, the readings will be hard for the first few weeks. If you put the time in, it'll become much easier as the course rolls along. I went from knowing very little about how to work through (relatively simple) formal models to being somewhat competent. I actually enjoyed much of the readings as the course went along, learning how to work through the articles. I thank Deborah."

    "Took this course as a distributional requirement in the PhD degree. It was very helpful in the end, but quite hard. There should be basic game-theoretic requirements for the course, as this would raise the level of discussion for the entire seminar."
