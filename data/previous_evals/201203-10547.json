    "I would absolutely without reservation recommend this class to another student. It should be mandatory for all classics students because it helps to explore a very important task, translating, that we sometimes do without taking all elements of what this means into account.",
    "This seminar explores the practice of translation and the discourse surrounding it from Roman to modern times. Class time is spent both analyzing existing translations of classical texts as well as translations prepared by classmates. The course involved a surprising amount of creative translation work as well as more traditional analysis.",
    "I found this class very valuable, since it dealt with the discipline of classics as it is appreciated by those who are not specialists in the field, i.e. through translation. As such, it offered an opportunity to consider how professional classicists, with knowledge of the languages of source texts, can best serve a modern readership. Attention was also paid to the methods and approaches behind translations from which professional classicists themselves sometimes work, e.g. the Loeb Classical Library, Penguin Classics, etc; and also to ancient and modern theories of translation. Towards the end of semester, discussion turned to modern adaptations and interpretations of classical texts. There was scope for students to consider, as part of their individual research projects, particular instances of translation or reception, according to their own academic interests.In my opinion, this class would be best taken in conjunction with CLSS898 or CLSS 899 (i.e. the graduate survey in Latin literature), since much of Latin literature is a 'translation' (of one sort or another) of Greek source texts.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student- as the seminars made abundantly clear to all of us, translation is an alienable feature of language in every culture, ancient and modern. The course was well-structured and well-taught, and the workload was manageable."
