It was an excellent class and I highly recommend it to ALL FES students regardless of background. Eli provides a great overview of the math concepts in the context of environmental studies. Anyone that takes it will come away with a thorough understanding and level of comfort with these math concepts.",
    "I don't understand why there is no question regarding the teaching assistant in this class.",
    "This course provided a fantastic refresher (for me at least) and overview of key areas of math and how they applied to environmental work. Also, the focus is on understanding the concepts at a higher level rather than rote memorization of mathematical rules - meaning that you understand how and why you use different methods and approaches to solve problems so you can determine the best approaches for solving problems."

   "comments": [
    "The combination of outside reading, problem sets that both had practice problems and word problems, online videos, and in-class learning really made complex mathematical concepts clear. Dr. Fenichel teaches math better than any college level professor I have taken classes with and I wish I had taken this class sooner. He does a great job of clearly describing these concepts and demonstrating real-world applications for linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations.",
    "Eli was a fantastic instructor.",
    "Math review was useful to other classes and research. The videos were very useful!",
    "The class periods were well organized, clear, interactive, and fun. The problem sets were challenging but not too challenging to be great teaching tools.",
    "Great material covered, great TA (Rob was fantastic), and Eli did a solid job bringing the highly theoretical to real world and practical. Favorite class of my semester here.",
    "Dr. Fenichel did an excellent job putting material in context; this made it very easy to see the practical application of coursework.",
    "For one, as mentioned in the previous question, we had a terrific teaching assistant who was able to respond to our questions with ease because of his very good grasp of the topics in class.Second, the value of understanding the mathematics is in being able to appreciate quantitative research and to distinguish god from bad research using mathematical models.The book on e was very useful in helping me appreciate the history of numbers that were relevant in the course. I'd recommend it to anyone who will be interested in a non-mathematical presentation of how we have reached this stage in mathematics regarding particular significant numbers.",

   "comments": [
    "I think some of the timing spent on subjects could have been improved, but this depends largely on the students in the class and their grasp on the topics. While some parts of the class were a bit slow for me, I recognize that other students were still struggling to grasp the topics. While this class is geared towards students with minimal mathematical foundations, a basic understanding certainly helps going into the class.",
    "Some of the topics could have been covered a little more clearly in class.",
    "Nothing",
    "Eli's drawing skills.",
    "I think we need a solid document to refer when we need. With the current structure of the class, it is difficult to refer back to what we learnt. Class notes and presentations might help!",
    "The material should have been presented in a more organized manner. Like I've mentioned, the syllabus wasn't a very good reference for what will be covered. While eventually the links between topics became obvious towards the end, I don't feel that anyone without any background on the topics covered will have been able to have a very good appreciation of it given the broadness of the course."

    "The ability to appreciate different researches, including researches that are quantitative, I think is a basic skill that all students should have.I feel that more than economics, mathematics and how to appreciate it should be a foundation course in MEM.",
    "This course for me was more of a refresher since it's been a few years since my undergrad math courses, but it actually provided me with a lot more than I expected. I gained a much better understanding of why I used various mathematical approaches rather than just memorizing them and forgetting them."
