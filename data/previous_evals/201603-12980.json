    "We gained a deep understanding of psychopathology and the evidence-based theories about the etiology of a broad spectrum of disorders. Sprinkled throughout, we also learned about various treatment considerations relevant to various forms of psychopathology.",
    "This course was an excellent overview of all major adult psychiatric disorders (barring addiction, just due to the class's enrollment overlap with the addiction seminar). In addition to an understanding of diagnostic criteria, prevalence, and the like, much of the course focused on discussing review papers that summarized current issues in psychopathology research. The class reading list also provided a number of detailed analyses of the RDoC approach, which were de-facto required to answer the questions on the midterm exam. All of these topics were both useful for future psychologists and genuinely interesting.",

   "comments": [
    "The class was engaging and Dr. Joormann was an excellent lecturer that shed light he intricacies and complexities of psychopathology. The reading assignments were very good and the workload was manageable and meaningful (both the midterm and the final were relevant to our own lines of research). One minor area of improvement for the course is that students definitely went to a lot of effort to prepare presentations on the readings and there was often not enough time to actually focus on them. I would have preferred if the lectures had been allowed to go longer because there was often more material than we could get through and if the presentations had been billed as 15-20 minute presentations instead of 40, because that was more along the lines of what it ended up being."
