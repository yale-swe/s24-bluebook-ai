    "Course name says it all -- origins of banking system and how central banking has evolved over time.",
    "It is a great survey course about the history of central banking and evolution of monetary policy. You will learn a lot in the class.",
    "Learned about the various ways that central banking has changed over the years",
    "Received an in-depth, qualitative\/historical perspective on the trajectory of central banking from the gold standard to the 2008 financial crisis. I feel that I got a good feeling of the narrative of monetary policy that may guide further quantitative exploration of the subject.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the workings of central banks, the mentality of central bankers when approaching the decisions they make, and generally a better understanding of the macroeconomy\/\/key events in our economic history (gold standard, Great Depression, 2008 financial crisis, etc).",
    "I gained an overview of the history and practice of central banking that had significant breadth and depth."

    "Mohan is a good lecturer; he's well regarded in the field and can explain some of the complicated concepts in central banking clearly. Some lectures could be a bit dry. I think the assessments were reasonable (2 essays and a term paper), though I'd like to see the weekly presentations be about something other than the readings (as the papers are on the readings as well, and Mohan discusses the readings after the students present on them in the same session.) Overall, informative and good course.",
    "The professor wants you to do well. He is very accessible and always ready to help you.",
    "I think more time for discussion and more debate-oriented classroom events would be good, but I enjoyed the seminar overall.",
    "Readings were interesting, topics were great, but I felt that the seminars were far too student-led. Prof. Mohan is exceedingly qualified to speak about the subject, but there were many classes where students spoke more than he did about subjects we had just read about. Inevitable, my and my peers' analyses are based on the readings, but since we read the readings anyways, I tended to get much less out of the seminars than I think I could have. If Prof. Mohan keeps a strict cap on the length of student presentations, this can be easily fixed.",
    "Strengths: Having Professor Mohan, a practitioner in central banking was incredible. Taught us how central bankers think. Course also covered a lot of ground. Weaknesses: Perhaps could use a section of the course devoted to the menchanisms by which central banks achieve their goals, making sure everyone is clear on the tools at the central banks disposal and their ripple effects before moving into our appreciations of them."

    "Yes, this is a great survey course on the history of central banking. You will learn a lot.",
    "This is a great seminar if you've been exposed to monetary policy before. I wouldn't recommend the course if you don't have a strong interest or background in central banking already, however. The discussions and papers get pretty technical. Of course, like any seminar, the other people in the class make or break your experience, so if the rest of your class is intelligent and engaged, you'll enjoy the course. I certainly did this year.",
    "Yes. Great course! Prof. Mohan is AWESOME!! Great person to speak to, unparalleled experience in the subject matter, and very willing to speak to and get to know students. I really enjoyed this course, and in large part because of our instructor.",
    "Absolutely, it is very important to have a deep understanding of the macroeconomy. I would advise to come in with some previous knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm for the material.",
    "I would recommend this course to students with a solid background in economics who want to learn more about monetary policy. The course involves a lot of weekly readings and three papers, but the grading is very fair."
