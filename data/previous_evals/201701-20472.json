   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "General knowledge about plant and animal biology\/anatomy, as well as how certain organisms have developed traits in response to their environments. I also learned the basics of taxonomy and how to describe phylogenetic relationships.",
    "This course gave a broad overview of diversity and phylogeny throughout the history of life, focusing each week on a different functional trait that has arisen within evolution. I would highly recommend it to anybody.",
    "I learned a lot about evolution and how various species have developed certain body plans and feeding mechanisms to survive. I also learned about flowers, trees and fruits.",
    "By taking this course, I learned about different ways to measure and understand diversity. I also learned valuable lab and field techniques. Furthermore, because of the Yale Nature Walk project, I learned about the connection between technology and nature, and how people can engage with nature in this technology age.",
    "I learned how to understand how components combined to inform the evolutionary history of a single organisms or a network of interactions.",
    "I developed a very deep understanding of ecology and evolutionary life in a much broader context. As a class, we learned a lot about the adaptations plants and animals experienced during their descent with modification to the modern-day flora and fauna we see today. I also gained some very valuable experiences (such as dissections and visit to the river) that I will remember for a long time.",
    "Got a good survey of ecology and evolutionary biology through a number of different lab types",
    "I learned a lot about introductory and intermediate concepts and facts in ecology and evolutionary biology. The course material was pretty comprehensive and well laid out for this learning. I also developed some skills in the lab portion, which was hands on in examining and dissecting various specimens. I developed insights into the major innovations in the evolution of bacteria, plants, and animals, which helped me see how major innovations drove radiation of certain groups.",
    "I learned a few new skills about dissection and microscopy. The insights were an increased understanding and appreciation for the world around me.",
    "This course taught me a lot about different aspects of evolutionary biology and was an interesting introduction to the field. I learned how to perform some dissections and how to classify organisms.",
    "How to study ecology and evolutioary biology in the field",
    "Great intro lab to EEB, if you're interested in the major I would totally recommend it. I'm definitely not an EEB major, maybe MBB, but I took it as more of a fun bio lab, and it definitely fit that. It was truly pretty fun.",
    "You learn a handful of cool ecological biology techniques, like how to create and use dichotomous keys to identify different organisms, how to measure diversity, and how to use different microscope settings to best visualize bacteria. You gain a lot of exposure to a wide variety of investigations into bacteria, plants, and animals, and overall it's just fun!",
    "I learned a lot about the tree of life and how to distinguish and evaluate different groups of life forms.",
    "I loved this course - I learned a lot about evolutionary bio as a whole but also the manners in which to work with different animals and plants.",
    "I learned a lot of information about evolution in all domains of life, from bacteria to mammals to plants. I also gained skills in conducting research in the field."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lab handouts provided by the instructor could be improved a lot. Every week's experiment had an associated handout containing the procedures and background regarding the lab, and these were often convoluted, repetitive, and redundant. I feel like these handouts could all be half the length and still convey the same information. Much valuable time doing actual science was lost while figuring out the handouts, and even the TAs were confused a lot of the time. Also, the mini-lab reports took up nearly all the time outside of class that I spent on this course, but they were worth a disproportionately low amount of points, which was a bit disappointing.",
    "Strengths - Amazing teachers and TAs. Fair gradings systems, though quizzes sometimes too specific. Interesting and diverse array of topics. Weaknessess - Lack of depth in any one specific topic, and inability to fit all of the curriculum sometimes into the allotted class time. Overly ambitious breadth of topics.",
    "This course could be improved by making the lab a full credit. I spent as much time if not more doing work for this class compared to my other full credit courses. I loved the tree project that we had to do at the end of the semester. I think the procedure for several of the labs was far too long and made my partner and I rush through the experiment and inhibited us from getting to take our time and really learn what we were doing. I thought one problem of the course was the quizzes. I would study several hours for them and each week was disappointed in my performance on them. I think it would be helpful if at the beginning of the year we had discussed what type of information would be on the quizzes because I found that it varied greatly each week. Additionally, maybe they could be worth fewer points. My grade was brought down tremendously by the quizzes and it would have been great if they weren't worth over half of a lab report.",
    "A strength of this course is that each lab was unique and taught me a different way to measure diversity or taught me new lab skills. A few of the labs were a bit too long, which made them tedious towards the end. This included the lab where we looked at bird morphology and then also looked at dental formulas for mammals. While all of this was interesting, having them combined on one lab day meant that there were so many observations to be made, it was difficult to finish in the allotted lab time. The prokaryotes lab was also like this. It may be difficult to cut down, as each part of the lab did offer valuable insight. However, if they were slightly shortened, these labs would have felt less rushed and I could have gone more in-depth with the observations made.",
    "The course does an excellent job of introducing the students to a wide range of topics and manners of analyzing evolutionary data. However the course requires a lot of busy work that is not particularly helpful for processing the information. The final nature walk presentation was a blast! It was neat to be able to contribute to the course with a creative component.",
    "One strength is its great diversity and organization of material. The class clearly built upon itself so that even people not well-versed in the subject would gain some important foundations before delving deeper into certain animal or plant groups. The workload was at times challenging, but it was manageable and similar to most other science labs I have taken.",
    "Strengths: Labs are fun and engaging, professor wells is very enthusiastic and supportive weaknesses: the write-ups were very tedious, the quizzes were not always consistent with class material in that they sometimes focused too much on details rather than broader concepts",
    "Strengths: well organized, Marta is wonderful and knows what she's doing, and the labs themselves are a lot of fun compared to other labs at Yale. Weaknesses: the lab reports often take a long time and are tedious. They help solidify some of the learning for quizzes, but they can be shortened significantly and still have students analyze the lab results and take home key points.",
    "The strengths are that most of the labs are very fun and interesting, but they take a longer time than the allotted class time.",
    "I thought it was a great lab overall. Perhaps clearer expectations for how much work should be put into the lab reports.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because it was a lot of fun. I could tell that Professor Wells had a passion for the material and wanted us to enjoy learning about it. It was very laid-back and that made it more possible to focus on learning about the course rather than stressing about grades. I thought the labs in the greenhouse and the lab at Sleeping Giant were great and kept the class exciting. I can't think of any weaknesses; this class was a great time!",
    "It was engaging, fun, gave opportunity to be creative while also giving structure, the instructors were amazing.",
    "Pretty great course, can't think of any major weaknesses. Marta is such a kind person and great professor, so invested in her students and this course.",
    "The labs are generally fun. I really liked the invertebrate diversity of feeding modes lab. We basically looked at a bunch of different invertebrates, mostly under microscopes. If you loved doing that in middle school and were a bit of a geek about using microscopes and looking at animals, you'll love it. Overall the course is so laid back--a great biology lab for premed students. I think there could be a bit less busy work--I don't know if turning in your lab notebook is necessary as most of the data is just pictures. But compared to other labs it was super chill.",
    "I think this course would benefit from more dissections since many of the students taking the lab will use dissection techniques later on in their academic work. A lot of the lab reports for this course did not have actual data m, which made writing the report more difficult and less engaging.",
    "You learn a lot of basic biology. The iPads are great. A lot of it feels very high school level though and while the lab reports are not that hard, they are often tedious and don't do much.",
    "Strengths - Prof Wells and TA (Erica was amazing), breadth of material, hands-on nature of course Weaknesses - good amount of work; lab reports\/quizzes pretty much every week",
    "This course was extremely engaging. The labs were very fun for the most part. This is definitely the most chill lab I've taken here. One way in which the lab could be improved is in organization. Sometimes, the instructions for the lab were very vague and we were confused as to what we were actually supposed to do."

   "comments": [
    "This class reminded me that science can be fun. It was the first time in a while that I felt that my professor was truly excited to be there teaching about the subject and wanted me to be just as excited. There are a ton of fun labs, but I will say that this class is a lot of work. There are lab reports and quizzes each week so keep that in mind.",
    "A class that I'd tentatively recommend, but with some major reservations. You get to do some amazing labs that you wouldn't have the opportunity to do anywhere else (dissecting a squid, studying a bunch of crazy plants in a greenhouse, and wading out into a river at Sleeping Giant to analyze stream ecology). Prof. Wells is very charismatic and knowledgeable, and shes a great person to get to know. HOWEVER, assignments can be lengthy and time-consuming without being particularly enlightening. The material picks up in terms of complexity, but is a little annoyingly simple at the beginning. The weekly quizzes are heavily memorization-based and stressful. The labs are tediously long and poorly written (I feel like every set of experimental instructions could be half as long and wed actually learn more). If youre pre-med like me and need a bio lab without prereqs, you wont regret taking this but youll probably be better off taking an MCDB elective and doing the associated lab instead. TAs are usually forestry students though and theyre super chill.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any other student, in any major! A vague interest in nature and biology is all you need to excel and love this course. I would definitely recommend taking it after introductory biology sequences; there is an expected base level of knowledge.",
    "Yes definitely take this class with Professor Wells. She is so enthusiastic about the course and was so kind. We got to do a class field trip out to Sleeping Giant park and afterwards she bought everyone ice cream!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it gives a broad overview of many techniques used in biology research. I think I learned a lot from this class.",
    "I would recommend the course for the content and activities we get to do. Unfortunately the course does require a lot of time outside of lab because there are lab reports due each week so I would be sure to caution my peers about that work load.",
    "This class is a must-take if you have any interest in biology. Professor Wells and the TF's make the class very interactive and enjoyable. Some of my fondest memories from this semester include moments from this class (such as tasting some really weird fruits and sampling invertebrate diversity at a creek). The workload is very manageable and builds upon itself so that you can hone your critical thinking and reasoning skills.",
    "I enjoyed the class during the lab time, but lab reports, quizzes, and assignments outside of class were time-consuming. Lots of fun activities and labs, but lots of nitty gritty work afterwards.",
    "Would definitely recommend to pre meds who are trying to find a bio lab and to E&EB majors. It's painless as a lab except for the night before a long lab report is due. The curve is supposed to be nice. The labs are really fun, and Marta and the TA I had were great. Not sure if I would recommend it to any other Yale student unless they're really passionate about ecology and evolution.",
    "Yes, it was a fun lab!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this lab, especially to premeds like me. Marta is fabulous, you have a lot of fun, and you come out feeling interested in the natural world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about E&EB or who needs a biology lab. It is super fun and pretty relaxed so you really get to enjoy the material. We take two trips to the greenhouse and also a trip to Sleeping Giant to wade in the river. There is a mini or full-length lab report due each week, and a quiz most weeks, which can end up being a decent amount of work. I think this class is closer to a full credit of work than some other labs, but it is still really great. Professor Wells is incredible and I'm sure you'll have a great time if you take this class.",
    "Absolutely! This was easily my favourite class in the semester.",
    "Yes, really fun, not a ton of work, but the lab reports are really long. Definitely more work than orgo lab, but less than gen chem lab, but much more interesting than both.",
    "If you love animals and nature and you're looking for a chill lab,take it! I really don't like labs--they stress me out. I took this to fulfill premed requirements, and it was the most laid back lab I've every taken! Marta was so enthusiastic about the subject and made it as fun and chill as possible. You're not really worried about how you're doing in the lab, you're just having fun dissecting or classifying or looking under the microscope for a paramecium. The tree project is a lot of fun--make the most of it! In general this lab is most fun if you get into it and enjoy it for what it is--a fun exploration into various aspects of ecology that's sort of reminiscent of middle school science projects. It's not terribly rigorous, but it's chill and fun.",
    "This is a decent lab course for pre-med students who need an additional biology lab. It feels a bit like busy work at times but the professors and TAs are nice and most of the labs are interesting.",
    "If you need a bio lab this isn't a bad one. Not super intellectually challenging but lots of hands on work with samples and relatively easy as far as difficulty and workload.",
    "Highly would recommend! Professor Wells is AMAZING and the subject matter of each week is so interesting. Lab isn't boring but also isn't particularly labor intensive.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Honestly this was my favorite class as a second-semester senior. 10\/10 recommend",
    "Amazing course!! The reports take a decent amount of time, and there are quizzes every week. But coming to lab was a genuinely enjoyable experience and I learned a lot. Marta is wonderful!",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab if you are interested in the material or need another biology lab. It is very laid-back and fun. Marta is the nicest professor and is so excited about the material. Overall, a very positive experience."
