    "Some interesting lectures, but would love to see more diversity in presenters and their backgrounds\/research topics.",
    "Good Food!",
    "Good seminar. Would like more variety in the types of speakers we get ie. not just researchers or academics; practitioners and other individuals demonstrating the diversity within public health",
    "I liked that it was combined with SBS so that it wasn't every week. I really enjoyed the speaker who talked about lead time bias - felt that they were very relevant given our epidemiology II class. Some of the other speakers were boring...",
    "Good way to learn about a topic other than your own field of study.",
    "Strengths- not too many seminars, and some pretty interesting lectures. Weakness- I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to get out of the course- is it just being exposed to different SBS-based research? I guess it did its job then.",
    "Great selection of speakers."
