   "comments": [
    "I learned all about typography, history, letterpress, Yale's resources, and how to use a printing press. I also gained a new appreciation for the physical world and for all things printed. This course also developed my design skills.",
    "In this class I learned the importance of the printed word in the development of conveying information and forming thoughts--and how this has morphed through history. Additionally I learned skills of graphic design, patience, creativity, and persistence. This was a very intriguing course that allowed individuals of different backgrounds to take different information learned and apply it to their specialized interests.",
    "This course taught me a lot about the history of printing and the intuitions that go into designing for printing, including the choice of typefaces, spacing, color, etc.",
    "I learned how to use multiple different types of presses, and learned a ton about the history and culture surrounding printing and bookmaking around the world.",
    "Through this course, students learned how to use a printing press, specifically 3 kinds of presses. Through this, students learn about different types of font\/typeface and space on the page. Additionally, this course touches different kinds of paper folding and book binding.",
    "Learnt both practical knowledge regarding printing on various types of presses, as well as the history and usage of printing. Each week we visited a different library on Yale's campus to see some rare books -- lots of fun and also beneficial for finding some cool and unique study spots!",
    "I learned how to use a *printing press*. Which is an amazing sentence I never thought I'd say about my first term in college. But just as importantly, I learned how to notice and appreciate more of the art and beauty in everything around us, especially in typography. I can't look at a book without noticing the setups of the cover and pages or the letter spacing and chosen typefaces anymore.",
    "I mastered the printing process and learned about many resources at Yale through field trips to libraries and museums."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This is a fantastic class; it combines the creative process of art with the history of letterpress, taking us far and wide to experience all sides of letterpress and printing. The greatest strength of this class is the professor, Richard Rose, who is so dedicated to the art and to teaching, and the second greatest strength is that it is taught at Yale, which has extensive collections for our reference. Another great strength is that of the JE Press, which is mostly well-organized and certainly beautiful as a space. The only improvement I can see is maybe purchasing more cases of wood type (we ran out of letters fast), but that is an issue in itself.",
    "This course offers so many strengths. For me one of the largest was its ability to expose the daunting libraries of Yale and to make them seem more approachable. This was done by taking class field tripes to the different libraries on campus. This class is also an ideal environment to make deep connections to other students in the class, as much of the work involved sparks conversations and is hands-on work allowing for those conversations to grow. There is honestly little improvement for this course, except for the class's tendency to run over the scheduled time. This problem, however, is minimal and many students appreciate the extra time in this unique setting. Also, the professor is very flexible and allows students to leave if necessary when the class time does run over.",
    "It's a really great, once-in-a-lifetime experience, but it does take a lot of time, and field trips will often extend well past the class's ending time.",
    "Strengths: Professor is deeply passionate about printing, and offers a lot of insight and guidance. Students get to regularly access the JE printing press and can independently carry out their projects. There are many field trips that give students the opportunity to look at various types of rare books. Weakness: Students are only able to use the JE press, which does not have all the resources a student might need (i.e. certain cases\/sizes of type).",
    "The best part about the course was the wide range of types of learning; whether it be looking at physical objects, listening to guest lectures, learning how to use the press and seeing the special collections. I really don't think there's another course with that level of intersection and made it overall an excellent experience and class.",
    "Through the sheer amount of time one spends in the pressroom, one becomes very well acquainted with the processes of printing. Since the professor is always on hand to help, too, I never felt stuck or unsure of how to proceed. The amount of research and reading on the subject is very much left for the student to decide; I would've preferred is we were given a small amount of set reading on a set area each week to help broaden our background knowledge of the subject.",
    "The strengths include Prof. Rose, who is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and who is excited about the course and takes care of all the questions and concerns we may have about printing. Additionally, this class really makes use of Yale's collections and libraries, and the trips to the Law and Med School libraries, as well as to Beineke and the British Art Gallery, will make you appreciate how much Yale has to offer. The weakness of this course was that on the class days when we went on trips, we'd often get out or get back to campus 20 or more minutes after then end of class. Prof. Rose was always fine with us leaving early, but it would be nice if everything could fit in the class time.",
    "The course was incredibly enjoyable and it was fun to work with the press. Professor Rose and my peers are passionate about the projects. Sometimes the field trips would run late."

    "I would absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt recommend this course in isolation to another student. I say \"in isolation\" because I don't want people to come into this without enough time in their schedules and then resent the class. It is a different kind of workload because it requires you very often to be in the JE Press. That being said, I did get so much out of this course and felt good about my timing even with two STEM courses. If you take this class, your brainpower will be multiplied by at least a factor of three. (That's huge because you're already a Yale student.) I learned about so many resources at Yale (our book collections are incredible, literarily and literally unbelievable), and I made some really close friends along the way (because of the seminar thing, for one, but also because we are united in our sensibilities). I have a much greater appreciation for the world and human culture at large because of this class. I cannot accurately convey to you how excited I get when I find threads of this class everywhere, and that is surprisingly often because letterpress pervades our culture. This class is truly something beautiful because it teaches you to step back and take in everyday things. You just begin to understand how much work printing takes, and it is staggering to consider the great works you get to look at and touch in the course of this class. This course is the definition of what makes Yale special.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to people of all backgrounds. The combination of learning and honest-fun creates an environment that fosters so much growth in the way people look at material arts, and how information is presented in the texts we read as students. This was my favorite class of the semester and Professor Rose is just the right person to teach it (think a combination of Bob Ross and Mr. Rodgers).",
    "Yes! Professor Rose is a very patient and knowledgeable instructor, and this is the kind of class that you will not see anywhere else. The press is a really interesting part of the Yale heritage and you definitely wont regret taking this class.",
    "Absolutely, a once-in-a-lifetime experience. That said, this class is definitely a ton of work, and you have to be prepared to put time towards this class. You will be rewarded if you enjoy this sort of thing, though!",
    "Yes. This is one of the few opportunities a student might have to learn how to use a printing press, especially when digital media is rapidly taking over. However, this course demands a lot of time out of class to complete projects, and students will have to be in contact with press managers to access the press room.",
    "If typography, graphic design, or books are of interest to you, then I would highly recommend the course. Be warned that you will spend a huge amount of time in the pressroom, which if you leave all your work on the projects until the last minute will feel like a subterranean dungeon!",
    "Definitely! This class is a unique chance to really get to know a great professor and to get to know your classmates more closely than in any other class which is a really nice thing to get first term. It's also a really amazing topic and makes use of Yale's resources in a way that will let you appreciate what this college has offer in terms of printing and outside of to too.",
    "Yes, this course is an incredibly unique opportunity."
