    "I actually took this class on a whim, mainly because I saw some more advanced sociology courses in the Bluebook and needed to take an intro class to qualify to take them. So I took this one and it turned out great! You read some of the big name authors to get a sense of some of the main ideas in sociological analysis, but also develop overarching themes and ideas about civilization and modernity. There's a bit of reading, but as long as your Thursday night are pretty free, you should be fine. Also, past years' reviews had negative things to say about the Blog, but I'm not sure why that was, because the Blog worked great for our class--our discussions often started before we went to class. Finally, I'm not sure there's any other class in existence where you get to play a computer game as part of your final project!",
    "The Sociological Imagination is a great introductory sociology course. We read some great works, from Weber to Hochschild.",
    "Great seminar! Professor Adams is the absolute best! Although we cover many big ideas, the class is very focused and coherent. The readings are interesting and very manageable. Each week we would post or comment on blogs, which was a great way to participate. The final paper was super interesting and you can tailor it to the ideas that you are most interested in. Overall, a must take and not only for sociology majors!",
    "Definitely take it. The readings are all really great -- a combination of Marx, Fanon, David Harvey, Eric Hobsbawm, Derrida, and others. There is a courseblog that gets some pretty exciting conversation going, and there is a lot of freedom for the final paper. You can even choose to play a video game (Civilization) and write the paper on what you learned!"
