    "SOCY167, Social Networks and Society, is a sociology introductory lecture, and it is not the one you should be taking. The material is interesting, but the presentation was painfully slow.",
    "Decent class - you learn more outside of class than in class however. The homeworks were a little confusing but rewarding. I wish there would have been more direction\/guidance on the homework assignments.",
    "Good overview of social networks! You look at a lot of cool network graphs and do some cool readings. Relatively low workload.",
    "I would recommend it because the coursework is light and subject interesting however, it must be taken for a grain of salt that there is no real understanding if you actually are going to get a good grade in the class or doing well. Mostly in no-mans land.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in networks, social dynamics, or computers. The class is highly interactive so you must be committed to the work. The final project allows you to pick any topic, so it can be a lot of fun during the craziness of finals!",
    "This is a good class if you want to delve into social network analysis and gain a basic overview of different types of networks and analyses. I learned a lot, even as a non-sociology major, and I would recommend it. Be aware that you gain more from it the more you put in, so doing the readings for the week makes a big difference in your understanding and overall enjoyment.",
    "This is a class where the more you put into it the more you get out of it. If you do the readings pay close attention in class and have a great final project you can learn a lot. Or you could just do the required pests, blow off the readings, and partner up for the final project. so either a nice 4th class or a great introduction to network analysis and the social ramifications."
