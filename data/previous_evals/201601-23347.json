    "Question 8: The instructor explained conceptual material clearly but went too fast and was disorganized.",
    "5. There were a good amount of field trips, but they could have been better spaced throughout the semester. I know that some events were changed around or added last minute, but it's just something to keep in mind for the future. Spacing the trips allows for time to process and discuss each one individually.",
    "Q1: The readings were often a little long and because we just had an open discussion about them there wasn't much motivation to read everything thoroughly. Perhaps inform us that it is or is not okay to skim certain readings and help us utilize our time best by pointing out sections of the text you would especially like us to focus on. Q7:I learned a lot from the Bridgeport field trip. The others not so much. Q8: There is a lot to cover and much of it is new for many people. A mre organized format to the class may be helpful for some people. I think it is okay to have a lot of brainstorming and discussion but make sure to hit home the important points and present them clearly. Q12: Besides feeling like the structure of the course was a little messy, I know I at least took away an understanding of designed experiemnts and resilience corridors."

   "comments": [
    "The field trips were great. Seeing real world examples of the materials brought up in the course really helped drive the concepts home.",
    "The field trips were great and the class assignments asked students to try their hand at exactly what we discussed in class. The partnership with the architecture school was neat, but more of a time commitment than I initially realized. I know those meetings weren't mandatory, but they were enriching and it would be great if everyone could have attended most of them. Maybe all that could be made clearer in the syllabus or during the first class.",
    "The discussions during class, applied concepts and field trips.",

   "comments": [
    "Needs better organization",
    "Overall, the course needs organization. For example, I enjoyed interacting with the urbanism studio, but felt like the collaboration would need to be far more methodical in order for it to work. This could include an official first meeting between architecture and FES students that everyone is aware of and participates in, followed by several partially shared classes. Otherwise, there is too much confusion about the role FES students are playing in the studio and the extent of their involvement.",
    "Keeping on time during class. We had a lot of time, yet we still were often unable to finish the prepared powerpoint or to have everyone share their project ideas thoroughly. It's okay if the arc of a class changes based on what is most engaging for students, but that doesn't mean we should stay beyond class time to finish up what is necessary.",
    "I liked the connection to the architecture program. However, making their designs fit into our coarse could become a more solid aspect in the future.",
    "The assignments could have been better-structured; students were supposed to be paired with studios from the School of Architecture, but there was very little communication as to whom we should contact and how. In general, communication of expectations was lacking throughout the course. Students did not receive grades on any of our assignments prior to the end of classes.",
    "We need feedback on assignments before the next one is due."

    "Advantages: learning from my team mates. Mixing up teams to include architecture and FES students was beneficial and broadened my perspective. Disadvantages: Dealing with team dynamics. Some people are more engaged and contribute more than others. Managing team dynamics often requires just as much time as working on the assignment.",
    "My partner and I had different backgrounds in terms of what we had studied and projects we had done in the past. Our strengths complemented each other, so I think we were able to learn from each other and produce a better project together than apart.",

    "Don't expect a typical class structure and be flexible with assignment types and due dates. If you can go with the flow than you should be okay."
