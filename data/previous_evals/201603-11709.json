   "comments": [
    "My Spanish improved, especially my grammar!",
    "My spanish improved.",
    "This class filled in the remaining gaps in my knowledge of Spanish grammar and improved my comfort with speaking, writing, and listening in Spanish in a variety of contexts.",
    "advanced grammar, new tenses, natural phrases",
    "This course allowed me to better develop my use of the Spanish language. I learned new vocabulary and grammar structures, as well as perfected my prior knowledge. I also gained considerable insight into Spanish culture through the various readings and short films.",
    "Further fluency in Spanish and mastery of specific grammar concepts.",
    "I will be honest, I did not improve my Spanish skills much in this course. I thought that the course work was ineffective in many ways. I think the idea behind Yale's language requirement is that every student can go out into the real world and speak with people of different languages; I don't think this course provided that.",
    "As a native Spanish speaker, a lot of the grammar and writing has never been one of my strong suites. However, this class and my professor Tortora was very helpful in creating a strong foundation for the language."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The homework is really uninteresting--especially the VHL exercises (which are unfair assessments of your work in the class). Overall, a strength is that it meets every day--that definitely improved my language skills. Also, some of the creative in-class exercises were really engaging--such as the debate, for example.",
    "Meeting everyday is no fun, but your spanish will improve. The supersite gets annoying.",
    "I think the course could be improved with the addition of some written homework in addition to (or preferably, instead of) the Vistas online homework at times. There were some things I was repeatedly failing to understand with the online homework that only made sense to me when the professor or another student explained it to me.",
    "The class seemed very unorganized and I feel like I really did not learn much. I am not very confident in my speaking ability anymore.",
    "Too \"high-school\" with daily busy work and fill in the blanks. Longer term assignments with multiple rounds of grammar correction for longer writing assignments would be so much more helpful.",
    "One of the strengths of this course was that students were required to use Spanish every day since the class met every day. One of the weaknesses of this course was that the exams often felt too long for the time given for them.",
    "I think we could benefit from doing more grammar practice in class so we can understand specifically why our mistakes are wrong, which is something I often struggled with on the supersite assignments.",
    "I think this course had very poor coursework. Never did our class go through the finite intricacies of the language. I was very upset with this course.",
    "Strengths: A lot of the material is about history that I never learned in my time at school so it was very enlightening. Weaknesses: Sometimes the work becomes tedious"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course only if you need to fulfill your L4 requirement. I really enjoy learning Spanish, however, I feel like I didn't get much out of this course. We didn't really do enough of anything: speaking, actively practicing grammar, improving reading, etc. Rarely did class feel substantive. Instead, we usually just re-did a grammar assignment from the night before or talked about a few parts of a reading assignment. After having taken L3, I feel that my Spanish did not improve at all in this course.",
    "L4 is pretty challenging, but this course does sharpen your spanish skills.",
    "Yes it is a helpful course that solidified my Spanish grammar rules.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, but would encourage them to maintain outside support from peers and\/or regularly attend the Spanish tutoring sessions for extra support.",
    "I wanted to become better at spanish, but we received little feedback other than on tests and compositions, so I never new if what I was saying or writing was actually correct.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student who enjoyed taking Spanish either in high school or at Yale. The course built upon the previous knowledge of students and helped students to perfect their use of the Spanish language. The assignments really helped to reinforce what was learned in class and allowed students to engage with the language outside of the classroom. Overall, the class is great for any student looking to improve their Spanish.",
    "Yes, for your language requirement even if you've already taken the AP and got a 5, you can still learn a lot from the course! It was tedious at times though, so if you're pretty fluent and want a discussion based class, I would not recommend it.",
    "Yes, definitely. It's a great foundation to Spanish grammar and introduction to writing and oral presentations."
