    "Very thorough and insightful reading of Beowulf. My Old English improved dramatically as a result of this course. We learned a lot about the nuances of the poem and ongoing questions of interpretation.",
    "I learned Old English! I also gained a richer and more full appreciation and understanding of Beowulf. The intimacy born of spending a semester engaging with one text has increased my intellectual capacity and has made Beowulf a text that I know I will return to over and over again throughout my academic career. This course has truly made me a better scholar and has provided me the key to unlocking the incredible potential of other Anglo-Saxon literary works."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the course, but it was a lot of work translating ~600 lines in the last week. Perhaps meeting twice a week could help space out the translation?",
    "I think it would be helpful to have this course meet twice a week and have one day in the week focused on translation and the other day focused on the literary and cultural moves happening in the text of the translated passage for that week. It felt at times that it was impossible to really capture the poem as fully as I would have liked because translation, in and of itself, takes up a large portion of time. I think it would also be helpful to meet once before the course starts to do a grammar view together following the break between semesters."

    "I would only recommend this course to another undergraduate if they're really interested in medieval literature\/the Norse world and have a strong background in Old English (again, it was a lot of work).",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all--it is such a rich course that provides the opportunity to learn about one of our founding OE English literary works with the premier scholar of the poem."
