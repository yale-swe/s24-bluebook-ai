   "comments": [
    "I feel that this course exposed me to a wide variety of topics in primatology and human evo in general that definitely deepened my understanding of some issues. There might be ways in which some of the literature we read could be beneficial to the larger themes of my dissertation.",
    "This course augmented how I thought about studying animals. I found great utility in identifying ways that certain species can be used as models or analogies for the evolution of traits in other animals or humans. I gained skills in critically analyzing the literature which claims to do this, and learned a great deal about human evolution in general."
