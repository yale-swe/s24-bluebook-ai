    "This was a fantastic course. Professor Tyler was open to listening to the thoughts and questions of all of his students. The topics of the course became slightly repetitive as the course progressed, but I personally felt that helped to reinforce the themes of the course. It could only have been improved by being taught later in the day, when students might lend greater attention to the course."
