    "yes. It was great to learn how to do more in-depth research. The Beineche library was a great resource to have.",
    "In most cases, yes. The logistics of getting as-of-yet uncatalogued material at Beinecke scanned for use in our projects -- to say nothing of finding enough time during Beinecke's limited hours for proper research -- presented a challenge, but for the most part, we definitely had access to some pretty cool stuff."
