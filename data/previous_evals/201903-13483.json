    "First half of a solid state physics course: crystallography, phonons (Einstein and Debye models of heat capacity), electronic conduction (Drude, Sommerfeld), band theory, Fermi surfaces, semiconductor theory and basic devices. I knew a little bit about the topics, but left the course with a much deeper understanding. I also gained an intuition for the general orders of magnitudes in solid state physics (i.e. typical band gap energies, semiconductor doping densities, etc.).",
    "This course was a fantastic introduction to the physics of solids. This field was completely new to me, and I learned a lot about semi-conductor devices which I had never learned about before.",
    "learn so much about how electrons interact in metal. new models and ways of thinking"

   "comments": [
    "Sohrab is a really engaging lecturer. He and TF were always willing to help go over material in further depth after class\/ at office hours etc. Weekly problems sets were great for consolidating knowledge and were usually not too long or difficult",
    "Pretty good class. Lectures were very confusing given that I did not have the pre-reqs for the derivations. Problem sets taught be how to apply the problems, which was hard but the TA taught me how to do everything. Exams were more applied and conceptual so they were manageable. I wish the lectures were a little more clear about how different concepts relate to one another, as I often got confused which part of the textbook to read and what the point of each topic was.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ismail-Beigi is a very engaging lecturer and manages to impart a lot of enthusiasm and interest in a subject that has been unfairly maligned by Murray Gell-Mann as \"squalid state physics\". The course is well organized, with lecture slides and relevant reading chapters posted online. There's a good balance between concept and calculation, which is a balance that physics courses can struggle to get right and particularly, an emphasis on what might be encountered in a real experimental context. Weaknesses: Professor Ismail-Beigi is, well, quite fluent with the material and also writes quickly, so the in-class derivations proceed fast. He does make sure to cover the conceptual background and intuition before diving in, but some of the material was hard to digest quickly if seeing it for the first time. At first I tried to copy down everything, but I really didn't have time to understand what was going on, so by mid-semester I decided to rely solely on the lecture notes and spend in-class time solely on understanding. However, the Professor is very receptive to feedback and tried to improve on this a lot from the mid-term survey.",
    "the textbooks (Ashcroft\/Mermi and Kittel) offer different ways to think about solid state models, in addition to the lectures."

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY if you're interested in solid state physics",
    "I would recommend if you have the pre-reqs, as it will probably make a lot more sense that way. Still, I learned a lot of the concepts but didn't necessarily understand the derivations.",
    "Yes, I think the subject matter is criminally under-emphasized in general. This field forms a large portion of useful technological advances both in the past century and in ongoing research, and there are also a number of fundamental theoretical ideas. Professor Ismail-Beigi is an enthusiastic and accessible instructor as well.",
    "The material was, at least for me, difficult to grasp. I think it is more difficult than previous course reviews led me to believe.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Although some of the topics were covered quickly, they were very interesting, and the lessons were incredibly thorough. There were a lot of \"ah-hah\" moments during this class regarding some of the properties of solids that I had never understood.",
    "absolutely. if you're shopping this class you likely either need to take it or not, but if you are looking at an elective for physics or chemistry, this is a good place to look!"
