    "Greatly expanded knowledge of colonial history and racial formation in the Americas, ability to connect labor regimes to histories of race, ability to engage with archival and literary material from before 1900, ability to historicize scientific racism and trace other kinds of theories of racial difference before scientific models were key",
    "To look at the history of race in a more systematic way; this class had a heavy emphasis on theory, and so the willingness to examine historiographical theories was important. To critically look at the subjectivities of the archive and whether a history should be told or not told at all.",
    "This course helped me develop a broader knowledge of race as a historical concept and process in the Americas, and gave me a sense of the various historiographies that have approached race from multiple critical perspectives. The course productively destabilized the apparent inevitability of race and showed the many contingencies and regional\/imperial differences in its making. The course provided a useful range of material for understanding race, showing its foundations in scientific discourse, labor, the state, and other social formations.",
    "I learned how to critically analyze texts, and how to historicize the concept of race. The class gave very important and helpful insights into the way that racial thinking has evolved over time. We also worked on various professionalization skills such as writing book reviews and conference abstracts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really liked that we took the approach of going by geography\/empire,. because it really showed how racial formation was influenced by specific economic interests the different empires had, their religion, their policies, but also the influence of the indigenous people, etc. which was very cool. Haartman's \"Venus in Two Acts\" and Morgan's Laboring Women were my favorite readings. I also really liked the assignmentsbook reviews and article proposals and other assignments that helped us practice for the practicalities of academia as well as be intellectually useful, also appreciated the amount of flexibility in the syllabus",
    "Excellent readings, great in-class conversation, assignments make sense for professionalization. Possible improvements: rough draft deadline for final papers to encourage more thought out work, foster in-class culture of students speaking to each other without touching back to professor after each comment (happened eventually but not at the beginning of class).",
    "The sheer scope of the course disallowed a heavy engagement with any individual culture, society, nation-state, etc. More secondary readings on a larger look at this context may be helpful.",
    "This course succeeded in providing a survey on the history of race while also moving us towards a deeper knowledge of race across the semester. By the end of the semester, we were able to tie together many readings, arguments, and historical patterns, to see a larger story about how race has worked over time and across geographies. The course was well-structured and the readings for each week produced interesting cross-currents and dialogues. Greta facilitated the discussions in a way that allowed most people to participate most of the time, which allowed people to bring their different disciplinary knowledge and experiences together. Because the course was a survey, it occasionally felt like we lacked enough contextual knowledge (in a particular region, or on a particular subject) to fully engage with some of the material.",
    "Strengths: Very interdisciplinary, interesting readings that were a mix of primary and secondary sources, appropriate workload, quick (and thorough!) comments on written work. Weaknesses: At times it felt like a few students dominated class discussion (but that isn't really the professor's fault!)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "This course was both theoretically dense, but also friendly for newcomers to historical thinking. So I would recommend this course to such students, or to students plain interested in the subject matter.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in any period of history in the Americas, and to anyone who worked on race, gender, sexuality, or empire. This course provided a solid foundation in the history of race, while also challenging many assumptions or easy conclusions about race. The material we read (and the conversations we had) generally understood race, gender, sexuality, and power together, and did not privilege one social formation or narrative above all else. The assignments for this course felt useful, and I feel that my work and reading in this class will inform my thinking going forward.",
    "Absolutely, I would recommend this course to anybody who works on race & racial thinking, either in the present day or historically."
