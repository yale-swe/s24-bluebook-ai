   "comments": [
    "Easy elective if you are good at math.",
    "Really tough, but since Pollard is a jolly, compassionate soul who lavishes office hours upon his students like a medieval king scattering largess, you should do just fine (provided you put in the time).",
    "with prof pollard, class included a lot of derivations",
    "Even as a math major, this class isn't a walk through the park. The problem sets tend to be less theoretical than you may be used to, which is a bit refreshing. However, DO take the time to do them thoroughly and correctly. I can't emphasize that enough.",
    "Math 241 is a great class. The material is interesting, the problem sets are interesting and not too hard, and Professor Pollard is a great professor.",
    "This is a basic into probability class. Professor Pollard is great! He is very nice and really enthusiastic about the material. I personally didn't find the material very interesting and I would have liked a more rigorous, mathematical approach rather than a computational emphasis, but the class is not too hard and some of the material is quite fun. Definitely take it with Professor Pollard if you can.",
    "Very fun material in the beginning, but gets very boring and considerably less fun in the second half of the semester. The first part is applicable and what you would expect, then the second half is terrible and you end up regretting you took the course. Also, the homework grading is horrible, many points are taken off for minute errors in notation when all the major steps and final answer are correct. This is aterrible way to grade and makes you hate and fear doing the problems sets instead of learning and applying the material.",
    "Pollard is an enthusiastic teacher, but he is sure picky and confusing at times. I regret taking this class, but I'm not a Math major so I really didn't have a reason to take it. You don't learn any applications of Statistics. Starts off pretty easy, but gets very confusing by the end. The final was also very challenging.",
    "I would be very wary of taking this class. The professor is extremely rigorous and will take copious amounts of points off your homework for notation even if you get the right answer. The grading is also not normal because it is 50% problem sets and 50% final exam. The final was even harder than I expected. While the course is supposed to be an introduction to probability, it goes way beyond what an \"introductory\" course is supposed to do. You basically learn how to derive any probability concept from a few principles learned early in the class. The weekly problem sets probably took me 10-15 hours each week and there were 12 of them. That being said, Pollard was very willing to help you and answer questions in his office hours. If you do take the class, I would recommend getting in the habit of going to office hours every week. Overall, I would probably not recommend this class unless you think you are very good at math. Often times I was very confused in lecture and and the grading on problem sets was harsh.",
    "Alright course, way harder than you would probably expect.",
    "A lot more math intensive that I originally thought it would be. A friend who took it had told me to make sure I keep up with the material, and I thought I did, but I actually didn't. So now I am telling you: KEEP UP WITH THE MATERIAL. As in, don't just get the HW's in on time, but UNDERSTAND THE HW AND MATERIAL front and back. It's really easy to have no idea what is going on during lecture, so you really need to make the effort to read and understand the notes beforehand. Take the class because it's intense and rewarding--but don't be a failure like me!",
    "Great class! An absolute must take. This is not a gut class; expect to put in some decent work. If you have farily solid background in math, you should be fine. Take it if you can with David Pollard. He's the best.",
    "I would recommend Math241 for anybody interested in becoming better at thinking about thinking probabilities. Note, there is no textbook, so if you find yourself not 'clicking' with Pollard's style, then jump ship.",
    "This has the potential to be a really interesting and fun class. Instead, sometimes I find it gets bogged down by too much theory and obscure, hard to understand examples. Still, the application-based problems on the homework sets are interesting and students will leave this class with a good understanding of the subject matter. There is a lot of pressure on the final, as it is worth 50% of the grade, with the other 50% for homework. The class is tough, but most people take it anyways because it fulfills an Applied Math requirement.",
    "A fun class with useful material. Professor Pollard is a good lecturer, and he's also really nice. I liked it and would recommend it.",
    "It is a good course with interesting material for a math major. I recommend taking it if you have a strong calculus background and are interested in probability. But again, do not take this course if Pollard is teaching it.",
    "Take it with David Pollard. He's tons of fun. The problems are challenging but fun (coin tosses, drawing out of hats, and of course some more theoretical stuff). Not too difficult either.",
    "Not an easy class if you are taking it with Pollard. Be prepared to put in a fair of time on the problem sets only to arbitrarily lose points on questions that you got the correct answer to. There was no midterm in the class so the grading was 50% hw 50% final. Pollard posts all of the notes online. If you need to take it then I would recommend waiting until somebody else teaches it. If you are looking for an easy math\/QR, there are better options elsewhere.",
    "This class was by far the most difficult class I've taken at Yale, and I have taken quite a few math\/QR courses. The final was absolutely brutal, and it was worth 50% of the grade, with the other 50% coming from problem sets. The problem sets were also very difficult, and everyone else I knew in the class sought outside tutoring. I would have been lost without residential college tutoring. Do not take this class (with Prof. Pollard at least, because his version of the class is way harder than past years) as your first stat class. This class took up most of my time this semester.",
    "If you have to, with another professor",
    "You probably have to for your major or something, but its interesting class. 238 might be easier. But this class is thorough."
