   "comments": [
    "GMAN673: Advocates and Representatives is a seminar that examines the role of the advocate in literature with a focus on European literary criticism. It is an interesting exploration of new concepts (i.e. the concept of the advocate), and wonderful overview of texts: Danton's Tod, Der Prozess, Don Carlos and even Judeo-Christian - relevant texts (i.e. Girard and Gospel of St. John). I enjoyed this course tremendously, and thought that the presentations were very useful for understanding the texts. Dr. Campe, as always, is a wonderful professor and great about talking through new ideas! I recommend this seminar to students of German and comparative literature. Also, it is great for upper-level undergraduates or new grad. students, who are interested in the concept of representation."

   "comments": [
    "This class is very useful to students of German literature. As somebody with a special interest, I was able to encounter many texts (some already known and some unknown) and analyze them from an entirely new perspective. This helped quite a bit to write a new and original seminar paper, as well as with thesis research."
