   "comments": [
    "Fear not, Music and Melancholy (as strange as this may sound) is not a sad course. It is more a survey of intellectualism than it is a digression on music that is melancholy. I would most certainly recommend this course, though I believe the student body is necessarily self-selective. One must be prepared to ask the fundamental questions of the human emotional spectrum in academia if one is to wholly benefit from this course.",
    "This course needn't be summed up in more than one word: it is SUPERB. Prof. Brodsky is possibly one of the best teachers I've encountered in my entire career as a student. Please sign up for this course if you are remotely interested in the way music relates to emotion (specifically melancholy!). You will read and listen to some of the most incredibly diverse and interesting material in existence. I'm pretty sure none of us in the class this fall knew what we were getting into when we ranked Music and Melancholy as one of our top seminars, but the class turned out to be rewarding beyond our wildest dreams.",
    "Yes, Music and Melancholy is a great freshman seminar! I always looked forward to going to class, and the subject matter is fascinating!",
    "This class had difficult moments where we had up to 100 pages of reading for a class, but those were rare moments and it was actually not bothersome because the material was so interesting. As a writing-intensive course, it's not overwhelming. We wrote 5 essays, I believe, this year from (rougly 3) to (minimum 5) pages long.I would definitely recommend it! It was the best class of my first semester. It is not depressing at all.",
    "Music and Melancholy was a very enjoyable course, despite its melancholic topic. It definitely was a good introduction to the seminar format of many Yale classes. I felt really comfortable around my classmates and professor, and was always happy to add my thoughts to our very interesting discussions. This was a great course to take my first semester.",
    "A wonderfully illuminating course, and in my opinion, probably the best Freshman Seminar. Professor Brodsky is a great teacher and he makes the course material very interesting and fun to explore. He's a great cook too! Expect this to be your favorite course if you take this seminar.",
    "Music and Melancholy explored the diverse meanings the word \"melancholy\" has had over the past few centuries and how \"melancholy\" has had an impact on all the arts, focusing particularly on music. We looked at the many composers who have been called melancholic, and in a separate part of the course, we explored recordings of songs written from the 1500s to today which had the word \"melancholy\" in the title. Along the way, I picked up quite a bit about music history and about how to listen to and write about music in a critical way. I'd recommend it, but not to anyone who requires strict guidelines and parameters because Professor Brodsky's assignments are often very open-ended and abstract."
