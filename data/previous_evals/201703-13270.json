   "comments": [
    "- how to read case law - origins of environmental law - approach to seeing the regulatory structure and tools at play - strong background on history of enviro law - tools to take on new legislation",
    "I loved this class and it was an extremely helpful introduction to how environmental laws are created, and applied. I thought Professor Camacho's legal taxonomy and policy analysis lens for the course was very useful. I am not a law student but am interested in environmental policy and found the class very valuable.",
    "This course not only taught me about environmental law, I also learned so much about the US legal system and civics generally."

   "comments": [
    "Strong alignment.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations. Studying for my final exam and going back over material from the beginning of the semester, it was incredibly validating to find that I had greater facility with concepts that had initially been confusing. This class equipped me both with much more substantive knowledge about environmental law, and an ability to learn about new areas quickly.",
    "Perfectly met my expectations",
    "This course exceeded my expectations! I learned so much about environmental law as well as the legal system generally. Highly recommend!"

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: - great discussions - engaging lectures - wide-reaching understanding gained by end of semester - promotes critical thinking Weaknesses: - As a non-law student, more guidance early in the semester on how to prepare for class and what an exam looks like would be useful",
    "I honestly can't think of a weakness of this course. I would maybe have been interested in a research-oriented project in addition to the final exam to get more experience in legal writing, but I imagine that is unique to the needs\/interests of non-law students. Professor Camacho is a clear, interesting, and engaging lecturer. I always got so much out of class. The supplemental readings selected were also great additions to the textbook. The class was well organized and thoughtfully structured.",
    "Camacho did an excellent job of rewarding the effort of the non-law students in the class and never made me feel stupid even when I asked stupid questions."

   "comments": [
    "Recognize that this class is law first, environment second.",
    "Professor Camacho is a terrific professor and he made an effort to make sure non-law students were benefiting from the class and learning as much as possible. I would highly recommend taking this class if you are interested in environmental law and policy. I took typed notes on all of the readings, but wish I had also set aside time to review my notes before class to be able to respond to Professor Camacho's questions more quickly.",
    "Take this class!",
    "If you don't have a legal background expect this course to be tough, but worth it. There's a very steep learning curve at the beginning just to understand the legal jargon and how certain aspects of the legal system work."
