   "comments": [
    "It's important to realize that there is a fair bit of theory involved in the course which I did not expect. It is a very opinionated course, which I think people will enjoy, but students must also be prepared to learn about the theory of memory. It may interest people and bore others. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of slavery and how it impacts life today.",
    "The class is interesting and covers a lot of great topics. While it is engaging, it's a lot of work. Reading\/movie screenings take a lot of time. If you're willing to put in the work, take it. He's also a very hard grader.",
    "Awesome. Take it if you're willing to do that readings and a re interested in the subject.",
    "The class is a fairly interesting look at how America has looked at slavery throughout its history. Professor Ball is a really nice guy, and his personal connection to slavery makes him all the more interesting. That being said, he occasionally spent most of the class talking instead of leading discussions, and occasionally assigned a large amount of very dense reading that we simply couldn't cover in any detail in class. My favorite part of the class was that we analyzed lots of film, literature, music and photos for the memory of slavery they presented, and our final project was a whole class documentary about Yale's past connections to slavery, which was extremely fun and rewarding to make. I would recommend this class to anyone who is looking for a cool teacher and interesting subject matter, but I'd say don't stress out too much about reading every word of the very dense essays, and expect there to be some classes where you're mostly listening.",
    "This class is an exploration through the ways slavery has been remembered in the United States over time. I would highly recommend it to a student interested in a small class that looks at a wide variety of media and sources for learning about the topic.",
    "This is a seminar about how slavery is currently remembered in America's collective memory. I really liked the class because it opened a new perspective about the United States culture and its race relations. I thought that Professor Ball was great. He is THE expert in this field and it was wonderful to be able to look at this subject with such a professor. The only downside to the class was that at the beginning there was a lot of reading, but Professor Ball was very adaptable and understanding about the readings. Ball is a tough but fair grader. And an added bonus, we took a trip to New York on Yale's dimes. This seminar was the best class I have taken so far.",
    "Great discussion forum, and close interactions with professor and other students. I'm still not sure if I think the topic is super applicable to daily life but it was definitely interesting, and if you are interested at all in the topic of slavery you should definitely take it!!",
    "Not really. It was very much psychology based and really based on memory and how we remember trauma."
