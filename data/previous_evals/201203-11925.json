    "If you're looking at this course description, you probably have to take it, so yeah, go ahead and do it.",
    "This class was the worst academic experience I have had at Yale. This was because the instructor who taught it this year provided absolutely no structure for the class, filled all of the time with unmotivated student presentations, and frequently interrupted students\/took over their question time during the presentations. Also, she did not know much about non-experimental research methods in linguistics (formal phonology, language documentation, etc) and students who were using these methods frequently had to educate her about how their research worked.I did not learn about research methods at all in thisclass, and the course took away from my ability to work on my senior essay and other linguistics research. That said, it is a required class for the LING major, and all required classes can be terrible now and then. Please don't let the reviews of this class - which seems to be a one time dud - drive you away from ling, which is generally a great field and dept.",
    "You have to take this if you're a linguistics major - welcome to life :)",
    "This class is meant to help you develop your senior project idea so that you're ready to go in January. Every week we had an assignment, usually around 1000 words, meant to help you prepare\/write up different parts of the project. During class time we each presented our projects and where we were at every week. Because there were 14 or 15 of us that meant only 5 to 10 minutes for each person, and then you just listened for the rest of it, which could be frustrating. I don't feel that I got much at all out of listening to everyone else present, and that time could have been better spent working in small groups and having just 2 or 3 other people really get to know your project and give input. You have to take this class as a senior, and I don't see why anyone else would take it (it's irrelevant unless you're developing a thesis).",
    "Reviews don't really matter for this course, since it's required for the linguistics major, and only majors take it as part of preparing for the senior essay. Professor Pi\u00c3\u00b1ango had an experimentalist-centric approach, which was fine for most of us but frustrating for the handful of students who had done fieldwork. We did weekly presentations of our current status, which felt repetitive a lot of the time, though incremental progress did occur.",
    "Well, if you're a senior linguistics major you are probably doomed to have to take this, so there's really no point in my recommending it or not. Just hope Professor Pinango isn't teaching (teaching is really too generous a verb) it again, or that they change the format of the course. Also hope your peers are interesting because there is nothing else redeeming about the course. Its just busy work, if you actually want to get serious work done on your project, that'll probably have to happen outside the course.",
    "Evaluations from previous years say that you end this class with a solid outline for your essay. That might be true for some people, but for a lot of us (like me) I think we are not quite there yet. In terms of actual work, you have a weekly assignment. For the most part they are simple, but if you do not have your topic narrowed down yet, prepare for an extremely frustrating search that involves reading an insane amount of literature. The assignments themselves, though, are very chill: a short 4-pg introduction section, a short methods section, etc. Each week in class, you just casually update everyone about your assignment and your progress, which can at times very fun or EXTREMELY boring. Keep in mind: this may differ on the future, depending on how the professor (who is different every year) wants to run the class OR if they change the course entirely.",
    "I would recommend Research Methods to a fellow linguistics student. Not only did the class encompass a broad range of linguistic research methodologies, but students were given ample opportunity to develop their individual senior projects as the semester progressed. The course was worthwhile, unique, and useful. The opportunity to openly discuss project progress and closely examinedifferent methodologies is very valuable in the development of the senior thesis. In sum, the class was enjoyable and recommended."
