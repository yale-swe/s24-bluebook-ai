    "Tentatively yes. The workload is very manageable and interesting and the other people in my class were brilliant and had very diverse perspectives. Prof. Weiss didn't say much during class though, so if you end up in a section with less smart people the class wouldn't be as good. Readings are great, but sometimes very theoretical.",
    "Flexible\/somewhat customizable to your specific interests related to China, great grade distribution across different assignments, good opportunity to meet other bright students and to be exposed to leading thinking regarding China. Jessica Weiss is brilliant."
