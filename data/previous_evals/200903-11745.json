   "comments": [
    "I doubt anyone that doesn't need it for their major will take this course, but it is a really good lab course. You learn a lot and it is not particularly stressful or difficult.",
    "Take the lab- you learn a lot and it accompanies the Orgo class well.",
    "It is the best lab course I have taken yet. There was never a time that I thought \"Why are they making me do this?\" Everything seemed applicable and reasonable, and I can say with confidence that I know and understand most of the techniques, without killing myself to do the work.",
    "If you have to take it, you will. But the lab is straightforward and no work superfluous. I think it's one of the better labs I've taken.",
    "Chem 222L was a very solid lab course, and actually quite enjoyable and interesting. Unlike some labs which may seem difficult and pointless, I feel that the techniques learned in orgo lab are very applicable to the real world, especially if you want to pursue research in the future. Good TAs can be a big strength to this course. I recommend!",
    "Chemistry 222 is a pretty enjoyable lab course that's more about the experiment itself than it is about procedural things. For example, the yield doesn't matter so much as you follow the necessary steps, which takes a lot of stress off of the students. Make sure you carefully read your course packet for instructions on Post-Lab assignments; they expect you to know it and won't necessarily go over it with you.",
    "Great lab. Take it.",
    "Chem 220 is orgo lab, which means a lot of technique labs and a couple of syntheses. Orgo lab is so much better than Chem 116\/117, for those who were scarred by that experience. There's a weekly prelab assignment, and a post lab assignment, usually just lab notes or maybe a bit of extra post lab with the lab notes. The work was by far less time intensive, and way more appropriate for a half credit class. Hope that you get a good TA, do what the lab manual and course packet say, and you'll be fine.",
    "I'm pretty sure that your experience in this course all depends on your TA and the people you take it with. I was with a ton of cool people with an awesome and funny TA, and the lab was such an enjoyable experience. Christine is awesome, and the lab is well-structured. A great experience!",
    "Good laid back lab course. Much more relaxed than gen chem. Got to listen to music while we worked. Only one big lab report. Multiple choice final exam. My favorite lab so far.",
    "useless",
    "I would definitely recommend this classes to other students. If you are taking orgo lab, it's probably because it's required for your major or premed. That being said, I wouldn't be afraid of the lab at all - it was very straight forward and less time consuming that gen chem lab. Because Dimeglio and my TA were great, the lab was at times even enjoyable.",
    "You probably won't take this course unless you have to. Solid lab course with not too many reports.",
    "Chem 222L is way better than the Gen Chem labs. Labs take much less time, and there was only one full \"report\" for the entire term (but it was worth a lot). Instead of a report for every experiment, there were smaller, \"post-lab assignments\". This year, instead of weekly quizzes, we had all the information poured into a multiple choice final. Don't get cancer.",
    "Take it if you have to; like all lab courses, there is an absurd amount of work put in for the half credit that we recieve.",
    "It is a worthwhile class, and if you are taking the orgo lecture, then I recommend that you take this lab along with it. The labs are manageable and easy and you finish within two hours.",
    "I would only recommend it if you need to take it.",
    "Take it--it supplements Orgo beautifully, and really solidifies lab techniques in a concise and easily remembered fashion.",
    "It's not anything that's going to be practical in real life unless you're planning to do more lab work in the future or go into the research field. But it is a great learning experience. I personally enjoyed it much much more than the orgo class itself. And it also depends on your TA. I had an awesome TA who made the lab a lot of fun to be in.",
    "This course is fantastic - very doable without sacrificing a lack of depth. Prof. DiMeglio was extremely helpful whenever guidance was needed. Highly recommended",
    "Great basic orgo lab; the basic techniques are thoroughly taught at a very reasonable pace.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they're interested in working in a chemistry lab or if they are premeds !",
    "It is a good lab.",
    "Overall a pretty good class, very educational. Be warned that the workload is a little bit more than half of a regular class, but not entirely unmanagable if you pace yourself.",
    "Totally useless, painful class. But, you have to take it, so do it.",
    "Chem222 is the supplementary lab course to chem220. It covers basic lab methods like thin-layer chromatography, infrared spectrometry, distillation, fractionation, recrystallization, column chromatography. It was probably my favorite course all semester. Take this course because it's definitely helpful for...learning about science, in general, but if nothing else it makes the lecture course chem220 more doable, emotionally. It's not that difficult and the workload is reasonable, especially for a lab.",
    "- yes, it was fun, relaxing, and not too much work",
    "A required class that ends up being quite rewarding.",
    "Yes, if you are premed, you have no choice anyway.",
    "I enjoyed this lab- so much better than gen chem. The experimental plans, lab notes, and lab reports, while tedious, were never too time consuming. You only need to write a few full lab reports, and unlike previous years, there are no pre-lab quizzes. The lab is organized and well-run. I suggest getting to lab as early as possible- you're allowed to arrive up to an hour early.",
    "As labs go, this one is pretty good. You learn a lot, and the work is only really bad for the one full lab report.",
    "This was a great lab, I loved it! It was very well organized and really enjoyable. It made the organic chemistry concepts very understandable and accessible, and I learned a lot. The labs weren't long at all and the post-lab assignments were much shorter and easier than gen chem lab while still reinforcing the concepts covered in the lab and making sure we understood the experiment and its data. Dr. DiMeglio made an effort to come around the lab and talk to each of us every week, which made it a personal class even though it was quite large. Overall the best lab I've ever taken at Yale, and one of my favorite classes.",
    "This class is actually more interesting than the lecture, and is a good way to learn concepts better. I would recommend it.",
    "I really enjoyed orgo lab. My TA was great. The techniques learned weren't difficult, and it makes orgo better, since you see practical sides instead of just reading Wade's textbook.",
    "tkae it if you need it for major or premed reqs",
    "It's much better than gen chem lab. Recommend...if you need to take it.",
    "CHEM 222L was a good lab course. It offered more variety than CHEM 116L and the material was interesting.",
    "AWESOME...Organic Chem lab is SOOO much better than Chem 119, and DiMeglio is wonderful. Much more interesting, too. Take it!!!",
    "Don't worry about doing any of the experiments correctly, just waste all your time doing the report exactly how they want it. Unfortunately you don't know how they want it done because it's rarely ever outlined properly. You will get points off for dumb reasons.",
    "This lab course is very relaxed and stress free. If you are between taking this class and not... I would definitely recommend giving it a try. The prof. and teacher fellow are very engaged.",
    "take it for requirement otherwise its not worth it because you have to take lecture",
    "Organic lab is so much better than general chem lab. They have the radio on and are much more chill about things like accuracy. They want you to have precision, but they don't attach 20% of your grade to it. The final was kind of weird, because even though it was multiple choice there could have been more than 1 answers to the questions.",
    "Grading can be harsh and labs can be long and frustrating if you don't get a reaction right the first time. Other than that it's fine.",
    "I would recommend Chem 222L. It is a great lab course (much better than general chemistry) and it's not too much work. The professor is great and the experiments are generally interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab, even if you don't take Orgo. Sure, it may get a little hairy towards the end but nothing you couldn't manage",
    "Good lab class, outside work isn't terrible and labs are interesting.",
    "This is basically a survey of techniques in organic chemistry lab. You learn how to do TLC, IR, distillation, fractionation, etc. While it's a fine lab with not too much work, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you have to as a chem major or premed. The workload is fairly light with an experimental plan due before lab each week (1 hr) and a post-lab assignment, varying from 1-5hrs to complete. There's only one full lab report which took awhile.",
    "CHEM 222 focuses a lot on teaching chemistry techniques, and doesn't really reinforce the material learned in class. Nevertheless, it's a necessity if you're pre-med, and it's really not that bad.",
    "It's orgo lab, which you're probably only going to be taking because you have to. That being said, the lab is not very difficult (it's a lot easier than Chem119L, for example, and it has about half as much work over the course of the semester) and Prof. DiMeglio is a good professor and is friendly and helpful, too. The TAs all graded very differently, but there's not much you can do about that besides hope you get an easy TA. Also, the lab generally ends early, between 3:30 and 4:00 (b\/w 2:30 and 3:00 on Thursdays).",
    "Put the time in. Don't give up easy points that you would have gotten with an extra half hour of prep.",
    "From what I've heard, it's better than other labs. It was also more enjoyable than lecture this semester.",
    "Yes, but only if you need it.",
    "Good lab course, don't be scared of it, just do your work, there is a little too much hand-writing required but try and convince your TA to accept typed up work.",
    "This is an interesting course. If you are thinking of going into chemistry or any other science, first semester teaches you some very valuable techniques. If this is the case, I would definitely recommend it. A word of advice, Don't wait until the last minute to do the last laboratory report!",
    "It goes much more smoothly than 114 lab and usually does not take as long.",
    "Chem 222L is a great lab class! I enjoyed it much more than Chem 116L. The radio's always playing in the orgo lab, which gives it a laid-back feel. You're also never graded on experimental accuracy. We had a multiple choice final exam and no weekly quizzes, but Dr. DiMeglio gives exam prep questions in the lab manual for each experiment, so it wasn't hard to prepare for the final. Also, the lab assignments are more manageable than in Chem 116L. We only had one full lab report this semester.",
    "Yes, take this orgo lab! It is relaxed and quite quite a pleasurable experience as hard as it is to believe lab can be fun.",
    "You have to take it if you're reading this. The class itself is not bad- that is the material- but the people will make it harder than it needs to be. Be prepared to put in a lot of hours doing EPs, assignments etc. and then get graded really harshly due to formatting details and nitpicky things that have nothing to do with lab, orgo lab, or organic chemistry.",
    "Great! I loved it, and from what I hear about other science labs, it's one of the best.Some cool color changes during syntheses, but apparently the best stuff comes next semester in Orgo 2.",
    "Cover basic lab techniques and concepts for organic reactions. Much better than the into chem lab.",
    "Better than 119 lab, that's for sure. Like all chem labs, it's more work than 0.5 credits, but oh well. Hope your section isn't too smart cause it's curved.",
    "is much easier than gen chem lab and is fun in some aspects...definitely take it..not bad or hard at ll",
    "It was actually a great lab. Not too stressful and it helped me understand some of the concepts in the 220 class.",
    "Good for learning lab techniques\/synthesis techniques. A small amount of it is a review of gen chem.",
    "If organic chemistry is difficult, the lab is the sugar to help the medicine go down. Dr.DiMeglio has put together schedule of labs and assignments that slowly ease the student into the practices of conducting organic labs and writing up reports. Definitely take it.",
    "Take orgo lab because you have to. Its much better than inorganic lab because the experiments are actually interesting and complement the lecture course well. Also, you're not running around all the time doing busy work and the post labs are not full lab reports so they are manageable. There is one final written which is so much better than weekly quizzes. The course is also curved to a B+ so its really not that bad.",
    "Yes. Good lab class.",
    "Orgo lab is not as time-consuming as general chemistry lab. It is quite enjoyable. Everyone works a lot of more independently. Be warned though, the turned-in assignments are graded quite harshly and there is no ungraded assignments in the beginning of the semester for students to become familiarize themselves with the grading level of the course. So be sure to start on your toes and not make any mistakes within your reports. Pay extra attention to details.",
    "Take with Chemistry 220.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "it was a course that did not require too much work but was helpful to learn basic orgo lab techniques. I was not a fan of the final exam at the end. It is easy to go through the procedures like an automaton and then try and cram for the final. But, I really liked the orgo lab environment. Music played while we did experiments.",
    "If you're thinking about taking this, you probably need it for a requirement. It's a good course, though. As long as you do the work you're asked to do and you aren't afraid to ask questions, it's not bad at all.",
    "pretty good overall. take it if you need the lab credit.",
    "Yes.",
    "Orgo lab is a good course. The workload is not too difficult, and they give us more than enough time and guidance in writing our first lab report. You learn a lot of the techniques you should know for orgo and get to practice them repeatedly.",
    "Great!",
    "This is a course that might not seem fun at first glance but is actually quite interesting. It might take up an entire afternoon but time passes quickly in this class. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, if you are taking the lecture class.",
    "Yes only if you're Pre-Med or a Chemistry major.",
    "It's all about your TA. Some grade very leniently (as in they don't even really look at your EP's) and some extremely hard and it's hard to know what you're going to get points off for until you make a mistake. They say everything we need to know is in the lab course packet, but there are often many other things they take off points for that are not included.",
    "Not worth the .5 credit, but that's the case with every chem lab. Still pretty enjoyable.",
    "Standard organic chemistry lab. I would recommend the course to those who need it.",
    "I would recommend this as a course if you are pre-med or a chemistry major. Otherwise, it is interesting but pointless.",
    "Great lab experience",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a fellow student. Most of the people in the class are taking lab to fulfill requirements, but I would still recommend it for someone who just enjoys experimenting and chemistry.",
    "TAKE ORGO LAB (ESPECIALLY FRIDAY). It\u00b4s actually one of the best labs you\u00b4ll ever take at Yale. I KNOW.",
    "Excellent lab. Much better than intro labs, less protocol fluff, more substance.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 222L to other students, because the experiments were all very interesting and relatable to the lecture course, Chemistry 220.",
    "I would recommend taking this lab along with the lecture. Though the lab requires a lot of work, you understand organic chemistry more than just reading about it in the book.",
    "Orgo lab is an excellent course, especially when you compare it to the other labs I've taken (chem 119--ugh!; physics 205--nothing special). But if you're looking at this it's because you're premed or a chem major or something so you don't really have a choice. Take it and don't worry much about it. It's probably about 1 to 1.5 hours of work outside of lab per weeks, the labs usually run only about 2 hours, and they are actually really enjoyable. Best advice: get a hang of how to to the EP's and lab notes well from the beginning--once you do, it's easy to get 10\/10's on them, and it'll really help in the end. Wish someone had told me that...",
    "This was the best lab course I've taken. Very reasonable amount of work outside of the lab. You have to do Experimental Plans for each lab, but they actually make the lab itself a lot easier. No lab quizzes, just a final exam at the end.",
    "Organic lab course that teaches you the basic techniques of organic chemistry. Challenging but informative. Would recommend if you need it.",
    "Much better than general chem lab!",
    "Very fun for organic chemistry. I would recommend it to students who are interested in organic chemistry or premed"
