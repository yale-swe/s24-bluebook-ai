    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in the field of mental health. You do not necessarily have to be a psychology major or be interested in being a clinician to get a lot out of this course. Just be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class at your field placement or triad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! All components of the class--seminar, triad exercises, and field placements--were really incredible and you will undoubtedly learn a lot from them. It is more work than you might expect, but it is definitely worth it!",
    "GREAT class. One of the most impactful classes I will ever take. It was a moving life experience (gaining a new perspective on mental illness) and I have developed useful \"helping\" skills I will take with me far beyond college. Highly recommend this class if you can get in.",
    "I would definitely recommend Clinical Psych to another student. I felt like I was able to learn about many different aspects of Clinical Psychology as well as many of the controversies within the field. I also really enjoyed the field placement and felt like it gave me insight into the lives of the mentally ill in a way that my other classes have not. Overall, I found it to be a fair and insightful course.",
    "The course is interesting and fun. The seminar aspect is very relaxed, but still impactful. The placement aspect of the course was the main reason I took the course. However, the placements seemed to differ greatly as did the students satisfaction with them. The triad experience was also a definite positive of the course. I would recommend the class to other students.",
    "A really wonderful and interesting class!",
    "Clinical Pych is a class that will open your eyes to new problems in society. I highly recommend this class not only to students interested in Clinical Psychology, but also students interested in mental illness and health care.",
    "If you have any interest in clinical psychology, take this class. It is amazing and the field placements are wonderful!"
