   "comments": [
    "the nature of disability studies means that this course helped me to shift and rethink my worldview and the assumptions that i make, as well as the assumptions that are embedded into our society's laws, buildings, and media. while every single reading taught me specific new things, i would say this broader perspective shift was the more important takeaway. i also learned a bit about anthropology itself, as a means of inquiry.",
    "you will learn a lot about issues regarding disability and diversity of topics involved in disability studies. Definitely an eye opening course that will get you thinking.",
    "Taking this course better changed my understanding of the ways through which disabilities are stigmatized by that fault of society not being organized to accept difference and provide equity for all. It also clued me into how different communities treat disabilities around the world.",
    "Thinking, writing and talking about sociological issues,.",
    "I definitely gained a different perspective of disability that I feel I had more so for race. It was challenging to navigate a topic that was so out of my experiences that I had not been really exposed to but it was so important and I value that.",
    "You learn to look at disabilities and what are considered as disabilities through a whole new lens. I think understanding the disability theories and how it relates to our definitions of being human was really critical for me to learn.",
    "The course was a great introduction into the study of disabilities. It is one of the very few valuable courses focusing on this topic. I have learned briefly about different disabilities. The social model of disabilities is especially useful and widely applicable to the everyday life. I felt the theoretical part was rather short and would have liked to read more, but the course was already packed with different materials. The greatest insight I gained was how much difficulty this society imposes on disabled individuals.",
    "This course opened my eyes to a discipline\/area of studies that I never knew existed, and for that I am eternally grateful. It has caused me to start questioning many of the things I had previously observed as the stagnant status quo, when it comes to disability and society's approach to it.",
    "I went into this class not really sure what I was expecting to get out of it, and came out of it with a new perspective on life. When disability does not affect you, it seems at times trivial to think about it. Or even to think that you know all about it. This class opened my eyes to the social and medical model of disability, the disability activist movement and the social actors involved, the ADA, the intersection of race, gender and class on autism in the US and across the world. We learned to be critical of Yale and the steps they have taken to accommodate students with disabilities and discussed ways of moving forward. Although the workload for this class was not overbearing, the readings that were assigned were all insightful thoughtful pieces that brought up very interesting questions. I was truly happy having taken this course."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "i would say that it would have been helpful for intersectionality to be introduced in the first or second week so that that framework could guide our thinking. we would make references to different experiences of disability earlier in the semester, but i think having it explicitly from the start would help to undo the idea that considering gender\/race\/class are just \"extra\" things, but not really central. maybe in conjunction with the chimamanda \"danger of a single story\"?",
    "The course was certainly strong in making us question the terminology used to discuss disability, and the mentalities held in representing different groups. I also appreciated the intentionality and space to break off into small group discussion after the lecture portion of class. I do wish however we'd spent more time on behaviors and mental disablities.",
    "She was obvious very knowledgeable about he material! She was super approachable and was really helpful when we asked questions.",
    "The class had a good structure and you always understood what was expected of you. I do feel like we would have benefited from having a more in depth oral component.",
    "Because there is so much information, it naturally needs to have a lecture component to it. But the seminar\/discussion component of it is really engaging. I think free discussions rather than those with prompts work better.",
    "The strength is the fact that we touch upon various disabilities that widens your view. However, I felt it lacked on the theoretical part since we really depended on social model throughout the course. I think we could have also read other theories, like Foucault. I would have also liked a week expanding and applying the theory in novel ways. We only looked at what is customarily seen as \"disability.\" I think there are other experiences we could have looked at that are actually disabling contrary to widely held view. I also felt the assignments were somewhat poorly designed. There were little place for creativity. It sometimes became awkward trying to connect all the readings in one writing. I would rather suggest doing a shorter reading response and adding a more engaging assignments such as interviews and observations at Yale.",
    "I think the readings and the lectures complemented each other really well without repeating, and I always really enjoyed doing the readings. I would have liked to have spent a little more time on mental\/psychiatric disabilities.",
    "Because the class was smaller, this really felt more like a seminar. There was discussion more than anything, which was mostly very interesting, but sometimes the conversation would come to a stop or go in circles. I really enjoyed learning about disability in other countries (like how only blind people could be masseuses in South Korea) and wished there was more of that in the class."

   "comments": [
    "yes, the course is not too demanding (other than being on top of your readings, you basically get to choose the topic you want to work on for the semester) and really informative. from my experience with bluebooking, it is fairly unusual to have a course that centers on or consciously includes disability studies",
    "Yes definitely!!! The class and Professor Miles really makes this class worth taking!",
    "Definitely! A very unique course in terms of the breadth of topics covered pertaining to disability. The course has a large focus on the weekly readings that really serve as the basis of class discussions.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, as ability and disability are identity categories almost never discussed, even in the context of discussing privilege and acknowledging different experiences.",
    "Everyone should take a disability studies course before they leave Yale. There is such a lack of understanding about disability on this campus that it's alarming. This class was a wonderful introduction to disability theory and discourse.",
    "Yes I really enjoyed it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. You should engage with the material and speak in class because that it a part of the experience. It's important to be able to look at disability studies in this light too because as a topic it deserves more conversation.",
    "Yes, but know that the final paper is 40% of your grade - work hard and constantly check in with Liz if you can. She is SO helpful.",
    "I thought the course could be greatly improved in terms of its designs, but the material is very interesting and highly relevant to everyone. I recommend all Yale college students to take this course regardless of major. Disability is much more prevalent and closer than you think!",
    "Absolutelyit's a unique subject that all should be exposed to at least once, I believe.",
    "This was my favorite course that I took this semester. The readings were really interesting and the topics were all very relevant. I liked that we got to choose our final paper topic, because we then got to explore something that maybe hadn't been explored as fully in class. There were lots of good examples from non-American\/non-Western cultures, which I think is really important. I would recommend for anyone who wants to learn more about Disability Rights and Activism. I learned so much in this class.",
    "Yes",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. There is one prcis (or reading response) a week based on very intriguing readings that bring up thought provoking questions. You have to present your idea for your final paper as a midterm grade, which ended up not being stressful at all, and then write a final paper, which can be based on anything of your choosing and which you get plenty of time to write. Overall, this course would be especially rewarding for someone who has never taken a class on disability before because it is very introductory, but it teaches you so much if you go in knowing nothing. Liz uses TED talks or videos and powerpoint slides to get her points across and then opens it up for discussion. It is best to not be shy, because Liz is very eager to hear your thoughts, and it makes the discussion more interesting."
