   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, it's interesting, moderately difficult, and informative.",
    "Yup",
    "History of US foreign policy from 1917 to 1991 with a large focus on 1917-1945.If you have some background in the subject, take a seminar or more specific class. The course is too broad.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're looking to understand the big picture of 20th Century American History. A really interesting course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's not amazingly exciting, but for anyone interested in modern history and the state of the world today the information in this course is invaluable.",
    "This is a course on US foreign relations from World War I through the end of the Cold War. It is a chance to really learn more of what actually happened and how each president and war made an impact on the course of the nation.",
    "Great, very interesting spin on the normal way the 3 world wars are presented. different foreign perspectives on events, giving a clearer picture and more foundation upon which to form our own conclusions. Readings were interesting and never too didactic. Lectures were interesting but got monotonous near the end, as they all began to sound the same. Professor Cohrs is clearly very knowledgeable in the field. Sections had interesting discussions. Grade is divided into participation, one final paper, and one final exam.",
    "International relations is not my cup of tea (I found this out during the course), but Prof. Cohrs is a fine lecturer and the overview of 20th c. history\/diplomacy was something I enjoyed. Take a look at the syllabus when it's available - it's very detailed and it'll give you insight as to whether you'll enjoy the material and Prof. Cohrs' style. Cohrs' lectures can be a bit dry, so don't take the class if you need an entertainer on stage to keep you awake, but they are very well done and insightful.",
    "Its a survey course with a lot of reading.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot in this class and it is interesting.",
    "History 139 is a great class to take if you want a basic understanding of American foreign policy during the two World Wars and the Cold War. However, don't expect it to change anything drastically for you.",
    "It's sort of like AP US history for that time period, but with more details about other countries and the way the countries all interacted and fewer details about domestic stuff. I would recommend it to another student if they want a history lecture that gives them a broad basis of knowledge about the US in international affairs. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who already knows a lot about international relation though, because they would probably be bored.",
    "I might recommend this course, but not if you are looking for a class that is actually global in its perspective. The syllabus and the course description talk a lot about incorporating views other than those from the U.S. and Europe, but in reality the vast majority of classes are devoted to relations between the U.S. and Europe, and you just get a couple classes devoted to Latin America and one to Africa and the Middle East. Asia gets a little more attention but still not nearly as much as Europe. It's a good course, but you should know going into it that it is not that different from any other class about U.S. foreign policy.Also, the workload is pretty good -- you essentially don't have anything to hand in until reading week, when you have a paper and then a final.",
    "The course is basically an overview of US' foreign policy and relations with other countries from WWI through the Cold War. I would definitely take the class if you don't know much about that, and care to learn more. It's not a run-down of all the things that happened from 1917-1991, but more of an analysis of different countries' policies.Most of your grade is based on a final paper (8-10 pages) and a final exam, both of which are manageable. But, since you don't have regular assessments, it can be hard to keep up with the reading if you are the type of person prone to falling behind.I really enjoyed it, and would recommend it. If youdon't know much about the events discussed in class, I would try to read the textbook before class (the Iriye\/Cohen one) to be sort of familiar with what Prof Cohrs will be discussing. But take the class if you want to learn more about US' role in the world during the 20th century. Prof Cohrs is a very good lecturer.",
    "This course discusses the United States and its relationships with the rest of the world throughout the 20th century. I would certainly recommend this course to any student that is interested in history.",
    "A useful survey course to take if you want to learn about America's international relations between 1917 and 1991. If you already know this history, you probably won't learn much new.",
    "A great overall lecture course of US international history. The lectures can be a little slow, but take it if you're interested in getting a great structure for the 20th Century. Just check the syllabus twice and make sure you like the grading system.",
    "I learned alot from the course, but the presentation style felt dry at times. Take this if you really like a straight diplomatic\/political approach to history.",
    "Yes",
    "You learn about the history of US foreign relations. There's a strong emphasis on World War I, since that's the professor's area of focus. Unfortunately, he doesn't use PowerPoint in his lecture, so he just tends to ramble, making it hard to pay attention and follow. The bright side is that the only work is the final paper and final exam. Like many courses, they focus on analysis at the expense of not really teaching you the facts, which ends up being a huge problem when you're studying history. Overall, I'd say it's OK - mediocre, not a ton of work, not great, not painful.",
    "If you have an interest in the period I would recommend it, but its not a course that will spawn an interest if one is not already present.",
    "US and the World History is a great survey course about the 19th century, covering both world wars and the wars in South East Asia (Korea and Vietnam) and the Cold War. To be honest, the lectures are not the most intriguing of presentations, but overall, Prof. Cohrs offers a cool different perspective about these commonly taught world events. As far as course load, there is a moderate amount of reading to do each week, but its pretty easy to get by without doing it very carefully. (It all depends on your TA). Definitely the course reader is less important than the books, which actually once you read them, (even if its the weekend before the exam) are really interesting. This class is definitely one of those that you get more out of the more you put in to it. The only assignments are a final paper and a final exam, which are due in the same week, but if you manage your time, its not bad at all.",
    "US and the World is a survey course for the US in the 20th Century. Much of the information is not new, it is taught in highschool history. But there are sections of the world that are going more in depth than a high school course, such as Africa and Latin America.",
    "This course offers an expansive look at the major themes behind historical events in the 20th century. It also focuses not only on America's relations with other major powers, but also on American influence in the third world. However, the course is at times almost overly broad, and the lectures, while informative, are not always 100% engaging.",
    "This is a good class for the student not very well-versed in 20th century U.S. foreign policy. It is a survey course, and it will give you a good understanding of how the U.S. came to occupy the position of global leader that it currently does."
