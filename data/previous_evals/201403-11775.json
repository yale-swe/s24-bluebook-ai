    "In Zulu 110 you learn enough Zulu to participate in simple everyday conversations. And to pick up words from conversation and figure out what may be happening. It is a great class because although the learning is rigorous, the Professor is kind and accommodating. One is not intimidated when participating in class. And it is definitely a more chill environment than most Yale classes, especially the language ones",
    "Thisha is an excellent instructor. She works very hard to explain things in the way her students need; when we would like to hear more about the details of the grammar, she breaks everything down very clearly. She's an amazing linguist, and her expertise in this region shines in the classroom. I'ms o lucky to work with her! TAKE THIS CLASS if you hope to ever work in South Africa!",
    "A great class with a phenomenal teacher! I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in learning a Bantu language."
