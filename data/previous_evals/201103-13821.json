   "comments": [
    "English 120 is fairly intensive, but an essential course to take at Yale. It compares very favorably with other intro writing classes. Profs are generally amazing. I would highly recommend this to anyone.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student, whether or not they are interested in English. It is fun, but also so worthwhile. You learn so much without even realizing it. I will miss this class next semester, but I'm thankful for how much it has helped me grow.",
    "English 120 with Cynthia Zarin was one of the best courses I've ever taken. The readings were always interesting, and our discussions of it in class were largely student-led. Professor Zarin knows exactly how to convey the essence of how to write well in a way as concise and clear as a good 120 essay.",
    "Just like everyone says, english 120 is like the best class at yale. Zarin is a boss and also high up in the department so she's good to know if you want to take more english classes later.",
    "I would reccomend this class. It is a lot of writing, but not too much reading and its paced well.",
    "I recommend English 120 to everyone."
