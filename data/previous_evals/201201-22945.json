    "Overall if you pay attention in class and learn from your corrections on previous papers, your writing will improve. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "If you're interested in the human behavior trends that relate to climate change policy, this is the class for you. I would strongly recommend this course.",
    "English 121 is surprisingly scientific-- we read articles from climate journals and even one from Science. Only at the end do we actually explore the rhetoric of climate science. Great for science majors who want to explore the implications and interpretations of scientific work!",
    "English 121 is a course that requires a student to read all of the material assigned and remain engaged in discussions to get the most out of the class. The more effort you put into studying the material, the more developed your ideas and papers will be. Do this, and you will see a major improvement in your writing and maybe a change in your approach towards scientific papers. I would certainly recommend this course to other students, because it will certainly help you improve not only your organization of ideas, but also the ways in which you employ literary devices to present those ideas.",
    "Great class to tune your writing skills, you will write a lot in class especially. The assignments are not long of hard, and you only have the equivalent of 1 reading response a week plus reading a couple papers. You will learn a lot about the climate debate, science in the media, and a lot of interesting topics for dinner conversation or just for you own information."
