    "Greek L4 has you read between 30 and 50 lines of the Odyssey a day. At first, I was terrified. It seemed impossible to get a handle on the readings, the vocab, the weird Aeolic forms, the meter. Over time, you actually get more comfortable with the weirdness of Homer. For me, this took longer than most. Prof. Bakker was happy to meet with me and that definitely helped.",
    "I learned to read the homeric dialect of Ancient Greek, and also many concepts concerning the poetry.",
    "This class is the perfect introduction to reading Homeric Greek. There is an ideal balance between grammar and analysis of the text.",
    "I made significant progress in my ability to read ancient Greek (especially Homeric of course), making the transition from more rote memorization to being able to move into actual texts. Additionally, Professor Bakker explained so much about the Odyssey. I will always look at the epics differently; I had no idea there was so much in there.",
    "My sensibility for the Greek language and literature improved vastly. This was one of the most informative courses I have taken at Yale."

   "comments": [
    "The class is strong because the language is beautiful and we get access to that beauty. Moreover, the emphasis on meter and our ability to recreate the gorgeous hexameter by a few weeks into the term was so rewarding, especially for someone like me entering with no experience reading classical metrical poetry. Also it was nice to have a strong, consistent immersion into using a dictionary and being exposed to multiple nuances of words which we would then translate into just one of those. This course could be improved with more of a general introduction into the ways Homer's language differs from the prose with which we are introduced to reading ancient Greek--particles, for example, were rarely touched on, and I in general felt the lack of acknowledgement that we were reading something whose differences demanded that we figure them out. The structure of the class was the exact same every day, which I didn't mind because I liked hearing Professor Bakker translate after we did, showing us how to better read the nuances and voice, but which some might find annoying or not as challenging for being predictable. The structure of going around in a circle with everyone translating once also meant that everyone was treated in exactly the same way, which can be read as less personal attention to your own learning or lack thereof than I have observed in my other classes so far (even other translation classes). The class's main strength is Homer.",
    "It can feel like a slog at times to be translating three days a week just to have 2 minutes on the spot in class, but you get from Homer what you put in. At the end of the course, you will have a very strong familiarity with arguably the most important text in literary history.",
    "I think the course was set up exactly how it should have been.",
    "A lot of interesting linguistic digressions. You get much better at reading Homer by the end. A fun class.",
    "The format is very relaxed and not too stressful, something which I appreciated. To some degree I think we fell off of a systematic treatment of certain themes, and we ended in a somewhat awkward spot, but overall I was very pleased with the course.",
    "I feel like we could have done a little more reading per week without much trouble, yet we also shouldn't concern ourselves too much about getting through all the lines each day, because Bakker's commentary on what we do get through is very useful and interesting. The quizzes were a little perfunctory, and stricter grading might have been helpful."

    "You should take this class if you are interested in Homer or literature. But you should be sure that you have about 9 hours a week for the homework, 3 hours before each class period, which feels like a lot of preparation for a language class.",
    "If you are pushing through Greek, definitely do Homer. Maybe skip the prose class (L3), but a whole semester focusing on intense and meticulous Homer will be good for your language skills.",
    "Yes",
    "Any Classics major looking to increase their language skills as well as gain a fundamental aspects of Homer should take this course.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are enjoying Greek up to this point. To say that the subject matter is \"classic\" is too obvious to say. However, beyond that, the experience is that of translating with a group of friends and learning from a passionate world expert on the story. I was genuinely excited for this class and will miss it dearly. Especially given that it is rather mercifully constructed in terms of the demands of the course, I am very happy to have taken this class.",
    "Absolutely. It's deeply interesting, and it helped my Greek skills immensely."
