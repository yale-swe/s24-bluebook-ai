   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed my writing and critical reading skills.",
    "DS Literature is a really fun class for people who already like reading and talking about books. That is basically the extent of it: I don't think it is essential to learn to the material so much as practice analytical skills etc. It also presents a sort of continuity between literature over (primarily European) history.",
    "In second semester DS Literature, you get exposed to many incredible, diverse, beautiful novels. You learn how to close read passages from each of these works, as well as make connections to other works in this semester, and to works in the previous semester as well.",
    "I read a ton of the most fundamental works in modern Western Literature. The readings were very interesting, and I genuinely wish I had more time throughout the semester to read the entirety of all the works.",
    "I discovered again and again the beauty in literature.",
    "Literature analysis and reading. How to read a super long book in an unhealthily short period of time. How to interpret plays\/dramas. How to write insightful and interesting papers.",
    "I learned how to connect works of literature we read this semester across larger themes like solitude, identity, and place. I also learned how to have efficient and successful discussions with my classmates about literature and to build off of their points to create my own.",
    "I never started outlining essays\/going for riskier essay topics ubtuk this class. The spirit of the classroom, which encouraged ambitious ideas, definitely contributed to this.",
    "I learned how to better write an analytical literature paper and improved my participation skills in a seminar-like setting. I also gained a baseline understanding of the more contemporary works of the Western canon."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strong course overall, but I wish all of our responses were graded because we put so much time into them.",
    "I like the pace of the content as a way to get basic familiarity with the works.",
    "The breadth and speed of this course is, for me, the biggest strength and weakness. The speed and breadth allows you to cover an amazing scope of ideas. I think that the scope of DS as a whole is one of its most valuable qualities. However, that speed doesnt come without its difficulties.",
    "The strengths of the course were the readings. They were varied and extremely interesting. The major weakness was the amount of reading that needed to be done this semester compared to last semester. DS Literature likes to read the entire work, or a large part of the entire work. This worked well last semester, but for this semester, the works were very long, and we never spent more than two sections on any work besides Paradise Lost. This meant that it was nearly impossible to finish all the readings, and I found that very frustrating. Also, the people in my seminar did not help produce an intellectually welcoming atmosphere. There were lots of people who tried to dominate the class and did not respect the opinions of other people, making class participation seem like an annoyance rather than something fun and worthwhile.",
    "The discussions were almost always excellent, and lectures were as well. This is a fantastic course, and the texts themselves are incredible as well.",
    "While Prof. Hagens is a very interesting person to talk to outside of class, unfortunately I sometimes disagreed with his style of leading discussions relative to other DS classes. The class seemed sometimes to focus too much on minutiae, though it was largely okay. Good feedback was given.",
    "This was a great class, but I felt that at times certain students were given more credence with their ideas than others. Certain students tended to dominate class discussions, and I felt that they were praised for their ideas when perhaps other students had better ones. Overall, it was a good class and we were able to grapple with themes of literature together.",
    "I greatest flaw of this course lies within the rapid rate at which we study novels throughout the semester. However, this is also one of the defining strengths of the course, forcing students to direct their attention toward the most important details of each text we study. I believe that this could be improved by an evaluation of the number of texts the course covers, but at the same time, it is this challenge that forges greater critical thinking skills.",
    "Reading responses were great (though painful in the moment) -- made me more engaged with this class than any other DS class. Maybe have students poll on what section of the text they want to talk about beforehand since some students seemed annoyed we only typically got to the first few pages for a lot of works in depth and then lightly skipped around.",
    "This course did provide a baseline knowledge of the major works of the Western canon. However, the way Directed Studies executes this goal is problematic. This program lacks standardization. There should be a consensus among professors on the main points of each text that should be discussed in section especially because all students receive the same final. Also, the reading this semester was double that of last semester, so it became very difficult to choose themes to focus on in our limited seminar time. One's experience in DS is greatly influenced by the professor one has. There is a lack of standardization in the writing assignments. Each professor gives different prompts, with some students receiving 6 and others over 30. Students should be provided with a sample paper so students are aware of the expectations of the writing assignments are. Professors have different views on what a literature paper should look like but the program advertises that students will know how to write a standard, analytical literature paper by the end of their freshman year."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes. Not only was the reading list fantastic, but the discussions were lively and in-depth. I noticed my improvement.",
    "Take DS literature if you want a whirlwind tour through the western canon. It felt like something that I needed to take before diving into more specific works in future classes.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course to another student. All of the novels, plays, and poems that you read are wonderful. Particularly with ending on Omeros, and its return to the Iliad and Odyssey, you get to experience a full circle return to the beginning of first semester Literature.",
    "The class is worth it for the works that we read. I would hope other students get a better section than mine was. Hagens is a good professor, but I don't think he is the best of the literature professors this semester in terms of really engaging the class to the work and helping focus on major themes of the work.",
    "DS, and the literature track especially, was the best intellectual experience I have had in my entire life. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any incoming first years. Prepare to read and write a lot of pages, but to be rewarded beyond measure.",
    "Yes!!! Fantastic books! Fantastic professors! Prof. Hagens is the best!!",
    "Yes, this is a great class--I really love DS Literature. Having daily reading responses in addition to the essays at times proved difficult, but in general the workload was manageable. I really enjoyed discussing the works we read with my classmates, and felt that my understanding of the works deepened through these discussions.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to students who wish to immerse themselves in the realm of liberal arts, as the three courses allow for students to consider a variety of majors that stem directly from the topics covered in the three courses. In addition, Directed Studies is ane excellent way to satisfy distributional requirements, and once completed, students will have the writing capabilities and critical thinking skills to take on many other challenges throughout their student careers.",
    "Amazing texts and amazing lectures to go alongside them. There's truly something here for everyone and that showed during discussions.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in the Directed Studies program and one who wishes to develop a basic understanding of the major contemporary works of literature. I would recommend this course only to a student who is intent on writing as this course requires one to write a significant amount. However, one's experience in this course varies widely depending on the professor one has."
