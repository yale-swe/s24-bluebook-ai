    "I think a course like this needs to be continued in the future at FES. There is no other class offered that is geared towards the finance aspects of land management.",
    "Lloyd Irland is great. A terrific teacher and very passionate about the subject. I am really sorry that he will not be around for future FES students.",
    "It is truly unfortunate that Professor Irland will no longer be at FES next year, and that this course will no longer be taught. This course fulfills a huge need for students interested in managing land and resources who require an introduction to financial analysis. The economics courses do not fulfill this need, because they are based on more general economic theories, and they do not provide a grounding in the tools of analysis that an individual would use to gauge the financial viability of a specific project.I hope that the dean and other decision-makers will think seriously about this and that they will try to develop some alternative that will address this critical need.",
    "Although a difficult class, the material is extremely important for MF students. The course should not be canceled!",
    "I am very glad I took this course. I think it's critical to know something about how resources and land is valued, especially for an MF like me.",
    "This is probably the best class I've taken at FES - it made everything I learned in Silviculture come together with the real world and brought out so many of the actual constraints of land management that mostly get ignored at FES. This was a key class for me and it's absolutely incomprehensible that it won't be offered next year."

    "the assignments",

    "Practical use and run through of real life financial analysis and techniques.",
    "The best thing was certainly homework that allows students to get the insights behind the lecture",
    "This course is grounded in specific case studies, which makes it practical and real, but at the same time it also presents a toolkit for financial analysis that is much more broadly relevant to other situations and can be transferred easily.",
    "The lectures of varied and interesting topics.",
    "Lloyd brought big, difficult topics to the class, like the productivity of plantations or pricing carbon. There's far more diversity of opinion in the forestry community outside of Yale than there is within Yale, and I think Lloyd did us an important service in raising controversial topics.",
    "The instructor - Lloyd clearly loves teaching and was the most accessible, most interested, and most enthusiastic professor I had this semester. He clearly went above and beyond the call of duty, and was very understanding of our interests and concerns.The assignments were key to the learning process in this class, as much as we suffered while completing them - without them, we wouldn't have learned anywhere near as much.The field trip to Maine was the best part of the semester to me - I learned more in 4 days than I have in months of studying! Also, it made me fall in love with Maine. Thanks!"

Also, he let me pick his brain for hours in Maine, without complaining once.Elyzabeth put in a huge amount of time and preparation, and her office hours were an essential part of getting the homework done. She clearly explained the assignments and was even willing to help us outside her office hours - repeatedly."

    "Essential to it!",
    "The course fits my overall program in forestry as it provides me with new skills and knowledge about the financial analysis with respect to forestry.",
    "This course comprises my only introduction to financial analysis, and thus provides a good complement to my other courses which are more ecologically, socially, and politically oriented.",
    "I need to know about finance if I ever want to run my own tree farm or sugarbush.",
    "I'm an MF and I want to work in forest management or land conservation.",
    "This class really brought into focus the things I've learned in Silviculture and Ecological Restoration. Taking these classes without a financial analysis class really just doesn't make a lot of sense - dreaming up treatments and management regimes is easy, but making them feasible is the important part. This class gave me a good context of markets for wood, and gave me an understanding of the relevant factors involved in landowner decision-making. This class is key for my future as a professional in the forestry and conservation sector."
