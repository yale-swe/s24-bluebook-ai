    "It's an econ requirement, otherwise not too interesting. Through the regression project I learned how to use Stata, which may be useful down the road. I guess it's a decent class for what it's trying to teach. Exams are open book so less stressful perhaps. If you are an econ major, then you have to take it. Otherwise, there are more interesting classes about statistics in other departments.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to. It's a tough class in terms of grades and material.",
    "A good class that's taught well.",
    "i would definitely recommend this course if you want to gain some useful stat\/excel skills that you can apply to anything from social science experiments to finance (esp the latter). benkard is a great teacher. problem sets can be annoying but are good for learning Excel, the midterm isn't bad (although the T\/F questions are absurdly weighted, 10 points each), although the final is harder.",
    "Yeah go for it.",
    "Using statistics and economic models to answer questions ranging from maximizing revenues to the relationship between unemployment rate and wage.",
    "It's a required class for the economics major so you have to take it anyway. If you're trying to learn econometrics for the pure joy of it, taking the harder class (Econ 135) would help you learn more. The class wasn't hard, just tedious.",
    "Never take this class. Horrible",
    "Standard metrics course; take it only if you're a major",
    "His slides are great and very informative, but still have to attend class to really understand the material. If you're going to take econometrics, take it with Benkard.",
    "Take it.",
    "tests are straightforward.class is useless. don't go.take it because its required.",
    "I would definitely recommend this. Benkard makes the class interesting. It's definitely not easy and you have to do a lot of work, but I'm glad I took it.",
    "if you're a quantitative person, like I am, it'll be a pretty easy social science credit. It's basically intro statistics with a SO slapped onto it. Beware though, because if you're not an econ major the econ majors who take this class are very intense about doing well so there's no curve or anything.",
    "Professor Benkard is a pretty good professor with a pretty good reputation. From what I've heard about last year, the class this year was harder than last year's though it was still manageable. Just know that the lecture notes posted online are not always very thorough, and there are some concepts that will be new, especially if you're coming from an AP Stat background. Don't expect anything life-changing.",
    "great",
    "It's required for economics majors. If you've had a previous course in statistics, I would recommend taking a higher level statistics course in place of 131. I had previously taken an introductory statistics course, and I found 131 to be so easy that it was difficult to study for.",
    "Take it if you're an Econ major. It's also good if only to learn the basics of how to build statistical models and other things that'll come in handy if you want a job in finance. Professor Benkard is fantastic. Not dry, clear, concise. Best professor to teach this class.",
    "This is recommended for any econ major, esp. those who do not know math too well. Those econ\/math majors or math experts may consider 135\/136 more.",
    "TAKE THIS (if you're an econ major or want to work in finance) great intro to econometrics, you learn useful statistical analytic skills that can be applied to the real world, benkard is great--take it with him, work is manageable",
    "TAKE IT. Great class, although the fact that the lecture is at 9am (if it still is) will deter you from going to class. Benkard is insanely good, he gives examples from real life and makes the class awesome. But taking a lecture class at 9am in general is not a great idea",
    "If you are an econ major, it is mandatory. There are open note tests, so not much memorization, but you need to get a sense of stats and when to use each formula to do well, which can be hard.",
    "Careful with psets as they can be graded fairly arbitrarily. Otherwise, the course was pretty solid.",
    "Good course, applicable to real life. Problem sets, 2 different regression projects. Final regression project is a pain, so start early. Go to lecture if you take the course, you'll get a lot more out of it.",
    "Take it if you must. It seems like Benkard's class is the best option for econ majors.This class seemed far more interesting during the first few weeks of school and then became quite boring. However, this is most likely due to the subject matter and not the professor. I thought Professor Benkard did a pretty decent job with keeping monotonous statistical information relevant.",
    "This was a fantastic class! I loved it. Professor Benkard is a great teacher, and he is a very nice guy too. All of the lectures are posted online, but it definitely helps to go to class because a lot of the notes are not on the lecture slides. Section is optional, but I HIGHLY recommend going to section because it helped reinforce concepts with great examples. I would suggest finding a good TA. We had some Law School students who were not the best, so I would try finding an Economics grad student who can explain what's happening pretty well. Rebecca Edwards was a good TA, so seek her out if she still is teaching. But DEFINITELY try to get Jiwon Kim if she is still a TA. Jiwon was hands down the best TA I had this semester. She was clear, focused, and helpful. She gave relevant examples that were even covered on tests. Go to her office hours, too, especially for the regression assignment. That assignment is really hard, so start early and ask the TA questions. Other than that, just know the first half of the course is much, much easier than the second half. To give an example, I have friends who got perfect scores on their midterms and bombed the final. Stay motivated throughout, and you'll be fine.",
    "You're probably not going to take this class unless you're in a major that requires it (or another statistics course). Although I haven't taken any other stats classes I would recommend it over stats. I always found statistics terribly uninteresting and at least this had economics applications. Regressions are kind of fun, and I'm not sure how much you do of those in a stats class (I could be wrong). If you do take this class, I would recommend waiting until second semester to start missing class if you have to. Things get a little more lenient and there's less material in the second half that you actually need to know for the final.",
    "Great in many ways. Benkard is a very practical guy and teaches as such- open note tests, not too much theoretical math, lots of real world applications. much better stat class than more theoretical classes i took in the stat department. not a big fan of the regression assignment but that was only a small part of the class.",
    "only if youre an econ major, or want to go into something math related (finance)",
    "Not a very good class, but not a bad class either.It was actually quite good up until the midterm, and then the 2nd part of the course (on regression) was just not very good at all. I'm not even sure what I learned since midterm (if anything..).",
    "As a non-major who took this course as an introduction to statistics, I was very happy with my choice. If Prof. Benkard is teaching the course, don't let the reputation of \"Econometrics\" frighten you off.",
    "Take it if Benkard teaches it.",
    "It's a requirement for Econ majors, but it's still a pretty good class. Professor Benkard teaches it really well and gives a lot of real-life cases for us to study. His teaching it makes it worth getting up for a 9 am class.",
    "Take it if you have to, avoid it if you can.",
    "I don't know how the econometrics class in the spring is, but this one was fantastic. Prof. Benkard includes plenty of practical elements in the typically theory-driven econ curriculum. I would definitely recommend this course. The exams were tough, especially the final, but fair. If I could make one change to this course, I would include some more problem sets in the second half of the course instead of just loading them in the beginning. By the time the final came around, I felt as though I was out of practice in spite of the sample finals and such. Also, one of the practice finals was from Stanford GSB, so it was nice to know we could do those types of problems. Finally, go to section. It helps to reinforce some of the less conceptual, more math-based calculations.",
    "A really useful class. Take it.",
    "It may seem easy but it screwed up the curve if everyone does well. Take if you need it for Econ major. No real reason to take it otherwise.",
    "It is difficult if you have not taken statistics. It is not really an econ class, but simply a statistics class where some of the examples involve economics. I was disappointed in how little economic analysis was involved.",
    "Overall, econometrics is a pretty good course. For someone who hadn't ever taken any statistics before, I didn't have too much trouble understanding the class concepts. Benkard is a good professor who really knows what he's talking about, and he comes up with a lot of good examples that are applicable to real life and actual research. Strengths: clarity of the material as presented in class, Benkard's teaching. Weaknesses: 9 am time, difficult problem sets, a lot of subjectivity in the material (a lot of times, the professor and TA's answer to questions would be \"it's a judgment call\" -- being an intro econometrics class, I would've liked a clearer answer). Also, it's a curved class so you have no idea what your grade will be until the end, when you're evaluated relative to everyone else. I would definitely recommend this course, and recommend that you take it with Benkard. Other than some long problem sets and assignments, the class isn't too painful and is actually quite interesting.",
    "An interesting class on regression and probability. The professor's great, although he moves really fast in lecture and was sometimes hard to keep up with at 9:00 AM. The class overall was not very demanding, as both the midterm and the final were open book\/open note. That didn't stop the final from being really hard though.",
    "Yes, take this with this professor. He's the best you will get.The stuff he covers is easy, but i mean, these basic econometrics, you can pretty much learn on your own. So why suffer through a professor whom you have trouble understanding?",
    "all intro econometrics classes are graded on the same curve. so why take benkard's which has more work (including a devastating regression assignment that sucked up more than forty hours of my life)? i'm still asking myself this question.benkard is fine (no, the lectures aren't awe-inspiring, in fact at 9AM [just an aside about the start time--SERIOUSLY YALE, a 9AM STAT CLASS?]they can occasionally be a little boring). some of the material is really interesting, particularly the last lecture on the winner's curse\/oil drilling scenario. unfortunately the fascinating material never shows up on the exams.problem sets are graded extremely punitively, but i suppose that's inevitable in a course that's strictly curved. exams were generally fair, if a little tricky--study hard. i had taken two stats classes before (AP and another course at yale) and still got thrown by a few questions.finally, it would be really awesome if the huge regression assignment that was worth a substantial fraction of our grade was actually handed back before the final. more data points=better resource allocation during finals week.",
    "Exactly what you'd expect. Blend of stats, probability, and regressions.",
    "monkey balls",
    "Take this class with Benkard, and not anyone else; he made this class accessible and fun, and the subject matter is very useful and caused me to change the way I view the world. Not that difficult of a class, though you may feel lost in lecture sometimes. Work on problem sets in a study group, study old tests and slides (both provided by Benkard) to do well on the exams (which are pretty straightforward in themselves, though there do exist questions that will throw you off), and you'll do fine. Good luck with this prereq (for Econ and EPE, among others!)",
    "Unless you're an Econ major, take Intro Stat instead. If you do take this class, make sure your TA is good (Jiwon Kim if possible).",
    "Obviously you have to take it for the econ major, but it's not as boring as it seems, especially the first half where we talked about probability and prediction.",
    "This is an interesting course, and it is useful to learn how to do a regression. Benkard does a great job. The final regression assignment is a bear.",
    "I would recommend this class as long as you're willing to put some work. If you don't put forth a good attempt, no one will help you out.",
    "As a class you need to take for the economics major, you should definitely take it with this professor. I shopped econ 131 3 times and he certainly is the best. He makes the material understandable and approachable.",
    "if you're reading this, you probably are an econ major and have to take the class to graduate. but with that being said, prof. benkard does a good job of making class interesting and teaching the material.",
    "Yes, take it with Benkard.",
    "Fantastic course. The first economics course that I've taken that I've really found applicable (I'm an EPE major). Benkard is wonderful and the workload is manageable. Take it if you're considering taking any form of stats.",
    "Yes for econ majors.",
    "It is a course that you should take if you enjoy statistical regression or are an economics major. If not, don't bother.",
    "take it.",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Going to class is definitely optional. You can figure most of it out before the tests and p sets.",
    "Great class in which you learn quite a lot but have to work hard. Go to class and do the assignments and you will do well.",
    "If you are an Econ major you have to take it, otherwise DO NOT TAKE this class. If you have a background in statistics it might be easy for you, but if you are like me and haven't been really exposed to statistics, it might be a struggle.",
    "Econometrics I should not be a hard course at all. And it isn't. However, the exams are graded harshly (I lost 13 percentage points on the midterm for forgetting to divide by 2) and Benkard does his best to try to trick you on exams. I guess you have to take it for the major. Just don't take it lightly.",
    "I recommend the class if you are interested in the subject. Definitely take it with Benkard, its worth it.",
    "Fair course, relatively painless for an econ core requirement. Pretty misleading because the beginning seems very easy, the middle it gets difficult and you get lost really quickly if you don't keep up. Midterm was not hard but again, it was misleading, because the final was very very difficult. Do not take unless you are an econ major, because the number of intense econ majors is very high in this class, and the curve will reflect that.",
    "Take it with Benkard.",
    "Hard class, don't take it for pure pleasure!",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow econ majors. if you're not an econ major, I see no reason why you'd want to take this course. The first part of the semester refreshes knowledge in statistics and probability and the other second part to applying this knowledge in regressions.",
    "The class is a great introduction to statistics. If you want more on probability theory, take MATH 241. If you've taken AP Statistics in high school, this class will be too easy for you. All in all, it was a great refresher on statistics for me.",
    "take it if you need to... interesting and worth cr\/d if you don't need it. valuable material, good lecturer (Although 9 am classes are not ideal) You'll learn some cool stuff, but definitely not an easy class (deceptively seems like it is at times)",
    "You have to take this if you are an econ major. Not fun. take Stats instead if you can. The curve is awful.",
    "Surprisingly not that bad. I know a lot of people think it's just a class that you have to take as an Econ major, but I would suggest it to others as a statistics class in general.",
    "It is a course in statistics. I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in the social sciences, not just economics. Knowing statistics, and particularly regression, is extremely important.",
    "Statistics heavy.",
    "I'm not an econ major and I took it to understand economic data with regressions. Its a really good course and the professor is amazing. I'm not a morning person, which I think hurt my grade in the course. Make sure you go to class. it really matters.",
    "I hated this class. The fact that it was at 9 am combined with the mundane material was a terrible combination.",
    "Econ 131 is a good introduction to Econometrics. Definitely take it if you're considering an Econ major. I thought the material we learned was very practical and I can definitely see myself using it down the road. The workload was managable. The problem sets sometimes took a long time but they were doable. The exams were not too difficult. Professor Benkard is great and makes the subject really interesting.",
    "Straightforward introduction to statistics. In fact, the syllabus is basically the same as Intro Stats. Not a class to be worried about.",
    "Yes. Great class.",
    "It is a required course for econ, so you probably have to take it if you are looking at this. Otherwise take it if causation and correlation interest you, you are okay with math and willing to do some work.",
    "You probably don't have much choice in taking this class if you're an econ major. The lectures were fine, but the curve on the midterm seemed harsh, and the final was much more difficult than the midterm. Make sure to work on your regression project in advance - I did, and the last two nights before it was due were still absolutely miserable. Overall a decent course, but one that you certainly need to take seriously to do well in.",
    "yes, cause you have to",
    "Take it with Benkard!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course with Benkard - the professor makes all the difference and the material is useful really for anyone in terms of understanding quantitative analysis at the most basic level.",
    "Take it if you're ok learning statistics through a largely verbal approach. If you're more quantitative and need to know why things work out on a mathematical level to understand, then take ECON 135. I thought this class was more difficult just because often the wording would be ambiguous, whereas showing me the math would have been easier to understand. Prof. Benkard is, overall, a good lecturer.",
    "Take it if you need to for the econ major. It may be one of the better econ. classes you take a Yale, at least among intro\/intermediate lectures. Professor Benkard is very enthusiastic.",
    "Absolutely if you are an Economics major and need to clear this prerequisite.Yes to other majors as well who want to learn basic data analysis skills.",
    "its a requirement.",
    "Econ. 131 is a decent course. Benkard is a dynamic lecturer, but his approach to the regression section of the course (perhaps the most important section) was a little weak. At the end, although I felt like I understood probability and statistics pretty well, I didn't have a full grasp on multivariateregressions. And the 9 am start time got rougher as the semester went on.",
    "I would recommend it only if it has to be taken. It's not a particularly interesting or fun subject, but Professor Benkard truly does try to make it as fun and interesting as possible.",
    "Take it. It's a good course for people who have or haven't taken any sort of statistics before. Personally, I hadn't before taking this but I did fine and learned a lot. I'm a math-oriented person anyways so it wasn't too hard to understand.Lectures are good for the most part. There were 1 or 2 where me and most others were pretty much lost the entire time, but that was very rare. Usually I thought what he was saying was easy to follow and not that complex.Problem sets are annoying not because they are hard but just because they are annoyingly graded. I couldn't seem to do well on most of them, and I still don't know why. I understood the material as good as anyone, but my problem set grades didn't reflect that.",
    "take it, one of yale's indispensable skills",
    "It was a good class that helped me review basic statistics and opened up the world of regression for me. After econometrics, I feel that I will always be able to apply statistical and analytical techniques to things that I study which will really come in hand. It is better than a basic statistics course (one level higher up) because it teaches you to apply these concepts to real-life scenario's which is great. The workload was manageable, easier than most courses at yale and I did not feel stressed by this class. Most students ended up not coming to class towardst he end, but that's probably not a good idea as some of the stuff he talks about at the end is really interesting.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "The course is a large lecture, but Professor Benkard does a good job breaking it down and asking for student input. I really appreciated his willingness to help us learn the material, and I thought overall, I got a lot out of it.",
    "Econometrics is a pretty good course. The problem sets at the beginning can be a lot of work, but at the end you get a really good idea of how statistics work inside of the economic field. It seems to focus on how to gather data and interpret data in the context of economics research, which isn't too bad. Also, the tests throughout the class are not difficult, but the difference between As and Bs are just small mistakes, so make sure to take your time on the tests. Other than that, good class.",
    "Econ 131 is a very useful course that teaches you how to analyze data. This is especially helpful for econ majors. Prof. Benkard makes the lectures as interesting as possible, and explains things well. The TFs were also very helpful.",
    "Fascinating in places, a little underorganized in others. Take it if you can admit to yourself that the lessons are useful - and can commit to mastering them accordingly.",
    "It's a good class if you want to learn some stats, but if you're just shopping around for a fun econ class or a QR that'll make you think, it's a bit dense.Still, I have to be fair - ECON 131 is perfect for what it is: an introductory stats\/analysis course. Definitely recommended for econ majors.",
    "This class just only seems to amount to teaching you how expected values and variance as well as regression is applied in economics. I couldn't see how other aspects of the course were useful or related to economics.I don't recommend this course unless you are an Econ major since I didn't feel like I learned much from it. I heard the 2nd semester econometrics class is easier since the problem sets are out of the book and the tests are more straightforward, but the lectures tend to be dry and hard to understand with a Japanese professor."
