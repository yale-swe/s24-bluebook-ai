   "comments": [
    "Take it if you like the subject matter. I loved it and had a great time.",
    "Yes! The material is fantastic and the class is approachable for anyone. The work is not bad at all and super interesting.",
    "I would recommend it, but its alot of memorization.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! There's a lot of reading, but it's all worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student - the material is interesting, but more than that I felt I really developed a better ability to understand critical writing and write my own papers.",
    "This is a good class to take Cr\/D because of the immense amount of art you are expected to memorize. I was interested in the material, but I know if I had to memorize all those paintings (title, exact year, artist first and last name), I would have gone crazy. This was my fifth class for 5.5 credits, and it was good to not have to worry in lecture. Carol has a very special lecturing style, but if you try to pay attention she's saying very interesting things. Take Cr\/D unless you're an art history major, because otherwise it's just a lot of memorization.",
    "It's fun and exciting (the time, the works and the artists), except that we had to get the exact years for exams (I think it really depends on the TA though). You might not like Prof. Armstrong's style of lecturing, but she's got a lot of information for you.",
    "I'd recommend it to a student who wants to learn more about French art. I wouldn't recommend it to a student who wants to take his\/ her first history of art class. There are simply too many images, and the readings are fairly difficult.",
    "I would recommend HSAR 315 to another student. I've taken many art history classes and I feel that HSAR 315 is one of the most comprehensive. You'll move quickly through the 1700s hundreds with the Rococo and then get into the 19th c. Prof Armstrong starts off slow, but don't let that scare you off right away. The lectures get better over time. She is not the most organized, but is very engaging. It might bother you that you don't get through all of the artworks on the slide list she provides at the beginning of lecture.Sections are awesome and will help you cement ideas learned in class and go more in depth with terminology from lecture. Section was definitely the best part. The reading is hefty, but useful. You don't have to read it all, but make sure you skim all of it and try to read half of it closely.",
    "Take the course.",
    "I would recommend this course. I hadn't taken any art history courses at Yale before, but I found the material very interesting and manageable. Professor Armstrong isn't the most engaging lecturer, but I enjoyed the course because I really liked the material. There course has a midterm, final, and two papers, which are all fair.",
    "One of the best time periods for studying art and the world it can open up into \u00e2\u0080\u0094 modernity, shifting gender roles, political upheaval, empire \u00e2\u0080\u0094 with an amazing professor who has devoted a lot of scholarly work to these artists. Highly highly recommended.",
    "Really great class, even for non art history majors.",
    "Great lecture on 19th Century French Art which also examines the history of the period and its relevance to the artwork the period produced. I would definitely recommend this class for another students. It's a very fun and interesting lecture to attend.",
    "Yes. This course is fascinating. The materials were all interesting and professor and teaching fellow do a good job in explaining the materials. However, you need to memorize a lot of images for midterm and final."
