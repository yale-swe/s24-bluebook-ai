   "comments": [
    "Fairly reasonable French course, every single thing you read is incredibly sad.",
    "A continuation of FREN 130 with a 10 minute oral presentation now included as one of the big projects.",
    "A study of French grammar through the lens of literature, with historical elements and cultural elements mixed in, along with a few films. Highly recommended and a nice change of pace from the FREN 110-130 rhythm.",
    "No. While Madame burton is fantastic and really cares about all of her students the curriculum is just not very interesting",
    "If you have room in your schedule and want to continue honing your french, take this course!",
    "An excellent intermediate-level French course. It has more emphasis on reading\/speaking and less emphasis on grammar compared to L3. The readings are excellent (an anthology of postcolonial Francophone stories, Un Sac de Billes which is an autobiography from WWII, and La Symphonie Pastorale). There is a fair amount of work -- grammar assignments every day or two, and 40-page reading assignments by the end of the course (though the reading is fantastic and you will enjoy those 40 pages!). Madame Burton is wonderful. Overall a great course if you want to improve your French.",
    "I would highly recommend this class-- it is somewhat challenging, but it greatly improved my fluency and ease with the language. I enjoyed the course material and the lively class activities. It is an effective and enjoyable way to learn the language.",
    "I would recommend the course. I haven't been in any of the other sections of French 140, but it's hard to imagine a more enjoyable experience with the material than what Madame Burton offers. She appreciates participation of all sorts, encourages input, and doesn't take herself or the class too seriously. Her main goal, and the main goal I see in the rest of the French 140 team, is to benefit the student as a whole, not just as their life intersects with the French department."
