   "comments": [
    "Obviously don't take this class unless you're an Econ major.",
    "Pretty straightforward, single derivative-based macro. Prof Moscarini is very concerned about his students, and his emails are really nice and caring. Take it in the spring with him! There isn't too much work (45 min problem sets a week, midterm and final), and the exams are really straight forward as he literally gives you all the hints you would need in the question. I really liked his teaching style.",
    "Take it with Prof. Moscarini because I think the curve is better than in the fall.",
    "Tough course.",
    "I went to lecture 3 times. I'll just leave this here. Okay, just kidding (about just leaving this here). Prof. Moscarini isn't the best lecturer but he seems like he genuinely cares about his students. The Psets aren't bad, do the reading since the textbook is really good and interesting (imo). The 9 am time is just brutal and unrewarding.",
    "Don't be scared by past evals. The class was enjoyable, as long as you understand multivariable calc. Also, the PSets were fair - read Moscarini's weekly emails they help a lot. Also, the final and midterm weren't particularly terrible.",
    "All Econ majors have to take it, but for non-Econ majors, I'm not sure if I'd' recommend it. It was a pretty interesting class, but I could see students not as interested in the subject being disappointed. The professor tried to make it better, but there's only so much you can do.",
    "Pretty easy class. Just the final was kinda confusing since it required you to memorize graphs instead of giving you a model in which you could derive equations and simply plot those as graphs.",
    "You probably have to take it. In reality, it's really easy so just stop complaining and take it. Also remember that economics is a highly mathematical field, and if you want to major in it, you should know that, so stop complaining about having to do basic algebra and take a derivative.",
    "Only take if ECON major to fulfill requirement",
    "You mineswell take Macro Theory because that's what this class is. This class is completely different from Nordhaus'. We didn't even go over international trade or foreign exchange because we focused so much on the math behind micro theories.",
    "Not bad, interesting at points, mostly pretty dry",
    "If you're taking this class, you're probably an econ major who has to. That being said, I think it's a solid class and adds depth to the macro you learned in intro by introducing micro foundations through models that have real-world implications.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it for fun, but if you have to take it for your major, then you have to take it. Go to class and read the textbook to keep up.",
    "It is a course focused on the general economic theories and current issues in economic policy-making.",
    "As taught by Prof. Moscarini, ECON 122 emphasizes the microfoundations of macroeconomic models (i.e. there's lots of math). Prof. Moscarini, though he's a busy guy, makes sure to supplement the textbook with historical anecdotes and additional details in lecture. Perhaps not the best course for the mathematically-uninclined, but I think math is crucial for understanding higher level economics.",
    "If ECON 122 isn't a requirement for someone, I wouldn't recommend that he or she take the class. I think if he or she has taken Intro and wasn't an Econ major, it's not worth taking Intermediate.",
    "It's micro on a broader scale.",
    "It's required, so you have to take it anyway. Take it for a mental challenge and if you really want to understand the vagaries of the macroeconomy. By the end of it, I was super proud of myself for grasping economic concepts that were way beyond my intellect.",
    "I had very little understanding of macroeconomics before taking this class, and left with a pretty solid working knowledge of it - I can read most economic news and have a pretty good sense of what is going on, and evaluate\/judge economic arguments. The course also puts value on economic intuition, so beyond the main macroeconomic principles which I know well, I also know how to think of things from an economic bent more readily now. If you feel good about your math skills and know basic microeconomics, you can probably take this class without needing intro macro. It will be a little more challenging but could save the course credit \/ boring lecture, as this one is more stimulating. If with Moscarini, definitely try to go to every lecture - reading the book alone is not enough! Plus, lecture is very clear, probably more efficient than trying to read the book cold.",
    "I was originally reluctant to take this course because I wanted to take Econ 126 and it wasn\u2019t offered this semester, but I want to say that I was very happy with 122. It was vastly better than my intro course at providing a cohesive whole to the study of macroeconomics. Many of the models I was introduced to before now make sense to me. We spent a fair bit of time picking apart various models of business cycles, a mysterious concept that becomes elucidated in this course. The assignments were quite fair and they helped you solidify concepts you learned in lecture. I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in solidifying his understanding of macroeconomics.",
    "Good class if you need the credit for the Econ major and don't mind the lack of international exposure.",
    "Most likely this is a required class, but Moscarini is great! The work is standard.",
    "I wouldn't go out of my way to take it but I think the usual blatant criticisms against and the negative image of the course is undeserved. It is a good class, you finally start seeing how economic theories are relevant to real life as opposed to intro classes where everything just seems naive and unrealistic. It will be somewhat boring if you're not into economics but if you are interested by the subject take it, and not just because it is a requirement for the major.",
    "an agonizingly boring class. Moscarini may be a good lecturer, but he has a tendency of unnecessarily complicating things.",
    "I would recommend ECON 122 to students who are interested in better understanding economic policy.",
    "Take it if you're an Econ major; otherwise, avoid."
