    "This is a class that you should only take if you are a Global Affairs major. I cannot recommend that any non-majors subject themselves to it unless you are incredibly interested in quantitative analysis of development have a very strong background in econometric techniques and advanced statistical analysis. Otherwise it will just be incredibly painful and depressing most of the time.",
    "Ok, so everyone else on here will talk about how terrible this class is, but I actually really liked it. Global Affairs majors, for the most part, are all terribly afraid of numbers and statistics, and most everyone went into the class with already a horrible attitude. I found that Professor Keniston was a pretty clear lecturer, and as long as you do your work and keep up with all the lectures\/start problem sets early, it really should be quite an interesting class. This has been the most practical class I've taken in the Global Affairs major so far, as you actually come out of it with real knowledge of development projects and their feasibility. My recommendation is, if you are here, you probably know that you need to take this course regardless. Go into it with a positive attitude, keep along with the lectures, and you will totally be fine.",
    "Take it if you have to. Take it with friends. The group problem set model is weird and could be extremely frustrating if the group does not work well together.",
    "A requirement for Global Affairs majors, this class is essentially an overview of current development literature coupled with an instruction to econometrics. Expect to become familiar with Stata. The class has a bad reputation, but I thought it was well taught. Sure, its not always fun, but its almost always useful. Keniston is a very approachable person who welcomes questions during class and makes the material clear. Develop a good relationship with your TAs, work hard on the problem sets, and the rest should fall into place.",
    "Only take this if you are required to. It is frustrating, confusing, and does not go into depth about anything. I would not recommend this class. I learned a little about a lot of things, but nothing very helpful. The PSETs were frustrating, the readings were dry, the exams tough, and the lectures boring. A horrible combination of difficult, boring, and useless.",
    "You're going to have to take it as a global major and otherwise you shouldn't take it unless you are super interested in international development. It will get a lot of negative reviews, but it really isn't that bad. The problem sets can be long and Stata-intensive, but other than that it's not too difficult, as Keniston tries to dumb it down as much as possible for non-economics-focused people.",
    "The course is getting better, but it is still a difficult course to be sure. That said, if you are a global affairs major, you are required to take this class. Many of the skills you learn, however, are transferable and useful later on.",
    "Many people go into this course with a predetermined negative opinion which is a mistake. If you are willing to do the work, this is a very interesting and well-taught course!",
    "Fine course. The paper-based material was much more interesting than the economic technique material. Keniston is good at explaining the papers but not so much the economic techniques and graphs. Not as bad as the reviews suggest but would only really recommend taking if you're a GLBL major. The material is interesting though.",
    "A great class overall! This class has either improved a lot this year or it doesn't deserve the bad rep it has gotten in the past (and I promise I'm not a total nerd\/person who doesn't go out and just studies all the time--this class was not that hard or time consuming). The topics it covers are super interesting, and it involves finally applying econ and material from glbl 121 to real life problems and studies that help improve people's lives. I learned so much, and though the psets were challenging at times, office hours were super helpful. My group always got nearly perfect scores on the psets just because office hours helped us work through the problems and let us know if we were on the right track. Also since they allow you to do the psets in groups, you can split up the work or check it with other people, which is a good safety net. This is an interesting class, and it will make you feel like the skills you learn in glbl are actually useful and have the capacity to make a difference in people's lives :)",
    "This is an awful class. But, you'll have to take it, so this review is mute. Some advice I have for you... - Don't worry so much about the reading\/class - Make sure you have a good group for the problem sets - Study from the same exams! They're actually super helpful. - Get Eric as a TA! He's super helpful!",
    "If you're a GLBL major you have to take it, and there aren't many other classes on development economics so take it if you're really interested in the subject, but know that most of the material you can learn from just reading the assigned articles\/readings. Teaching could be confusing and hard to follow, though the TA's are great (especially Eric).",
    "An economics and econometrics background is required in this class. While not a prerequisite, it is taught assuming you've taken econometrics and intermediate micro. I would not recommend for non-global majors (take Udry's class instead). For global majors, try to take the Econ needed or push off the class as long as possible and hope they eventually make it better.",
    "I know a lot of people say to stay away from this class and at points in time I thought I'm crazy taking it as a non-Global Affairs major, but in the end it was definitely worth it. The subject material is genuinely interesting and it is amazing what sort of results can be drawn from econometrics! It is frustrating that people get by simply through bullshitting, which makes the getting a good grade quite competitive I think.",
    "It's a requirement, so... we have to take it. If you're not a global student, absolutely don't take it.",
    "I would say that for a class that most people take because they have to (and a class that a lot of people complain about) it isn't so bad if you put in the work. This comes from someone with no Econ background.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to!",
    "GLBL225 was a great course - the information was really interesting and integrated econometric techniques seamlessly into its instruction. A lot of students will complain that the course is too difficult, but it is really an appropriate level of quantitative analysis that every global student must engage with.",
    "The only reason why you should be enrolled in this course is if you are a Global major.",
    "Its a required class, you have to take it. The reason people hate it is cause they are completely math averse but its really not that bad. Its just not terribly engaging cause its required.",
    "Dear GLBL major (because those are the only students who should even consider taking this, unfortunately required, class), I am sorry that you have to take this. I am sorry that you have to trek all the way up to Watson for something that will probably make you even more confused. I am sorry that the professor isn't clear about the material, and I'm most sorry that after four years of terrible reviews, Jackson has not even bothered to improve this class. To anyone who has taken a metrics class, you will do perfectly well. Anyone else, I feel for you.",
    "It is an overview of key problems in international development. Expect difficulties with problem sets.",
    "You're probably going to take it because it's a requirement. It's not as bad as people say it is, and the material does get very interesting, especially if you're interested in Development Economics. You learn how to master STATA, you end up knowing so much from research papers, so it's definitely a steep learning curve for the class. So overall, pretty good class!",
    "GLBL 225 has the potential to be an interesting course and the econometric techniques are very useful to know, but the course's instruction by professor Keniston kills the class. Unless you must take this class for the Global Affairs major, I would not recommend this course. If you do take it, be prepared to be confused in lecture and to have to pay attention in section and ask the TAs many questions.",
    "Absolutely not. (DO NOT take this class unless you have to for global affairs and even then, consider waiting until they revamp the course.) Let me start by saying that the excruciating pain that was this class nearly caused me to drop the major altogether. If I could italicize the words hate when I say that I hated this class, I would. First, the material was unstructured, unfocused, and incoherent. Not only did the lectures have no logical order whatsoever, but the material itself also came from an indiscernible hodgepodge of economic theory, paper findings, and econometrics. Nothing was properly delineated and instead of teaching the econometrics techniques we needed first, Keniston interspersed them throughout, which made it harder to understand how they all fit together. We also seemed to be drawing a long list of grand conclusions from a small universe of papers, most of which concerned villages in India (apparently everything in the developing world is a village). On to the teaching. Keniston often assumed that people in his class had taken intermediate economics and econometrics of some sort, which is unfair especially for security track majors. To his credit, he remembered 2\/3 into the semester (or somebody corrected him) that the security track only requires introductory macroeconomics and microeconomics, but he never realized that the last time many people cracked open an economics textbook it was freshman year. He also doesnt seem to realize what we learned in AQA (which doesnt prepare us for his speed and incoherence). On top of this, the problem sets have little to do with the exam questions because theyre primarily on Stata. For the midterm, theres nothing except for last years midterm to give you a sense of not only what but also how you should study. For the final, we only get practice questions made up by our own classmates, not the professor, so its not nearly as helpful as he thinks. In addition, even though there was a refresher course on Stata, it was insufficient to help us with the complicated maneuvers that they expected from us, none of which we learn in AQA. Now all of this makes for a pretty steep learning curve, particularly if you dont have a naturally economics-oriented mind, and Keniston does absolutely nothing to ameliorate that. Instead, he makes jokes about the fact that only 25% of the class will walk away having understood the material. Jackson needs to do some very serious rethinking about the nature of this course because, as it stands, its absolutely the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "One of the worst global affairs classes. You'll take it only because you have to.",
    "This class gets a bad rep, but is actually really practical and interesting. Just go in knowing that you have to use stats and econ and apply them to development models, but if you get a good pset group and go to office hours it's easy enough. Keniston is awkward but hilarious and really helpful if you ask questions. It's not overly demanding but psets do require time and effort. You probably are taking it because you're global and you have to, but don't go in hating it already because if you start out hating it you will only hate it more. Keep an open mind and give Keniston the benefit of the doubt - as far as econ professors go, he's one of the best ones because he actually explains the concepts well.",
    "For those in Global Affairs, this is a required course. Its reputation is pretty bad, but the class certainly has its moments where it's very useful or interesting, so don't dread it too much. For those not in GA, I would not recommend this class unless you are very interested in development. I think this class would be worth taking if you're very invested in the subject. But otherwise, your time is probably better spent elsewhere."
