   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as a more comprehensive review of the grammar learned in L1 and L2, in an effort to improve comfort (and ability) in speaking the language.",
    "L3 of any language is the hump level. At this point you have a nice foundation of basic German, but at this point there's still much more to learn. German 130 is nice because you start to form more complex sentences, and even thoughts. I would highly recommend that every student takes it and continues beyond it to L4 or L5.",
    "Certainly a necessary course if one wants to be able to ask for more than the very basic things. Certainly not enough to feel comfortable around native German speakers, but the command of the language improves rapidly here.",
    "The class runs very quickly through many grammar topics and you have to learn how to teach yourself a lot of it. That being said, you cover a lot of interesting cultural topics in class from reading Brecht to watching films and the discussions and presentations definitely helped me improve my German and use the grammar that I was learning at home. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "German 130 is a fantastic class, and I would definitely recommend it to another student. It has daily homework assignments, but they don't take too much time to complete. The material is mostly a review of previously-covered material, at least for the grammar. The instructors are amazing, I heard great things about all of them. I loved this class."
