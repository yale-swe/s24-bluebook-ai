   "comments": [
    "A rigorous, but very fair and doable, introductory language course. If you like learning languages, you will like it. I recommend it highly.",
    "This class is great! It taught me a lot of German, the workload wasn't bad and there was no final. Take it with prof. Schenker.",
    "Standard intro language course. German tends to vary by year and \"professor,\" since TAs\/grad students teach the sections. Check the syllabus and pick the one you like best. And if Theresa Schenker is teaching, do it with her - she's fantastic.",
    "Do you want to take German? Of course you do. Take it with Theresa; her section is fantastic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in beginning an exploration of the German language and culture. The class is extremely well taught, and you will be surprised by how much you will have learnt by the end of the semester. And the most incredible thing is that you will learn a lot in a completely relaxed, fun and friendly environment!",
    "This was a fantastic course. The stress is on communication, so we spent a lot of time simply talking to our classmates to practice asking and answering questions. Since this class is every day, it's great for getting to know your classmates. We had some technical frustrations with the online homework system and foreign exchange program, but after only one semester I feel quite confident in my ability to speak simple German. Professor Schenker is incredibly organized and on-the-ball. She's an engaging, efficient, and personal teacher. My favorite class this semester.",
    "This is a good L1 course. It has tests every other friday and homework most nights, plus a final project, but the work is manageable and the department seems really dedicated to the language and to teaching.",
    "It's an intro language class in a good department. The text book is poor but overall it's a fine class.",
    "It was a fun class. I would recommend it.",
    "German 110 is an introductory class that will give you the most basic fundamentals of German. You'll talk in German a lot in class, and you'll have constant but simple homework assignments. You'll also have a good time! I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in German."
