    "This class is amazing. The material is all so ridiculously interesting \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the Church-Turing thesis, the halting problem, the Godel incompleteness theorems \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and the professor is indescribably perfect. She's charismatic, clear, articulate, intelligent, etc. etc. etc.There's one presentation (which is the worst part of the class, TBH), a take-home final, and basically nothing else. What more could you want?The people in the class are meh, but you don't have to talk to them.",
    "Fascinating subject material, hands down one of the coolest class I've taken at Yale. The course is organized into two parts: a) exploring the notion of computability (Turing machine, Abacus machine, recursive function, their equivalence, halting problem, countability\/ diagonalization, etc) and b) proving the Godel's incompleteness theorems(as well as Church's theorem, Tarski's theorem on the way, relying on the diagonal lemma, godel numbering). Such an interesting material, and I enjoyed studying for the oral exam, preparing for the presentation and doing the final problem set(by the way, it seems daunting at first but it was really enjoyable doing it)I would recommend taking it after 267 or taking concurrently with 267 to get a fuller appreciation of the logical theory (I took it concurrently, which was fantastic).Professor Shin is incredible. A clear lecturer who can explain complex concepts to students without confusion, and she has a great sense of humor! I honestly enjoyed going to her seminar every week. In sum, I wholeheartedly recommend it!!",
    "Phil 427 is an excellent course that will teach a variety of interesting results whilst remaining very low-stress. It helps develop perspective for those in math on the limitations of the theories that one works with. It is possible to take this course even without the prerequisites with only a small drop in understanding. Also, note that it gives a Hu credit: very useful.",
    "Yes! Just go to class. It's pretty cool. Anyone interested in math, comp sci, or philosophy will like it. Just be wary that it's mostly a math class, but without much work.",
    "I have nothing but good things to say about this class. As a philosophy major among many STEM majors, I still found the material accessible and really interesting. The course is first and foremost a technical exposition of Godel's incompleteness theorem, which decisively strikes down one of the predominant theories by which philosophers of mathematics used to characterize arithmetic. The material has interesting ties to the Liar's paradox, and Sun-Joo does a great job of raising other philosophically interesting issues. There were one group presentation, one oral-exam, and one take-home final, so if you're like me and take a lot longer than other people to do proofs and quantitative reasoning, you'll have a bit more time to prepare for these things. Overall, I can't recommend this class enough to someone who either has taken 267 or who has done proof-based coursework. It's really interesting material, Sun-Joo is great, and you feel like a smarter person after the term.",
    "I thought this class was really interesting as a computer science major. Not very \"philosophical\" except that computability and incompleteness are kind of a mindf**k...Not a lot of work, a group presentation (all the material needed is in the textbook, format is whatever you want), an oral exam near the end which was fun because the professor is pretty cool, and a take-home final assignment that was harder than the rest but doable if you've gone to class",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have any interest in logic, computer science, or theoretical mathematics.",
    "Yes, highly recommended.",
    "Essentially, this is a class on Godel's incompleteness theorems. The entire semester is devoted to exploring the proof- yes, it takes that long. It's definitely worth it, IMO; the theorems themselves are fascinating, and the proofs should blow your mind if you understand them properly. Sun-Joo is a great lecturer and if you can take a class with her definitely do it. Don't worry about the PHIL 267 requirement, I didn't do it, and I was fine.",
    "If you think you might be interested in the subject matter, then yes, definitely recommended! Sun-Joo is a great teacher and really cares about her students. The course is not much work - one presentation, a brief oral exam, and a take-home exam - although I did not get any grades back until the end, so I can't say whether grading is harsh. Lecture is usually pretty fun. There are a lot of incredible \"wow\" moments in this class. Sun-Joo does a good job at keeping the big picture in mind at all times, without compromising on detail and rigor.",
    "Pretty solid. Engaging material, but those seminars can drag on a bit too long some weeks. Prof Shin is great. Take home final and oral exam.",
    "I recommend this course. The material was very interesting, the course was well taught, and the workload was low.",
    "This class is so cool! The professor is really great at making the material clear. Take it! I loved it."
