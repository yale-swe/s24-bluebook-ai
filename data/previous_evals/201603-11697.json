    "Spanish L3 provided me a solid foundation in the language. I now feel comfortable enough to speak with a degree of fluency in the language.",
    "My grammar and speaking abilities definitely improved because of this class.",
    "I learned a lot of very useful Spanish grammar structures, as well as new vocabulary and insights into various Spanish-speaking cultures. The readings we did were really interesting and a good exercise for learning how to read fluently in Spanish. I enjoyed the exposure to various authors, genres, and cultures of the Spanish-speaking world.",
    "I feel like a much more competent and capable Spanish speaker.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of Spanish culture and literature along with new confidence in my Spanish speaking skills going forward."

   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is that the professor only speaks in Spanish, so for the time that you are in class you get to be fully engaged with the language. It meets every day which can be burden on your timetable but it's definitely worth it because it keeps you fully in touch with the material.",
    "Strengths - amazing professor Weaknesses - too grammar heavy",
    "The only weaknesses are the strict attendance policy (-1% off final grade for every missed class past the allowed number) and the repetitive nature of writing evaluations such as the redacciones and paragraph writing section of exams. I generally felt like the workload was very even, so that was definitely a strength. The organization of the course and detailed syllabus were also good.",
    "There were no major weaknesses of the course and was engaging. As long as the student put forth their best effort, success was more than feasible along with major improvements in Spanish ability."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend L3 Spanish if you've learnt Spanish to a basic level already and want to further your knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you need to do your language requirement, as it's fairly easy with a not too heavy workload. It's also great for just learning Spanish because it provides lots of practice with speaking and reading and teaches you lots of useful vocab and grammar.",
    "If you want to learn Spanish, here's how you do it!",
    "Yes I would recommend the course because if one is new to the language, the class teaches at a very steady pace and if one has some sense of spanish already like myself, the class greatly strengthens one's foundation"
