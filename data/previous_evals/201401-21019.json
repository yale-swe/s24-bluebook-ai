    "If you have to take this class, you need to do it with Sebastian. He's so nice!",
    "I would recommend the course to another student and describe it as a way to improve fundamental Spanish language skills through short stories and a little speaking. I don't like the oral exam in the way that it is prepared though. It's just a test of how well you prepared! Not how well you speak the language conversationally.",
    "It's a lot of daily work, take it if you have to.",
    "The curriculum for this course is very cut-and-dry, but the professor can certainly make the difference. The assignments are rather tedious, but it's definitely a manageable workload. It definitely helps your spoken Spanish, but only if you're willing to stay focused in class (not the easiest thing to do 5 days a week) and be willing to make mistakes. Sebasti\u00e1n is a great professor, I definitely recommend taking it with him if you can!",
    "Classic intensive language class. About what you would expect. Workload is unreasonable.",
    "I took this class to fulfill the Language Requirement. It was a worthwhile class, and I definitely improved in my listening and writing abilities this semester. I also improved in my speaking abilities, although not as much in comparison to other facets of my Spanish knowledge. Prof Diaz is great as an instructor, he's very entertaining and treats his students like colleagues and adults."
