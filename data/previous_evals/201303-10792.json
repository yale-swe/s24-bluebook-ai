    "If you're looking for a language credit, this probably isn't the most labor-intensive way to get one, though I haven't taken any other language classes, so I can't offer a real basis for comparison. Su Laoshi has some excellent stories, and it's a very laid-back class. You do see considerable improvement in your paper writing, and I found that experience rewarding, if time-consuming.",
    "Great class. Highly recommend taking it with Su Lao Shi.",
    "Maintains your Chinese level but doesn't drastically improve it.",
    "Definitely take Chinese with Su Laoshi if you are placed into this level! He's a fun person who clearly has a deep knowledge of Chinese literature, culture, history, and philosophy. I found myself looking forward to our classroom discussions (in Chinese of course). The class is well-structured, so you know well in advance what part of the curriculum you will be going over on which day, and when assignments are due or when tests and quizzes will be given. I very much appreciated that.",
    "This course is difficult but manageable. It is your standard advanced level language course. We go through topics and skills and everything quite quickly, almost too quickly at times. It seems as if there's no time to really let those skills, or let new vocab, settle in. I liked the course though and I would recommend it to someone just looking tokeep up their Chinese!"
