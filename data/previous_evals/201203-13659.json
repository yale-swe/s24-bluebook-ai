    "Professor Elliot has taught this course enough that he can do it with his eyes closed. His experience was invaluable andhis ego (while in many ways deserved) was comical. You could still tell when he was winging it.",
    "It was an excellent class, so wonderful to be taught by someone that is such an expert in the field. Ifeel, in response to question 12, that this class is a very necessary foundation for students with interest in environmental work. A basic understanding of some of the most significant environmental laws is integral to working in the environmental field, and this class does an excellent job of teaching those foundations.",

But that would be so un-law school.Given that so many non-law students take this course, I'd consider switching textbooks. Without law school training, I found it was much easier for me to read law summaries on epa.gov and other online sights.",
