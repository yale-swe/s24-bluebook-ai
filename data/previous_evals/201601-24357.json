    "No matter your major, take this class (if you can get in). It will teach you so many different things. If you're a non-STEM major, the class has the added bonus of teaching you some cool technical skills. But more importantly, the course is meant to teach you how to think critically and deeply about the consumer products around you. Beneath the surface of just making things, like headphones, you get to learn first hand what it takes to make something, what it takes to create a start-up. I think it is especially valuable and relevant for seniors who are about to graduate, and even more invalvualve for those interested in start-ups overall. It gives you a taste of what start-up life is like. It's a demanding but also an incredibly rewarding class to be part of. I strongly recommend!",
    "YES absolutely take it if you can. There's no other course at Yale quite like it.",
    "This course is the best course I've taken at Yale. You get to make things with a small groups of extraordinary people. It's awesome.",
    "A typical Joe Zinter course (which is to say very challenging but incredibly rewarding.) You will spend more time on this course than all of your other classes combined, so you have to plan a light semester aside from this course. If you are considering this class, you probably know what you are getting yourself into. This course ended up being a ton of fun! Joe is amazing and you should take this class even if you aren't an engineer. Don't let the workload scare you.",
    "This class primarily focuses on the development of a product and a very preliminary business plan. It is definitely the best class I have taken at Yale. The material is engaging and fascinating--especially if you are interested in entrepreneurship. Besides learning how to engineer a product, you learn about all the other important concepts such as how to pitch the product and how to structure a business for the product. It's a ton of fun to work with a group to develop an idea and there is so much to be learned from your peers and from the development process. Further, professor Zinter is fantastic. He is constantly excited and is able to get the best out of his students. He really takes the time to support the students and provide feedback in whatever way possible. If he can't provide feedback, he will find an expert that can. All that said, this class is a ton of work and professor Zinter expects a lot. But, with out a doubt, at the very end of the semester you will feel incredibly accomplished and you get out what you put in.",
    "Best hands on interdisciplinary engineering class at Yale. For everyone, a good mix of tech and artistic and business-oriented folk. More like a startup incubator from ideation to execution than an actual class. This will (and should) take more time than all of your other classes combined.",
    "It is hard to say what this class will be like next year as this year was the first year, but my experience overall was positive, especially because of the group I was in. You are given a lot of freedom in the project and timeline which can be great if you can handle it, but you have to be somewhat self motivated.",
    "It's really hands-on and will teach you so many things that are actually useful (not the sort of learn the textbook and recite everything that's in it). If you can, try to take the class earlier than senior year so you can potentially use Yale resources to bring the project to the next level while still taking classes at Yale (YEI, CEID fellowship, etc)",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend. I've learned more in this class alone than probably most of my Yale classes combined. A true gem I'm incredibly fortunate to have participated in my senior year.",
    "This is a pretty fun class!! It's a lot of work when it comes to the final month of classes, but definitely well worth it and some groups even came out wanting to continue their project ideas for the future!",
    "Take it 100%. It's a lot of work, but very fulfilling."
