    "Absolutely! The H&P syllabus for the spring is packed with interesting texts. I really enjoyed reading all of the books--I feel like you get a good overview of many different schools of thought, and they all build upon each other nicely.",
    "This course is amazing. Take it!!",
    "Take this course. It taught me so much and was really great to learn in an environment with friends and peers who were all engaged and interested in the texts.",
    "Western cannon, etc. etc. Take it, it means you get to take the other two classes, which (in my opinion) teach more interesting books.",
    "Yes. You will learn a lot about writing and speaking. Working with Pro. Slanski can be tough at first but it is rewarding at the end of the day.",
    "H & P second semester is really one of the best classes Yale has to offer. It is political philosophy (more or less), but the readings and the discussion is fantastic, especially with Professor Slanski. Take this class, and above all, take this class with Slanksi. She will push you to write and think, and you will be thankful for it.",
    "DS History and Politics is great, and second semester you will take on fascinating texts. Favorites included Locke, Burke, and Marx. If you decide to take the class with Slanski, realize that she is very difficult, oftentimes cold in section and office hours, and a bit disorganized. Class discussions were insightful, but she was absent very often (for varying family emergencies), resulting in disjointed explications of the texts. She gives in-depth, typed comments on papers which is really helpful, but she handed our papers back the same week as our next paper, which personally limited my ability to fully appreciate her rich feedback. Her comments can be a bit...stinging, but you will learn to incorporate her constructive criticism. You will learn a lot in this class because Professor Slanski is brilliant, and this class will challenge the way you comment in class, the way you write papers, and most importantly, the way you understanding and read influential texts of political and historical thought."
