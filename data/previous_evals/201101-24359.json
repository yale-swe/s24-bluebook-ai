   "comments": [
    "The course is relatively intuitive, discussing the key spectroscopic methods used by any chemist, espeicially organic chemists. That being said, if anyone is to pursue a degree in chemistry, this course is a must have.",
    "CHEM 525 was a very useful course in that it was practically significant, but also was extremely useful in giving an overview of how NMR and MS, and their different forms, 'work' on both a molecular and instrumentation level and how they are used currently and also their trajectory for the future.",
    "I would recommend the class. The knowledge is very pertinent to everyday chemistry work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to another student. Generally, not very work-intensive, except around exam time.",
    "Yes. Students can organize his or her research by themself after this class. I strongly recommend this class to a fellow student.",
    "A great course for learning how to characterize the structure of small organic molecules. For any student wanting to gain a good working knowledge of interpreting NMR without the quantum mechanics behind it, the course is excellent."

    "I finally understand 2-d NMR especially COSY, HMBC, HSQC and how those experiments allow for structure determination of molecules.",
    "This class will be very helpful for analyzing unknown compounds, and also greatly broadens the scope of designing experiments to determine unknowns.",
    "I can learned following knowledge from this course;Interpretation of variety spectrum.planning experiments for the structural determination.overall basic concepts and knowledge to spectroscopy."
