    "I would say that ENGL 114 is a great choice for learning how to write academically. The most helpful paper was the research paper, which we spent the most time on and about which we received the most feedback. It is well paced and graded fairly.",
    "English 114 has a very particular type of writing. You might be a terrific writer and even that doesn't guarantee that Engl 114 will go smoothly for you. However, I do recommend this section with Prof. Klemann. I learned a lot and it was fun at the same time- which is not too common with Engl 114 sections, I hear!",
    "If you want to learn how to write an analytical essay or improve your current knowledge, then take this class",
    "ENGL 114 is a great course that will introduce you to academic writing and give you concrete tools to improve your writing and editing process.",
    "I have heard my friends talking about other ENGL 114 sections, and many of them complained about how they did not make any progress in writing after taking the class. This ENGL 114 section I took is the best section and I learn a lot under Professor Klemann's instruction.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to any student, but especially one that might be nervous about taking a writing class and needs guidance in the writing process. Although this class is really helpful for students who aren't that comfortable with writing, students who are comfortable could also thrive in this class. It also really teaches students to attack problems in a new way and question common views."
