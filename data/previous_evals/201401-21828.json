    "A lot of material in class and reading but very interesting class if you're intrigued by the subject. Cool to see how scientific innovations came about.",
    "It's a solid course if you have an interest in technological histories but it has a ton of reading and can drag at some parts.",
    "I would not take this class again, personally. If you need a non-pathway HSHM course try to find another, or wait another semester for a better course.",
    "HSHM lecture class that covers a lot of interesting material, but it's a lot of material, so you must stay engaged",
    "I liked it but I can see why someone might not. Just show up during shopping, you'll know pretty much right away if this class is for you.",
    "This course is one of the less interesting HSHM courses, especially if you are on the medicine and public health track. There is some interesting material, especially on the development of the electronics industry because it is so relevant. But the lecture style is extremely dry. The hardest part of the class is getting through the lectures, but to be fair, it did get more interesting in the second half of the course.",
    "EVST 206, \"The History of Science and Technology\" offered a broad, yet comprehensive view of the developments in history and science in the United States since the 18th century. As someone who enjoys learning history, it was great to see the \"arc\" of developments in chemistry, physics, biology, environmental science, and computer science throughout the history of our nation. The course does require a lot of reading, and the lectures on topics that one is not particularly interested in can be quite boring...(e.g. on DNA and molecular biology for me). Also, if this course is offered again, there is a midterm paper (5-6 pages) and a choice between taking a final exam (2 hours 45 minutes) or writing a 13-15 page research paper. The work is relatively manageable, and both Kevles and Susannah (the TF) are helpful in clarifying topics and assignments for the course. All in all, I would recommend this course, because at the end of the day, it's important to be literate about the nation's scientific and technological developments, since innovation in science and technology is really one factor that has helped make the U.S. the global power it is today. The only thing is...I'm not sure if the course will be taught again in the future. Apparently Kevles will no longer teach this class again!",
    "Yes, I think this is one of the best classes I've taken. It's a lot of work and the readings take a lot of time to read, so I wouldn't recommend this as a 5th class.",
    "Interesting topic. Boring presentation. I would not recommend this course.",
    "I'm a true history lover, but I don't think I can recommend this class. Lectures are read directly from notes and are overwhelming because of all the details; you never feel like you can get it all down in your notes. And the reading load is simply too overwhelming, especially if you're taking even just one other history class.",
    "As I had no previous knowledge of the material, it was definitely an interesting class. However, the lectures can often get boring and thre is a ton of reading.",
    "Take it if you want to do a lot of reading.",
    "I think this was a very good class and recommend taking it, especially if you are not a history major. There is a lot of reading but the work load other than that is not too heavy. Very interesting stuff.",
    "Probably more work than you would expect, but definitely a course you should try if you're interested in the topic"
