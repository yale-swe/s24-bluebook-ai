    "Fun stuff, yo. Read up on your modern philosophers. Cautionary note, you only read a handful of pages of each dude, so don't think you know all of philosophy as a result. But you'll have the books to (maybe) read later, and you'll have an overview of what's going on.And if you're the sort that gets high on showing off at cocktail parties, well, you'll have plenty of ammo. So go impress those glamorous people with your newfound erudition.",
    "Overall great. favorite ds class of both semesters",
    "Tamar Gendler is an excellent option as a section leader. She enriches the section by bringing in material from contemporary cog sci, and she really makes sure that you have a high quality of participation, discussion, and understanding.",
    "YES! YES, I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. This class is definitely the best class I have ever taken, at Yale or otherwise. Honestly, I do not think there was ever a section that was bad. Tamar Gendler is the best professor (or, for that matter), teacher I have ever had and she was able to explain the intricate, sometimes confusing concepts in a manner that made sense. She also cares, and respects, each of her students individually. This class featured a group lunch once a week where we continued our conversation about philosophy and applied it even more to the real world. Although the ideas are harder this semester than last, they are also real issues that real philosophers talk about today and this class teaches you to understand modern arguments and to engage with them. Take this class and, if you are lucky enough, take it from Tamar Gendler.",
    "Any student would be lucky to have Professor Gendler (or, as she wants us to call her, Tamar) for DS Philosophy. More than just a famous name, she is both caring and knowledgable in the extreme, able to help those who struggle initially at understanding a text but also to engage those who have deep or technical philosophical questions. She takes the class to lunch once a week or brings in food; in class, she always maintains interest in often difficult material via a constantly upbeat attitude and the kind of positive teaching methods which won her a teaching award this year. Any time students from another section had a cancelled class, they would flock to Professor Gendler's, based on her well-deserved reputation. Her class is no walk in the park--it requires constant attention and participation in class and thorough readings and forum postings beforehand--but it was a truly enjoyable experience, both providing a solid introduction to modern philosophy and developing my skills as a critical thinker.",
    "Absolutely, unquestionably yes! Take DS Spring semester FOR this class (lit and hp have big problems)",
    "Philosophy is not for everyone- some love it, some hate it, and it can be very tough to think the way philosophers think if it is not natural. However, this class will help you grow as a reader, writer and thinker whether or not it is your \"thing\". I would definitely recommend taking DS, and though philosophy was not my favorite of the three sections, Tamar Gendler is the most incredible professor I have met at Yale. Take DS, and do your best to get Tamar- you will not regret it!",
    "The second semester of DS philosophy is incredibly rewarding. You will learn about a lot of the major and still-relevant issues of modern philosophy (mind\/body dualism, empiricism vs. idealism, etc.). If Tamar is teaching and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lucky enough to be in her section, you are in for a treat. She is easily the smartest and most dedicated educator I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the pleasure of knowing. This woman makes Hegel intelligible, chairs a philosophy department AND brings doughnuts for the last day of class. She juggles a million commitments with consummate ease. She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably been to the moon. Did I mention that she knows almost every famous psychology experiment ever by heart? I sincerely would ask myself during the semester, \u00e2\u0080\u009cIs there anything this woman can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do?\u00e2\u0080\u009d This class has without a doubt shaped the way I think more than any other I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken so far at Yale. It is worth as much as you put into it. The readings and ideas are sometimes hard, but the stuff you learn really matters and will benefit you in the long-run.",
    "Philosophy in the spring is great. Tamar is a great person to have as your professor for this class. She is a wonderful human being and just a great person to get to know. Her style is a little different from other professors: expectations, particularly on papers, are higher (a good reconstruction with a couple of counterargument will not do it -- you need to do something a little original). Discussion style varies pretty much every class, although in general Tamar does more of the talking. Sometimes she gets too caught up on minor details and tangents, and I do feel occasionally that students in other class come out with a better understanding of the philosophers and their arguments. However, this class did change how I look at philosophy and arguments in general, and Tamar's teaching style was a great part of that change.",
    "This is a continuation of the philosophy survey from first semester in Directed Studies. The content and readings become very interesting as they become more modern; it is especially remarkable in the second semester of D.S. how much the philosophy texts influence or engage in conversation with works of literature and historical and political thought.",
    "Absolutely. The best Philosophy survey course I can imagine.",
    "DS philosophy permanently, significantly, and positively changed the way I think, the way I formulate and the consider arguments, and the way I parse difficult texts. The readings were shorter than those in other DS courses, but generally denser. Even if you have no interest in pursuing philosophy, I recommend this course."
