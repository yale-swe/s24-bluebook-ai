   "comments": [
    "yes.",
    "Really great for getting up to speed on micro for people who took undergrad courses a while ago.",
    "Econ 545 is a great class to take if you are interested in a course that goes into the details of the theory of Microeconomics and expands on it through intricate math.",
    "I would recommend 545 to a student who wants further education in microeconomics, but might want a more applied approach than the PhD course.",
    "most people have to take it, so my response do not really matter. Just listen carefully and take good notes.",
    "It is a theoretical and mathematical heavy microeconomics class. Great for those going into heavy research or phD. Wonders what good use is there for those not intending to go into academia and hardcore research.",
    "N\/A-It was a requirement for me.",
    "Yes but I would tell them to have a flexible outlook",
    "An in depth coverage of basic concepts in microeconomics. Consumer theory and producer theory, with a small dip in to other interesting areas of study, e.g. rural labor markets. Unfortunately, its unlikely that you will cover any new topics beyond an undergraduate program in microeconomics, however, you will cover the core principles in much greater depth.",
    "If you want an overview of basic concepts in Microeconomics, I suggest that you take this course. If not at least get the course notes from someone, as they are very useful in aiding understanding.",
    "Good way to build up a better understanding of microeconomics, especially as it pertains to developmental settings.",
    "A challenging fast-paced intermediate overview course",
    "A well constructed and thought out course. You will be given several presentations of material (handouts, lecture, section) each with its own takeaways.",
    "I would recommend it only for those who had previous rigorous training.",
    "The course is recommendable to students who already have some background in microeconomics and would like to take an advanced course that takes a more applied approach.",
    "For someone outside IDE, take this course if you need to. Otherwise an undergraduate class covers all the topics and more. However, some concepts like substitution and income effects and their applications are taught much better",
    "I would recommend this course. The course challenges the intellectual ability of each student regardless of their familiarity with microeconomics",
    "I would state that this a comprehensive intermediate review of microeconomics. I would recommend the course to another student interested in learning this material."

   "comments": [
    "gave a good foundation of microeconomic theory",
    "Really good refresher on important concepts",
    "The course was integral in understanding the different market structures and consumer and firm behavior. It is absolutely a crucial addition in my arsenal of research tools.",
    "It gave me a broad sense of the body of knowledge in the field and helped me to learn a bit more about problem solving in the field.",
    "Yes.",
    "As mentioned, more geared toward academic work and research.",
    "It didn't really deepen my knowledge as much as it allowed me to both use and understand the language used in microeconomics. Most of the details (e.g. Slutsky equations, Shephard's lemma) I'll never use. But substitution effects, utility functions, etc... are all concepts that are very helpful for me to understand. So basically, the high-level (i.e. non-math) parts of the course were very helpful, while the low-level calculations were only useful to the extent that they illuminated the concepts themselves.",
    "Course developed core principles of micro, I would have liked to cover more ground and learn about new topics that i hadn't seen at undergrad. However, the class is rather large for a masters course which means we often have to slow down, classes are often interrupted by multiple questions and the new material is often brushed over.",
    "I was familiar with most concepts taught already but this course went deeper than previous microeconomics courses did and Prof. Boozer did a good of explaining the concepts.",
    "The course introduced me to development specific microeconomic concepts which I had not covered in my previous studies.",
    "The course material was highly relevant to my research and was a good refresher from undergrad micro.",
    "I think it increased my knowledge, yet it could have deepened it exponentially if the teaching method wasn't only math oriented, but also intuitive."
