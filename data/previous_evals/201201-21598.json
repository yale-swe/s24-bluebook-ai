    "I would say that it's a great class to take if you have a very specific area of psychology that you know you want to explore further. You need to go into this with a very specific plan, but if you have that then it will really be an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend directed reading.",
    "Yes, this is a great way to get one of the 400 level credits out of the way for Psych, since the senior seminars are few in number and a much greater time commitment. A directed reading with Prof Donegan lets you choose an interesting subject, investigate it on your own time, and write a paper you will actually enjoy.",
    "Definitely recommend! It's perfect to add to a tight course load because you can work around your schedule. It requires a lot of self-control and responsibility, though, because the professor will not be on your back making sure you do the work. As long as you work throughout the semester, you're good!"
