   "comments": [
    "If you want to take a language, Japanese is difficult but the teachers are great and the class amusing. You won't feel the hour go by.Even better if you're interested in Japan.",
    "If you want to begin learning Japanese, here is how. But be prepared for a tremendous amount of work.",
    "It's everyday, so it's a lot of busy work, but you definitely learn a lot of Japanese, and it's manageable. All the teachers are so fun too. Even if you've had some prior experience learning Japanese, Irecommend you take L1. You learn a lot, so chances are there is a lot of info in L1 that you never learned before.",
    "It's a huge amount of work, and if you get behind, you're really in trouble. I'd recommend it only if you REALLY REALLY want to take Japanese, otherwise you're likely to get disheartened. Also quite a few people who have already taken Japanese or speak some Japanese at home are in this class, so expect to be working harder than a lot of people if you haven't done that.",
    "This was the most rewarding class I have taken this semester. By the end you will be amazed by how much you have learned. The work load is considerably heavy, and you will spend quite a bit of time studying for this class. So I would only recommend taking it if it is something that you are truly interested in and dedicated to.",
    "I absolutely, positively recommend this class to any student who wants to learn to love the Japanese language and culture. This class is very, very well taught, and if you are dedicated to your work, you will reap great benefits. If you take this course, you will be in the hands of an incredibly experienced and talented teaching staff. I have absolutely no qualms whatsoever about taking this course. Give it a chance!",
    "This course takes a lot of time if you do it right, but it's an incredibly interesting language and I absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes learning languages. If you're just looking for a credit, do not take Japanese.",
    "It's an intro class, so it's very intensive. I had 1-2 hours of homework\/preparation for the next day's class everyday. But I feel like I've learned so much Japanese, even only after one semester. The teachers are so great, with their pictures and props, and that made class so enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's serious about learning Japanese, because it's a big time commitment, but know that it's worth it in the end.",
    "Japanese 110 is an excellent language course. Interestingly, students are expected to read through lessons before they come to class, and then we spent time in class practicing using the things we learned in conversation. This is a good format considering that, being in America, our opportunities to practice speaking are limited. The homework is a solid hour or so per night, which I loved for the regularity and sense of accomplishment it gave me nightly, but can be difficult if one doesn't have the patience for those kind of things. The teachers let you turn in homework a day late with no penalty, though, which is great when you're in a pinch. Overall, I loved the class.",
    "Japanese 110 is a great course if you want to spend loads of time on Japanese and really learn the language. Do not take it because you need to take a language and, hey, there's japanese.",
    "As with other L1 classes, the course is a lot of work and the pace is rather quick. This is especially true for those without any experience with East Asian languages, so it might be useful to at least learn what hiragana, katakana, and kanji are (if not preview some of them) before taking the course. Nevertheless, the work is manageable and at the end of the semester you will learn quite a bit of Japanese.",
    "I would recommend this course to others . The teaching was very good, but the class was extremely fast paced. I am happy that I learned the amount of material.",
    "The best! Take it!",
    "Japanese 110 was a great class, but it was also a lot of work. Expect at minimum one hour of work a night. You will learn Japanese though. After only one semester, I feel like I've learned enough, not to be able to function in Japan, but to be able to go to Japan and learn Japanese.",
    "It is not for those who want t breeze through a language. You will learn a ton, if you're dedicated tolearning the language. Make sure you don't fall behind or you'll have trouble ever catching up,&try to do everything they suggest each night (drills, bunpoumon, etc.) because it really helps.",
    "All the language courses at Yale are intense, Japanese being no exception. Expect one to two hours of homework everyday. However, the satisfaction you get from being able to speak with your Japanese friends and understand Japanese TV shows or books is well worth it. Take it if you want to start a new language in college!",
    "Japanese 110 is a class that will demand your full attention and rewards you based on the amount of effort you put forth. Beginning with basic roomazi(Japanese in English) and ending with 75 Kanji, you will be working quite a bit. The teachers are superb and keep the class interesting while the shifting sections allow you to get to know most if not all of your peers. Only take this class if you are prepared to work!",
    "The workload is intense and class meets everyday, but if you want to learn Japanese you will not regret taking this class. After taking this class and realizing how much I appreciate the Japanese language and culture (which is slightly infused into the lessons and teaching book) I've think I've decided on majoring in Comparative Literature rather than English, to permanently work Japanese into my course load. The opportunities for study abroad are also very appealing and accessible following first-year Japanese.",
    "If you are a Japan-enthusiast, want to learn an East Asian language, or would just like to be able to say \"yes, I can read those funny-looking characters\" to your friends, then this is the class for you. However, be prepared: it is not an easy language by any definition. You must study daily, and for several hours at that, for you to be well-prepared for the next day. It is a fast-paced and intense course, but the results are totally worth it.",
    "Japanese 1 covers basic grammatical structures and is a great introduction to the languageof japanese. To any student trying to learn japanese, i would definitely recommend the course",
    "One of the most intensive language programs at Yale, you should compare it to Chinese for raw difficulty, though my feeling is that the program (though not the language) is more forgiving for Japanese, and the Senseis are worth the price of admission. As for the language itself, it is wholly pronounceable by English-speakers (with a couple new sounds to play with: I'm looking at you R\/L, which is neither R nor L) and no tonality AND phonetic writing systems (in part), but has significant grammar and a switched parameterization (Subject\/Object\/Verb order). Contrast with Chinese's tonality, character-only writing, but dead-simple grammar and similar word-ordering.All that said, only take this course if you're actually interested in learning the language - it's not for the faint of heart. You really do need to do the low-grade-cost-but-hours-long homework to succeed and keeping yourself motivated will be key. Fortunately, that's what your classmates are for - and no, they aren't all native speakers or anime\/manga fanboys\/girls. :)You'll learn basic conversation skills, the two syllabaries, and some 75 Kanji (almost-Chinese characters), which was actually one of the more enjoyable parts of the course for me. Again, you get out what you put in. If you are able to put a lot into it however, you'll definitely be happy with what you get back. Enjoy!",
    "Worth it for anyone who has any remote interest in Japanese, but it does bear a heavy workload.",
    "It's the most rewarding class I've taken, but it takes much work. If you want to learn Japanese, it's the best thing that's ever happened to you. If not, beware the work.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it."
