    "it was generally pretty hard, i had it Cr\/D though.",
    "depends on your professor; i liked it with Cifuentes",
    "It is a lot more difficult than level 1, but definitely manageable. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "yes!",
    "I would recommend this class, especially with Cifuentes. She's great!",
    "Obviously you are probably taking this for some sort of requirement - Spanish 120 is a good class because you learn a lot but it's less work than other languages. Just beware that even if you took Spanish in High School you still need to put in a lot of time to keep up in the class.",
    "I would recommend this course. If you keep up with the assignments and put in a little studying outside of class, it is certainly manageable. You will be required to apply what you learned in L1, and it is perhaps a bit more intensive than the first semester, but overall it is a solid class.",
    "YES TAKE IT WITH YOVANNA. overall a lot better than Span 1.",
    "It's a good course.",
    "It was a good spanish class, covers what you needed to know"
