   "comments": [
    "I'd never before taken an art history class so I learned a lot--from close observation of the texture and technique of images to understanding how to put a piece into cultural and historical context.",
    "I learned to engage more with museums and art pieces.",
    "Learned about Korean art, culture, and history.",
    "I learned so much about East Asian culture and history. So often, we learn about western history, spanning all the way back to the ancient Greeks. But in this course, I learned about the other half of the globe--granted only one part of it, but still it opened my eyes to a culture I had never learned about before. It has definitely expanded my world view, and has changed the way I approach things, especially in the realm of art.",
    "I learned a great deal about the cultural and artistic history of Korea, as well as trends and developments within the art world and academia surrounding some of the issues discussed in class.",
    "I learned about the history of Korean art and about the practice of art history in general.",
    "This course looked at a wide survey of materials from Korean history. We learned to look at ceramics, paintings, sculptures, and even architecture. We were able to apply different principles of East Asian philosophy \/ Buddhism to multiple objects and understand the connection between them. I think that the course moved flawlessly into different",
    "I got to appreciate Korean Art a lot more and understand how its art was influenced by historical events at the time. I enjoyed learning about the artists' stories and how Korean art has changed over time.",
    "I developed a general knowledge of the dynasties of Korea and how art flourished under each of them.",
    "Great understanding of Korean Art both historically and culturally.",
    "I managed to get a much deeper insight into the history and art of Korea.",
    "more knowledge on Korean art, also on Korean culture and history was my first art history class so learned a lot about how to learn cultural history through artwork and the transformation of art due to various other influences",
    "I've learned a lot about my culture and heritage as a Korean.",
    "I am now able to identify Korean Art works and comprehend the trans transregional history behind a lot of their creation and importance.",
    "I learned how to read art that was not typical western art. I have a decent art history education for western media but this was my first non western focused class. It was amazing!",
    "I learned how to better understand Korean art over time and to generally observe art.",
    "I feel more knowledgeable about Asian art in general, as well as Korean history and culture in general. More specifically, I learned about the important aspects of art and visual culture throughout the entire length of the Korean Peninsula's history.",
    "This course helped develop my connoisseurship of artworks, and appreciation for Asian and Buddhist art. This class was a wonderful exploration of the history of Korea as seen through it's artwork and artists. The focus of the class on works less commonly focussed on my art history courses, particularly the role of women in the art history of Korea, was thrilling.",
    "Although I spent the last summer in Korea studying Korean through the Light Fellowship, I knew pretty much nothing about Korean Art and very very little able Korean history so I learned all of that from this course.",
    "I learned how to evaluate art from the perspective of its political, social, and historical significance.",
    "This course was a wonderful overview of Korean art history, and gave great insight into the transition of artistic styles with historical and political events.",
    "Basics of art history rhetoric, Korean history",
    "A wonderfully inciteful introduction to art history.",
    "Korean Art and Culture was a fantastic course that combined a broad scope with a deep look at specific pieces of art. It is a huge loss to the department that this course will not be offered in coming years."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Kim is amazing, so knowledgeable and she does a great job of presenting the material. I was quite satisfied overall. I guess maybe the Met field trip was a little haphazard, but otherwise I was really pleased.",
    "The course does well in showing the importance of art in history, and the broad evolution of it in Korea.",
    "Great professor, could go into greater depth about subject material.",
    "Youn-mi Kim is an incredible lecturer. Her lectures are engaging and thorough. Her assignments are fun, and can be very low-stress, which I find enhances my ability to learn. I can't think of any weaknesses for the course. I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "Strengths: comprehensive; focused on Korean culture which is not generally or exclusively offered in Yale's curriculum. Weaknesses: Lack of organization or structure, reading selections varied all over in difficulty or depth of discussion.",
    "There was a clear emphasis on Buddhism and Buddhist works of Korea. Although I do think that this is essential to learning about Korean history I wondered about the different objects that did not get as much attention. Overall, I think the greatest strength was the fact that Professor Kim knew so much about the Buddhist works and as a student with very little experience in this field, I received a lot of excellent information about how Buddhism transformed not only Korea but the rest of E. Asia. Learning about this topic definitely wasn't a disappointment.",
    "I thought the strengths were that it gave a comprehensive overview of a variety of art forms. I have never taken an art history class before and found this one very interesting.",
    "This class was amazing!!",
    "They lectures are really easy to understand, but I feel like a lot of the course depends on memorization but not understanding.",
    "Strengths is that it covers a lot of interesting material, but sometimes could be disorganized.",
    "Course was well taught. Perhaps more detailed lecture slides would be helpful.",
    "weakness: a lot of memorization strength: everything else, i loved this course very much especially the professor",
    "This was one of my favorite courses I have taken. The biggest strengths were the professor and my TA! They were so fun and made learning the material very enjoyable.",
    "Strengths: Very engaging course - Prof Kim is so sweet and kind. Going to class and listening to her lectures were really fun.",
    "It would be great to allow more funding towards the course so trips to both the Met and the Boston Museum. It would be well worth it!",
    "This course was overall very strong. Low workload yet highly engaging lectures. The exams are very reasonable though they are too time pressured. I think the rushed character of the exams was the fundamental flaw of this course. Time constraints do not allow a student to genuinely represent what they have learned. The professor was excellent",
    "Unfortunately, Korean art is a very small and burgeoning field, and it was evident at times, when Prof. Kim had to draw from very little writing or use her own thoughts a lot. However, whenever she did have to do this, she did it well and thorough, and her overall enthusiasm for getting people interested in Korean culture and art history (for non-majors!) was the pro of this class. She obviously cares a lot, and that made the course good.",
    "Really great in it's linking of historical events to artwork - how dynasties, relations with other nations, religions, gender relations affected the work of artists.",
    "post the readings the day they are assigned. not everyone procrastinates the reading or doesn't do the reading altogether",
    "The course is actually pretty good. I was always told that art history classes were super super boring but this class wasn't boring at all. Maybe the only weakness is that sometimes the slides are sort of bare so if you miss something in class it's pretty much up to the chance that someone else caught it. If no one else caught it you're pretty much out of luck.",
    "Strength of the course is undoubtedly the teacher. Professor Kim is an amazing teacher, and her enthusiasm for the content is contagious. She will definitely be missed at Yale when she leaves for her professorship in Korea.",
    "Korean Art and culture did a fantastic job of emphasizing the transition of artistic styles and comparison of similarities and differences in the art by being structured chronologically. Professor Kim was absolutely wonderful and I looked forward to her class every time. The only weakness of the class was ensuring grading uniformity amongst the TAs, which definitely did not happen for the midterm.",
    "I loved this course. The professor's passion for the subject was truly palpable.",
    "Strength is that the content is very interesting and it focuses on the learning experience of the students. I think the tests and the sections can be more organized."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. You can get so much out of it regarding art but also the history of Eastern Asia and depending on how much work you want to do for it, I think it can be as rewarding as you make it. But super interesting, well thought out and paced.",
    "This course is a very good introduction to East Asian art and museum culture in general. IT is an easy Humanities credit as well.",
    "Yes, a fun and informative course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I learned so much, and it's an incredible opportunity to be able to learn about Korean art. Only about 3 other universities in the US offer a course in Korean. Everyone should utilize this unique opportunity. .",
    "The class is what you make of it, as you can probably get by with a good grade without doing any work as long as you get a good study group together to collect information on all of the terms and slides for the exams. If you put an effort into learning the material, it can be a very interesting class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student-you'll learn a lot about Korea and how Korea affected the rest of the world. For a long time Korean art did not receive recognition but it is nice to see that Korea is now receiving more attention.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who may be interested in art history but has never taken an art history class before.",
    "Definitely take this class, you learn so many interesting things in a short period of time!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course but you must actually engage otherwise you won't learn anything.",
    "Highly recommended if you have an interest in Korea",
    "would 100% recommend this class - youn-mi is one of the best professors I've ever had!! I'm sad to hear she's leaving because she showed me what it's like to have a professor who is truly there to teach you as much as she can without any care about grades or curves her passion for Korean art and culture was very evident and made the class all the more fun and enjoyable LOVED THIS CLASS",
    "ABSOLUTELY - take this course!",
    "Very much so. It was extremely engaging and informative. Having no prior knowledge in East Asian Art it was still and extremely informative course with digestible information.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It is a very interesting topic that is taught very well.",
    "YES. One of my favorite classes ever at Yale but that could be because I am Korean and am biased. It was a wonderful survey course of Korean art history and culture. Gave me lots of talking point with my family on holidays. It's a shame professor Kim is going back to Korea. She really made the class. The workload was very light but appropriately engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course because it has a very relaxes workload, highly interesting content, and a delightful professor. Beware though, the exams are highly time pressured, though the content is highly understandable. Make sure to attend lecture and take notes.",
    "Amazing class.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "100%",
    "Professor Kim went back to Korea to teach so I don't know if the course is worth it without her. That being said, the general outline of the course is interesting and if you have any interest in Korea at all you'll probably learn something. Let's put it this way, I was surprised when class ended because I hadn't spent the whole time looking at the clock. Unclear if that was because of the content or the way Professor Kim taught.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with a remote interest in art. It is a golden opportunity to get to engage the artwork at the Yale Art Gallery and go on a fantastic tour of the Korean exhibit in the MET. Unfortunately, this course will probably not be offered for a while, since Professor Kim is leaving Yale.",
    "Korean Art and Culture was an AMAZING course! Unfortunately, Professor Kim, a renowned expert in this field, is leaving so the course will probably feel different in the future. Her powerpoints were always very clear and the additional trip to the MET museum in NYC was also a nice addition. I learned so much about not only Korean culture, but other asian cultures as well due to the influence of trade throughout history. It was a fun class and not overwhelming in work.",
    "Absolutely! Wonderful course and wonderful professor.",
    "Yes--even if you don't have interest in Korea or art, it's a new experience and is well taught by the professor.",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "Yes was great.",
    "This is a fantastic course on a unique subject. I highly recommend it.",
    "Korean Art and Culture was a fantastic course that combined a broad scope with a deep look at specific pieces of art. It is a huge loss to the department that this course will not be offered in coming years. If it were being offered again I would 100% recommend it."
