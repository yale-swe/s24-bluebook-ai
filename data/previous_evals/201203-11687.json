   "comments": [
    "This is a very fun class. You definitely have to be interested in theory, because most of the course is reading and writing blogs about theoretical texts. But if you are, it is a fun and very engaging seminar!",
    "Don't take it, unless they make it better. It was honestly like not having a class on my schedule, except for the fact that reading responses were due ridiculously early AND you never discuss what you actually read in class. It's random and you don't get much out of it. Final project is really cool, but that's the only redeeming factor. Readings are great but we never discussed them properly!",
    "yeah, take it if you want to read media theory and make a digital media project",
    "This class is very broad and goes through a lot with digital anthropology and different aspects of the internet and how it is used. A lot of good basics, but often conversations were very superficial and flighty.",
    "If you're into WGSS, this is a great course for discussing gender and sexuality issues in the context of modern technology. It can seem a bit scattered at times, but the workload is very manageable -- just a blog post (reading response) each week plus the final digital group project. Grewal and Wexler are a great team. Take this class if you're genuinely interested in the syllabus material; otherwise, you'll be underwhelmed.",
    "I would recommend the class. But you must recognize thaft this class is basically a book club that doesnt talk about the book.",
    "This is a whacky class with benefits and drawbacks alike. If you're interested in putting together a big project and having wide ranging discussions about media, sexuality, gender, and pop culture (so basically anything), try it out! Keep in mind that although it is listed as American Studies, for our semester you weren't allowed to do your large research project on anything American."
