    "strong writing basis about developing ideas, incredible insight into modern consumption of popular media and the qualities of culture",
    "I learned how to structure arguments and essays, and I gained new insight about societal power structures of capital and culture.",
    "I learned a lot in this course. It was the most eye-opening of my classes this semester, and I learned to look at life\/culture around me under a more critical\/analytic lens....very interesting and cool.",
    "This class taught me how to write a proper university paper. I began this course being used to writing short, concise, timed essays. I learned to really flesh out my ideas and utilize sources to support my arguments."

    "strength: compelling topics and discussion",
    "Strengths of this class were student involvement and feedback from the professor. Weakness was that we could have worked on writing\/specific improvements more.",
    "I really appreciated all of the scintillating in-class discussions, and I feel that this really improved my ability to verbalize my thoughts and contribute to the class discussions. I think more writing assignments that receive feedback (on top of the 4 main essays of ENGL 114) would be helpful to improve writing ability.",

    "Yes! If writing essays at Yale stresses you out, this is a great course to better your skills and acclimate you to writing!",
    "Yes because it was an interesting course while also providing in depth knowledge about important social and cultural concepts.",
    "Yes, because you learn a lot about the society you live in as well as the fandoms that inhabit it.",
    "yes - recommended on the merit of the teacher alone! she's so great!",
    "I would recommend this course--it was a new spin on 'traditional English classes', and it was so interesting to investigate fandom structures firsthand by becoming part of a fandom and analyzing our behavior and the responses we received. I also loved the philosophy discussions that were intermingled with our reading discussions.",
    "Yes, this was my most enjoyable class (in terms of both class time and work). I think it made me a more creative thinker.",
    "Fans, culture and society offers a different perspective on mass media and popular culture. I learned a lot and strongly recommend.",
    "Yes, it was deeply interesting to learn about fan culture. This course was a good way to learn writing skills and to have engaging topics to write about. The readings were always interesting and insightful, complicating the narrative of fan communities, and the discussions were interesting because of the varied perspectives from which we were all approaching the material. The course was taught well. I really enjoyed having a professor who both challenged our perspectives and respected our right to have a different stance on aspects of fan culture."
