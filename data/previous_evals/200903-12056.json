    "If you only ever take one WGSS class, TAKE THIS ONE. If you're a WGSS major, TAKE THIS ONE. Either way, this class is accessible to you and definitely worth your time. Prof. Boyd is a great discussion leader and the topics at hand here are extremely compelling. You will never again take a class that integrates theory and real life so well, and you will not regret it. This class has opened my eyes to so many new ways of looking at the world around me, and I couldn't have asked for a better course. Furthermore, the reading level is relatively light for a seminar and always interesting.",
    "YES!! I really enjoyed this class. You should take it. Professor Boyd fosters really open, honest discussion about very difficult topics. I often found myself thinking about this class and telling my friends about it, because it was so thought provoking. The readings are also fascinating, so I did every one of them. You have to post weekly responses to the reading, which aren't difficult, there's a short analysis of a cultural artifact and a long analysis of a different one as well as creating a group intervention project. The intervention project was one of my favorite parts of the class. We also did a self-defense class at the end of the semester with a yale grad, which was really great. We talked about issues on campus as well as self-defense tactics. Overall this is a great class that everyone should take!!",
    "AMAZING CLASS.1. All students should take this class--both male and female. It is relevant to all social interactions, particularly in college life, where so many of our daily endeavors are hyper-gendered (think frat party).2. Prof. Boyd is incredible. So kind and welcoming, but so so smart.3. I found the class very challenging -- feminist theory can be hard to parse though, but it was so interesting and rewarding.4. The subject matter is heavy -- we essentially talk about rape, molestation, and domestic abuse all semester. Not happy times. Everyone in the class had a really good attitude, but it was a little depressing at times. At times it was a little bit much, but I was comfortable sharing these feeling with Prof. Boyd.TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in discussing issues of rape, victimization, media portrayals, and other types of sexual and structural violence. There's a rape intervention project that allows you to basically design a way in which you would help prevent(or make others more aware of) sexual violence either on campus or in another setting. Even though the project isn't a huge part of the course, it lets you put the things you learn in discussion to good use and see how the theories hold up. It's a great small seminar :)",
    "Very good, important course. The reading is all very interesting, rich theoretical reading surrounding the issue of rape and how to prevent it. Class discussion were generally very interesting. The class offers a fascinating intersection of cultural studies, gender studies, and social activism. Cool opportunities to apply what you are working on through rape prevention project, and many discussions on how the material relates to social life on campus.",
    "If you are thinking about taking this course, take it. Professor Boyd is an incredible instructor on a topic that this is so important."
