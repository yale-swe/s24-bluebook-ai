   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in urban studies, city planning, design, cultural issues, this class is awesome. there is usually a somewhat diverse background of students so you get different opinions and are able to generate great discussion.",
    "If you're interested in urban studies and different ways of approaching urban research (and don't mind a sometimes boring seminar), definitely take this class. It's not super difficult in terms of work, and the material is really engaging, as are the field trips.",
    "I'd recommend it if you're looking for a different way to view cities and the urban environment; it's also cool because you get to go out into New Haven a few times and do field trips. But if you want a class on urban planning or whatnot, skip it.",
    "This is a great course. The professor is incredibly engaged in his students' work. The field trips are a lot of fun, and you really come out of the class having a new perspective on urban life.",
    "Elihu is great, but the class didn't really expand upon anything that hasn't been covered in other urban theory classes.",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "A fun class about theory of urban design. Strong focus on New Haven but also touches upon European cities, Philadelphia, and New York City. Very technical, lots about urban renewal and high way development. Fun assignments like urban drift, study the history of a building, and site observations.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student. It is a great seminar. Always have interesting discussions. Elihu Rubin is a great professor. The assignments are fun. I also really enjoyed all the field trips we took, especially the one up to East Rock.",
    "I would without a doubt recommend Urban Life and Landscapes to another student. The work load is manageable, but be prepared to do assignments that require you to go out into the city a few times. While the assignments are both enjoyable and relevant, having to venture out multiple times can be sometimes prove to be a hassle. Nonetheless, if you're at all interested in urban studies, this is a class not to be missed.",
    "Listed as ARCH, but take it if you want an interdisciplinary urban studies class where you are granted a great deal of autonomy with your projects. Elihu is an approachable professor and very encouraging of students to make what they want of the coursework. The readings are reasonable and well-curated. Because the course is interdisciplinary, and the professor is open, the quality and content of the discussion depends on the interests of the students and really tempers the course; try to gauge that in your first meeting before deciding whether to enroll."
