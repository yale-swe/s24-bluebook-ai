    "If you are interested in Brazil or South Africa or interested in racial inequality in general, this is a great class for you.",
    "Yes! Awesome class with a great professor. The readings were very interesting and topic matters were interesting to discuss. Professor Seekings is a very approachable professor who does a great job of keeping discussion active and interesting. The assignments were not very difficult and were helpful in learning the material.",
    "Yes! Amazing class - one of the few at Yale that requires students to really think critically about its themes.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in conceptualizing and understanding race outside of the U.S. Class is definitely more race focused than class focused, but it is a really good class.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject.",
    "Prepare to think about race in a vastly different way if you're only used to thinking about USA race relations. Take this seminar, every week we head excellent reading and lively discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course"
