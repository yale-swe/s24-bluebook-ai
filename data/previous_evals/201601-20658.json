    "USAF 102 is an introductory course for AFROTC cadets. It covers different aspects of the Air Force lifestyle and culture that is important for Air Force personnel to know. I would recommend taking USAF 102 if you are thinking of joining AFROTC (because you can't join AFROTC without taking the course).",
    "Great class, overall interesting material, gives good info about air force and its many benefits.",
    "If allowed, take this class. It's a fun, discussion based class that is pretty chill.",
    "It taught us a lot about the Air Force. I would only recommend this to a person in Air Force ROTC because it is designed specifically for cadets, but others might find it interesting.",
    "USAF 102 felt much more relevant, useful, and was overall far more interesting than USAF 101!"
