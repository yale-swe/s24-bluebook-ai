    "it is interesting for BME majors and other who may be interested in the material. There isn't as much in depth study of particular biomaterials, it is more of an overview or survey of the field. I would take it if you had any interest in the subject",
    "Tests are difficult. Classes are interesting if you like the topic.",
    "As the course stands now, I wouldn't recommend it. The lecture slides need to be restructured so that main ideas are apparent - this semester, they were repetitive and confusing, and Prof. Gonzalez reads directly off of them so there isn't much clarification in class. There are only three problem sets, but you need both textbooks (required and recommended) to do them, so make the investment. Exams aren't super difficult but again, it's hard to study for them if you're using just the lecture slides. (The required textbook is really dry so even if you try to do the readings, they don't help much. The recommended textbook has better example problems for calculations.) Use Becky the TA is a resource - she's great at explaining topics you might be fuzzy on after lecture. However, I'm betting that Prof. Gonzalez learned a lot from this semester since it was her first time teaching, and will be much better the second time around. Shop it and see how it goes.",
    "This course contains a lot of valuable concepts and information for a biomedical engineer because the materials it presents can be used in anything from nanoparticles to large prostheses to pacemakers. However, the method of presentation of information was not helpful. Part of the problem was a lack of a good biomaterials textbook for reference (the Shackelford text, although it didn't contain biomedical applications, was far more useful than Ratner's book). A larger problem was the lecture format, which generally consisted of about 40 to 80 PowerPoint slides, which the instructor, Anjelica Gonzalez, rushed through (often finishing 10 to 30 minutes before the allotted time) without much explanation, often reading off the slides, many of which were unclear and hastily assembled, as evidenced by misspellings, direct copying and pasting from questionable Internet sources, and the way the instructor sometimes wasn't sure how to pronounce words. Therefore, lecture was very ineffective. Studying for the tests was an exercise in memorizing the slides since students couldn't be sure how general or specific the evaluation would be. The final was more fair in its cumulative evaluation of concepts. The TA was very knowledgeable and helpful in explaining ideas that were not clear. In general, the TA was more dependable than the professor for a good explanation. Although I have not seen the grades yet, the professor claimed to be curving to a C, which made the course additionally worrisome and stressful for students. In a school where curving to a C is the norm, this is fine, but at Yale, where this is not the case, a C on a transcript makes it look as though the student performed poorly compared to his or her performance in other classes, which gives the wrong impression. However, the professor did not mean any harm; she is actually a nice person.",
    "No, I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. It was my least favorite course this semester and was very frustrating. The grading was too critical, the lectures were boring, we were not prepared for the exams, and studying was almost impossible because we had to memorize 60+ slides for each lecture.",
    "Biomaterials, ranging from adhesives to nanomaterials. 99% of your learning will come from doing the readings.",
    "Biomaterials gives an introduction to ceramics, metals, and polymers and their uses in biomedical devices. Although I do feel I have a general understanding of the topic, this course felt somewhat scattered at times and did not offer as much as it could have. I would recommend this course to students who already have a background in engineering and would find it helpful to know specifically what each type of material can offer in terms of biomedical function."
