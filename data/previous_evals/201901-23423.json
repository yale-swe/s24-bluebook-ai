    "I learned more about art and its interventions and place in the city, about who does\/can\/cannot make up the city, how people engage with the city, and how photography captures\/remakes\/redefines the city",
    "I learned so much about the history of photography in American cities, as well as ethical issues regarding such photography, looking at both contemporary and historical projects.",
    "In this course I learned how to think critically about socially photography, public art, and social practice. I learned how to write a proposal for a public exhibition.",
    "I gained a basis of urban theory combined with a toolkit to analyzie art and civic engagement from a political perspective. I learned a lot about the photography and art world, as well as the intentions and process involved with formulating a project similar to the ones we explored in class each week.",
    "This course combines ideas of visual studies with urban studies and is ultimately about public art. We looked a wide range of photography and public art projects that I feel like helped me understand the relationships between artists and cities.",
    "This class provided me with new lenses through which to examine urban spaces and photographs of them."

   "comments": [
    "Readings were really interesting and engaging, but actual class time could benefit from more structured discussion or even varied class formats",
    "Assignments were fantastic and fun to put together, and the readings were carefully chosen and were well organized in the order we read them. Discussions were good, although I would have wishes for two things: 1. More time to discuss our own projects as a class before the final presentations 2. Less time dedicated to discussing the readings, more time looking at photographs in class and discussing those\/working in groups (like the first class).",
    "I thought that the syllabus was incredible; the readings were all interesting, and they were organized thoughtfully. Sometimes, however, the amount of reading assigned along with the difficulty of the readings themselves disabled full engagement, and it was clear in class discussions that some of the students were not fully engaged.",
    "Strengths: the syllabus was very well put together and engaging as a set of materials to engage with every week. Each week had a theme, creating a broad yet coherent curriculum of art analysis entwined with urban analysis and larger social issues. Weaknesses: the seminar itself could have been more engaging, in that many students opted out of participating in the discussion week after week. It may have been helpful to have a clearer rubric of participation that required everyone speak. Discussions often deadened not because of lack of engaging topics but rather because many did not feel compelled to contribute to the discussion.",
    "The readings, materials, and projects for the course were great, but discussion was often unfocused.",
    "This class covered an amazing array of material: a variety of different texts, locations and photographic projects. I also enjoyed the structure of the assignments in this class -- the opportunity to pick a site to study throughout the semester was really exciting and rewarding."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely! Its an important subject that rarely gets much discourse.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the subjects that we covered hadn't occurred to me before taking the course and the project was really fun to conceive and work on throughout the course.",
    "This course was such a fun exploration of art from a social perspective, allowing students without any background in art to engage with the course materials through their own respective lens of study. The class facilitated the joining of many academic perspectives, as well as a diversity of artistic interpretation, contributing to an interesting and conversational class environment each week.",
    "If you're interested in public art, this is a great class! But it is less about photography than the title would suggest. I would take this class again just to spend more time with Kristin Hankins.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student."
