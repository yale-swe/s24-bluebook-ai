    "I would recommend this if you are interested in theories of war. Don't get intimidated by the syllabus--class really ends up being what students make it, and Professor Dafoe explicitly talks about how it's impossible to do every page of reading. Overall, not too much work--lots of reading if you do it all, but just two reading responses, and a final paper that is around 60% of the grade. This class will make you think, and will give you an intelligent way to talk about current problems.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in security and very theoretical discussions of war. The readings are long but generally very interesting and you can skim them."
