    "Unfortunately, Frank Prochaska has just left for Oxford. This is Yale's loss.The syllabus is fine and the workload isn't overly burdensome.",
    "Yes. Very, very sorry that Prof. Prochaska only got to do this once.",
    "A great overview of the western canon of political philosophy. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "This course should be required for everyone, and especially for Americans who need to understand the ideological roots and problems of political philosophy of the republic and democratic political system we have inherited. The amount of work in the form of the three essays and the reading list is minimal in comparison to what you will get out of being in this course. The return on your investment is exponential and there is no point of diminishing returns, but you will want to return!",
    "DS is an excellent program, but the success of your semester depends heavily on your section leader. Prochaska was often uninspiring and dull, never giving us new ways to think about old ideas. He will be leaving though.",
    "Wonderful course. Look forward to it - it is much more enjoyable than first semester H&P."
