    "great class, discussions were great",
    "Strengths: Great discussion, interesting material, useful perspective. Professor was sweet, approachable, and extremely helpful in planning out assignments. The course also drew a good group of students, with whom discussions were lively and insightful (and whom Susan tolerated with impressive patience!) Weaknesses: Reading volume was fine (sometimes heavy), but many of the articles were above our level of quantitative expertise. It also might be beneficial to take a more formal instructive approach to the first part of class, walking through the concepts and laying the groundwork for a more structured discussion.",
    "I enjoyed the course, but I did find that I was often wishing for less theory and a little more practical economics. Without a lot of background in micro, I would have liked to do some more work with graphs\/math etc. That being said, we covered some really interesting topics, and class was very enjoyable and thought-provoking."

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0really great, very responsive and friendly, openminded",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is just great. Really, one of the nicest people (student or professor!) I have met at Yale. Extremely kind and helpful, not to mention surprisingly tolerate of the knuckleheads in our class and the maddening tangents we pursued (\"It was a very nice Basilica!\"). Susan was invaluable in planning out our final papers, and provided very useful assistance in guiding our research. It was always a pleasure to meet with her, and every student in the class was fortunate to meet and work with Susan. I would recommend any class she teaches.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan is fantastic! Very receptive to student's interests and requests. Encouraged discussion and made the time pass quite quickly.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan definitely put in effort to strike a balance between letting the conversation run wild and lecturing on pre-selected topics, which was good. I do think that she probably could have made some of the topics of discussion more challenging (since it sometimes seemed like she was dumbing things down for us)"

    "Very helpful for those who want to get insights into the theories and literature in health economics.",
    "Good! Useful material, good instructor, a step up in sophistication of familiar concepts. Highly recommended for people with an understanding of health policy but a shortage of economic perspective.",
    "This is a very interesting seminar course. Highly recommend!",
    "This class is really interesting and not a ton of work. It uses economic concepts to talk about health care problems\/procedures. This is definitely a class, based on its size, where the students make it, so I would recommend that people take it together so that there can be lively debate\/discussion. I also really liked that we had the option to analyze data for our final projects; I had a lot of fun doing that."
