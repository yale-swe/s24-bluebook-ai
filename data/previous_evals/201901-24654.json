   "comments": [
    "An in-depth look at a nation often not studied - this course did a great job of covering a wide range of aspects related to Tibet.",
    "Understanding an intelligible field of study and looking at the progression of Tibet through multiple different lenses.",
    "This course not only offers me a chance to listen and accept different perspectives but also helps me understand my culture, identity, and religion better in a broader context.",
    "Professor Hill was a genius in this course. He was not an expert in Tibet by any means but understood the fundamental concepts pertaining to the religious, social and political life of the country and demonstrated how those concepts are pervasive and present in spheres we would have otherwise not expected. The selection of readings allowed students to glean salient insights on the country.",
    "The history and culture of Tibet by looking at Tibetan history, religion, and politics, often through a comparative\/interdisciplinary lens.",
    "A lot of knowledge on the history of Tibet and the history of stories relevant to each class's topic.",
    "I learned how to study a culture in general, and then how to apply those skills to Tibet in general. I learned how to dive headfirst into a culture you know nothing about, and how to really understand it. I learned to critically analyze historical documents for hidden meaning in the same way I would analyze a novel for English."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: incredible professor, readings, and topic",
    "I felt our seminars could have had more discussion. Additionally, the workload expectations for this course were somewhat unclear.",
    "Strengths: very interesting material and great readings. Prof. Hill is very knowledgable. Weaknesses: relatively unstructured leading to silences in discussion, but expected for a class in its infancy.",
    "Strengths: It teaches strategy and methodology to learn how to analyze global affair or culture differences. I believe this kind of knowledge is the foundation for any students to learn the world better with less bias. Weakness: It would be better if the professor can invite some speakers for some specific topics.",
    "The readings are well selected and the course has a good arc. Perhaps a greater focus on the anthropological and cultural component would be nice.",
    "Very good course overall. In some cases, I found it a bit broad; it could easily be split into two classes, one on Tibetan history and politics, and one on Tibetan Buddhism. But the class does a good job of covering both topics in depth most of the time, and the advantage of covering all those topics together is that it emphasizes the interconnectedness of religion, history, and politics in the Tibetan identity.",
    "I really like that it looked at Tibet in a specific context but also it's relation (or lack thereof) to the rest of the world. It was very thought provoking. There were times when we deviated far from the topic of Tibet, though, and I sometimes lost sight of what we were discussing in the first place. For the most part, the discussions were relevant though.",
    "The strength of this course is in the Professor. Professor hill is incredible, and in addition to being very knowledgeable, he has a great interest for exploration. He is happy to consider new ideas and angles on Tibet and the course material. I loved all of our reading, and the prompts for the midterm and final essays really made me think and helped me understand the culture better. No weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!!",
    "Yes! Prof. Hill is great!",
    "Highly recommend. This course is actually not just about Tibet. It gives the bigger picture of the modern international system and teaches how to analyze political issues objectively.",
    "Yes. Tibet is something we should all know about, and the course is an effective primer.",
    "This course is what Yale should be. Learning about something in order to be better informed, while engaging with the liberal arts.",
    "Yes it was great I definitely would.",
    "To learn with professor Hill is to learn with one of Yale's greatest thinkers. He will expose you to Tibet like no other professor.",
    "Yes! I didn't know much about Tibet going in and the class was a good introduction to many different aspects of Tibetan history and culture. So it's very accessible whether you're already versed in Tibet, or if you don't know much about it at all.",
    "Definitely! Although it's a very specific topic, it teaches you a way of thinking and analyzing one nation\/culture\/civilization in a way that can be applied to many others.",
    "Yes, definitely. Even if you dont know anything about Tibet, as was my situation, it is incredibly fun to dive into a new culture. The professor is great and the readings and assignments are fun. Would recommend very highly."
