   "comments": [
    "I would summarize the course by saying that it is a lecture on the mechanics of how MRI and EEG actually work, and then a lab portion that is about the practical aspect of analyzing different kinds of neuro data. I would definitely recommend this to another student, as long as they know that it is a good deal of work, and helps if you have a particular interest in neuroscience already (as in, this probably shouldn't be your first neuro class).",
    "\"The class introduces you to most of the big methods in human neuroscience, focusing on fMRI and EEG and the latest techniques used in both. The course is mostly lab based and the students work with actual data, going through all steps of the analysis. At the end, there's an actual experiment you'll need to design and run, thus allowing you to use the methods you've learned.\"It was a great class, I'd recommend it because these methods are the basics in human neuroscience.",

   "comments": [
    "The course definitely deeps my knowledge of how to run an fMRI study from start to finish. I hope to introduce some fMRI work into my own line of research, so this is hugely helpful.",
    "This course filled in many of the gaps in my fMRI knowledge as well as introduced me to many other methods and techniques, such as EEG, that I'd never used before. It also provided background explanations of the physical mechanisms contributing to the techniques. I plan to continue the class project with the intent on publishing the results.",
    "very much deepened my understanding of methods used in neuroscience."
