    "Portuguese! reading writing speaking listening",
    "I got an immense amount of knowledge about Portuguese language and culture. I improved my speaking, listening and writing skills substantially throughout the semester, and hope to continue to improve them in Portuguese II going forward.",
    "I learned basic conversational, sentence structure, vocabulary for this course. I also learned about brazilian culture.",
    "In addition to learning Portuguese, I was able to gain a profound insight into Brazilian and even how to dance to Funky!",
    "Enrolling in this course truly initiated and developed my Portuguese language skill, given that I had no previous experience with the language. All of the language components-especially that of reading and speaking in Portuguese-immensely enriched my academic experience as a whole.",
    "I learned tons of the basics of the Portuguese language, from vocabulary to grammar. I feel like I have such a stronger grasp of the language now, all thanks to this intro class."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: friendly and low-stakes atmosphere, emphasis on speaking in class, additional events outside of class to further practice Portuguese\/engage with Brazilian culture, emphasis on interpersonal\/group learning (you spend a lot of time with your classmates and learn a lot about them!)",
    "It's a fantastic course, very well taught. Could have used more reading assignments though.",
    "The main strength of this course was the Professor, Lizandra Correia. Professor Correia made each and every class fun, engaging and educational, and went the extra mile to make our experience in the class as good as possible. The main improvement I would have with the course is more transparency about homework and assignments, as sometimes we would receive hours of homework in one night then nothing for the rest of the week. Having work more spaced out and announced farther in advance would definitely improve the class.",
    "I loved this course. The professor was always engaging and dynamic. She always had a fun activity to get students to interact with the material and learn a new language. I enjoyed how the class was taught with interactive activities both in and outside the classroom. Not only did we learn to have simple conversations in Portuguese, we also learned to read and became more knowledgable about brazilian culture and traditions.",
    "This course is amazing. The only weakness is that Pearson Language Lab the department forces us to use.",
    "This course enables students to acquire Portuguese through various and enjoyable manners, especially with respect to learning Brazilian culture. The classes always have some component of direct and diverse contact with it, whether in terms of listening to Brazilian songs and learning its historical context, or in terms of reading about Brazilian folklores.",
    "Strengths - very fun classes, great teachers, fun extracurricular activities to supplement language learning, and lots of information learned Weaknesses - none that i can think of!"

   "comments": [
    "The Brazilian Portuguese program is really fun--you learn a lot\/as much as any other intro language class without the undue stress\/pressure present in most other intro language classes.",
    "Yes, so much fun and I loved Lizandra and the other portuguese professors.",
    "100%. Professor Correia and all the other Portuguese professors are highly motivated to make your experience in the class a memorable one. They make learning a language truly enjoyable, with food, music, movies and other activities scattered throughout the semester. If you're looking to fulfill a language requirement this is the best class to take, whether you've taken another romance language or not.",
    "Absolutely. This course was the highlight of my day everyday.",
    "So much fun and tailored efficiently! I feel like I am already conversational in Portuguese. And the class encourages one to look beyond just the textbook. I ended up listening to lots of music in Portuguese as a result of the class!",
    "Indeed, I would most definitely recommend this course to all, because of the multifaceted and active manners with which students are able to engage with the language.",
    "Yes 100%!! The class is so so much fun and you learn so much. Not too much work but I feel like I got so much better at Portuguese. Such a great class."
