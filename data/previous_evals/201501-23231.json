   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course even to other students in the astronomy department. It was a bit of a \"culture shock\" to get back into mathematical formalisms and Lagrangian mechanics, but I learned a lot from this course.",
    "Physics 538 is a very good class if you are interested in astrophysics or general relativity. Be warned that it does require some high-level mathematics, so having some familiarity with manifolds would be wise before taking the course.",
    "This a rigorous well-paced and advanced introduction to general relativity and cosmology.",
    "A freshman could take this class, provided he has a decent background in covariant electrodynamics with gauge and is familiar with the language of differential geometry. Good motivation and a genuine interest in the material is a must before taking the class, as well as being able to self-study and lean the material on your own so that you may keep up with and take more out of the lectures. It is highly recommended to have multiple reference texts on GR with you as you go through this course.",
    "I would recommend it to people interested in studying astrophysics as it goes deeper into the things that comes up a lot when talking about curvature, expansion, etc."

   "comments": [
    "As someone intending to work on black holes, this class was indispensable.",
    "For a serious physicist, knowing how to work with symmetries, killing fields, and gauges is a must, and so this class is an excellent preparation for both quantum and classical field theories. Especially considering the modern fascination with inflation, this class allows the student to understand with some clarity the goings-on in the forefront of gravitational physics. One setback is that Einstein's equations are not derived, and so self-study from alternate texts is especially recommended for understanding."
