   "comments": [
    "This class taught me how to think differently and engage in meaningful debate. It also taught me a great deal about the (lack of) animal protection in US law, and the need for new legal thinking. Although you will definitely learn about some of the atrocious things that happen to animals in the US, this class is not meant for only environmentalists or animal lovers. Everyone (FES, Law, Yale College, etc.) should take this course.",
    "The course gave a constructive way for me to think about animal ethics, animal law, and some more broad principles like respect, integrity, humanity, personhood, and morality vs legality.",
    "Great breadth of understanding of topics related to animal law. Also, as my first law school course, it was a good introduction to law school style readings & teachings. Appreciated the legal cases. Several takeaways - too many to list here.",
    "The class was mostly animal philosophy and ethics, so that's most of what we got out of the class. Little time devoted to law, and literally no feedback for students.",
    "Exposure (albeit very modest) to the legal world (e.g., terms, literature, general thinking\/argument styles, etc.). As an FES student, it was fascinating to hear the opinions offered up and the arguments put forth by YLS students regarding animals and the environment.",
    "A general survey of existing animal law, as well as the innovative ways that science and policy are addressing gaps in the field. A series of awesome speakers gave a concrete and applied grounding to this highly philosophical class I liked this balance.",
    "The course covered an overview of animal law protections, policies and advocacy strategies in the United States. But the course went beyond law, and in fact focused a significant chunk of its time on discussing philosophical and ethical questions."

   "comments": [
    "Very well.",
    "I was surprised that the class was way more philosophy-oriented than law-oriented, which surprised me a lot. We really didn't discuss cases and statutes much in class, so I don't feel I got much animal-legal skills out of the class.",
    "With my nonexistent experience with YLS courses, I didn't exactly have expectations about how the course would be run; similarly, with my minimal exposure in the \"animal rights\" world, I didn't really have expectations about the course material. The only expectations I had were those related to the professorial styles of Drs. Kysar and Lovvorn, and those were certainly met. Doug and Jon are so entertaining to be around, and the fact that they're so brilliant makes it all the better.",
    "Super well! I feel that I know the landscape of animal law and what it would mean to work in this field.",
    "Coming in, I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the course. But I was sometimes a little confused about what exactly the course focused on, and this varied as the course progressed."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The syllabus encompasses a robust overview of the various dimensions of animal law (wildlife, anti-cruelty, research\/zoo, companion animals, climate change, technological innovation). I also appreciate that the professors brought to the classroom some of the top academics in the field. I also thought the class embraced the seminar style in a way such that the professors really wanted to hear people's honest opinions, even if they were not politically correct. Weaknesses: The pure quantity of reading could be reduced to increase the number of students who came fully prepared.",
    "Strong topics and mostly strong guest lecturers. The lectures sometimes were a bit too chatty; I think Doug corrected this near the end by identifying topics of interest and putting them on the board for class discussion so we had some structure.",
    "Much more class time devoted to the laws and statutes. I was very surprised when the professors mentioned that one of our guests, Bruce Wagman, had written a casebook on animal law, because I assumed the reason we were just reading a few cases and mostly philosophy each week was because there wasn't a structured casebook. I didn't feel I got the legal insights and skills that I was hoping to out of the class, so I think using a casebook and teaching more about the law would help the class a lot. That said, the discussions we had were a lot of fun and very engaging and rewarding. Also, a lot of students were frustrated that the professors never provided feedback or even grades on any of our written response papers, which the entirety of our (non-participation) grade for this class. This really did not seem fair, because we had not idea if we were meeting expectations or needed improvement, let alone how we could improve and develop skills. Lastly, it was frustrating that so much of the class was devoted to anti-cruelty laws. Even after that section, since it was the only legal topic we really went into any depth on, that shaped our discussion for later topics that were not through any particular legal lens. Because so much of the class was focused on why anti-cruelty laws are inadequate for dealing with animal problems, I felt that our time would have been better used and felt more rewarding if we had looked at say agriculture laws, food standards, environmental laws, or other types of laws that might have been more effective for a specific topic that just anti-cruelty laws, which we had already discussed as being inadequate.",
    "The predominant strength was, without question, the professors. They were excellent at facilitating discussion amongst students while also interjecting their own thought-provoking opinions at perfectly-timed intervals. Moreover, Jon and Doug never failed to inspire a comfortable yet \"respectful disagreements welcome\"-type atmosphere, which is particularly important for a subject as potentially-touchy as animal rights and the environment. Another strength was the students; it was borderline mind-blowing to hear certain students speak, because their eloquence was off the charts. \/\/ Weaknesses of the course are harder to pinpoint. I suppose my main gripe was the amount of reading, but that's not really a fair complaint because it's probably to be expected with a course at YLS.",
    "The number of applied lecturers was a great strength. Readings were diverse and varied, ranging from case law to legislation to philosophy. Great strength in that.",
    "Doug and Jon are amazing instructors with a real passion for the subject, a great deal of experience, and a real chemistry working together as well. They're so kind and supportive and made the class really enjoyable. But there were times when I felt a little lost in the course - about what its methodological foundations were, what it aimed to do, and how exactly assignments were to be written. We also didn't receive any feedback on our assignments, which was also disappointing."

   "comments": [
    "This is a wonderful class to engage in reach philosophical discussion on the question of animal ethics. The professors provide a space where people can spreak freely and the class can truly have robust conversation. It does require a lot of reading, but definitely worth it!",
    "Take this class if you think you might be interested; great content and professors.",
    "Be prepared for a LOT of philosophy. If you're interested in that, you'll have a great time. If not, some FES students I spoke with were disappointed with how little law was in the class.",
    "Don't be intimidated by the intensity of this class' legalese. It's nothing you can't learn, and it's in your best interest to try. Nobody will judge you for being a novice. Plus, how many more opportunities will you have in life to take a class at the number one law (or any subject) school in the world? Just take it, and soak up what you can. These professors make it worth it, and you're pretty much guaranteed to grow (in some way) from the experience.",
    "Not a traditional law course a lot of discussion between students! A lot of free flowing conversation.",
    "Definitely take the course! But also consider auditing it. The topic is so important and the professors are wonderful, but we received no feedback on our writing, so I'm not sure if there's much to gain beyond the opportunity to sit in the classes."
