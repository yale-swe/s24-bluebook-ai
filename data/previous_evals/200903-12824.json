   "question_text": "If a requirement, did this course occur in proper sequence within the School's educational program?  If not, where should it occur?",
   "comments": [
    "It should occur in the the 1st year second semester to give students an opportunityto explore areas of personal interest earlier.",
    "this was a requirement but i think it would be better if this were taught either first or second semester instead of 3rd. It would be a great class to take that could possibly spark interest in something which could develop into a thesis but the current order of this class means that we are taking it too late to do that.",
    "I believe that it would be more beneficial if this coursewas offered in the first year of the program (either the first term or more preferably the second). It would than provide an opportunity for the post-pro students to structure their further education at Yale.",
    "It should actually happen a little earlier in the post-pro program. probably secondsemester would be best.",
    "The course occur in a proper sequence within the educational program. It might be even more useful if it happens in the second term of the program, instead of the third.",
    "In class we discussed the location of this class within the post-pro sequence. Itwas the group consensus that it should be located in the first or second semester of first year. This class would be a great opportunity for students to establish a thesis proposal or focus area for their education.",
    "As we discussed in the final session, it seems that this course would be most effective in the first semester of the March II sequence. It would provide the opportunity for students to identify a specific interest around which they could a) tailor the selection of elective credits and studios over the following three semesters b) propose a thesis or independent study.",
    "No - This is a great introduction course for the Post-Professional program, but itshould definitely be the first required elective you take, not the last one. The course gives you an open format to explore an aspect of urbanism or architectural design that interests you. You\u0092re able to develop your own area of \u0093concentration\u0094 within this elective, which has the potential to setup a strong set of options for Post-Pro students over the course of two years if it\u0092s provided at the beginning.If this light open-format elective replaced Eberhart\u0092s aggressive fabrication elective in the first semester, it would work as a catalyst for a multitude of Post-Pro improvements. Post-pro students would be able gain traction within a good intro studio and elective package instead of being bombarded with Eberthart\u0092s heavy three credit elective and dividing their time between two \u0093mini-studios\u0094 of lukewarm production. Eberhart\u0092s class could turn into a full fledge 2nd semester \u0094building project\u0094 studio for the Post Pro program, which would also resolve the program\u0092s \u00932nd semester dilemma\u0094 when it comes to portfolio review and advanced design studio schedules. In the end, these moves would give Post-Pro students the proper footing to build up their interests and eventually opt to enter the advance studios in the second year or a final thesis setup.And finally, I believe having this entry urbanism seminar at the beginning will also help catch students who have a strict pre-conceived notion about urbanism before they try to force their ideals and interests on other students within a studio environment or future electives."

    "the sequence of the course is pretty basic and just involves students presenting their ideas every week. I don't see how this could be any different",
    "a very open ended, discussion based class. subjects were brought up by students, and discussed collectively.",
    "course was very helpful and allowed individual exploration, very intersting to see other students works and I found this very encouraging to apply this knowlege to future practice and studies",
    "The sequence and assignment is well sequenced, but the workload can be more intense during some moments of the semester.",

    "I had no actual expectations, but i was finally well impressed by my classmates personal investigations and availability for mutal critique.",
    "very good and seems to be a good course to encourage exploration as well as this is seems to be why a student would come back to grad school, to take courses like this one.",
    "The course covered well my expectation of understanding my main area of interest, narrowing the scope in this project to undertake a feasible research, doing the research and arriving to conclusions.",
    "I hoped to research a theme which framed this two-year course of study in relation to broader issues and trends. Although I was unable to draw the conclusions \/ complete the synthesis that I had originally hoped, the research was tremendously interesting and provided an overview which I will continue to reference in the future.",

    "I think the only way to improve this class would be to teach it earlier in our program and not the second to last semester.",
