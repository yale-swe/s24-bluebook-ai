    "The ability to engage with books as historical objects that don't only matter because of what they contain within them",
    "Definitely gained an ability to look at material objects, use the Beinecke's resources, perform material analysis, draw from a variety of sources.",
    "I gained a greater awareness of items at the Beinecke and the unique challenge of archival research.",
    "Before taking this course, my knowledge of the evolution of print was basically nonexistent. I now have an understanding of print as it began to pervade the culture of early modern England, exploring everything from the mechanics of a printing press to the involvement of the book in the dissolution of the monasteries."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength is definitely the materials-- being able to see and touch all these incredible works is a huge asset to this course. The weakness is that there's not a lot of cohesion throughout this course, and week to week it can be really hard to keep a sense of a complete narrative.",
    "I think a weakness of this course would be that sometimes the basics weren't well established. Having to read so many detail-oriented, very narrowly focused articles and book chapters, it would have been helpful to have a more solid foundation of British history or book and print terms in order to better keep up, rather than struggling through the readings and perhaps getting some definitions in the subsequent class--too late to really apply to what you were trying to learn. I also think that more built-in assistance for the papers--but especially the final paper--would have been helpful.",
    "A fantastic course that provides ample instruction and support to engage with the Beinecke's rich array of material.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was its ability to expose students firsthand to literature from early modern England. Yale has an incredible collection in the Beinecke which, unfortunately, students rarely take advantage of. By meeting in the Beinecke each class, students are able to discuss materials they had studied online as the printed edition sits in front of them. I think there could have been a higher level of involvement in the labs component of the class if write-ups were due after lecture attendance for example. I enjoyed the opportunity to write with quill and ink as a part of the labs, and I wish there was more discussion about the significance and implications of our personal experiences with writing with those materials."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. James is an absolute gem kind, understanding, eloquent, knowledgable, and fabulously smart. The material is interesting (and you get to be in the Beinecke all the time, how cool!) and while the readings are often dense and irritatingly exacting, James helps you through it all. Not a lot of work... weekly \"labs\" (aka handwriting analysis or other fun projects) that don't take more than half an hour or so, readings, one 5-7 pg paper, and a final 10-15 page paper. Take it if only to spend more time with some rare books.",
    "The class is listed as a history seminar cross-listed as an English seminar. To be clear; it is an english class. There is very little on the history of printing and England and a whole lot of close textual analysis. You have been warned.",
    "Yes, if they're interested in history in general or book history in particular",
    "I'd recommend this class for a few reasons. First, Kathryn James is a wonderful woman and an amazing resource-- she's tremendously knowledgable and really willing to help you out, from reading rough drafts of papers to meeting with you one on one to go over material. Second, it's taught in the Beinecke and has full access to the Beinecke's resources-- you get to see (and touch) the First Folio, for example, and you become really comfortable with these works. It's also just cool stuff, looking at material objects and doing analysis that isn't a common feature of most English courses, but definitely informs what you're learning about in other English classes. The downside is that it's hard to follow along if you don't know much English history, and from week to week it could be very disjointed-- each week had a topic that didn't really connect well to the next, so there wasn't much of a narrative and it was hard to remember what you'd been talking about a week before when it was so different. Overall, a good course.",
    "This course is good for if you want to learn about the background of and historical context of the works that make up the foundation of the English major. You'll cover approximately from Henry VIII to Charles II, and along the way you'll run into Shakespeare, Donne, and a few others. You'll learn a bit about the culture and political climate that would have influenced their work. The readings can be very detailed and a bit challenging if you don't have a solid background in book theory and history (which hardly any of us in the class did), but you do get to look at cool stuff from the Beinecke every week.",
    "Yes! Great excuse to spend a ton of time in the Beinecke.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, not just those interested in history or english. This course gives students exposure to incredible texts, an opportunity unique to Yale and its rich collections. The final 12-15 page research paper at the end of the semester allows students to explore any topic they are particularly interested and allows them to discover even more materials outside of the classroom."
