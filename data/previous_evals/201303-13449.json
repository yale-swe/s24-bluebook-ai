    "It was a good course if you're very interested in the specifics of pharmacology.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone that is interested in or considering a career in pharmacology. The content covered was very challenging and I enjoyed writing the midterm and final reports. There are no other undergraduate courses that covers the topic of pharmacology as in depth as this course.",
    "This was an excellent overview of pharmacology, including pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the development process of pharmaceuticals. There are only two fairly short papers and no tests. Every week you have to read one or two journal articles and most of the class time is spent discussing those. I would definitely recommend taking this course to anyone who is interested in pharmaceuticals."
