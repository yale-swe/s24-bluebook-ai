    "Awesome course that studies past epidemics",
    "This course introduced me to a seminar style of learning. I improved my speaking and analyzing skills, and am now more confidant in voicing my opinions. I also learned a great deal about epidemics throughout history and just how much they've influenced society.",
    "A strong conceptual understanding of the factors influencing disease.",
    "A newfound understanding for how epidemics affect wider societies.",
    "I learned a great deal about epidemics around the world and the impact of many epidemics on the cultures which they afflicted.",
    "I've gotten the chance to learn a ton about the epidemics we read about, and gained skills with reading about medical history as well as group discussion skills.",
    "I learned a lot about epidemics, and epidemiology. This course has a great mix of history and medicine and I came away with a wealth of new knowledge.",
    "As my first seminar at Yale, this course has taught me about how to approach required readings efficiently and how to properly engage in class discussions. Also, because of this course, I've realized the importance of context and the author's background in every piece of writing. With respect to content, this course has taught me the very basics of epidemiology and disease, and I learned a lot about major epidemics in history. The history taught in this class also carried some important lessons about politics and (not to be too trite) human nature.",
    "I developed knowledge about different epidemics throughout history, how they occur scientifically, and how they impact the society in which they occur. I also developed the skill to draw connections between different examples of epidemics around the World.",
    "I learned a lot about the intersections of history, science, and culture in this class. It allowed for me to combine my knowledge of all of these topics and better understand the major effects of epidemics on society."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course was a really great way to introduce freshman to a college seminar environment. It was relatively low stress, with papers and a lot of reading but no tests and not too many small assignments. This allowed us to really focus on learning the material and having interesting discussions about the books. Bill let the conversations veer off topic if interesting side points came up, and so I ended up learning a ton not only about historical epidemics, but also about philosophy, French writers, and the history of Yale. I really enjoyed the course - I don't think there's much to be done to improve it!",
    "It could be improved with less of a focus on long books because no one reads those and they hinder classroom discussion. Maybe selecting passages will help facilitate discussion.",
    "The material is interesting but the readings vary a lot in length: one class can require 300 pages of reading and the next 10.",
    "I really enjoyed the discussions we had each day!",
    "Strengths are the great class discussion and interesting readings. The main weakness is the amount of reading due in short time periods.",
    "Strengths: The topic is incredibly fascinating, and the syllabus is well constructed. Weaknesses: It can be somewhat frustrating to have read 150 pages, only to have an in-class discussion that doesn't go beyond the surface. It would have been nice if prof. Summers had set the bar for required reading a little bit higher earlier on, so the class discussions would've benefitted from the full potential of all students.",
    "This course is really well taught. Professor Summers is extremely knowledgable and I was able to learn new things every class. Even though the coursework is really light, the only way I can imagine to improve the course is to spread out the readings evenly.",
    "This course was a good introduction to seminar courses at Yale--though the discussion tended to be shallow (students often just restated facts from the book without any followup analysis, and sometimes discussions ground to a halt when people neglected readings), I think this course prepares students for higher-level discussions and research papers. To improve the level of discussion, it may be helpful to establish an expectation of high-level commentary at the beginning of the course to set a standard. It would also help to establish basics and ground rules at the beginning of the course (raising hands or not? what kinds of things should we be aiming to discuss? etc).",
    "The strengths of the course were the chosen topics discussed, as well as class discussion. A weakness might be that there wasn't too much variety in the type of homework we were assigned.",
    "The course had strong book choices and allowed for great discussions on the topics. However, I wish there would be a day before the reading would be due to discuss the diseases themselves, as sometimes researching the diseases myself before reading would cause me to miss some important detail for better understanding the reading."

   "comments": [
    "YES Bill is awesome",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was a welcome change from my other classes, all of which I'm using to satisfy distributional requirements or major prerequisites. This class was low stress with not too much outside work, but class discussions were stimulating and I learned a lot. We also got to go to NYC for an all expense paid field trip, which really helped our class bond. It was a great classroom environment with a great professor and interesting topics of conversation.",
    "Yes I would. It's a good class.",
    "It was a fun, easy class where reading was basically optional. The final paper was cool and Bill was really nice and engaging.",
    "Most definitely, especially those interested in the subject matter.",
    "Absolutely, this class was my favorite this semester and the professor is wonderful.",
    "Definitely would recommend! Prof. Summers is incredibly interesting to listen and talk to, and all the course content is really interesting. Not a lot of work at all, so you just get to enjoy learning about what you're reading.",
    "Yes!! This class teaches you about the history of how epidemics have shaped the world through a series of readings and class discussions. Professor Summers is brilliant and he presents information in a way that is easy to understand.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Bill is really likable, and although the readings can be long, you'll figure out how to handle them through experience, and besides the reading, there is not much coursework (two mini-presentations, a midterm paper, and a final paper). Also, if you're interested in history, this course provides a unique aspect of history that you otherwise might not encounter.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in global health, science, and enjoy class discussion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is highly enjoyable by people of many different majors due to the diversity of the books and the openness of conversation presented."
