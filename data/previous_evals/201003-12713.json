    "I say take it.",
    "more of a lecture type class. not too much work for a seminar. 2 presentations and a ten page paper.",
    "The class covers the history of the UN and its peacekeeping operations. You'll learn a lot, but there won't be much opportunity for discussion until your in-class project, which are generally really boring. It's a pretty solid class, though definitely not the most exciting.",
    "If you need a Poli Sci seminar this is definitely a winner.",
    "I had read the reviews that said that there was little discussion in this seminar but I was surprised when there was absolutely no discussion whatsoever. Almost no one spoke or asked questions but instead spent time on their laptops, which led to a painfully long seminar. Professor Krasno is really interesting and has a lot of great connections at the UN but I think that I would have benefited more by just having one-on-one conversations with her than I did by being in the seminar.",
    "eh. pretty easy,mostly interesting, but nothing really groundbreaking for a senior poli sci major."
