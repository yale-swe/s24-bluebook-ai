    "Yes, but please consider the difficulty of having a practical exam for a midterm. Yale does not prepare you for such kinds of exams. I studied a ton, and did adequately, but it really depends on that day and whether you just recognize in that 1 and a half minutes they give you for each slide. good luck!",
    "No lab reports mean this lab is very little work - just 50% really hard practical midterm, 50% reasonably easy final. For the midterm you have to identify parts of mice, frogs, plants etc. that are tiny and impossible to tell what they are...for the final, memorize everything in the lab packets and you should be fine. The second half of the lab starts getting really technically difficult, but since you don't write lab reports and you're not graded on success of procedures, it doesn't really matter if you can do it or not. Dr. Klein and the TAs are really helpful and knowledgeable - if you can get their attention, since the other 20 people in the lab are just as confused as you.",
    "very useful course to go along with the lecture. I would highly recommend any one willing to get hands dirty and understand reproductive lab by practical experiments.",
    "A good lab class. Very different from other labs because the focus is on technique, which isn't graded.",
    "Repro lab is an excellent way to get hands-on experience doing some very technical procedures. I learned a lot! Please beware this course if you are squeamish or afraid of rodents.",
    "YES! Great lab for bio majors.",
    "Definitely recommend it. The midterm can feel devastating, but it seems pretty fair and the experience is good with little work.",
    "The midterm will kill you. My grade in this class will not reflect the immense amount of knowledge I acquired throughout the course, and that is disappointing. This is definitely not an all A-B+ lab, despite being more interesting and instructive than most of them. It's really a shame that the lab final was fair, while the midterm was based on how well you happened to know a particular slide out of context. If you bomb the midterm you will bomb the class.",
    "Yeah!!",
    "I would recommend this course for a fellow student. The work is interesting and satisfying, and the stress level is not too high.",
    "Absolutely. Take it! Very minimum work except a lab practical for a midterm and written lab final. If you pay attention in class you will do well on the exams. It just takes effort to do all the work in class because there are no lab write-ups so it becomes tempting to just goof around.",
    "not as good a bio lab as everyone makes it out to be. if they change it from 50\/50 midterm and final, then i would take it. otherwise, the midterm is killer hard and the final is OK. i have no idea where i stood in the class, because klein was always so vague about the curve. on the other hand, its not as much weekly work as other bio labs (actually zero weekly work), and as a second semester senior bio major, i really enjoyed that aspect of it. i guess that may also explain why i thought the midterm was hard...",
    "Best MCDB lab by far. No questions asked. Midterm sucks, but the class itself is just awesome.",
    "Solid lab to take. Actually worth a half of a credit, prof klein is very nice and helpful, some pretty cool labs, pretty interesting, chill, do it.",
    "If you are a premed student and need to take a biology lab, this course isn't bad. Keep in mind, however, that this is not a traditional lab course. There are no lab reports - your entire grade is based 50% on the midterm and 50% on the final. Since the midterm is ridiculously difficult (it's a practical exam that we all felt entirely unprepared for), it is difficult to do well in the class.",
    "yes!!! great lab! interesting and applicable and no lab reports!",
    "Take it, if you can get in. THis is the only lab at Yale that I have been in where you get to do amazing dissections. There is also no lab reports so there is nothing that feels like busy work. you have to work really hard to do well on the exams, but if you study, you can do well.TAKE IT!",
    "MCDB 241 was a fun and interesting class. Other than going to lab, there is nothing else except for a midterm and a final. You will have to study very hard for both, and even though you will not know everything. Do not let this put you off of the class as you still get a lot out of it. Just make sure that you pay attention during the labs and your grade will be fine. Also, do not take this class if you are squeamish about dissections, mice, or frogs.",
    "Awesome, especially if you like dissections. Some of the techniques were very frustrating, but it's a relaxed enough lab environment that it's not a big deal. People complain a lot about the midterm, but it's really not bad - just memorize everything on the handouts, pictures included, and you'll be fine."
