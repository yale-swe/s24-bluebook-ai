   "comments": [
    "A course for people interested in learning why materials are brittle, ductile, etc. I found it the most interesting engineering course to take at Yale.",
    "This was a decent course--nothing super great about it, nothing super awful. Professor Schwarz is not the most interesting lecturer, but it also was not too difficult, so it all balanced out to be very neutral. I would not recommend the course unless it is required for your MechE course track.",
    "This course is fine. In the scheme of MENG requirements, it's pretty damn easy. If you're looking for a Science distribution requirement, you could find something easier. But also, this course teaches you some interesting stuff about the modern world if you're willing to come to lecture and listen. I won't say whether I recommend it or not because I'm kinda torn.",
    "This class was very disappointing. Though materials science is interesting, the lectures were annoyingly disjointed and the exams were almost silly in relation to what was emphasized in lecture. Udo is an adorable guy but I couldn't help but hate him after getting the first midterm back and realizing that some of the answers he was looking for not only contradicted his lectures but basic chemistry. I wouldn't take it unless its necessary or taught by a different professor.",
    "I would not recommend MENG 285 to another student. This class presented almost no new material after general chemistry and MENG 280, and the lectures were unorganized and boring. All of the material is easy; the class would be far more interesting if it were remotely challenging. I spent at most two hours a week on this class doing problem sets, which were the only way I learned anything. All of the exams were rather arbitrary in terms of material, but also very easy. If you don't have to take this class, I would recommend taking anything else; you will probably get more out of any other class.",
    "It took me a while to appreciate the subject matter in materials science. It may have been because the lectures were based on Power-Point slides, which made me less keen on paying attention during class. It also might have been that Udo's teaching style was different than what I was expecting, I don't think he followed the book as closely. Nonetheless, the slides sometimes helped in studying for the exams. The open ended questions sometimes felt a bit unnecessary, but they were not difficult. The problem sets were not particularly difficult, but could be tedious sometimes. The exams were manageable, considering we were allowed to create our own formula sheet for each exam, which we would turn in at the end of the exam. It was always hard to gauge what material would be on the exam.",
    "Only take it if you are interested in the material. The homework assignments are easy, but the exams are a bit harder if you don't fully understand the material. Would definitely not recommend if you haven't taken chemistry recently.",
    "Not very complicated but very useful course for any MechE, or engineering insterested, student",
    "The demonstrations were fun and some of the material was interesting, but it was alot of basic chemistry which can get pretty dull. The exams were surprisingly difficult given the course material.",
    "This class was pretty standard and not too challenging. It's not out of question to take for non engineers. There's a good mixture of theory and application.",
    "It was a very interesting course, I found - you learn how samurai swords are made and why the first airplanes crashed and how the Pantheon was built. I know a lot of my fellow students were quite bored though and didn't think it necessary to go to class because everything you needed was in the book\/lecture slides. All the answers to problem sets were very easily found online. The midterms weren't too challenging either and it was frustrating that someone who studied a lot would perform equally as well as someone who had put an hour's effort into the class and just printed out all the lecture slides and main formulas onto the cheat sheet: don't overstudy - just not worth it.",
    "Not well taught. A lot of unclear concepts because a lot of information was missed from the book especially in the last few chapters. Classes didn't cover as much as the book and exams. Final was incredibly difficult.",
    "An interesting course which focused on how the properties of certain materials are affected by the microstructure of said material. The lecture can be very insightful if one puts forth a concerted effort, otherwise it will be far to easy to zone out periodically. The homework is primarily based in readings from the textbook, and section is golden if one is having difficult with the problem sets. Go to section and try to get to know Professor Schwarz and the class will be fun and intellectually stimulating.",
    "There are some ME courses that are only meant for ME people, but this one is not. You should take it if you plan to be an architect, ME, or in fact, any type of engineer, because it gives you great insight into the properties of materials. If you are not interested in building stuff though, I would say you might get bored.",
    "It's a fairly painless course. Lectures are very dry as Udo has no gravitas, but if you're interested in the material, there is certainly a lot to learn! The homeworks are reasonable, and the exams, although a bit unpredictable, are not like pulling teeth. This class is required of most ME majors, but it's a solid class to take for those filling up the elective part of the major. Don't be a fool. Go to the review sessions; you can earn up to 5% on top of your final grade by going.",
    "If you're reading this, you probably have to take MatSci. Just make sure you know how to do the homework, and pay attention to the anecdotes.",
    "If you are excited about material science and want to learn about metals, plastics, and composites, then this course is perfect for you and you'll probably enjoy it. Otherwise you will be unhappy."
