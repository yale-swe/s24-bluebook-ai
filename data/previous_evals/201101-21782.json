   "comments": [
    "Unless you're a linguistics major, I wouldn't take it. It's not that it isn't interesting, but the general intensity of the classroom is pretty overwhelming if you're not willing to meet it. Also, the exams are pretty challenging and require a lot of time and thought.",
    "This is an insanely difficult class but the emphasis is really on the learning process and you will learn a totally new approach to language and the brain by the end. This was also very, very scientifically rigorous (as much or more than the Science credits I've taken) and thanks to Professor Pinango I can now read scientific papers with ease and total understanding. It's crucial that you do the reading for each class and really work though the problem sets, but it will pay off ten-fold if you do so and then can follow the discussions. I would 100% recommend this class; it was truly the most interesting thing I've ever learned. The language system is fascinating. I just wish there was another level to take next semester!",
    "If you are passionate about neurolinguistics than absolutely take this class. It is a lot of work, and you should be prepared to do each of the assingned readings multiple times. Professor Pinango's homeworks and other assignments are very difficult, but so worthwhile. Before this class I don't think I ever really learned to read and understand a scientific paper, and that alone made this class worthwhile. Professor Pinango is very intimidating and will take you to task in class if you didn't do your reading carefully enough, but she is brilliant, and so passionate about this work. You may spend a certain percentage of time in this class confused, but that's mostly because the subject material is very complicated and there is rarely a consensus on anything in the field of neurolinguistics. This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and the only 75 minute class I've taken where I haven't felt like I was watching the clock.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to take an in-depth look at what constitutes the human language faculty and how this is represented in the brain. A couple warnings, though: there is a lot of psycholinguistics that you have to do in order to understand the neurolinguistics, so the conversations might not be as neurologically-driven as you might expect. Also, in general, this class is not for the faint of heart. It is very small, and you will be expected to be able to thoroughly dive into the material, usually scholarly articles. Finally, Prof. Pi\u00f1ango has a unique style where she makes you appreciate the complexity of the problem rather than providing temporary solutions for incomplete sets of data. This means that it's very easy to get confused since you have nothing to hang onto for the majority of the course. All that being said, really cool course.",
    "Neurolinguistics was truly an excellent course, and may be my favorite Yale course to date. Prof. Pinango was excellent, the material covered was compelling, and the conclusions made as a class were important to the emerging field of brain\/language relations. I would recommend this class. The basic format is to read and interpret current research in the field and synthesize this material to form a holistic model of the language system. It is a very scientific course (should be listed as SC) and worth every minute of reading. The final project is to create an original experimental proposal, which was a really intuitive, personalized, and beneficial end cap to the body of material covered in the course.",
    "This class was a very thorough and in-depth introduction to the field of Neurolinguistics, and, for some, the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and the brain. The class was very intense, in terms of work and preparation outside of class and level of participation expected in the class. It was also a very intense introduction to reading and analyzing technical research papers, and if you don't have experience with that it might seem overwhelming. I highly recommend this class, but only if you have some Linguistics background already, andare willing to put in a lot of time."
