    "While the course contributed neither to my research nor my knowledge of the profession, it aided me through the 'vale of soul-making.'",
    "I have a better understanding of the chronology and main poets of the British Romantic movement, which -- while not my intended field of study -- has broadened my knowledge of English literature. Knowing some of the main critics of this period (particularly the Yale Romanticists) is also useful, as their criticism is highly influential across a variety of fields in literature."
