    "I would definitely recommend Ital 120 to another student, because it is a fun, relaxing class and you will know Italian by the end of it.",
    "In ITAL 120, you continue learning grammar and building on concepts learned in ITAL 110. At the end of ITAL 120, you will have learned all of Italian grammar. You also get a good look at Italian culture, reading literature and watching movies. It's a really great class that is a bit more laid back than some other language classes.",
    "I would recommend it! It really helps all aspects of your italian and teaches you extremely interesting things about the italian culture."
