   "comments": [
    "This course uses primary literature to explore the topics of sexual selection and social evolution. I would recommend this course to any student interested in either of these topics.",
    "EEB 710 offers a broad overview of the current research in the fields of sexual selection and social evolution. It is discussion led, and takes it's specific form from the interests of the students that are attending it.I would recommend the course to students of evolutionary theory, sexual selection, social evolution, psychology, and animal behavior. However a grounding in most of these fields is necessary to participate in the course. I would not recommend it to students without some knowledge of evolutionary theory and sexual selection.",
    "The class is pretty much what the title says - a survey of sexual selection and social evolution. It's a good orientation to the current state of these fields, and various topics within them. Note that the focus is very much on the biological literature. Within that, there's plenty of flexibility allowed to customise the class readings, topics and project to your interests. Workload is not unreasonably heavy.",
    "I would call this course an indepth discussion of the theory and biology of social interactions in biology, ranging from bacteria to humans. I would recommend it to anyone who wanted to focus on the subject, though would probably be sure to articulate that it is very focused on this one topic. Which was what I was interested in, so was great for me.",
    "A great class that pushes you to learn.",
    "It's a good class if you want to learn about sexual selection and social evolution through reading both classic and newer papers. I would definitely recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me the opportunity to read more broadly in both my own and closely associated fields. Because of the breadth of knowledge amongst the course participants, even topics with which I was familiar from my own research were approached from novel angles.The discussions from the course aided in clarifying the approach I wish to take to one of my thesis chapters, and the ideas that I took away from the course may also become the introduction to my dissertation.",
    "Very good grounding, provided excellent familiarity with the current literature in the field, including topics of interest and outstanding questions. Very helpful.",
    "This course was very useful for me as I am working on mate behavior and social interactions and also made it possible for me to take some literature I had not read and apply it both to my current area of study and the research I was conducting during the three years prior to the beginning of my PhD. I found the reading and discussions a useful framework for some of the research I am now doing."
