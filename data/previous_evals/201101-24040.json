   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Yes.",
    "Mostly. Love the sanders in the shop.I still plead with the school to have the library let us take out more than one book at a time! I am not a huge fan of the one day lending but I would even be okay with that if only we could take more than one home at night!! Especially when our hours extend so long after the library closes!!!!",
    "There should be a budget for the final projects for this class. It is a bit ridiculous to require students to build enormous models out of expensive basswood after they are already broke at the end of the semester.",
    "yes.",
    "In the end, yes, although the shop situation got hairy.",
    "Yes. Except, having a course-reader option would have been greatly appreciated. Hunting down, printing out and binding all of the PDFs is arduous and equally as expensive as a course reader or even requiring the purchase of some of the more heavily relied-on books.",
    "The Library lending period is too short nor does it have enough copies of key texts that are often used by students. Relative to other comparable institutions, the Arts library falls very short.",
    "The final project resulted in a very high cost for everybody. It seemed though while everybody ended up producing very beautiful work, the cost of the model and the intricacies\/time required of it was not a sufficient price for the amount of payoff it provided. Much of it was just how to represent a detail section in model, and much less in understanding how these details work and how the components relate to each other and why.",
    "The final model needs to be coordinated with the shop. It was a bit of a disaster this year because there were no shop monitors available when we need to be cranking on these models.",
    "For next semester, a budget should be considered for the students final projects. The vast majority of the projects were over $200, a serious strain on a students budget.",
    "My final model cost upwards of $500. I believe this financial burden to be unfair for a non-studio class.",
    "Trying to work in the shop while shop monitors were not scheduled was not conducive and added unnecessary complications to an already frustrating assignment. It would be better if the project were due sooner rather than the day that school has officially ended and is no longer in session.",
    "The required resources were too expensive for students living on government loans."
