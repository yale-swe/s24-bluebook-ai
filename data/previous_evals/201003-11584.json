    "The class started off with a boom, and I was certain I was going to learn a lot about technology, society and the environment through the course of the semester. I was on track to be correct in the beginning, but the last 4 classes or so were entirely focused on the students in the class editing the professor's manuscript...i.e., doing the work of PhD students, but unpaid. I wouldn't have minded this so much if I felt like I was actually learning something, but the manuscript was choppy, difficult to read, and oftentimes redundant with material we'd already covered in the class (before ever touching the manuscript).I also didn't like the class space. It was too hot in the early weeks, and the lighting was conducive to headaches and feeling tired. I would have preferred a newer and more professional classroom.I did enjoy the intimacy engendered by the class size (14 students), and Arnulf made us more comfortable with him and each other by hosting a bonding dinner of sorts at his home. He's clearly very experienced and accomplished in this field (and very quantitatively-inclined), so any student would benefit from a conversation with him on technology in the energy space.",
    "Overall, the course was informative about technological development and energy. The course needed to have more structure and clearer expectations regarding graded material. It would have been nice to have focused on more significant energy readings outside the KM-24.The TA certainly showed favoritism to his friends in the class regarding graded assignments, which was inappropriate.",
    "The first half of the class was fantastic but when we started to read the KM24 and the class become an editing session every week, the class no longer held much value for anyone by Arnulf.",
    "This is a very popular course with a good, well-deserved reputation. Many students showed up for the first class because there was so much interest. This first class was primarily spent giving student introductions. In the future, I would recommend using this class time to actually give a lecture and have a discussion similar to what will be done in subsequent classes.This will help students make a more informed decision about applying to the course.",
    "The readings and cases were a good way to gain insight into innovation and diffusion.",
    "Interesting topic to learn, but sometimes there are overlaps and the Professor is repetitive. Having an oral midterm is non-sense. Prof. Grubler should stop that: what's the point of memorizing things?"

    "Annulf's expertise and the initial readings.",
    "The professor challenged students' responses and gave ideas for projects. His challenges also made me a little nervous to speak in class, but overall I think this was a good thing. It would be good for me to become more used to this kind of on the spot challenging.",

   "comments": [
    "More engaged students who bring energy to the class; class time not used to edit the professor's upcoming publication; a final class dedicated to key takeaways at the end of the semester. Momentum really fell off over the 8 weeks.",
    "The second half of the course, where students did more of the discussion-leading. I don't learn as much when students are leading the class. It would have been nicer if Prof. Grubler led the entire second half, or portions of it, rather than leaving it all up to us.",
    "Professor Grubler can be seem intimidating and in fact sometimes be intimidating. He is in fact quite open to discussion, but it can be difficult to get comfortable.Jargon was sometimes a barrier to understanding.Could be a little more encouraging of students.He didn't always like it when he wasn't right or didn't have an answer to a problem or question. Would often eventually get to admitting it, but took a darn long time.",
    "More direction ahead of time on projects. Arnulf loves leaving it to students to figure out the deliverable. There's certainly some merit in the idea in some situations but more clarity on expectations would help quite a bit. Otherwise, we end up off the mark and unable to gain all he'd like us to from the exercises. In particular, having a better understanding of the LSM program before we worked on our projects would have been a huge help.",
    "The class is a seminar but there was never a discussion (the class was not taught differently than ESA) in class-- just Arnulf lecturing.",
    "Clearer expectations given for assignments. Details for assignments often were not written down and\/or were changed mid-assignment. This made it more difficult to prepare what was expected.",
    "Keeping lectures more within time constraints.",
    "The classes and discussions are sometimes too long. Professors goes beyond the class time, even having a 3-hour slot. We didn't talk about the environment much, I don't even know why is it in the course title.We spent and excessively amount of time reviewing a manuscript of an upcoming compilation oif case studies that made the latter half of the course extremely tedious: we would go line by line making comments on an unedited draft version. We should had used the class and assignment time on other things. I don't think we should had spent that much time doing that."

    "Both were very responsive to my questions, although the TA had never before taken the course, and was therefore learning it at the same time as us.",

    "I'm focused on energy development. This course provides a big picture backdrop to energy\/technological development cycles which is hugely important in thinking about appropriate policy responses to any desired environmental outcome involving technology.",
    "This course exposed me to different ways ofthinking about technology. Having completed the course, I think this understanding of how business and policy can support technology and how technology in turn shapes society will be useful to me, just to improve my understanding of the effects of certain policies.I had a lot of difficulty in the beginning of the course, because I did not understand how we could have discussions about the topics in the papers we read about. To me they seemed very matter of fact, more like texts on history. Here is what happened, and that was that. I did not see the areas that were not matter of fact, or how one could discuss them. In this way the course has opened my eyes to these points.",

    "Because it seemed interesting about the first class and was focused on energy. I thought contributing to the development of KM24 would be an interesting experience.",

    "The material was not what I had expected. I probably would have opted to take a different class had I realized this before the 3rd seminar. It was a very good class, though. I feel the value of the class depends greatly on how much work and preparation students put into it.",
