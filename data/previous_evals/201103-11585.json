    "A good introduction to Classical Japanese Literature. Some of the readings might offend your sense of decency, but the course is still absolutely worth taking -- the waka poetry, especially, though overshadowed in the West by later haiku, is a real joyto read.",
    "If you're interested in Japanese literature at all, this is where to start.",
    "The reason why I took this class was because I thought it presented a cool opportunity to experience Yale's resources in the humanities\u0097Beinecke, Art Gallery\u0097in relation to Japan. This course fulfilled my expectations in that regard. The content of the class spanned the centuries and across genres and disciplines, and for this reason, I believe the instructor was expecting the course to appeal to a broader student audience. But the class remained small, probably because of the Japan focus. If it were larger, its somewhat impersonal nature would be understandable and acceptable, but I thought it was unacceptable that I did not know the names of my 9 classmates even after I turned in the second paper. It would have been nice to have known my classmates' backgrounds and why they had decided to take this course. I think that knowledge would have helped facilitate a stronger sense of community within class and thus, more lively discussions. I suppose a discussion-based seminar was not what theprofessor was expecting to have, either. Despite that complaint, this survey, interdisciplinary course was challenging and provided brief, thorough looks into works of Japanese literature and related art from the 10th century to the 19th century. Professor Kamens was always open to students' questions and ideas and provided helpful feedback when formulating ideas for the three papers. A note: make sure to edit your paper THOROUGHLY before submission! Quality and accuracy of writing is definitely taken into account during grading. In the original syllabus, the class had some time devoted to workshopping, which would have been helpful...",
    "Yes",
    "Japanese 200 is a great survey of Japan's classics. Discussion of the translated works is almost always accompanied by interesting, authentic visuals--often examined in real life. The course is a great opportunity to see in person and learn about some of the amazing works of art and literature in Yale's collections. The main possible negative of the class is that the level of scholarship expected from the students might be slightly unrealistic and difficult to live up to when dealing with the subject matter in translation, especially without any background in any East Asian art or literature. As this is a writing credit course, the standards in that area are also very high, and while I feel that my writing skills improved greatly, the same cannot be said about my self-esteem. Overall, Professor Kamens does a great job lecturing and leading discussion; he is a true expert in the field--a fact that manifests itself in the course in a slightly intimidating yet very positive way."
