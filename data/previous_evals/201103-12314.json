    "I took this course to decide if I wanted to be premed. I hadn't taken bio science freshman year of high school. This was not an obstacle. I did well in the course by just keeping up with the reading. I learned I didn't want to be a premed, but I think that if you want to be a doctor you better hope you like this course. And for me it was a good way to determine if I would like being a doctor.",
    "Yes, its hard but so useful. you learn a lot that is really useful for medical school (i mean you are using a med school textbook). Dont take it if you can't devote time to it. But if you can, I bet you wont regret the class at all!",
    "Absolutely!I felt the pace was fast, but reasonable. Lecture notes and slides are provided, so you can spend the class looking at the slides\/diagrams\/graphs without transcribing anything. Weekly Friday quizzes are not graded, and mostly to encourage you to review the lectures and tell you if you are behind. Lecturers were great for an MCDB course.I know I did much less work than most people (I only attended lectures and studied the 2 days before an exam), but to me it wasn't that much work. Test questions are very fair, and many of the intricacies aren't tested, just a general understanding of how each system works.As a warning, towards the end (last 2 weeks), the pace picked up and it was harder...",
    "Take this if you need for a major or are really interested in learning physiology. Otherwise, don't bother. It's a lot of work.",
    "SUCH A GOOD CLASS. We covered pretty much the whole book, which was approximately 30 chapters per exam, but it was much more manageable than it sounds. I learned so much, and it is such applicable material. I have nothing but good things to say about this class.",
    "This course covers all the major organ systems of the human body. I would recommend espeically for persons interested in medicine.",
    "Absolutely take this course.",
    "Definitely take it. Great introduction to physiology, and really convinced me that I wanted to go to medical school.",
    "Definitely take this course! Lectures were really fascinating, and I found myself thinking about what I was learning in class all the time just because the information is so relevant. The course is an overview of the major physiological systems, with a different lecturer (all of whom are great) for each system. The reading was definitely helpful for the cardio lectures, but is otherwise not entirely necessary.",
    "Great course. So much learning. Take it! Definitely worthwhile.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT!! PREMED OR NOT, THIS IS THE MOST AMAZING CLASS EVER!",
    "Great preparation for the MCAT, if you're pre-med. You don't need to get or read the book. Just go to class and section and you'll be fine. Warning though: pretty intense pre-med-angst-fueled-curve. Saltzman is great.",
    "yes...great course. learn so much",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any life science major, it really teaches you pretty much everything you'd want to know about the human body in great detail.",
    "Excellent biology course, I had an amazing experience with it! It is a lot of material but really interesting.",
    "This is a fantastic class if you want to learn all about how the human body works! Some lecturers are better than others, but you come out of it with an amazing understanding of many complex organ systems. I found the textbook to be really readable, especially since you can skip over the sections not mentioned in lecture. I'm not a huge fan of exams that are all multiple choice\/TF, but the questions were definitely fair.",
    "Yes. Even if it's not a requirement.",
    "This course covers different body systems. The material is very interesting. The tests are multiple choice and not too hard. There's a lot of reading but it's not required.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to other students. You learn a lot, but also have to be prepared to do a lot of outsidework. I didn't ever want to miss a class, they were so interesting. All of the lecturers were great, and I never even had trouble staying awake for the 9:25 meeting time.",
    "It's a pretty difficult course with alot of memorization. That being said, a lot of the material is pretty interesting. Basically, you get out of it what you put into it. I don't recommend it for freshmen or sophomores (unless they're pretty well versed in biology), but it's definitely doable if you're willing to work hard.",
    "If you have to take this class, then of course you're taking it. It's difficult. There's a lot of material. You'll get through it. Try to get Nicole as your TF.If you don't have to take this class, then you should take it only if you're very interested in physiology. The workload is low, but there is a lot of material. If you're premed it might help to take this class.",
    "Yes. Very nice way to learn Physio. Also... perfect for Mcat studying.",
    "Definitely. Even if it's not for your major, I think this is a class everyone should take. It's a lot of memorization, but fascinating material and makes you appreciate how the body works.",
    "Yup, even if you are not Premed, it is still super interesting to know how the human body works. This is not really a guy class, or something you can just jump into if you don't have at least some biology back ground.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but you also learn a lot. I would definitely recommend this class to others.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "this was a good class. i would recommend it if you're pre-med. it's not too difficult, but make sure you stay ahead of the curve.",
    "Yes! Definitely for anyone, because it's all very important stuff.",
    "It's an ok class. If he's around, trust me you want Sascha as your TA.You learn a lot of cool stuff, although some lectures are awesome and some are kind of bad.",
    "This class looks at the physiology of several body systems in detail (like, cellular detail) and is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. The subject matter is really interesting and the class is generally very well taught- there's a series of guest lecturers for each body system, some of whom are better lecturers than other. The workload isn't light but is definitely manageable- a couple of chapters of reading per week, a weekly online quiz, and 2 multiple choice\/true-false midterms. Take it!",
    "I would highly recommend this course. It helps a lot when it comes to MCAT studying and also in general understanding the mechanisms behind the body. But, be prepared to work a lot before the final. The midterms are manageable but there is a lot of material by the end!",
    "Physio is a great class. There is a ton of material to learn, but it is all fairly interesting, and the professors do their best to connect it to disease states.",
    "It's alright. MC\/TF exams and a pset every weekend. Not too much work, but SUPER broad subject matter and because of this, you don't really get a thorough understanding of any one system.",
    "This class is for premeds. It throws a lot of information at you and really does expect it ALL to be memorized. If that is not your learning style you will be disappointed. The material is good. The expectations are bad.",
    "Pros-really interesting material whether you're pre-med, a bme major, or just a person interested in how your body works. I learned a ton of interesting\/cool stuff.-you learn an immense amount.-some of the lecturers are really good and legit (saltzman and aronson)-weekly psets aren't too bad if you've gone too lecture and they help you stay on top of the material-some focus on interesting processes and interplay of effects, dynamics, etc.Cons-the class is at 9:25 (AM!!), even on fridays (i missed this class on more than one occasion) (fortunately, the lectures are posted online but can be kinda tough to catch up)-some lectures are hard to follow or too detailed (bolpaep)-psets can kind of time consuming, especially if you missed a class or two that week.-you learn an immense amount (yea, you have to learn andmemorize a lot of content)-while there is an emphasis on understanding the material you still need to memorize a ton of stuff (nights before the exams involved lots of cramming and caffeine and little sleep). Fortunately that's only 3 nights all semester (2 midterms and a final)-Pre-med curve. not sure the curve is that bad but some kids in this class will work their butts off and know EVERYTHING so if you want to be relaxed, it might be worth taking Cr\/D",
    "It is a fantastic course, where you learn so much! Yes I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Great class if you are interested in pure human biology. A lot of time but great payoff. Professors were generally good and lecture notes were helpful. Good TAs.",
    "I would recommend physio to another student who wishes to learn about physio, it is a fun subject. You learn a lot, and there is a lot of reading (you learn a lot about the subject, its insane). Tests aren't too hard, but they are not easy, Interested in being pre-med, take this class, it allows you to know what's going on.",
    "This class takes you through all the major organ systems of the body and gives a moderately in depth overview of each process. Its a lot of work, but worth it if you can conquer the material. It is a great way to sample if being premed is what you really want to do. This class is the closest you will get to med school while at Yale. If you are like omg this stuff is boring\/hard\/your mind just isn't built to look at things this way - reconsider being premed. So good either way.",
    "I would without a doubt recommend this class to anyone who is interested in physiology. It's the best.",
    "I would not recommend taking BENG 350. Unless bio is truly your thing, this class will mean a lot of memorization without a great payoff.",
    "Great. Take it if you plan on being premed, but make sure you dedicate enough time to it.",
    "This course is very interesting and you learn a lot of information about how the body systems function. This course was very demanding and I had to spend a lot of time studying for the exams. However, it was really interesting and worth taking if you like to learn about the body. So I would recommend this class if you are willing to dedicate a lot of time studying detailed information.",
    "Physio is a lot of work but if you spend a lot of time memorizing the lectures and reading Costanzo's physiology book (NOT Boron and Boulpaep) you will do very well. Also get some sleep before your exams. Dumb mistakes make the difference in this class. Further this class is as clinical as they get in college and gives an exciting taste of medical school.",
    "If you are a premed, you should DEFINITELY take this class before you graduate. It has been my favorite science class at Yale. The material is fascinating, the class is very well-organized, the professors are all experts and very dynamic lecturers, and the tests are very fair. I also strongly recommend this course to any MB&B majors because it encompasses not only anatomy, but also biophysical concepts that underly cellular structure and function. Also, try to get Sascha as a TA... he's excellent!",
    "Physiology is a great course which examines the human body in depth. I recommend that you've taken an advanced bio course before, as there is a lot to know. The material is fascinating, but the book is way too obscure to understand without a lot of help from your TA. You have a quiz every week (very chill since you get full credit if you go to section), and there are two exams and a final. Be careful on the exams, since reading over a question too quickly, even if you know the material well, can cost you. Thereare six different professors which are all very knowledgeable about their subjects. Professor Saltzman is very reasonable. GET NICOLE AS YOUR TA, or at least get notes from her section.",
    "it is hard, a lot of material and a lot of memorising. but if you study and really stay on top of it at all times you might be fine. you have a quiz every week but you get 100% if you go to section even if you did not get full points on the grading also that is 20% of your class so that helps. It is not easy but if you try hard you should be fine",
    "Take it if you're a pre-med to get a taste of what a medical school class is like. It isn't a medical school class. It's a baby one. If you're interested in the body, you'll love it!",
    "Physiology is one of the more interesting bio courses, at least to me, since it is so macro and applicable. Yes, you have to take the time to figure out the graphs and memorize the hormones, but it is really very reasonable. The exams are reasonable (averages were around 83) and the problem sets were not killers. The material is well taught by each lecture. People always ask: do you need to read the book. I used the book mainly as a reference when I didn't understand a slide in teh lecture, and I didn't really use the extra notes each professor gave, though many people did. Don't try to read the book comprehensively: it covers way more than you need to know, which teh professor make clear in the first week fo class.",
    "This is one of the best MCDB courses available. It's essentially diet-med school. You will learn a lot and (most likely) enjoy the course. Make sure you have plenty of time to review for the midterms and finals. Prepare to spontaneously start diagnosing your friends whenever they have ailments on completion of this class.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I really liked the way that each system was taught by an expert in that field, and all of the material was fascinating. However, I do feel that most of the material was presented in lecture in a way that made it seem much more complicated that it actually was. And the textbook had this same problem; it was way too dense and detailed and didn't allow the student to learn the important ideas and concepts. However, this was still a wonderful class and I would highly recommend it - especially to people who think that they want to become doctors.",
    "If you have any interest at all in the human body, you need to take this course. It's basically a crash course in basic physiology, and easily one of the best science courses I've taken in my 3 years at Yale. The workload is significant but totally worth it: 2 exams plus weekly quizzes online. The material is such a refreshing break from the pure memorization that was required for so many other science course. I HIGHLY recommend this course!!",
    "This is a really interesting class with great professors! Be sure to read the textbook before lecture so that you get the most out of lecture. Also, be sure to get a full night's rest before the tests, they can be tricky.",
    "Great class! Lots of material but very interesting!",
    "AMAZING CLASS! One of my favorite classes at Yale of all time. The profs are great, the lectures are almost always interesting, and there's a lot of studying and memorization, but the tests are really fair. It's amazing to be able to put together all this physiology knowledge and I came away from the class really satisfied at how much I learned. It really helps to have taken Cell Bio.",
    "The class is very interesting if you're interested in medical stuff, but it's a huge amount of information. If you want to do well, plan on spending a lot of time reading the textbook (which is absurdly thick). The class is also way too early in the morning when you consider how much information the professors are trying to plow through, but the lectures were at least usually interesting. I would recommend the class overall, especially if it was a little later in the day.",
    "Take it if you want a more in depth look at the body! That being said, it's a lot to keep up with. It's a difficult course because it's not only a ridiculous amount of material, but it's a ridiculous amount of complicated material.",
    "take it if you need to - expect to cover a lot of material. don't bother reading B+B. read the costanzo physiology textbook and just use B+B for figure references",
    "Worth the pain - get a good TA. Heard it helps for when studying for the MCAT.",
    "Yes, required for BME major.",
    "Yes- definitely recommend. All the instructors were great lecturers and the material was really cool. Two midterms, one final, weekly online quizzes, and mandatory weekly sections. Overall a reasonable workload for such a broad subject area. I had some Neuro background so that section was somewhat of a review for me, but even then some of the information was new even if you've taken Neurobio. Part of me wishes they had time to cover the immune system -- maybe a day or two. There is a ton of information in the course, but an emphasis on understanding concepts and function rather than memorizing anatomy, which worked really well. Premeds -- highly recommend, as this will help with both the MCATs and med school.",
    "For anyone interested in premed, biology of biomedical engineering this course provides a very thorough understanding of the major systems of the body. Great lectures, professors and teaching assistants. Take this course!"
