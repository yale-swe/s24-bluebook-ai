    "I learned how to craft a long research project\/paper by constructing it piece by piece from all of the necessary elements. Feedback and discussion of our research ideas was useful as it shed insight on holes, potential forms of biases, and other issues with my research that I could address early on in the writing process.",
    "Planning research design and question, literature review, providing feedback on other's work.",
    "This class improved my research skills and facilitated my thesis writing process.",
    "This class was helpful in learning how to narrow down a research question, and was extremely helpful in making sure that I was accountable to someone other than myself to set deadlines and continuously be working on producing pages.",
    "This class has given me the tools necessary to write my thesis - mostly in the form of support and set deadlines to keep me motivated."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class kept me on a solid timeline for completing my thesis, with its deadlines and assignments throughout the semester. Further, being able to receive feedback from professors and classmates on my research and progress thus far was a really valuable component of the process that wouldn't have been possible without this class. I will say, though, that while it was useful to get feedback, it felt like a lot of the feedback we would get from other students was kind of partial and flawed simply because the feedback process didn't facilitate a real in-depth engagement with other students' work.",
    "I liked the course!",
    "The professors are super attentive and it was helpful to have a weekly check in on the thesis writing process.",
    "It would be helpful to have a bit more structure in the spring semester of Junior year, so that students who might be interested in doing research have a bit more structure going into the summer. I think the size of the colloquium was really nice, and having the smaller groups of 4 was really helpful in that you get to know other people's projects.",
    "The main purpose of the course is to guide seniors through the thesis process, which it does a good job with. Had the different deadlines not been there I think I would not have worked on my thesis nearly as much. Having the peer review groups is also really interesting as other students have different perspectives than professors. I really wish that this colloquium had existed during Junior Spring, because I would have been much more productive on my thesis over the summer."

    "Yes. Without it, I would feel much more lost on my senior thesis.",
    "Yes - it's required for all EVST majors.",
    "This is the senior thesis colloquium for the environmental studies major. only EVST majors take this course.",
    "Having this colloquium was really helpful in making sure that I was working on my thesis in manageable quantities, and had multiple people to bounce ideas off of.",
    "This is a required course for all EVST majors, but I'm actually really grateful that it exists - it makes a big different in breaking up the thesis process and making it feel more manageable. The Adirondack trip was also a highlight of my semester, and it's fun to get to know the other EVST seniors."
