    "The class is an overview of different approaches regarding the politics of language. There was one class focused on theory and the rest were about case studies of various language situations around the world.I would recommend this class only if you are very interested in the social and political aspects of language use.",
    "if you're an anthropology major and are looking to fulfill your language distribution requirement.... don't take this class. take himalayan languages with turin or something else. the readings for the class are all really interesting but errington is a terrible seminar leader and class was often painfully boring. linguistic anthropology is really interesting and i found the theories and material interesting, but the discussion really fell flat.",
    "Good course for understanding sociology and politics of language"
