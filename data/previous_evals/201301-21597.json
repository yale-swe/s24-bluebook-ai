    "Take the class--the material is so interesting and has illuminated to me so many important events going on in the world today. It connected well to the other environmental studies class and econ class I was taking. I'm able to discuss origins of domestic abuse from our chimpanzee ancestors, development problems in the Mayan Biosphere Preserve, to economic implications of demography. The class incorporates a really good mixture of overall theory and casestudies. Professor Wyman has an incredible amount of life experience--he really adds a personal touch to the class. Plus he's always willing to help and get to know you on a more personal level. Be warned though--there is a lot of reading. It's manageable, but can be a serious struggle to get through some weeks.",
    "A good class overall. If you like looking for a simple class that helps you understand the world better, take this course.",
    "It is a good basic understanding of human evolution and human behavior over time.",
    "Yes. You'll encounter new issues from a variety of perspectives. If you need a class to be uber-structured, this probably isn't for you. But as an interesting 5th class to get you to consider some new topics and how they interact with different areas of academics and policy... yes."
