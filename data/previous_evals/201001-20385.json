    "I would certainly recommend it, because I think the material is extremely important, and too often overlooked, by American historians.",

    "I'd absolutely recommend it -- for any Americanist, as well as any historian interested in indigenous peoples or empires more broadly.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in Indian history or Western history. But beyond that, I would recommend it to anyone interested in the history of empire. This is a course that will open your mind to the fundamental transfers of land, people, and ideas that history is all about no matter what part of the world or time period you are studying.",

    "Reading list would work well as an oral exam field",
    "The course provided some background knowledge that underpins my dissertation and offered me the basis I need to do more in-depth research. It taught meabout the the historiography of the field and gave me a sense of where it's moving. I mapped out a particular sub-field through the paper. Maximum contribution.",
    "This course was perhaps the most important course I have taken at Yale, given how its questions and discussions will continue to shape my future scholarship. I feel lucky to have been doing coursework when Yale brought Prof. Blackhawk aboard!!!"
