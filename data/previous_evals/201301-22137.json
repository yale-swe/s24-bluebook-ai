   "comments": [
    "The course is great if you keep up with the reading. Here's my suggestion: if you are blue booking far enough in advance - read War and Peace over winter break and then read Anna Karenina over spring break.",
    "Take it!!! The reading can be a lot, so if you're worried about keeping up perhaps take it Credit\/D. Fantastic lectures, fantastic professor, fantastic (but a lot of) reading.",
    "recommended if interested in Tolstoy...",
    "I would recommend LITR 206 but I don't think it's a course you HAVE to take. I almost think that I would have gotten just as much out of War& Peace and Anna Karenina without going to lecture, but I would simply not have been able to get through these two tomes without the structure of the course. Lectures were good, not mind-blowing, but they definitely informed the text.",
    "I took this class because it had gotten rave reviews on OCI. I don't quite understand why it got those reviews. The class was fine but totally uninspiring. The lectures were very repetitive (though Tolstoy's repetitive, so maybe that shouldn't come as such a surprise). It's good to read Tolstoy, but this is definitely not the life-changing class it's billed as. Also, it is of course a ton of reading. If you do take it, start the reading early or you likely won't keep up.",
    "Most definitely. The work is typical of a normal course, and the final exam is actually a pleasure to take. Lectures are wonderful - Professor Alexandrov sheds light on Tolstoy's masterpieces in a way that is truly remarkable and delightful.",
    "This is such a wonderful class. I took it Credit\/D and so didn't have to worry much about the grades, and so I did the readings without a pen, just to enjoy them. I ended up getting more out of this class than many of the classes that I take for a grade.",
    "yes!",
    "Good class for an introduction on how to look at literature...",
    "Take this course if you feel up to\/have time to actually read War and Peace and Anna Karenina. They are great novels, Professor Alexandrov is AMAZING, and the lectures are great, but it is a TON of reading!",
    "I very much enjoyed LITR206. The class is definitely not to be taken lightly--the reading workload is fairly intense (we are talking 'War and Peace' and 'Anna Karenina' here) but totally manageable with good time management. Lectures were extremely insightful and gave novel insight into both great works. Professor Alexandrov is a genius andobviously well-versed in Tolstoy. Just a preemptive warning: Professor Alexandrov also preaches Tolstoyan philosophy, you may well find yourself becoming a convert at the end of the course...",
    "Phenomenal class that will really turn you into a fan of Tolsoy and inspire you to read more Russian literature!",
    "Yes, because it really does give a great foundation in Tolstoy. But you have to be willing to commit to it. I wasn't really.",
    "A great course. A wonderul way to read some of the best literature ever written.",
    "My favorite class! The lectures are wonderful, the syllabus is dreamy, and it's like twice-weekly storytime. So rewarding.",
    "If you are curious to read a historic author like Tolstoy and you enjoy reading fiction and philosophy, this is your class. This was the only literature course I took at Yale. The lectures were enjoyable, as long as you do the reading. Definitely take this class if you think you can do 300+ pages of fiction reading per week. For some, that's a burden. For others, that's a guilty pleasure. I was in the middle, yet I still thought the class was 'very good.'",
    "Absolutely. Maybe take it credit D so you don't have to worry about all the reading \/ weird grading TFs, but definitely take it.",
    "A great lecture class with great readings. The readings are a somewhat heavy load, but they're the reason to take the course, as well as Professor Alexandrov's lectures. You can read Tolstoy's works at any time, but this course provides the unique opportunity to read Tolstoy's great novels while getting a greater understanding of them from excellent lectures.",
    "A course that has a lot of coursework---reading the main works of Tolstoy---yet the course works is very fun. I learnt truly a lot, about history, philosophy and about the world of mechanisms that Tolstoy's created. Very rewarding.",
    "If you want an exposure to Tolstoy, this is a nice overview class.",
    "A MUST TAKE. This class will change your life. While there certainly is a lot of reading to keep up with, if you manage to finish all of the texts, you will feel so proud of yourself. Alexandrov is an unbelievably knowledgeable Tolstoy scholar and you will learn so, so much from him. The grading on the papers can be tough so make sure you start them well in advance and coordinate with your TA.",
    "This course is basically a mechanism for letting a brilliant reader in Prof. Alexandrov talk about Tolstoy. His words are, moreover, well worth hearing.",
    "Yep! It's a lot of fun to have Tolstoy reading to do in the middle of the semester.",
    "Very interesting course. Not too much work, but a lot of reading every weak. You get through a lot of material, so you don't dig deep into every piece. There are, though, wide subjects that are touched upon and analyzed in different pieces, so these are talked about extensively.",
    "Absolutely! You'll struggle through some tough literature, but when else in your life are you going to be able to read this stuff without the guidance of an incredible scholar like Professor Alexandrov?!That was my rationale to take this course even as a non-humanities major. That said, if you aren't usually a lit\/humanities person, I'd HIGHLY recommend credit\/D -- the reading moves REALLY quickly and the paper grading is TOUGH.",
    "It's amazing. Definitely read war and peace over winter break and Anna karenina over spring break though because it's really easy to get really behind on the reading.",
    "Take this class! Tolstoy's works of literature are amazing, and Alexandrov is the best person at Yale to filter Tolstoy's literature into insightful lectures. But do all the readings and participate in sections. You'll get so much more out of class that way.",
    "YES TAKE IT. One of my favorite classes I've taken.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU LEAVE YALE. It's one of the best lectures I've taken here - and I've taken pretty much all of the \"must take\" Yale lectures out there. Alexandrov is fantastic; he knows more about Tolstoy than Tolstoy himself probably did, and he's a pleasure to listen to. I took this class Credit\/D and still took copious notes because I wanted to remember every wonderful word he said. Plus, everyone should read W+P and Anna K. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This course is a terrific survey of Tolstoy's major works with a Professor who knows them well! In addition to recognizing the trends and themes that pervade Tolstoy's life and writings you will learn to explore the paradoxes they contain. I highly recommend this class to anyone who loves literature."
