    "Yes.",
    "All resources were available and functional - but the course budget needs to be greater (even more so than for other fabrication electives).",
    "The shop was of course a fabulous resource. I did have to buy my own sewing machine for the upholstery but otherwise the lab downstairs more than met my needs. The $200 budget is entirely too low for the type of pieces that are expected in the class.",
    "Yes.",
