   "comments": [
    "The title is pretty bland, but this class offered an interesting and refreshingly frank look at democracy promotion. The class is well designed and Professor Blair knows his stuff, having worked for USAID and democracy promotion consultancies for years. If you have any interest whatsoever in going into a related field, you owe it to yourself to check this class out. It's not the best I've taken at Yale, but it offers a nice counterbalance of realism and practicality to all of the idealism\/theories you get in a lot of Polisci courses.",
    "This is a decent class. You learn a lot about democracy promotion in a whole host of countries. The class was small, and so we could all participate well in seminar. The reading was substantial, but not too dense. I would recommend this class if the idea of democracy promotion is attractive to you, and if you have a good idea for a final project.",
    "A Great Class if you're interesting in learning about both the why's and how's of democracy-promotion by agencies from the USAID to the Soros Institute to the UN. You get lots of case studies to go through, and the readings while dense at the beginning evolve toward a highly interesting (often amusing) m\u00e9lange of USAID reports and scholarship written by democracy-promotion practicioners such as Diamond, Klitgaard, and Carothers.Harry Blair is deeply knowledgeable on the matter, and he'll tell you plenty of exciting personal takes of his many trips to study and work in democracy-promotion in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.",
    "The class offers an interesting angle on a popular topic, looking at foreign aid programs and not just the development itself. Professor Blair is great \u0097 he is extremely well-versed in the subject and takes a real interest in his students.",
    "Interesting course that synthesizes democracy theory with democracy promotion practice. Prof. Blair is really nice, super-chill, and has a background as both an academic and field worker for USAID\/other similar groups. Only grades are participation and a 20-pg final paper, so it's a low stress class. I'd recommend it if you're at all interested in democracy promotion abroad, but if you're not, you'll probably be bored.",
    "A good overview of USAID and development. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Only people who are genuinely interested in development should take it. Otherwise, you'll never do the readings (there's a fair amount)."
