   "comments": [
    "In Anthropology 501, you do a close reading of some of the key foundational texts in social science. It is an excellent course for developing an understand of these foundations and gaining insights into how they have influenced contemporary social theory. My sense is that many scholars do not or cannot make these links and would likely benefit from this course. I would recommend it to anyone in any social science field.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for any student interested in classical social theory.",
    "Anthropology and Classical Social Theory provides a foundation for contemplating the great questions of the discipline: What is society? What is the individual's role in society? How do we grapple with human agency within social structures? As a consequence of the course, you will become intimate with Marx, Weber, and Durkheim and discover which of the greats you, personally, wish to become most familiar with. Regardless of who you select, all will inform your reading and writing in anthropology and beyond.",
    "This course is a must for anyone interested in seriously engaging with social theory."

    "very helpful to think about dissertation questions",
    "I left the course with a much deeper understanding of the \"roots\" of my field and some of the different traditions within it. I am not sure if it will be directly relevant to my research, but it will likely indirectly influence how I read, observe, and interpret my own work and that of others.",
    "Coming from the humanities, I find this course as a helpful introduction into the practice of \"social science.\"",
    "This course was imperative to my understanding of anthropology. While the texts we covered may not represent the most cutting edge of contemporary social theory, I am convinced that the familiarity I gained with foundational works in social theory through this course will highly contribute to my own dissertation research.",
    "Although I had read smatterings of Durkheim and Marx before the course, I had never read their writings in full, nor had I tackled Weber. This course gave me the space and time to contemplate all three of these founding figures and develop my thoughts on the benefits of their analyses to my own research interests. The rewards of this class are already apparent. Now whenever I read a reference to Marx, Weber, or Durkheim I am able to critically evaluate the author's use of their theories and judge for myself the validity of their arguments. This is not only empowering, but evidence of my growth as a student of anthropology. Without this course, I doubt I would feel as confident.",
    "This course was extremely useful for deepening my knowledge of social theory and its application to the discipline of anthropology."
