    "Advanced Acting is great for anyone interested and with each teacher offers a very different and, I've found, incredibly rewarding viewpoint. I particularly encourage people to take this class with Professor Margolin if they get a chance.",
    "TAKE IT!! It's a comprehensive acting class, one of the few practical courses offered and Deb is one of the professors at Yale that you cannot miss the opportunity to take a class with."
