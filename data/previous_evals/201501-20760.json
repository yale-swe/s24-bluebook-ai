    "This class is a traditional Latin prose composition class with emphasis on stylistics. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in improving their Latin reading skills through composition.",
    "I would only recommend it to another student if he or she had ample time in his or her schedule. I was taken aback by the amount of time necessary to complete the work, which seemed to increase as the semester went on. Also, I feel that the expectations for the final were not adequately communicated, leading to a misuse of studying time."

    "Latin prose composition is a rite of passage for the field, and I am very happy to have received such quality instruction from Professor Solodow."
