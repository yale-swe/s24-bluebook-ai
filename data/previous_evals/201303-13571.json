    "Peter spent way too much time covering \"housekeeping\" issues--when we needed to take our quizzes, when our readings were due, presentation order, etc. He needs to have a more clear syllibus at the start of class so that if we have questions we can ask but otherwise all important information is in the syllibus.the quizzes we took were not helpful and i didn't learn anything from them.",
    "Q 12: I think this course will undergo a lot of change since its new, but I wish we'd kept our energy-related lectures.Q 7: I think we should figure out a way to still teach students to evaluate a building",
    "Overall, thought this was a good class. I think sometime we were trying to cover a little too much information too quickly. I realize this is a survey course, but some of the lectures felt rushed. Too much time in class was spelt dealing with logistics (sometimes 20+ minutes). Logistics should be dealt with via email\/classes v2. Class time is too valuable.",
    "the instructor already provided an in-class course eval which i completed extensively. i won't be repeating it here.",

The access to the Green Building website and the quizzes was a great way to summarize the reading for each section and quantify the level of comprehension on each topic.",

    "The instructor really needs to tailor the learning material to the students' knowledge level about green building. I just cannot finish the assigned reading for each week. There are too many professional phrases that I don't understand. The lectures about insulation, windows, building sciences are too technical for me.",
    "Can be slightly disorganized",
    "The only addition I would suggest would be perhaps a field trip to off campus facilities of different scales (residential, commercial, industrial) buildings that are great examples of BMP's in green building design.",
    "This class was designed to be a survey class, and it was exactly that. However, I think there needs to be a focus at the beginning (first four or five weeks) that starts with an in-depth of the fundamentals...i.e. something very technical but also very expository. The class sort of did this, but I think it could go further. After the first month or so, I would want to be well-versed in all aspects of green-buildings that can be cross-applied to other green building genres.",

    "Instructor tries to pack A LOT into the day's agenda. I think the course would have been better if the instructor wasn't so ambitious in trying to fit so much into the time we have together. Given the amount of reading we had to do for each lecture, perhaps designating 1-hour discussion sections just to review readings would be better than trying to do it during lecture time WITH guest speakers.",
    "Readings. Assignments. Syllabus.Reduce the amount of time external speakers get to talk. Course and syllabus and discussion sessions need to get more specific and detail oriented. Green buildings include a lot of technology hence more specific technical topics must be a part of this course.",

Peter was flexible and helpful in responding to any issues.Also, there were a few too many guest lectures. Although the lectures were interesting and applicable, it would have been helpful to either have fewer or shorter guest lectures. I found that they detracted from our ability to discuss course readings and concepts as a class.",
    "Organization. Obviously, this was the first time the course was taught, but the course needs to be more organized. Syllabus changed a ton of times, too much time spent on logistics in class, etc.",
    "It covered too much material for a one semester course. I think having a more streamlined syllabus would make it more clear and comprehensible.",

SInce this was the first course of this type at Yale F&ES I think it was a great first step and can see that the order and depth of the topics will evolve very logically over time.",

This course provides the understanding of applied green building design and function not currently provided at F&ES by any other course.",
