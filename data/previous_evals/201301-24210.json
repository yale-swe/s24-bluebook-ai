   "comments": [
    "More ways to create discussion rather then lecture the entire time.",
    "The guest were great. it was nice to have a large range of topics. The groups projects were not very effective. The foucs should be on individual projects instead.",
    "I loved how we had people from different PH careers come in, that was really helpful for my understanding of what I might want to go into. I wish the student presentations were better split up, maybe half go halfway through the semester, the rest at the end. Also, I appreciated getting free food, but not when it was pizza! Isn't this a health course?",
    "This course is a great survey of fundamental global issues and frameworks. The lectures can seem disjointed at times, but overall it's a fulfilling experience.",
    "The talks were diverse and very interesting. I thought that the student presentations were a complete waste of time. If the course is not graded then people will not (unfortunately) put in the effort to make good presentations and it is an exercise in frustration. Better that students should just absorb the information in the lectures and discuss those issues than to pretend that we will be able to delve into a topic and present something meaningful in a short period of time.",
    "- Interesting mix of speakers,current topics in global health- The module is a waste of time as it is currently run; poorly organized, unclear expectations, little guidance--students end up going through the motions, not really learning anything",
    "Great overview of global health players\/career paths. The environmental health module is a worthwhile and important topic to address. This semester was much better in organization\/flow\/content than last semester. Great work!",
    "Not all of the lecturers were very engaging and a lot of them just weren't interesting. There's room for improvement, but overall it's structured well.The sessions would work better in a smaller room so people sit close to each other at the front. Students should not be allowed to have laptops - it gets distracting to other students and is rude.",
    "Exceptional course that provides you with insights on potential career opportunities in global health.",
    ".",
    "This seminar is a HUGE time commitment considering it is a no credit course. I think it would be great if the lecture + question portion was ONLY 1 hour, and that any further questions were answered afterwards during dinner. Also, maybe push the start time earlier a bit so that we do not have to wait until 7pm to eat dinner.The module is okay, but I think it should replace the lectures instead of supplement them. It would be a better experience if it only required in class time that is already allotted to the project.I really liked the topics this year! Environmental health, chronic disease, and public private partnerships are all really important topics for the world going forward!",
    "Strength- Some of instructors were world classWeakness- Module should be planned better to make it effective",
    "Not engaging for students in a lecture series",
    "Strengths: Great mix of speakers. I appreciated that there was time for students to meet with the speakers for a more in-depth discussion after the lectures. I also appreciated that the module presentations were kept to a time limit this semester so that students could grasp the key concepts without having to sit through hours and hours of presentations. Weaknesses: Sometimes the seminar started late.",
    "Great speakers this semester!",
    "interesting seminars from leaders in diverse public health fields",
    "We had really good speakers this time around. I also enjoyed the way the module was organized this semester. I still think that it would be better if we have presentations throughout the course with groups presenting on different topics. I also enjoyed the time we were able to spend with the speakers over dinner.",
    "The strength of this course is that you are able to hear presentations from a number of interesting professionals who are engaged in health work around the world. While there is no one focus on a particular region, the topic of the semester ensured cohesiveness among the lectures. The weakness is that since we are not required to complete individuals assignments, students do not really have to invest much time in preparing for class or researching topics outside of the lectures. One suggestions is to have an individual assignment as a compliment to the student presentations so that students feel more invested in the course."

    "I would recommend this course. It's a great opportunity to meet global health professionals and learn about new topics in the field.",
    "Yes, is is a great lecture course. And it is required for Global health concentration",
    "Very easy credit, no homework and don't need to do outside readings, one presentation\/semester that is not much of a commitment, very interesting speakers from all different PH\/GH careers",
    "It is what you make of it. I liked it, but I really hated the projects - total waste of time.",
    "Interesting to listen to guest speakers. You're probably taking this class because you have to.",
    "Great overview of important global health topics and low effort learning experience.",
    "The Mon time slot is rough for first year YSPH students because of our schedules on Monday. Most of the time I felt like going to them was a chore - every odd lecture would be interesting. Could benefit from getting more engaging speakers and having it in a smaller room to stimulate discussions.",
    "A great experience - I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "There should be a better selection of the rakers. Not all the speakers were capable if capturing a large audience's attention.",
    "This is a seminar series in global health with an interactive module component.",
    "Useful but can be improved in some areas",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in learning more about global health. This is just a fun seminar every week where you can learn more about a new topic and have a chance to further discuss the topic with the lecturer if you are so inclined.",
    "If you are interested in Global Health I would definitely take this course.",
    "eye-opener for people interested in global health-related work",
    "Good into to global health, but other courses might be better at teaching actual global health skills",
    "I would recommend this course. I love the fact that they consistently collect our feedback. The course improved drastically from the first semester. It was an excellent introduction into global health topics that I was unaware of before. I also enjoyed the public health practitioners that we were given access to.",
    "This course is a seminar that will allow you to hear presentations given by very interesting health professionals. While the course does not require a lot of work, it does give you a great opportunity to hear about different topics and countries. It is a good compliment to other global health issues courses."
