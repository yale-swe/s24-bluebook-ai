    "Great english class. Really challenging and not a class where you will feel completely confident in your writing skills as you may have before. I took the class because I had heard it was a \"must-take\" class at Yale and it is definitely a \"must-take\". I knew it would be challenging but the essays we read are brilliant and it's fun and interesting to try to write in a manner that is very different than the standard academic way we had before.",
    "As they say, English 120 is a must-take at Yale, and I agree! I really enjoyed this course, its structure and my particular section. The readings are really helpful and are great examples of the way writing is crafted. I think the major strength of this course is how unique it is in its outlook: professors are not didactic and don't prescribe good writing skills, but rather work with students to discover why and how the models we read work.I also loved the peer-editing and workshops, and learned a lot from my fellow classmates. Even though the class keeps you constantly writing, that really improves your writing and allows you to learn more.Also, the readings are all really fun- you get assigned New Yorker pieces and Onion articles so it does't even feel like work. The amount of papers might seem like a lot of work, but it's a very consistent workload and you'll appreciate that during midterm and final season.",
    "The assignments take up a lot of time but are really interesting. The class is worth the effort.",
    "English 120 is very rewarding, but be prepared to devote a lot of time to it; you definitely get out of it what you put in.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is willing to do a spot of reading and take it seriously. I think it provokes you to think about things and writing in a new way and that it helps improve your writing dramatically if you are willing to work at it.",
    "YES! Prof Shirkhani is great! So nice and so helpful and really makes you want to become a better reader\/writer. This is a must-take course at Yale. Phenomenal, really!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's a lot of fun to write these kinds of essays vs. regular academic ones. The class is really well structured and well-taught and you'll learn a lot from your professor and peers.",
    "I think everyone at Yale should take this course, even if they don't like writing, because it makes you so much more aware of the power of words and heightens your awareness of the craft. So I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "I really enjoyed this class in general. Professor Shirkhani makes reading essays really fun, and she kept the class discussion lively and interesting. I don't think that I learned as many writing skills as I would have liked, and I also felt like some of the comments on my essay's only made me more confused. I don't think English 120 is the incredible writing class that a lot of people at Yale seem to call it, but I still liked the class.",
    "It's a great step up from high school writing, though the grading is a little steep, especially considering some people may never had any experience in the forms of writing covered. I would definitely recommend it for those looking to write different styles of non-fiction.",
    "I would recommend English 120 12 to other students who had an interest in writing specifically, or who studied another liberal art\/social science field and wanted to spruce up their writing style.",
    "I enjoyed this course. The readings are fun and the topics interesting. I would suggest speaking to your professor about a topic before writing a draft. Also, figure out your teacher's style and write your essays for them, no one else. They are the ones grading the papers after all.I don't feel like my writing improved immensely, but I am definitely more aware about how clear and persuasive my writing is after this course. I recommend this if you enjoy creative writing and writing a 4 page paper (draft or final) every week doesn't daunt you.",
    "I would strongly recommend English 120. It's the kind of writing that is always fun and that we rarely get to do in school. The class is basically learning and practicing the kind of writing that entertains the reader while retaining intellectual credibility. The essays"
