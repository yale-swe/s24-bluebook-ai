    "Fantastic lecture course. I really enjoyed it.",
    "A great survey and lecture course. Maybe take it Cr\/D because your grade is somewhat undetermined until the very last minute which I found unnerving. It's also a tremendous amount of reading. Interesting topic and interesting lecturer.",
    "In general, this was a great course. I think it gets a lot of hype on these evaluations and in school culture in general -- it was not as amazing as everyone promised it would be, but it was great. The readings are generally interesting, though LONG and plentiful. The midterm paper is interesting and lets you examine fiction or nonfictional memoirs from WW1, which is different from alot of drier history courses. The great thing about this class is that it introduces you to the wide variety of methods historians can use to approach events that have been traditionally interpreted in a certain way. Though Professor Winter is an awesome lecturer and has a lot of insight into specific events, that won't be the best part of the course -- it's really the big picture approach he takes towards history that leaves an impact. If you take this class, DO THE READINGS and GO TO THE LECTURES. It sounds self-explanatory but people who didn't put alot into this class didn't get alot out of it, so it's dependent on you to make it as good as it can be.",
    "I would recommend it. There is a lot of reading but you don't have to do all of it and it is an extremely interesting topic with great lectures.",
    "Excellent class. Great lectures, interesting material. definitely recommend.",
    "not if you are a upperclassmen non-history major.",
    "I took this class Credit\/D and still feel I got a lot out of the class. Because of the six 2-page reading responses you will have to do at least a fair amount of the ENORMOUS amount of reading. Also, the midterm requires you to compare two books, so there is no way to skip working on that. Finally, this class is not historical in the factual sense of history. Instead, it is Jay Winter offering his well-reasoned and wonderfully presented personal interpretation and theories on the first and second world wars. Don't expect to come away from this class being able to name all of the major battles.",
    "Take it. You need this background about Europe if you want to understand anything that's happened since then. Its just a darn good history class. Lot's of reading, but you should do it.",
    "Total War is an essential course to take if you want to know anything about Europe, history, or war. I would completely recommend it. The amount of reading assigned each week is absurd for a lecture course (ca. 400 pages each week), though much of it is repetitive (and hence, you can skim\/skip much of it). Also, I would suggest studying for the final in groups and splitting up the preparation for the final exam study questions.",
    "lots of readings. material isn't dry though",
    "I would definitely take this class if you get the chance. It's one of the most interesting, well taught classes I've taken at Yale. That said, be prepared for A LOT of reading.",
    "Good lectures, LOADS of reading, mandatory section. Among History dept lecture courses, it's among the best.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. There's a lot of reading, but the reading all reflects what's said in lecture. The mid-term paper is easy, and the format of the final is such that you could ace it (but if you study!) I made the mistake of taking this class Credit\/D but definitely take this class for a grade- you won't regret it! Plus, who doesn't love war?",
    "I'd definitely recommend it. A very interesting period of history with an amazing professor and solid TFs.",
    "Jay Winter is a baller. You should take this class if only for him. One of the best history of lectures I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Incredible course. Definitely take this course\/anything Winter teaches. The Prof. is amazing, the material is amazing. This is a must-take.",
    "recommend it",
    "Yes, this class is a great overview of World War I, the inter-war years, and World War II. You should definitely take it if you have any interest in this subject.",
    "Great course on World War I and World War II.",
    "Definitely a great class - you should take it. Lots of reading, some of which is very interesting, but you definitely don't have to do it all.",
    "Hist 273 is a good introduction to recent European history. It's a lot of war, but the course gains a lot from Winter's interest in big ideas about memory and commemoration. The reading is heavy, but the midterm essay is interesting and the reading responses are helpful. And he's an outstanding lecturer.",
    "One 12 page paper comparing two WWI-related war diary(-esque) books. Final Exam with 3 essay responses (No ID's). Jay Winter is a great lecturer and it is a very interesting class, a Yale classic (so, you should attend lecture when possible). Everyone should take it, especially history majors. Section can be pretty tough, weekly 2 page reading response - so make sure you have a good TF. The reading is a very intense looking amount, but read like a history major, not an english major, and it's not bad at all.",
    "This course begins with World War I, continues through the interwar years, and ends with the conclusion of WWII. Rather than focusing on battles, this course delves into many of the surrounding factors and their implications during such a tumultuous era. Highly recommended, but beware of the amount of reading!",
    "Yes, mind blowing lectures, and really not that much work (if you don't read every word of the readings).",
    "The course was incredible. Its strengths were that it was taught by perhaps the world's best scholar of world war studies and that the readings were carefully chosen. Its weakness was that there was just too much reading to do.It's really a must-do course for everyone. Due to its rigor, however, to take it one should either have a firm interest in the history of the early 20th century or be a history major. It is by no means a light class, but an intense and intellectually rewarding class.",
    "HIST 273, Europe in the Age of Total War, is a must take for any history major. This is easily the best lecture course I have taken in my time at Yale. Professor Winter is absolutely outstanding. The emotional force and conviction he instills in every lecture made this a truly special experience. At one point in the semester, I recall telling a friend that his final 4 or 5 lectures may have been the BEST 4 or 5 I had heard at Yale.Be prepared to give this course the time it deserves: 3500+ pages of reading, an intense Midterm paper, and six section \"reading response\/essays.\" Thus, the course was at times a grind...but do the reading! You will be a better person for it in the end, and it will be essential in preparing for a final exam that spans the entire scope of the course content.This is material that any true student of history must approach at some point in his or her lifetime. No better time to do it than under the auspice of an expert like Jay Winter.",
    "Once you have lain with mistress Total War you will never be satisfied again. On and start your WWI novels the day the class begins.",
    "Strength: great lecturer.Weaknesses: when Prof. Winter doesn't lecture. The expectation that we can read 600 pages of a course packet (that comes in 3 parts) that costs $160...in addition to 4 - 5 books. The reading amount is absurd and often boring, and therefore section becomes a place to practice bullshitting. This is unfortunate, because Mr. Winter makes it sound so interesting, and the excerpts from the stuff that he writes are great reading.Take it only if you love military history.",
    "This course provides an overview of European history bracketed by the two world wars. Professor Winter is very enthusiastic about the material and his lectures are always engaging. The workload is very manageable, though the reading response assignments can get annoying. Overall, if you are interesting in the topic, this is a great history course.",
    "This class may not be the most obvious choice for Yale students, but it is a must. Everyone should take it and if not a history major, then take a credit\/d\/fail because no one should miss out on the experience of the class.",
    "Great course, a lot of reading though. Winter's lectures are great. This is a course you don't want to miss.",
    "a pretty good class, but definitely not the amazing class everyone told me it was last year. pretty interesting material about social history during the world war one\/two era, as well as good military insights, but you do have to do some side research if you're not already very familiar with the military timeline of the two wars (wikipedia works great for this), as professor winter does not go over timelines in depth and will often just throw dates out. i also did not particularly like professor winter's lecturing style--he's declined from the passionate lecturer he used to be, and i personally find him somewhat disorganized and too anecdote-based--it was sometimes difficult to divine the central theme of any lecture. and everyone says this, but definitely still tons of reading. not necessary to do it all. but i would try to skim part of every reading at least, although there's no need to read any whole document. i bought books for the class i ended up reading four or five pages from.",
    "Great lectures, a lot of reading that can be sometimes a little boring though.",
    "A great course. I would recommend wholeheartedly. A good overview of a time I didn't know enough about beforehand, though I thought I did. The WWI portion is especially excellent.",
    "I had a lot of trouble taking notes in this class and I know other students felt the same way. Professor Winter would outline how many points he planned on covering but, throughout the lecture everything became harder to follow. Also, after studying for the final I realize that in class he spent a lot of times on specifics so it was difficult to piece together the big picture through just lecture notes. That is to say you need to do both (some of) the reading (which is incredibly, ridiculously too much) and go to lecture. It is an interesting subject and the reading was fairly interesting. Lecture was difficult to follow though.",
    "This class is a great overview for anyone interested in 20th century European history. I think it is especially important for history majors to take. Professor Winter is great at basing his lectures specifically on evaluating different historical arguments. Beware of lots of reading, but the class is certainly manageable.",
    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale -- highly recommended. Start the midterm paper as early as possible, since there just isn't time to read both books and write the paper in the middle of October.",
    "This rivals Prof. Blight's \"Civil War\" as the best lecture I've taken. You need to learn about this area of history (WWI and WWII) in college...there are so many facets of it that are forgotten in what I'd been previously taught. I wish the reading was a little less. No one ends up doing all of it, so you might as well focus it so that we're sure to read the god stuff.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Or anything with Jay Winter. He's the best lecturer I've ever had. And the material is incredibly interesting and important. (It's a lot of work, but even taking it Credit\/D you get a lot out of it. Also, don't expect to do every reading if you are taking it for a grade. Do as much as you can or do what's interesting, and you'll do well in the course. The grading is really fair, and the assignments are interesting. Taking the final was the most fun I've had on an exam.)",
    "If you're interested in World War I or World War II, you should consider shopping Professor Winter's class. He has a very engaging lecture style and is one of the world's preeminent experts on the period. The midterm assignment that asks you to compare two war novels is quite interesting and enjoyable.However, you should know that Professor Winter focuses much more on historiographical debates about the period than the period itself. There is a ton of material and reading that you'll be responsible for by the end of the class, and Professor Winter doesn't do a very good job of structuring it. He also doesn't give you a good idea of what material you'll be responsible for on the final.If you're comfortable with the caveats and are engaged in the period, then the class is worth a shot. If not, you should probably find another history class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Yes, good over view of modern european history.",
    "Yes. It is very interesting material and not very difficult- one ten page paper and a final. But be prepared to read a lot.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course. It was interesting and exciting. Every week I looked forward to going to lecture.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Jay Winter is an amazing lecturer. Even if you are not sure you will like the subject matter, Winter immediately establishes its relevancy and draws you in. There is a lot of reading, but it is really interesting. This course is truly a must for any Yale student looking for a fantastic lecture class!",
    "Great history class. Professor Winter is brilliant and extremely eloquent. However, he does often talk very circularly, and it sometimes went over my head. As a non-history major, with nobackground of the events, I often struggled, because he doesn't focus on every detail, but the major pictures he painted were really interesting. It's a lot of reading, and that too is also dense, but if you have a good TA it can be made manageable. I definitely enjoyed the class, but I could also have bombed since I'm not sure I had a great grasp of everything he taught. The workload beyond the reading is pretty managable-and the midterm paper is kind of fun since you are reading two novels.",
    "Take it, but don't go crazy trying to do all the reading.",
    "THIS IS A GREAT COURSEFirst, Professor Winter is a superb lecturer. His lectures are excellent... and coherent. He can go off on what seems to be a tangent for five minutes...but then bring it back perfectly to the topic he was originally discussing. Lectures complemented the readings nicely and did not merely repeat what we read outside of class. I definitely looked forward to hearing him speak twice a week.Regarding the workload--There is a lot of reading (close to 300 pages by the end of the semester), but the overall, the reading selection is very, very solid--interesting, informative, and generally not too dense. Also, besides the reading, there is very little other work (one 10-page midterm paper, five or so section responses, and a final exam with a very generous structure). I do know people who got through the course doing very little of the reading, but it you take the class, it's worth it to do the reading. It makes writing the section responses and studying for the final much easier, and you'll get a lot more out of the class.I would recommend this class to anybody who wants a more sophisticated understanding of Europe during the time period--and of Hitler, WWII, and the Holocaust, especially. I learned a lot from this course, Professor Winter is great. Take Total War!",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "I would recommend it. very interesting stuff.",
    "Great course. Absolutely take it.",
    "i would recommend it, but i would warn them about the reading! it's overwhelming! especially if you're me and join the class on the last day of shopping period, finding yourself already 2 weeks (and about 1000 pages) behind. that said, you don't have to do all of it to do well.",
    "TAKE IT. great great class. lecture is awesome. sections require a lot of reading\/responses. great credit d class",
    "By all means, take this class. By far the most interesting class I've taken at Yale, beautifully and passionately taught. Very heavy reading, but very little actual work. ONLY GREAT AND FUN!",
    "Good course; don't take it if you already have a lot of knowledge of the period or the military history of the wars. A hell of a lot of reading.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in this time period. You learn so much about why the world is like the way it is today and the escalation of the nature of warfare. Winter is a great lecturer and the workload is only a little more than the average history course at Yale.",
    "This was by far the MOST AMAZING course I have taken at Yale. It had absolutely no flaws. Jay Winter was the BEST lecturer I have ever had and will probably ever have at Yale. His lectures were extremely structured, vibrant and objective. He is what I envision as a true historian - dedicated to the subject, striving towards objectivity and able to engage his students. The subject matter is knowledge that every educated individual should have if they want to understand the dynamics of today's world and foreign affairs. A truly, truly amazing class. Wish all were like it.",
    "Great Course",
    "This class is an incredible, as long as Professor Winter is lecturing. I highly recommend taking this class, as you will get some of the best lectures in the school.",
    "not a lot of work, except preparing for the test... lots of reading (not all necessary) very interesting material",
    "sure, interesting class, if you do even some of the reading you'll do fine.",
    "A great class that covers one of the most interesting periods in history. Not terribly hard, not terribly easy, just be prepared to do a ton of reading (if you do the reading)."
