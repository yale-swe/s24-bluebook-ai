   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The reading is relatively manageable, and the discussions are low key while still being extremely interesting.",
    "So good. If you are interested in HSHM this class is for you. Dr. Romano gave us information that was so interesting and the syllabus was fantastic. The books were unique and mostly not on subjects that are so overly covered. Do you know about FAS? I didn't before, but now I do. Great class for practice before senior thesis.",
    "Good seminar on a lot of standard and interesting topics in HSHM. Definitely would recommend.",
    "This seminar was essentially a social-construction-of-disease book club. The readings were interesting, but the student-led discussions became tiresome. The course was very basic - I might recommend it to new majors or non-majors, but not to an HSHM junior looking for advanced discussion or any guidance on historiography.",
    "This is a solid seminar that often feels more like an interesting book club than an actual class. Professor Romano is really invested in her students and very knowledgable about the subject matter. She offers great guidance in constructing the final paper. As wonderful as Professor Romano is, this class oftentimes felt slow because my classmates seemed blase and offered only lackluster discussion. Make sure you're in a class with interesting people. This seminar could be a true gem, but many times it felt like there wasn't enough spark in the room to keep conversation rolling, and it was at no fault of the professor.",
    "This was an excellent class. The readings were managable, discussions were engaging and rewarding, and the work load was not too big. The 20 page paper seems imposing but you get a lot of guidance and it ends up being pretty managable. Take it if you are interested in learning about how diseases are socially defined."
