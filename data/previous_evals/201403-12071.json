    "A wonderful classrigorous but low-stress. You'd be a fool not to take it.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Professor Muravnik is a god amongst men...best foreign language teacher I've ever had. This class will especially appeal to those interested in Russian history, politics, and literature. If you're already at L5, you have nothing to lose.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student learning Russian. Having a native speaker explain difficult grammatical and usage concepts is invaluable, and provides context and background that you could never get from a textbook.",
    "It is very helpful and informative. The professor has prepared packets that are better than any textbook I have ever seen. It is time-consuming but overall a wonderful class",
    "Greatly improves language proficiency, excellent instruction, and a very manageable workload. If you've come this far, absolutely continue.",
    "It's a lot of work, but you will get as much out of it as you put in. Nevertheless, you'll probably only want to take this if you're really serious about high-level mastery of Russian.",
    "Take it! This course will really help you get deeper into the grammar of L1-4 while giving you more reading experience."
