    "I cannot say enough positive things about this course. Karen's dynamic teaching style kept every class interesting and different. Students were constantly engaged and asked to think\/learn\/communicate in new ways. There should be more classes at FES taught this way!",
    "The best aspects of this course were the assignments, readings, and class discussions, and how they all complemented one another to provide substantive knowledge of the material, but practice in skills such as synthesis writing, public speaking, and policy analysis.",
    "Best-taught course at FES. Instructor shows actual interest in student learning! Subject area is very interesting. Readings on-point.",
    "The layout of class time made offered opportunities to practice a lot of different skills...class neverfelt slow.",
    "Everything we do and the order we do it in really makes the information sink in and turns you in kind of an expert in the subject. Starting with learning to properly read the literature, learning to write synthesis (a skill so essential but apparently few know), reading a commenting on classmates work, and finally having an class filled with great exercise and loads of in-class discussion. All of these things in a week make it a heavy course, but so worth it!",
    "The heavy reading load and weekly synthesis exercise were tremendously valuable in terms of generating accountability among the students and ensuring a high level of discussion during class. The interactive class activities were well-designed and valuable too.",
    "I enjoyed the format of the course",
    "Everything! The readings were great and relevant! Learning to write syntheses is challenging but very necessary and allowed me to thoroughly gain an understanding of the readings.The class discussions could have gone on for hours!"

It felt a bit like the grading was inevitably going to improve over time, and that your grade was more about how to motivate you to keep working than it was a reflection of the quality of your work.Also, a little much to have policy memos and S&As due the same week.",

I love studying cities and how to make them more sustainable and human places, this class made me realize the actual extent to which cities can become global key players in mitigating\/innovating on climate change issues.",

Karen taught me how to properly write and make a case for fighting climate change in urban areas.Even if your thing is not urban, the skills you gain from the course are useful in any subject. Synthesizing, persuasive writing, speaking and discussing, and working in groups.",
    "This is a demanding course requiring critical engagement with the materials. It is well worth the effort, and may be the best course offered at F&ES.",
    "Tailor your other courses so that you can prioritize this one! It has a huge and heavy work load, so make sure you are able to give it the time and dedication Seto expects! She puts even more time in to this course than you will which is reflective of how amazing she is as a professor! If you don't put in the required effort you will get nothing out of this class, so bother even taking it.This is probably the only class at FES (or any course ever) where the heavy workload is a benefit and actually worth the students' time!"
