   "comments": [
    "I learned so much by taking this course including learning how to interpret the meaning of a text beyond the literal words and be able to interpret the bigger picture of a text. This class has taught me so much more because The Comedia has so many valuable life lessons in it.",
    "I read and understood the whole of the Divine Comedy! Dante and Christiana and the tfs were amazing and everyone should take this course before they graduate."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I have nothing negative to say about this class because it was so incredible. Our lecturer Christiana was amazing and the class itself was inspirational. It has definitely been my favorite class by far at Yale.",
    "There are no weaknesses to this course. The quizzes could be a bit much but they also kept us on track",
    "Professor PM is amazing. She jampacks every lecture with fascinating insights from Dante scholars, medieval studies, and her own research. Professor PM also made an effort to create class cohesion through outside events related to our studies, which I greatly appreciated it.",
    "I absolutely love the class' specific focus on the Divine Comedy; I would have not had the opportunity to engage this deeply with this text--or most other texts of this length and importance, frankly--had I not taken it. Professor Purdy-Moudarres is a joy and an engaging lecturer; while some had warned me that I might lose interest after the Inferno, her lectures always concerned a fascinating new element of the text that served the whole. One weakness is in the quizzes--while they forced me to retain what I read more deeply, I would have liked a bit more guidance on how to identify certain passages per canto, which was difficult.",
    "The lectures in this course are incredibly useful and insightful. In providing short review sessions, the text of Dante's Comedy was made easily digestible. I can think of no improvements to the course, as it is highly structured and developed for students to have a succesful reading of the Comedy."

   "comments": [
    "i would highly recommend this class to any student at Yale. Even if they are not interested in literature or Italian, I think this class can offer so much more. It has taught me so many valuable lessons and I cannot wait to take another class that is similar.",
    "Yes!! Everyone should take a course on the Comedy before they graduate, and Christiana is wonderful as a teacher and a lecturer",
    "Please take this course. You will read and get somewhat of a firm grasp on what of the most important pieces of literature. More importantly, you will get a new perspective on life. Dante in Translation will be a respite in your schedule in that it will force you to look at your life and its greater point in a new way.",
    "Yes this is a wonderful course. Highly recommended",
    "Absolutely take this class. If you've been meaning to read the Comedy but never find the time or willpower, take this class. Professor Purdy-Moudarres really makes the class feel like a family through planned extracurricular activities and close personal attention and compassion. The small-lecture format is brilliant, and works so well for this type of text. You'll be so glad you took it, like me!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone wanting to engage deeply with such a powerful text. It is incredibly well structured, and excellently tailored to the length of the semester."
