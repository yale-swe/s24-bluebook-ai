   "comments": [
    "Interesting material. Watch out for the curve.",
    "Standard abstract algebra course. Homeworks and exams are pretty straightforward. Casson goes at a pretty slow pace and explains things very well so you shouldn't have trouble keeping up.",
    "Great, structured introduction to algebra. Professor Casson is an extremely clear lecturer and enhances your learning greatly. I highly recommend this class.",
    "It's a lot of work. Be careful before you decide to take this with other classes that are a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend Math 350 to a student planning on being a math major. The material is very central to the math major in general, and I found it to be very interesting. I cannot imagine a non-math major taking this class, though, though if they were interested in the material and had sufficient background I would still recommend the class.",
    "Math 350 is a decent course and you will certainly learn a lot about the basics of Abstract Algebra in it. As I'm sure you've read from others, Casson is a bit of a boring professor, but not unbearable. If you listen carefully, you can even catch a rare joke his lectures. The homework is manageable, though the tests can be a bit difficult. Make sure you know a variety of counter-examples for the test--you will need them, unfortunately.",
    "If you're just interested in the material, take it Credit\/D\/F. Casson is a good lecturer but an incredibly hard grader, and the exams tend to be very difficult. The actual class (material covered + homework) is not bad, although it seems like some sections were rushed through. But the material itself -- groups, rings, and a little bit of modules -- is very interesting and worth taking it for, as long as you don't mind the grades.",
    "I took this course as a freshman, in addition to Math 230. 350 always immediately followed 230 and was even in the same classroom, and there was a very noticeable difference in the classes. 350 is a much more normally paced class than 230, and the expectations are for you to learn the material (basic theory of groups, rings, and modules) and learn it well. The homework is always from the book, in comparison to 230 homework which is 75% not from the book.That said, the class is by no means easy. Having never done abstract math before, I found the actual conceptual material more challenging than the calculus\/linear algebra being covered in 230, even though work-wise 350 was the easier one. I spent a lot of time reading the textbook myself trying to learn material myself, but that is largely from not being at 100% focus while at lecture. Casson is not the most energetic lecturer, but definitely has the material down cold and gives rigorous explanations and proofs of all the material.In summary, if you're interested at all in abstract math, definitely take this course. You'll get a strong understanding of the basics. Lecture is not the best but well worth soldiering through for the payoff of understanding at the end when some of the bigger ideas come together is really worth it.",
    "I was happy with this class. It's medium difficulty as far as math classes go, and pretty well-taught.",
    "Yes. First of all, its basically mandatory for the Math major, and I would definitely take it with Professor Casson. Casson is an extremely good lecturer; lectures and incredibly clear and interesting and you will be using your notes a lot in preparing for exams because lectures were always so organized and insightful. The material is very interesting and important too; you move pretty quickly through basically half of Dummit and Foote (you cover groups, rings and modules!). The homeworks can be a bit random at times but they don't count for much. However as you will probably hear from many people, Casson is very strict grader and his exams are really hard. However you will probably have the first midterm before the drop deadline and he'll tell you exactly the letter grade you would get based on that midterm, and if you might have to drop if you're in the third to a half of the class in the C+,C,C-,D+,D,D- and F range. So if you're taking this and don't already know algebra, study and practice well for each exams and you'll be fine.",
    "Take it only if you are considering a math major or love abstract algebra.",
    "It's a good intro to some basic objects in algebra, mostly groups, rings, and modules. There weren't a whole lot of applications outside of algebra, but I expect there'll be more of that in 370. It's really well-taught, so if you want to learn the material you should take it.",
    "Cool class, cool material. Not life-changing, but apparently Galois Theory, its sequel, is. Casson explains everything very clearly and slowly enough. I will say that the course blurb isn't really accurate. We didn't cover half those fancy sounding groups. We did learn enough that all that material should be very accessible. So, we covered groups (normal subgroups, quotients, symmetric and alternating groups, abelian groups, and direct products, and Sylow p-subgroups which are crazy), rings (Principal Ideal Domains, Euclidean Domains, Unique Factorization Domains, polynomial rings) and a bit of modules. The class gets harder about 3 weeks in; before that it's a breeze.",
    "Abstract algebra is a decent math course. I found it a little hard to get too excited about the material (none of the proofs we did were too complicated, but none of them were that exciting, either), but Casson is a clear and coherent lecturer and gets everything across really well. if you're into highly abstract math, the course will be a lot of fun; if not, you'll still learn it pretty well.",
    "This course requires a lot of work outside of class - problem set answers are online but it really helps to work through them yourself.Professor Casson is very approachable and will give you helpful hints if you are stuck on a homework problem.",
    "I would recommend this class with Prof. Casson, who was extremely clear and helpful and who made the many definitons and concepts clear and interesting.",
    "No. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably a math major and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have much of a choice, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d still say no. Intro to Algebra, as taught by almost any teacher, is pretty dreary: you see a lot of disparate definitions and theorems but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get to any of the cool stuff. With Professor Casson in particular, the class is exhausting. He doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give you much of an intuitive idea of what is actually going on behind the definition-proposition-proof ad infinitum, so you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see much of the beauty of the math. The homeworks and tests are difficult, (don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be fooled by the first three weeks!) and all along the way you keep asking why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re putting yourself through all of this\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bit of a leech on any enthusiasm you might have had for mathematics coming out of, say, 230.I think I learned a very particular technical skill set for working with rings and groups. Too bad this class didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t inspire me to take another algebra class ever again.",
    "This class is HARD. The homework is straightforward, but the tests are brutal. Still, take this class if you have the slightest interest in the material. Casson is a good lecturer. Straight from the book, yet much clearer than the book.",
    "Algebra is an interesting topic, but this class is not great. Professor Casson is nice and organized, but he makes a minimal effort beyond giving lectures and holding office hours (which are not helpful unless you have a very specific question)."
