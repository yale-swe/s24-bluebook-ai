   "comments": [
    "I feel like I really strengthened my critical thinking skills in this class. I also feel more confident in reading scientific papers and questioning everything I read more closely.",
    "I found out how much I didn't know about biology in this course, but am also much more confident in my ability to follow literature and understand research in the field",
    "This was the best class of my semester! I feel as though I better understand now how to read papers. I also think I came away with basic knowledge of fundamental papers in biochemistry.",
    "I learned how to really read a scientific paper. Before this class, I would read papers, but wouldn't get the information and insight into them as I would if I were to read a paper after this class. I learned to be critical of results, and learned a lot about different methods and techniques that are commonly used in the field that I didn't really know much about before.",
    "Understanding papers!",
    "Learned some specific methods as described in the papers we read, but also analytical skills and how to think critically about the work presented, and how to communicate that with a group",
    "I developed a lot of critical thinking skills by taking this course. I think this course really taught us to challenge the information presented to us in scientific papers and not just trust what we read. It also challenged me to try to understand the thought process of the scientists who made such influential discoveries.",
    "Developed the ability to read papers critically.",
    "This course was useful for several reasons. Firstly, it exposed me to a number of different topics and expanded my knowledge of biology. Secondly, it helped accustom me to scientific discussions with my peers. Probably most importantly, it let me see how other people read and interpret papers. It was very illuminating to learn what they looked for and what sorts of questions they were implicitly asking while reading each paper--I felt like I became a more perceptive reader when I tried approaching the literature from these new vantage points."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class stressed me out a lot, and a big weakness was the time of the class. However, I learned a ton.",
    "The strengths are the skills learned by reading these papers critically every week, and the ability to read and understand papers at a much higher level. The weakness is that sometimes a few people in the class answer most of the questions sometimes, with some of the quieter people not feeling like they really get a chance to willingly participate.",
    "High workload but worthwhile.",
    "I think it can be hard in classes like this to make an environment where everyone is contributing, but in general I think the instructors did a good job of encouraging this. There could be more active methods mixed in occasionally for varying participation",
    "The course has many strengths, it's design\/ organization is really unique and I feel very lucky to have taken the class. I feel like our class was pretty introverted, so having the name cards really helped keep our discussion going.",
    "I mean, it's a great class. It's a great opportunity to engage with classic literature under the tutelage of great professors. And it's a great opportunity to learn to think critically about how experiments are done.",
    "Strength: The discussion format is the real strength of this class. I learned as much from the comments\/questions of my peers and professors as I did from my pre-class preparation. Additionally, the final paper was a fun excuse to revisit each paper and think about its implications for future research. Weakness: as someone who has trouble jumping into conversations, I often found that, if I didn't immediately respond to questions, I was effectively \"locked out\" of the ensuing discussion. The name card system was an effective solution to this problem.",
    "I wish we have a chance to pick some of the paper instead of following the syllabus."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! The final project was especially fun.",
    "Definitely yes. I learned how to really read and evaluate scientific papers, a skill which is important in any scientific field. I also learned about different techniques used, which could be helpful in thinking of different experiments to try.",
    "It will push you to understand paper and discuss with you classmates.",
    "Yes, for first semester it was nice to get to know everyone in the class very well",
    "Yes, I am so happy to have had to take this course.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Absolutely. While I try to close-read papers by myself, I found that I took away so much more by discussing them with my peers and professors. The class was both challenging and engaging."
