    "This course will equip you with a working knowledge of Spanish grammar, and provides a good foundation for further exploration of the language.",
    "Although the material is not very hard, It is a hard class, so make sure you keep up with all the work. There are lots of assignments every night and if you don't keep up, you can easily fall behind.",
    "It's fine. Professor Pilar is great though. You should try to get a section with her. She makes it better than just the curriculum.",
    "Great class. I would recommend taking it even if (like I had) you've already fulfilled your language requirement and just want a class that can really quickly give you real applicable knowledge in something useful in the world. I'm a more fluent speaker and understander of Spanish coming out of this intro sequence than I was after L3 in German. All expectations, and all explanations of new material, are very straightforward, the work feels like it has a purpose, and it really pays off. There is definitely more work in L2 than in L1, something every day and generally the weekend assignments take at least a couple hours, but I'm very happy I took this course."
