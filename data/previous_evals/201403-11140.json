    "This class requires some charity on behalf of the student. Most courses require you to put in work outside of class on reading, etc. Most of the work in this course happens in the classroom - trying to see beyond George's slow presentation to the broader ideas that he's trying to push, and trying to figure out the deep insights he expresses in offhand comments about parts of metaphysics. It is a different kind of work than other courses, but I find it very rewarding."
