    "You can't take this course unless your a junior in the major, so I'm just going to give advice. 1) pick a body of theoretical literature that you are interested in. its a great opportunity to read stuff you haven't got the chance to. 2) you dont have to decide your senior essay when you start the course, but you definitely have to think about it. since all the assignments revolve around your senior essay, actually think about what you want to research. you dont have to decide the entire subject or narrow it down, but its helpful to have some idea of what types of reading would complement your interests. 3) read other students articles -- and at the very least read the parts you find interesting. It makes class discussion a lot better, and its great to hear about what other people are interested in. 4) Melanie is super approachable and insanely well-read. make sure you spend time talking with her -- she gives awesome suggestions.",
    "A required course. You work on creating a theoretical foundation for your senior essay. Good course."
