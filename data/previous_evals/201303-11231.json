   "comments": [
    "A panoramic sweep of ancient literature and the Western canon. Undoubtedly recommended for fascinating readings, interdisciplinary connections, and irreplaceable wealth of reading experience.",
    "In many ways Lit is the most engaging of the three sections. There are some great works here, some of whom we passed far too quickly (Greek tragedies and Paradiso, sigh). That's the tragedy of DS, though, and the great thing about it is now you have a survey you know exactly which works you'll want to revisit. It's also interesting to see the progression of certain values through the Greek and Roman ages, and then into Antiquity. The ability to see how works influence each other is one of the best parts of DS.Also, Professor Neuman is great. He often does little exercises in class to help you collect your thoughts before section. He's also just that quintessential quirky English professor - a lot of fun to have a class with and really helpful when it comes to interpreting works of literature. He gets your papers back to you really fast, too, always a plus.Overall, recommended if you're into the DS\/Western Canon thing.",
    "This course goes through many of the important texts from the beggining of time through about the 13th century. Certainly not every text over that time period, and not quite as in-depth as I would like, but a good overview nonetheless.I would not recommend this class to another student. Directed Studies classes are amazing classes with very intelligent students and excellent teacher-student interaction, but they also include mind-numbing amounts of reading and work.If you are willing to give over all of your free time for a semester to learn the classics, then this is the class for you. Otherwise, I would look for a class elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend Directed Studies to a student who enjoys reading, writing, and discussing literature with peers. I personally learned so much through discussion sections and talks with classmates. I would say that Directed Studies is a survey program for the major branches of the humanities.",
    "This class was a challenging, thoroughly worthwhile survey of some of the Western Canon's most important works of literature. Getting through each text feels like a major accomplishment. It's immensely validating and I would recommend it to anyone who feels that he or she has a strong writing ability and a love for literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course! I loved it. All of our lectures were engaging and I really liked that we got to hear all the different professors lecture. The range of opinions was definitely enriching. The reading was substantial, but it wasn't any harder than I was expecting it to be.",
    "A crash course in literature from The Iliad to the Divine Comedy. A lot of work, but definitely worth it. Very much participation based. You have to do the reading or else it is pretty obvious, but I found myself always wanting to do the reading. I was hesitant about DS at first, but am very glad that I took it. It is a great freshman year experience.",
    "Looking back on DS Lit with Professor Neuman, I feel really satisfied with the semester! I wasn't sure about an early morning class on classical literature, but Professor Neuman kept the pace going fast enough that an hour and fifteen minutes passed almost too quickly. The course succeeds in that I feel like I've learned something new about the progression of the Western canon despite the fact that we haven't delved deeper than a couple weeks per book we read. At the end of the semester I know more about my tastes in literature and what I want to pursue afterwards.",
    "DS Literature, first semester, covers the major literary works of the Western world starting from Homer and continuing to Dante. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in literature, beautiful writing, gender issues (and how these problems have been around for ever...), and just humanity in general. Everyone would benefit from a class like this, devoted to understanding changing conceptions in how humans view ourselves.",
    "This is a great class. Neuman is a great guy, and he's really enthusiastic about the material and the class. The semester really builds on itself - by the end you'll feel really intellectually challenged and fulfilled.",
    "Everyone should take DS!",
    "This section is one of the most exciting DS sections. It's amazing to see how Homer's work is built upon by Virgil and then Dante. The Greek tragedies should also be mentioned - those characters are so intriguing! The works are on the whole interesting and really worth digging into which is exactly what sections and DS papers let you do."
