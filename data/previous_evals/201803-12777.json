    "All of life",
    "Extensive knowledge and insights about the world at large! Given the close ties between agrarian studies, political theory, history of globalization, and the recent past of conservation and development efforts. Insights weren't necessarily novel, but articulated in a setting with unifying features and narratives which helped bring things together that I had observed throughout my academic career.",
    "examples of agrarian societies and how they have been transformed through colonialism and capitalism.",
    "I learned a great deal about Agrarian Studies as a(an) (inter)discipline. This course provided a wonderful opportunity to read a lot of great material and discuss with a host of interesting people. The final paper also gave me an opportunity to try writing a research paper in the style of anthropology, a style I have read a lot but not tried writing before.",
    "Critical thinking and appreciation for multidisciplinarity.",
    "This course provided me with a clear framework to understand the evolution of agrarian societies in relation with the formation of the state. Thanks to its interdisciplinary approach, the course structure gave me a wider understanding of how agrarianism has deeply shaped the way in which societies work.",
    "I learned plenty of rural livelihoods in history and in our time, many interesting concepts and writers, as well as experiences from many parts of the world",
    "A detailed and expansive understanding of the political, economic and social frameworks of land relations, indigenous rights, environmentalist, small holder agriculture, big agribusiness, and peasant revolutions. This class builds on social theories from Marx, Foucault, Scott and others to paint a global picture of people and land. This is an intense, upper-level graduate course with large amounts of reading and complex discussions.",
    "understanding ways to present global history; understanding the nuanced meaning of state presence, development, civility, etc.; understanding drivers of social transformation in agrarian societies;"

   "comments": [
    "Far exceeded, my mind was blown every week",
    "Even though I was auditing this class, the knowledge and insights gained in this class exceeded my expectations. No comment RE skills because I audited the class and wasn't graded for assignments.",
    "I was expecting it to be a bit more geared towards people not as familiar with the agrarian studies. Because discussion sections are not focused on only the week's readings and lecture it requires students to have personal experience and research they are drawing on to contribute. This lead to a high level of discussion but difficult for all to engage.",
    "This class completely aligned with my expectations.",
    "The wide-array of students coming from other Yale schools as well as the interdisciplinary faculty team, made this class exceed all my expectations. At first I thought the reflections would be mostly centered in questioning development from an anthropological point of view. However, the weekly readings complemented that with other political, economical, sociological and ethnographic views.",
    "They surpassed my expectations",
    "This was the most difficult class I've taken in my time at FES, though also very worth the effort. Without having a background in social theories, political ecology, and environmental history, I struggled to follow all the lectures and discussion. However, if you want to be a part of this field, this a must-take course and will be a rapid introduction. Just be prepared to work diligently.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strength: diversity of insights from various professors in more or less distinct disciplines, but with shared interests weakness: limited feedback on work throughout course - evidently for graduate students who already have a direction in research and less ideal for others",
    "I appreciate the way the class was structured and the content. The only thing I would have liked more of is reflections from the professors following the other's lectures.",
    "The best part of this course are the student discussions. I really enjoyed that aspect. The lecturers were great--especially Elisabeth Wood's lectures. More Dr. Wood lectures would improve the course!",
    "More attention can be put when developing the syllabus in making sure that the connecting thread between one class and the other leads the student to see things as a process. In some cases, I had the impression that the weekly readings were completely unrelated to the topic of the class, as well as to the rest of the material in the course. Since it is a heavy-reading class - and not all students can afford to buy all the books every week - I would strongly advise to have a repository of online copies of the weekly readings. Also, during the discussion section a better discussion structure would be appreciated. Although there was richness in everything that we discussed, at times it proved difficult for me to express my reflections or questions in an arena where many questions were bouncing all around.",
    "The lecture - discussion format worked very well, although I would have liked a little guidance on how to direct the discussion.",
    "The strengths were the lectures and the excellence of the professors--they are the experts in their field and offer an unprecedented academic experience. I think students need to know beforehand what they are getting into--the first lecture should be a quick and clear overview of important theories and pieces of history that must be understood as the foundation of the course. The professors didn't do this, and I found myself swimming in very unfamiliar waters for most of the class. I eventually caught up, but it took a lot of grasping on my own. This made for participating in the discussions--an intimidating process--quite difficult.",
    "discussions could use a little bit structure while still allowing students to express novel ideas"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. It's a lot of work but a really enjoyable structure - insightful lectures from brilliant professors and then the opportunity to discuss a wide range of topics with engaging and diverse group of peers.",
    "take the class! Its a lot of reading but worth it.",
    "It's a lot of reading. Be prepared for that! Shivi and Libby are much more accessible professors than Jim in terms of giving feedback. It's great! You should take it.",
    "If you can participate in a discussion group with students coming from other schools, you can have the guarantee that it will be fun and challenging, but also very rewarding. Although the amount of pages to read every week is high, don't be discouraged if you finish the book with many questions. Almost all of them will be answered during the lectures or in the discussion group. My last advice would be arrive to the class with a region to focus your work on. Since the region-focus is not exclusive to one part of the world, it resulted to be very helpful for me to know beforehand that I could take more advantage from the readings and lectures with a Latin America focus.",
    "Take time to read some material besides the required ones and find reference works to consult concepts and histories because some knowledge is taken for granted",
    "If you are interested in anything to do with social issues in the environment (colonialism, agriculture, community conservation, protected areas, indigenous rights), take this class. It is a high-level intellectual course, but this is Yale and that's what you are doing here. This is a must for all students interested in being a more well-rounded arbiter of the human systems connected to the earth--this class is a history of land, food, people, and relations.",
