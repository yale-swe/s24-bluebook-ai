    "In many ways, this class taught reading poetry as much as it did writing it. But, importantly, not as two distinct acts; the reading was very creative, in and of itself.",
    "Long poem gave me the chance to experiment with radically different and new forms and styles. Having never tried writing long poems, I was challenged but very rewarded by the end result and by seeing others' work!",
    "An excellent breadth of contemporary poetry and visual art, and a sincere appreciation of the overlap and link between song, prose, poetry, film and visual art."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of the course would definitely be the combination of Professor Rankine and the incredible syllabus she crafted. Professor Rankine is incredible, and I don't really feel like I need to say much more. The syllabus, though equally incredible, wasn't incredible because you knew about it and loved it before you sat down in class. It was incredible because it was filled with things you've never heard of before (if you were like me), and got to experience alongside a class of really engaged students led by an amazing teacher.",
    "Claudia is excellent at assigning interesting readings and setting deadlines that encourage steady progress. However, sometimes workshop schedules got disrupted,which left workshop time uneven, and a difference in experience levels made feedback more challenging for both class and professor.",
    "Strengths of the class are that each person works very hard at their own poem. Weaknesses are that no one really seems to care about anyone else's poems. I have no idea how to remedy this. It's partially the poems: there's a somewhat combative element about the poems themselves, and people are certainly reluctant to open themselves up to complete criticism. More specifically, identity politics as it has worked in our classroom means that people from different backgrounds feel reluctant to write about, comment on, or criticize things outside the boundaries delineated for them by their own particular brands of identity politics. But it does mean that when someone takes that risk, the class gets more exciting, yet more hostile, at the same time."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. If you get in, you have to take it.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a course in which you are fully allowed, by the teacher, to make work that takes time and may not meet conventional standards of what a 'piece of work' looks like at Yale. You can take three weeks to produce three pages of good, thought out poetry. You can produce eight pages, which after good feedback, may be reduced to three pages. You can refine and re-work, withdraw and offer anew. These privileges are extremely rare, so if you want a poetry class which allows for something like breathing room, take this class. Also we were given ice cream once after class this is not trivial."
