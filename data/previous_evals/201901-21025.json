    "Historical and economic foundations of the European Union; challenges in the EU (i.e. Brexit, Eurozone reform); how to write policy position papers",
    "Understanding of the EU and the current politics.",
    "I got a solid overview of the theoretical basis of the European Union and the way it functions in practice. I learned a lot about the issues surrounding Brexit and what needs to be done to improve the stability of the eurozone.",
    "I learnt a lot about the EU and learned how to apply economic theory into practical life situations - relevant in current affairs.",
    "General knowledge about the European Union, specifically the evolution of EU, Brexit, and the European financial crisis",
    "I learned so much about the EU and about general macroeconomic theory.",
    "The course provided a good overview of the current state of the EU with a particular focus on Brexit and the Eurozone crisis. There is a bit of trade economics. The main assignments are position papers, which are like a policy brief you might have to write if you ever actually got a job at the EU\/UN\/US government. Overall, a good course on exactly what it sounds like it's on.",
    "General overview of the development and further integration of the European Union with a strong focus on the Brexit debate and the Eurozone crisis.",
    "Learned a lot about the EU! Specific topics: history and structure of EU politics, macroeconomic trade theory, Brexit, Greek debt crisis and others"

   "comments": [
    "Course does a good job of giving an overview of economics of the EU while forcing the student to think for themselves and come up with concise policy solutions in memos and debates.",
    "The course covers a wide range of super interesting material, from both historical and economic perspectives. Really enjoyed how we learned historical background but also really dove into current day challenges. The debates were great in experiencing firsthand the complexity of these challenges. Besides that, it's a super manageable workload, and Marnix is such an engaging, witty, and intellectual professor! Only weakness? Readings felt disjointed from the course at times.",
    "The strengths are the assessments. Debates are a very good way of learning material and defending your ideas. The oral exam ensures a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. The class could be improved by increased class discussion.",
    "Strengths: Clear instructions for the assignments and the guest speakers. Weaknesses: Most of the lecture sessions did not engage the students as much.",
    "Strength was the small nature and the partner based aspect - I loved getting to know my partner and learning in a small group. Weakness was that grades are super unclear",
    "I thought Professor Amand was super engaging and did a great job answering all our questions. The material was super interesting and the assignments were at times difficult but not overly long. I thought spacing out the assignments a little more would have been nice. Lectures were a little rushed on occasion, so maybe accounting for questions in the timing. Overall, a great class.",
    "Debates truly helped strengthen my understanding of these issues. The textbook is pretty easy to follow in the beginning but becomes rather dense toward the end; luckily the key concepts are further discussed in class, although I did remain unclear on some of the rationale and intuition behind particular concepts. I also learned how to properly prepare a position paper, having never done one before. Only improvement I would say would be to maybe slow down when covering some topics. At times I felt that we blew past entire swaths of information which left the class rather overwhelmed with information and unsure of exactly how to process it in a succinct manner.",
    "There are very few grades in the class, and even while writing this I still have no idea what my final grade might be."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, even if you don't think you know very much about the EU. It was my first global affairs class ever, and I not only learned a lot about economics of the EU but about writing clear and concise policy memos which is a useful life school.",
    "Yes! It's a great seminar about a super interesting topic, and most of the learning actually happens in class, as opposed to some Yale courses where you're expected to teach yourself solely from readings. I came in with close to zero background on the EU, but am leaving with a comfortable understanding of how it functions -- and it's super helpful in framing a lot of concepts from other courses here (e.g. macroeconomics, trade, development, IR, etc.). I find myself super interested in the news about the topics we discussed and feel comfortable explaining\/debating the topics with other people. The assignments are also a lot of fun and completely reasonable (and you get a partner!). GREAT professor who not only knows his stuff inside and out, but is great at teaching it to students.",
    "This was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Prof Amand is excellent and I learnt a lot from him.",
    "If you are remotely interested in European affairs, I would recommend this class to you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course",
    "Yes, definitely take it if you are interested in the EU or just a mix of economics, political science, and global affairs (which is really what this course teaches). Professor Amand is very knowledgeable and nice. There are not too many assignments but be aware that the position papers are not graded easily -- so put in the effort to do a good job.",
    "This definitely gives you a more practical sense of how economic principles play out in real life; I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a sort of \"applied economics\" course that bridges the gap between theory and reality.",
    "Yes"
