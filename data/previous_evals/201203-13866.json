    "This is a seminar course that is meant to provide students with a survey of interesting areas of focus with CDE and SBS. It seems that its main objective is to get students thinking about what kind of research they would like to pursue and who they should speak to if they are interested in a particular subject. This is accomplished by bringing speakers who are Yale faculty and who conduct their own research to present their work."

    "I think it is helpful to understand what is going on the field and what YSPH researchers are working on. I particularly liked the guest speakers.",
    "The seminars were ok - there weren't many of them though. The topics were usually fairly interesting and it seemed like an ok way to spend an hour over lunch. I would have really liked to hear Megan Smith speak though - I wish that lecture hadn't been canceled.",
    "good diversity of topics",
    "Speakers were great, especially Alice Miller and the last one on HIV in MSM",
    "there weren't enough SBS seminars",
    "The seminars were a good introduction to work being done by faculty.",
    "The course is helpful to get a glimpse of how research is conducted in epidemiology and the areas some of the faculty work on. Nevertheless, I would prefer to have the seminars more frequently so as to know more about the research areas of the faculty.",
    "I loved the SBS faculty panel at the beginning of the semester!! It provided me with a general understanding of each faculty member's research focus. Although this info is available online, it was more interesting to hear it directly from them. I also liked that each of them were direct about research\/thesis opportunities.I enjoyed the Dean's lecture, but I was really looking forward to Megan Smith's talk. Hopefully, this will be rescheduled for next semester.Although I am SBS, I attended the talk about measurement issues and I loved the speaker!! She gave an interesting talk, but she was also an amazing person that seemed to really care about students.",
    "the food was pretty gross",
    "I think there must be a way to make this seminar more relevant to students. One session was spent having instructors introduce themselves and their specialties, which I felt like could have been done in an email. The lecture with Ally Miller and the Dean's lecture were good and informative. An hour isn't really much time to be introduced to a topic and then have a thoughtful discussion about it, though. It might be more interesting for students to learn what kind of jobs might await students in the SBS concentration and hear from someone in the field. Most presenters are not from school of public health (they were from psychology or law backgrounds). Students in school of public health are rarely exposed to professionals who have only an MPH, which is somewhat discouraging. It seems like we also have to get an MD to do something productive in the field.",
    "Good overview of the department",
    "good",
    "The seminars were very interesting and were a great way to see current research in our Department at YSPH.",
    "The seminars were a good way to bring the SBS group together. Interesting topics were covered and having food there was also a good thing.",
    "Great course - very interesting projects discussed and a great way to know what kind of research is being conducted at YSPH.",
    "Subjects of seminars varied considerably, might have benefitted from a more cohesive structure. Dr. Xiaomei Ma's overview of different topics she performs research on may be a good guide for this. Overall the course did have lots of interesting material and I enjoyed attending."
