   "comments": [
    "Take English 120! Everyone's writing will improve with the amount of individualized attention you get; professors (Stephen Longmire, although I think this is true of all of them) give long, thoughtful comments and edits. There aren't many classes that allow this amount of personality in your writing, and this is the perfect segue into creative writing--although the essays are non-fiction, the course teaches you to write from your own perspective, and you leave with a nice portfolio of short pieces and a lot of writing tips.",
    "Very enjoyable course if you like writing, arguing, making a point.",
    "I highly recommend English 120 to students who want to improve their writing as well as learn to write in a format generally not taught in other courses.",
    "I took the course because I had no previous experience with non-fiction, but I would not recommend the course to students who are already familiar with non-fiction.",
    "The course itself is good-the workload is manageable and it does improve your writing skills. The professor can make or break the class though!"
