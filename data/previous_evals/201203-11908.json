   "comments": [
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS. DO IT. If you're good at science, go away. If you actually struggle with topics in science, then this class is for you.",
    "Best class ever. Easy. You learn a lot. Science Requirement.Take it.Period.",
    "It is a course that helps you understand very, very fundamental concepts of science. It was a great course, one that I very much enjoyed going to each day. Everything about this course is manageable. Rick Casten will become one of your favorite professors. He is very passionate and helpful.",
    "Painfully easy. Like to the point where you feel like you might not do that well because you don't really know what it is you should be learning. Like you just need to memorize physics like he talks about it, not actually grasp things. Which I really think its nicer when people make you actually get ideas.",
    "PHYS 116 is a very basic examination of the core principles of physics. However, it moves very slowly, even for people who struggle with scientific ideas, and frequent distractions cause the class to move slower still. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking for an easy science credit, this class may be for you, but by the end of the semester you might be wondering whether you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve made good use of your time.",
    "Definitely take it if you were very curious about physics but too intimidated to give it a shot. Also a gem for a science credit.",
    "really good introductory physics class covering a wide range of everyday topics. short weekly problem sets. definitely take this class if you can fit it into your schedule",
    "If you are in need of a Science credit but are not willing to put in hours of work or take an extremely dull gut class, take this!",
    "BEST SCIENCE CLASS FOR A NON-SCIENCE MAJOR. NOT JOKING.",
    "Yes. I have never recommended a course more strongly than I am recommending this one. Just take this class.",
    "A great class for understanding physics principles and the way they apply to daily life. Easy workload and accessible course material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Being a non-science major, it was a great way for me to get a science credit while giving me a good basic understanding of many physics concepts.",
    "This is a great class to understand phenomena in the world. Professor Casten is great - funny and patient - and I enjoyed going to class each day.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is fun, enjoyable and a great class. Prof Casten forms great relationships with his students and makes each class intersting!",
    "The best class at Yale.",
    "Yes! Professor Casten is absolutely amazing. He is funny, sincere, and will care about you so much.",
    "If you're looking for a science credit, DEFINITELY take this course. I actually really really enjoyed it and I'm not a science person at all.",
    "A fun time, not too difficult.",
    "Take it! It's great.",
    "A great course for non-science majors! Of course I'd recommend it!"
