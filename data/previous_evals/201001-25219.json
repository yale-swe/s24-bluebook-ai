    "I would totally recommend it, it's been a great individual experience.",
    "I worked at the Child Conduct Clinic. It was a nice change of pace from normal classes. Everyone there is really nice and makes your time enjoyable. You also get to have a good relationship with a professor which can be hard in psych given all the large lectures.",
    "Yes!",
    "This is now required for the psychology major but if you're not interested in doing research it's a great way to complete the requirement. As long as you find an advisor who you're familiar with and who is chill, the credit is very easy to get. All you have to do is write a 20 page paper the whole semester. SO DON'T LEAVE IT UNTIL THE END!! Start writing early!",
    "Yes - I highly suggest this course if the student is organized, independent, and very interested in the topic at hand."
