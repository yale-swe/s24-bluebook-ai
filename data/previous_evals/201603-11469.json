   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Learned some more about quantum mechanics.",
    "I learned about several advanced physics concepts which were built upon the material for Quantum I, and learned how to manage time for doing psets",
    "The class is probably exactly what you think it is. You learn how to apply the quantum topics you learned in 440 to multiple particles. There are some topics that are extremely interesting and some that are pretty boring, but you will definitely develop a better natural qualitative understanding of what is happening in 2-particle quantum systems.",
    "This course focused a lot on getting an intuitive grasp of the material -- understanding what was going on in a qualitative sense before jumping into the quantative --which was something I really liked. It also kind of filled the gaps between stat mech. And quantum 1, and you start to see how it all fits together which is kind of exciting!",
    "A little bit of many body quantum, perturbation theory, and scattering were covered. Overall, I feel than this course did not cover an adequate amount of material in any of these sections.",
    "I learned more quantum mechanics!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Could benefit from more clear lectures. In particular, it often felt like we started doing some type of physics before saying what the set-up of the situation was.",
    "Teaching was a bit disorganized, but material is important.",
    "I think the professor was very helpful and made sure we had nailed the most important concepts we needed to know! Perhaps some pset questions required further clarification from the professor, but overall it was good!",
    "Prof. Lamoreaux isn't the best lecturer I've had, but he is happy to answer any questions brought up in class, and if he has trouble articulating it, Ben our TF almost always gives a very concise satisfying answer. The tests were very fair and the homework wasn't too much. Overall I think the class did well to teach the material.",
    "Strength- tailored to the most important concepts needed for quantum 2. Weakness - lectures were at times unclear and incomprehensible",
    "Strength: a lot of physics courses I've taken have gone through a ton of material without really emphasizing the important take aways. In this class, on the other hand, the important bits are drilled into your head so you will never forget them. Its nice because you know what to study, plus if later on I was to be given a quantum II question (like on the GRE) I could use the foundational principles I will most certainly remember to figure out whatever is being asked. Basically by the end you will have a strong mastery of what you should have a strong mastery of. Weakness: some parts (particularly toward the end of the semester) felt a bit rushed. I think it might have been worth it to cut out one chapter just so we could have worked a little bit longer on the material covered at the end.",
    "Strengths: the material, the first half of the textbook. Weaknesses: the last fourth of Griffiths Quantum Mechanics.",
    "Strengths: None. Weaknesses: Poor text (Griffiths is terrible for the last half), unclear and unhelpful lecture, boring algebraic and uninspiring home works. This class would be improved by its complete deletion from the curriculum.",
    "I frequently wondered why a course in quantum mechanics would be offered MWF for only 50 minutes at a time -- this forced Lamoreaux to have to rush through derivations or cut them halfway through at the end of lecture, and also made me generally cranky by spending more time walking to and from class than actually attending it. That aside, quantum mechanics II is kind of a tedious course by nature - it's a lot of perturbative techniques which are very mathematically intensive. Lamoreaux liked to pick problems that consisted of doing a lot of algebra and very little physics to verify something intuitively obvious, and then he'd pepper in some problems involving complex roundabout steps that nobody could guess without him explaining the entire problem in class for us ahead of time. Because I'm afraid I sound overly critical, I'd like to point out that the class had a great non-competitive feel - although tedious and occasionally ambiguously worded, the psets encouraged students to work together, and the exams never offered any big surprises or impossible time constraints."

   "comments": [
    "Most students who take this course don't have a choice, so...",
    "It's obviously required for physics majors, but I think that others with time and interest would also get a lot out of this class!",
    "The class was fine. Not too much work, but sometimes it gets so esoteric that you might get completely lost until you have to apply the topics to your problem sets. The homework load is fair and overall the topics aren't too hard. Honestly if you're reading this, you have to take the class anyway since it's required for the intensive physics major; don't worry about it too much.",
    "Certainly! The material is fascinating and the professor is enthusiastic. Whats not to like?",
    "Take it if you have to. Otherwise, assuming you're coming from 440, just finish reading Griffiths on your own. To be fair, professor Lamoreaux did introduce some techniques not in Griffiths. They were clever and concise, but without a written text on them, hard to learn.",
    "No. I would never recommend this class to anyone ever. It was slow, uninspiring, and taught so slowly that I could have covered everything we learned in less than a week. Both the professor and book were bad. Literally nothing redeeming.",
    "If you liked quantum mechanics I, this course is also interesting - lots of perturbation theory and ugly math, but a peek into approximate solutions to real world problems (whereas quantum I offers only the hydrogen atom, this goes into fine structure, the helium atom, the electron gas, blackbody radiation, etc)."
