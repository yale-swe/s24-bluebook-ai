    "Take this class! Take it! You get to take advantage of the resources the Peabody has to offer (like its invertebrate and vertebrate fossil collections... holy cow) and you get to hang out with Derek Briggs, the man, the myth, the legend of invertebrate paleontology. The class is so cool and totally worth the 3 hour block. You also get to work on your art skills a little bit, since you spend so much time examining specimens in detail.",
    "Assuming you're in G&G 125--definitely take the lab. Not only does it supplement what you're learning in 125, but also it gives you tangible evidence of what's going on evolutionarily and especially if you're a kinesthetic learner like me it really helps to actually have what you're learning about right in front of you. You also get a lot of experience and insight as to how paleontologists do their work, and it sheds light on science and paleontology as a discipline and as a profession. Lastly, who doesn't want to touch fossils???",
    "A simple lab, although 3 hours on a Thursday is admittedly a drag. If you're in the lecture, you should strongly consider the lab - it should probably be mandatory, but I'm sure that would kill enrollment.",
    "If you're taking G&G 125 and can fit the lab into your schedule, definitely take it. It provides a hands-on review of the material covered in the lecture, and those of us who took the lab benefited from this increased exposure. The labs can be a bit stressful at times (expect to always be rushing to answer 15+ questions with sketches and descriptions), but in the end it was a very rewarding experience.",
    "If you're going to take the lecture, definitely also take this lab course. It was fundamental to my understanding of the lecture topics, but also stands alone as a great and interesting class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this lab as a great way to engage in the material covered in the History of Life lecture class. Labs were largely contained to the weekly time slot, and the teaching staff was great."
