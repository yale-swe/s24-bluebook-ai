    "This class offers a great opportunity to complete research and work to answer many pressing environmental questions. I benefited from the collaborative relationship I built with my team members and the frequent communication with my supervisor and client.",
    "Practice consulting, real life experience with a client, a chance to delve more deeply into research about something that matters to a student.",
    "The best part of this course is the professional experience it provides to students. I feel like this course will be much more useful to me in the long run than many other FES courses I've taken. It also provides students who are interested in underrepresented areas (like marine policy) with an avenue to study that topic and develop useful skills for their careers.",
    "Working directly with clients. Feeling useful.",
    "This course is fantastic - there are a variety of projects with employers all over the US and the world to choose from, so you get to work on a subject you care about while having the support of excellent faculty. As a bonus, you may get to work with a potential future employer."

Additionally, FES has a woefully underdeveloped curriculum for students interested in oceans compared to competitors from which it allegedly hopes to recruit prospective students (Duke & UCSB). I don't think FES will address this (damaging and frankly misguided) gap anytime soon, but until then EPC provides the perfect opportunity for ocean-focused FES students to work on marine policy projects for academic credit.",

   "comments": [
    "The group work is arguably the highlight of the course. With the right project, the course can be extremely fulfilling. In my case, I have benefited from my project and it opens a door to further career development.",
    "Ability to work on a team as part of a larger project. Difficulties arose from balancing abilities, knowledge and time to give to the project.",
    "We all had very different skills and interests which made the project more interesting",
    "Though working on a semester-long group project is challenging, I learned a great deal about how to manage time through setting benchmarks and meeting agendas, and dividing tasks between the three of us.",
    "I grew a lot from my collaboration in this course. The most challenging aspect of group work was managing expectations. I felt insecure about my understanding of legal research throughout the semester because I worried that my work would not measure up to that of my YLS colleague. My biggest personal lesson came from appreciating the different strengths we all brought to our team.",
    "It was a really great group experience. Scheduling has been very challenging, but otherwise I have no complaints.",
    "Advantages included having others to bounce your ideas off of and spread the work around. Disadvantages included varying levels of familiarity\/expertise with the project material. I found that even within our team we developed \"silos,\" i.e. where certain students were doing exclusively legal research and others were doing scientific research. I don't think there was any feasible way to avoid this in a short (semester) timespan, but I do think these types of silos are a chronic problem in environmental conservation\/policy. I wished I'd had time to dive into the material I wasn't familiar with, in addition to the material that I felt comfortable researching. In a professional setting I hope I will have the ability to do this.",
    "Group work in the clinic is the same as working on a professional team - you don't necessarily choose who you're working with, and they can be great, frustrating, or both."
