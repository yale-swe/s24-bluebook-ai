    "It's a great class and gives you a lot of information about Public Health in America.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. The lectures are interesting, as are the readings (usually, and the few that were really dull weren't that long), and I feel like I learned a ton. I felt like I was always quoting some information I learned in this class to my friends\/family. It's also not that much work on a daily basis, and the final paper is great because you can literally write about whatever you want.",
    "This is a very interesting class. The lectures can be somewhat disjointed, and the vast amount of material can make the overall sense of the class less cohesive. However, it is clear that Professor Rogers really has done extensive research on the subject, and her focus on more marginalized groups is fascinating.",
    "Yes. Great lectures, manageable workload.",
    "The class is a good public health survey for anyone interested in medicine\/public health. The lectures are interesting, and they are usually fast-paced. There's a lot of information on the slides, so it's impossible to get all of it in your notes. It's probably a good idea to come to class every day because none of the lectures are posted online. All you can download are short summaries of lectures, which are just basically lists of terms. They aren't very helpful unless you went to class to begin with. Other than that, there's not too much work associated with the class. The readings are very manageable and usually pretty entertaining.",
    "Workload is average, pretty interesting course but there is A LOT of reading. Tests are doable if you prepare ahead of time",
    "I would summarize the class as basically American History from a medical viewpoint. It's good if you want a broad survey of public health!",
    "Great class. Definitely take it",
    "Very good course in terms of material. Lectures were interesting and tests were fair. Try to get a good TA, otherwise sections are deadly.",
    "Naomi Rogers has a structured set up forthis class that works pretty well. Basically you have about 50 pages of reading a week (sometimes 25, sometimes 75, but far less than the average history class and not as dense) on two different topics (like smallpox and yellow fever, or leprosy and mental illness), which are the two lectures, and then you have one section in which you discuss themes from the reading and lectures. The HSHM department is great, and Rogers is an engaging speaker and the reading is pretty interesting. The only grades are section, midterm, final, and final paper. In general, the topics are relevant and interesting, especially later in the semester, and you never get bored of one subject. A lot of people take a random Public Health class and fall in love with HSHM. This is a great intro class for that, especially if you\u0092ve taken US History since it\u0092s basically just that through the lens of public health. The midterm was five out of seven IDs (paragraphs on ideas, people, or events) and an essay connecting themes from that material and the final was seven out of 10 IDs, an essay connecting themes from the second half of the semester, and an essay from the whole semester. Both were fine. The final paper is 10 pages on anything of your choosing and is pretty independent, though my TA was especially resourceful.",
    "yes!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Great intro to public health! Take this class if you are even remotely interested in public health or American history.",
    "This class is really interesting, a great intersection between American history and scientific history. Lecture is never boring, Prof. Rogers is engaging and presents the information in a really straightforward way (though she talks really fast andit's sometimes little hard to keep up). The workload is really manageable, just a midterm, final, and 10 page paper and really light reading once a week. Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in the subject, it's definitely worth it. You'll learn a lot of fun interesting facts and get a new perspective on public health in America (or gain one totally if you don't have one now)!",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Prof. Rogers is a fantastic lecturer and makes class really exciting! I definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in American history or public health. The connections to other aspects of American history are absolutely fascinating!",
    "This is an excellent, excellent course. The format is straight forward (go to lecture, go to section, take the midterm, write one paper, take the final), but the material is definitely interesting and nuanced. Prof. Rogers is an excellent lecturer (she moves really fast!) and there's a lot of material, so you definitely have to go, but it's totally worth it because the material is fascinating if you're interesting in Public Health.I definitely recommend this course.",
    "The topics are interesting, albeit consistently depressing. Lectures simply consist of the professor talking VERY QUICKLY and flipping through slides VERY QUICKLY from the minute class starts to the minute class ends. However, the course packet is extremely fun to read and consists of a variety of sources, not just the route history textbook reading that seems to be expected. 1 midterm, 1 final, and 1 massive research paper...which seems fine until it is reading week and you realize that you still have 70% + of the course to go in terms of your grade.",
    "This is an interesting overview of all of the public health issues in America since the early 1800s. Fairly easy if you go to class and take notes, the professor talks really fast so bring a computer. Only a midterm, final, and 10 page paper, plus section. Take it!!!",
    "history of public health in america, covers a broad range of topics, lots of information to remember but i would recommend the class",
    "An interesting course on the history of American public health. Kind of repetitive at times if you've already taken other HSHM classes.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Naomi is a great lecturer, don't be thrown off by the weird intro lecture. Attend the second class during reading week to get an idea of what the course is actually like. The material is really interesting and the workload is definitely manageable. I did almost all the reading because I actually enjoyed it.",
    "Very interesting course that traces the course of public health in America from its initial development in the 18th century to its modern challenges. Surprised that public health wasn't always around or wonder how it started? Take this class. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Relevant interesting readings, well-presented lectures (some of which are quite mind-blowing), lots of things every person ought to know about the history of health and the interplay of race, economic class, and medicine. Professor Rogers is an excellent lecturer and the TAs are quite good too. Workload wise, midterm, final and 10-page essay on pretty much anything related to public health in America.",
    "It is an interesting class that has a reasonably light work load.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! This class was fun to attend, and section with Debbie was great. It covers a lot of fascinating topics, and the reading load is not only totally manageable, but usually really interesting, too. Take this class!",
    "Not too bad. There is a paper, a midterm and a final. The midterm is not bad. Plan ahead for the paper. Go to section.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's well-organized, interesting, and the expectations for the class are very clear. Plus, it's a pretty standard workload.",
    "If you have even an inkling of interest, take it. Fabulous course.",
    "There is a lot of information in the course, but the majority of it is engaging. The readings relate well to the lecture, if you have an interest in American history or medicine, you will find this class interesting.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It covers a lot of material, but it is very interesting, and the exams are fairly straight-forward. I would advise students not to underestimate the amount of time the paper takes, as the expectations are high. However, having the freedom to choose our own paper topics made the process enjoyable. Difficult, but enjoyable.",
    "Definitely recommended, for a really thorough look at public health and its historical implications. Professor Rogers is really engaging and the material resonates today. Also, the class is not too much work\u0097the readings each week are pretty short, and interesting.",
    "I took this course just because it looked interesting. I have no plans to become a HSHM or science major, but I still learned a lot. This class provides a new and interesting angle on history--how public health has shaped public policy and affected the nation through history. There is a research paper but it is manageable as long as you keep up on deadlines recommended by your T.A.",
    "Good course!",
    "This course was a great overview of United States public health. I highly suggest it to anyone interested in public health, and it is a must-take for HSHM majors and pre-meds."
