    "CHIN 162 will help improve your Chinese writing skills. Every one\/twoish weeks you go through a chapter in the textbook. In class, Su LaoShi cold calls for exercises in the book. Each week you either have a presentation or paper, Quia exercises, pre-quiz for lessons and dictation. Although this sounds like a lot of work, it is manageable. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Chinese skills.",
    "Just take it! The workload is light and the tests very manageable. Get to know the other students! Our class had a lot of fun because we all liked each other and became friends. You won't get to practice speaking very much. But you'll hear a lot of great stories and cultural + historical tidbits from Su laoshi. He's lived a super fascinating life and is keen on sharing.",
    "I highly recommend this course! Even if it's been a while since you last did any consistent Chinese practice, if you tested into this course or are progressing into it, it will only take a chapter or two of course material to get you right back into the swing of things. The tests are challenging but very fair, and the same goes for homework and in-class assignments. You'll love Su Laoshi's teaching style and will feel completely at home once you get to know your class a little.",
    "I really enjoyed my CHNS 162 class, and I would recommend it to anyone who is dedicated to improving their Chinese. The workload was decently heavy, but it became very manageable because it follows a pattern that is established from the very first lesson. You can definitely get by with doing the bare minimum, but you get from this class what you put in. I found the class to be very rewarding because I saw how dramatically my Chinese improved over such a short period of time. Su Laoshi is fun and good-natured, and his stories and jokes make the class entertaining and much less tedious than it could have been."
