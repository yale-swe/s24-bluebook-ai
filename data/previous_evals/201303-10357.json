   "comments": [
    "This course covers a range of current issues and questions for future diplomats. It focuses primarily on political things, rather than questions of how embassies are organized, etc. and has a large emphasis on war, conflict, terrorism, and the Middle East.I would recommend it, though know that there is somewhat limited discussion on topics outside of the ones mentioned above (only one week on the environment, and even that was largely tied to conflict, for instance).",
    "I wouldn't recommend you take this class. It has an outrageous amount of reading, the assignments are corny& repetitive, and Grossman is a rather harsh grader. Didn't matter whether I put in 5 minutes or 5 hours on an assignment, I received the same grade on everything I handed in. As a teacher, he's somewhat boring and the seminar was much less a discussion and much more student presentations with him talking at us for an hour or so to kill the time. Poor class overall, there are plenty of better ones out there",
    "This was a really interesting class, taught by a practitioner in the field. We covered topics that are extremely pertinent in today's world and discussed how diplomacy can be used as a tool to affect them. The projects, a role play and a presentation that required you to contact diplomats, were challenging, but extremely rewarding. I would recommend this course, but caution that you are expected to do a lot of reading (200-300 pages a week) from many sources. In general, it is interesting reading, but some of the more abstract pieces can be difficult to connect it back to the class.",
    "Great class with a great professor. The class is challenging and will keep you on your toes throughout the semester, but it was very worth it. You'll learn a lot about international affairs and the practice of diplomacy.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student, even if they were not global affairs majors. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and liked the fact that the topics changed from week to week and covered a wide range of issues related to diplomacy. Although there was a lot of reading, Amb. Grossman did a great job at highlighting the most important important parts during class discussions. The role play exercises were also surprisingly rewarding",
    "I would tell another prospective student that 21st Century Diplomacy is a course for those interested in seeing the nitty-gritty details of how modern diplomacy works, as well as for those interested in understanding all aspects of this subject. Ambassador Grossman provides extensive knowledge and expertise of the subject at hand to the class, and he instructs students on the good, bad and ugly of diplomacy as it exists today. He draws on current subject matter experts in the field to conduct real-time discussions during class, at times, and these have all been beneficial.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course without reservation. Whether one wants to enter the Foreign Service, Civil Service, Intelligence Community, or even politics, the unique exposure one gains to the complexities of twenty-first century diplomacy is critical.",
    "I would recommend this course, though I feel some changes should be made (see above).",
    "One of the best classes I took at Yale. Professor Grossman is extremely engaging and will provide excellent anectodes and advice on your assignment. Definitely take it if it is ever offered again.",
    "The opportunity to learn from someone of Amb. Grossman's caliber, experience and influence is a rare privilege that you would be remiss to forgo. Especially if you are thinking of any sort of career in the foreign service\/national security apparatus, this class is a must take. Reading list is fantastic, assignments are very rewarding, and the overall workload is lighter than you'd expect. Definitely one of the better classes I've taken at Yale."
