   "comments": [
    "I know far more about different historians than before (frankly I know more than I would have expressed interest in knowing before DS), but more importantly, I think I've learned how to push myself in examining an author's intent. I'm not sure if I actually improved in expressing that understanding based on my ongoing paper struggle, but something was definitely internalized.",
    "Seeing patterns and digressions in political thought.",
    "It expanded my understanding of modern politics, showing me how relevant ancient ideas about politics are and how they have influenced societies and governments today. The class was fascinating and definitely improved my writing. I learned how to write a more politically and historically oriented paper as opposed to literary or philosophical writing.",
    "I think the greatest skill I picked up over the length of this course was the ability to think about historical and political writing as thematic, and how best to trace these themes across different works and eras.",
    "The main things I developed during this course was an appreciation for the interplay between different aspects of historical and political thought and how foundational elements of philosophy, like the Republic, can fit in. Before I took this course, I didn't have that much of an appreciation for the the historical context of a work, and especially didn't think to look at the way the author approached and (mis)interpreted the works of previous thinkers. Professor Smith particularly emphasized these aspects, as well as how They pertained to both regime type and justice, which was particularly valuable to me.",
    "Steven Smith definitely teaches you how to effectively participate in Seminar. He secretly records who speaks, so speak at least once.",
    "My ability to closely analyze difficult texts significantly improved, as did my writing.",
    "Context and connecting themes throughout texts",
    "Prior to this course, I had no experience in historical and political thought. What this course did was provide me with a basic understanding of the subject. Not only did I learn the major themes and questions of historians and political theorists, but I also learned how to take contemporary events and frame them in the perspective of Western thought.",
    "I learned to look at historical texts differently because of the range of styles and interpretations we saw. I learned to read carefully and think critically about historical themes.",
    "Great insight into the ways to approach history and political thought.",
    "The course gives a very strong introduction to some of the seminal texts of the western canon. My writing definitely improved after writing three papers."

   "comments": [
    "One of my favorite parts of DS this semester was the four weeks spent on Plato's Republic, first in philosophy and then in HP. Reading the same text through two different lenses was really interesting, especially since the classes focused on such different aspects. Obviously, I recognize that most texts aren't as equally relevant to both texts, but more conversation between disciplines could be really valuable. Also, while I loved HP section, I think the HP lectures were often the weakest of the three.",
    "Because we read so many works in chronological order, we're able to see how earlier writers influenced later ones and how the study of history and politics evolved over time. But this also means that we had to read and discuss a huge body of work in very little time. I think it would be helpful to have a kind of check-in maybe every two or three weeks for 10 minutes at the end of a section to review themes and connections in the works we've read thus far. This would add to our overall perspective and understanding during the course in addition to helping prepare us for the final.",
    "Strengths works chosen that were thematically close, in conversation with each other, and rather interesting; great professors, great lectures; a historic aspect that gives insight into Greek and Roman history without being a Greek and Roman history course. Weaknesses the fragmented nature with which we read many of the works so that we get the most important bits and pieces of each work; how the lecture and discussion sections were scheduled so that we were almost always lectured on works that we had not yet read unless we were ahead in our reading.",
    "This course was my favorite one this semester, and so, in my mind, had an enormous amount of strengths. I loved having Professor Smith as an instructor, since he was excellent both at explaining the intents of the different authors we read and especially at encouraging us to think about the relationships between the different authors. The other major strength was the way the works seemed to flow into one another, with Thucydides contrasting himself to Herodotus, Aristotle to Plato, and so on. The on weakness was the transition into Christian thought, which I thought could have been slightly better guided and had one or two Roman works from the Christian period for contrast.",
    "Smith definitely has an agenda when teaching great books -- not necessarily a political one, but an ideological one. Fun to see a different way of looking at things.",
    "Professor Smith is a tremendously good instructor. He does a terrific job of breaking down the essentials of a text, facilitating and engaging in class discussion, putting ideas in context, and opening the door to alternative readings or new ideas.",
    "A lot of reading, which is good because we cover a wide amount of material, but because there was so much we had to move really quickly and I don't feel like I got a great grasp of the material.",
    "The chief strength of this course is that it constructs narratives that bind together the various books that we read. Questions broached by Plato or Herodotus are picked up by Al-Farabi and Machiavelli. Seeing how each writer approaches these running narratives makes the course reading and the course itself enjoyable and intriguing. The chief weakness of the course is that some of the works that we read did not seem relevant to the narratives. Polybius, Augustine, and Maimonides in particular did not seem to offer much that could be discussed in great detail.",
    "I thought it was useful to read parts of the texts together because I missed details reading on my own. I also liked the structure of our discussions, Prof Smith's questions were often illuminating and helpful. I would have liked to have understood what kinds of things (theme, style, etc.) to look for while reading on my own, especially at the beginning.",
    "I enjoyed the history a lot and wish it was more of that rather than political philosophy. The lack of context also made things feels less enjoyable."

    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Honestly, I came into DS thinking HP was going to be my least favorite class, but while it wasn't my favorite DS track, I ended up really enjoying it. Professor Smith is fantastic and made waking up for 9 am section easier. These weren't my favorite texts, but I know they were for a lot of other people (especially if you're interested in political science). Regardless, I really did come to appreciate even the authors that I didn't necessarily love right away and am definitely glad I stuck with DS.",
    "Yes, Professor Smith is great.",
    "I would recommend this course. I've gained a better understanding on politics, the study of history, and how both have evolved over time. It was a fascinating class, and the texts we read inspired engaging discussions.",
    "Obviously, to take this course would necessitate being in DS in general, so I will answer this question in a more general DS way: yes, I would recommend DS, but only if you're a particular kind of person with a particular set of interests. Even if you know you don't want to major in a humanities subject, DS is a great way to get general requirements filled. The more important intellectual interest is in understanding where pivotal ideas of the West have come from, how they came to be, and who and what they were influenced by in coming to be (also, a tolerance for a West-centric curriculum with the understanding that this is not the only important intellectual tradition). It's a lot of work, a lot of reading, but worth it. I don't know for sure if I'll be continuing with DS next semester, but I'm very glad I did it this semester, if only because I would have little other reason to read the works I did, and I'm glad I did.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, both on its own merits and as a part of DS as a whole. History has always been a favorite subject of mine, and this section greatly expanded my understanding of both history's place in the greater context of philosophy as well as the other influences which shape the thought in those works.",
    "Definitely take this course with Smith -- one of the best DS teachers available!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. The texts we read are all fascinating, and the essays are a good way to take your grasp of the concepts one step further.",
    "Yes, we cover a lot of material and you will leave with a solid understanding of ancient history and politics",
    "Yes, I found it difficult but very rewarding.",
    "If they enjoy political philosophy yes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is considering Directed Studies. The workload is heavy, but interesting, and worth the effort put in. Take it with Professor Smith if you can - he is encouraging, and leads a great discussion section."
