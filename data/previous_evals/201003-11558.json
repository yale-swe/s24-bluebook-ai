    "This was a really high-workload, client-oriented course. If the clients are great, the course is enjoyable...if the clients are difficult (as mine were), the course is very difficult. However, I still learned an enormous amount about both the issue area that I researched and about working with clients. I may have learned more lessons about working with clients as a result of having difficult, demanding ones! That being said, the course was high-stress and high-work, especially towards the end of the semester, and crowded out some of my other obligations."

    "The best things about this course included the experimental and hands-on learning of the clinic, the guest speakers, and the field trip to the Natural Resources Defense Council in NYC. I enjoyed my clinic working group, all of whom were very dedicated, intelligent and responsible teammates. I learned first-hand how to conduct legal research and legal writing. I was grateful for the importance of the project we were given and how our work will actually benefit our clients and their environmental advocacy.",
    "Learn practical skill to work with clients",
    "Great opportunity to work on real, timely issues.",
    "flexibility, choices, actually working with organizations",
    "The instuctor has a nice casual conversation style of presenting the material. Professor Elliot is a very intesting person to listen to in class, and probalby out of class too.",
    "The project was extremely interesting. And the working group was also great.",
    "Learning about working with demanding legal clients."

    "A TA would have been good to have in the class for some logistical support. There were some house keeping items which were in limbo. There was some switching of the sylabus, I had to figure out the Inside YLS site myself, and also the web exam procedure.I realize it is the classic law school format, but I don't think having the entire grade based on a final exam makes me learn as much as classes with multiple exams and class papers.",
    "The lectures\/speakers. I did not find them particularly useful, because they did not appeal to all students. Also the moot court exercise should be done at the begining when students can spend more time preparing. Otherwise the exercise is not taken seriously because there is too much work going on.",
    "Learning about working with demanding legal clients. More explicit teaching on how to handle consultant-client relations and problems would have been MUCH appreciated."

    "Simi Bhat, the TA, was extremely helpful. She definitely helped to lead the clinic through the entire process, particularly making sure we were up to date on what to expect each week. She also took extra time to meet with my clinic group a couple of times to make sure we were clarifying tasks with our clients and to give a 2-hour workshop on how to conduct legal research.",
    "Instructor and TA were both available most of the time.",
    "I never contacted the professor.",
    "it was excellent",
    "Great. We met in project teams with one or both of the profs every other week, and the TA was super-available, including spending an entire morning providing my FES-heavy team with a crash course on legal citations."

    "This was a very important and valuable course for my academic program here at Yale FES, especially given my interest in applying to law school. I have had a number of policy related courses and a couple of law classes, but this was my very first clinical course which gave me a greater understanding and appreciation for environmental law and advocacy.",
    "It gives me a backgroud to environmental law and complements my studies.",
    "For someone interested in environmental policy it was great. Not only are you working on current issues, but you get practical experience from working with clients as well as working with groups.",
    "You look at environmental policy issues from a legal perspective...a very good angle to add to your policy toolkit."

I also took this course because I am interested in hands-on environmental advocacy and I am also planning to pursue a law degree after FES.",

    "the advantages were that we were all very interested in the subject and had something to add. There was good synergy among group members. We also were disciplined.",

    "Try to get a good client! And come to the profs\/TAs early and often with issues--they were very good at helping us resolve difficulties in our client relationships, even helping us moderate a phone call in which we hashed out and clarified issues."
