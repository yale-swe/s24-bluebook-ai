    "I would definitely recommend this class. I'm a humanities major who took it for a science credit because I was turned off by a lot of the \"fake science\" lectures. This class required slightly more work than most science offerings, but it was far more rewarding. It was small, the professor was helpful and attentive, the material was interesting, and the labs\/fieldtrips were fun. Don't be scared away by the fact that it's on science hill- it's an approachable (even enjoyable) course that's definitely worth the effort, and it's about a lot more than just rocks.",
    "Surveys geology from rocks to atmosphere in a good, necessary way. I would recommend it",
    "For those students interested in geology, earth sciences, or environmental studies, I would recommend this course because of the breadth of material that it covers. It serves as a good foundation and launching point for these fields. There is a new course, I think it's G&G 200, that will be offered in the spring which covers much of the same stuff, so either would be an option. This is not the greatest geology class you will ever take, but it is a good intro and the stuff is worth knowing.",
    "This class isn't difficult, but there is a lot of material to know. The lecture isn't super inspiring, but if you like the material enough you will enjoy the class anyway. The field trips are really cool and really cement the material.Overall, I'd recommend this class if you're interested in the material and want something really different than lots of other sciences, but slightly more legitimate as a science than some of the porn in the morn type science classes."
