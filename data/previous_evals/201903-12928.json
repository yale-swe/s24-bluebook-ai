    "Basic background in proof-based mathematics, basic concepts\/topics in real analysis",
    "I entered the course with the more basic skills covered in Political Science Math Camp during the summer, also taught by Andrew Bridy. This course was an introduction to mathematical logic and proofs, which I expect will be useful in future courses I take on game theory and\/or formal theory. My exposure to this sort of mathematics prior to this course was practically nil, so the course served as a primer for some of the more abstract material that may be alluded to, if not explicitly covered, in the quantitative methods sequence."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Bridy is an excellent instructor: he presents concepts clearly and carefully, and the problem sets are well designed. I was very new to the material and much of it was a challenge, but I do think I learned a great deal. I do not think the course could be improved -- it was a great introduction to rigorous mathematics.",
    "The course as taught was fascinating in that it did not set strict goals for material to be covered or given applications; I feel I learned a great deal about the math behind some of the discipline, but I felt engaged precisely because it wasn't tied directly to political science. Some students might not appreciate how abstract the material feels, particularly in the context of first-year methods work. For them, more crossover between 529 and 500 may suffice, though it wasn't necessary for me."

    "I definitely would - very thorough introduction to analysis that will be very helpful for future courses in formal modelling and game theory.",
    "Yes, if the student did not have a math background but wanted to develop a firmer footing in proof-writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students in my department because we have so few chances during coursework to explore other disciplines. There is the possibility that I won't go much further in mathematics, but it was an edifying experience that made me open to the idea of pursuing mathematics further than I otherwise would."
