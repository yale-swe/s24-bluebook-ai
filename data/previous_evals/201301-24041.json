   "comments": [
    "ok",
    "I have no idea about weakness. The whole of this course was well organized.",
    "It would be valuable to review a finished product upfront so we know where our proposals are heading. I appreciate the checkpoints with different assignments along the way. Some of the guest lectures were pretty bad",
    ".",
    "This course provides students with the opportunity to hone their writing skills.It is perhaps best suited for students with previous experience who want to freshen up their grant writing techniques, or for professionals who actually plan to submit the grant written for the final project.For students without previous experience, it would be very helpful to have a lecture which entirely focuses on explaining and carefully comparing the different grant mechanisms (e.g. R01, R03, F, K, and T awards).",
    "Good but I would have preferred to complete the final projects earlier in the semester and spend the last several weeks revising and re-writing.",
    "This is a very useful course. I appreciate being able to talk through the proposal and learning\/hearing feedback from others who have a neutral\/fresh perspective. I would probably only change the reviewer assignment process. I think it would be most beneficial to either divide protocols by topic\/area or to assign reviewers by grant mechanism.",
    "This course is probably very useful for anyone who is actually submitting a grant in the near future. I think the knowledge that I gained will help me in the future; however, putting together a fake grant proposal felt like an exercise in futility.",
    "I think this class was able to walk us through the grant-writing process in a relatively clear way. I liked that we had some additional human subjects training built into the course. I also thought the peer-review component was helpful. I think the peer review part might have been more helpful earlier on in the course, however, for persons who were sort of heading down a wrong-direction on their proposals. I know this was supposed to happen but didn't because of the snow. It might have been useful to have a peer-review session for the initial outline or something, just to get some feedback prior to writing up the entire proposal.",
    "This is a good course, with useful elements.",
    "This course suffers from a significant lack of critical feedback. Although various assignments are required throughout the course, not a single assignment was ever given a grade, and only cursory verbal feedback is provided for a minority of the assignments. It is impossible to predict or even have an approximate idea of what one's final grade is.Feedback for the final proposal is given by fellow students in the class peer review session, but this feedback is not necessarily valuable, given the lack of experience for some students. The course would be greatly improved if the instructors, or other faculty who are experienced in the grant review process, provide detailed critical feedback about a proposal.Some of the class sessions were of little or no benefit. For example, the lecture on sample size calculation was extremely general and discussed material that has been amply covered through various biostats courses. One class session consisted mostly of watching Youtube videos; although these videos provided a little bit of insight into the NIH review process, these videos could have easily been assigned for out-of-class viewing. Yet another class session consistedof a basic overview of academic writing; given the ample writing help resources provided to Yale students in general, this session had little value.",
    "Good course to help you proposal writing. Need to incorporate mroe examples of real life proposals and more help with sample size preparation and reasoning behind it",
    "This is a great course. You learn how the NIH extramural funding system works and you learn how to write successful grants. Dr. Ettinger is very attentive to students needs and clearly dedicated to teaching students. The lectures did become tedious at times but the information needed to relayed. It is a great course overall.",
    "This class is a sine qua non!Dr Ettinger is preparing us for real life grant submissions. This year we benefitted from both her experience with clinical trial applications and Dr Gould-Rothberg's experience with basic science submissions and it was a blast! Both were incredibly patient and knowledgeable and eager to share with us all that it is to know about this process",
    "Very good for someone who wants a real world feel for grant writing"

I enjoyed meeting with her one on one and feel she would be a great mentor had I been ready to write a real grant.",
    "Instructor: Adrienne Ettinger \u00a0There were two instructors but for my one-on-one sessions I worked with Dr. Ettinger. Ithought she gave very helpful feedback on the process and was even helpful with smaller aspects of my proposal. I could tell she is very familiar with this process.",

She was incredibly knowledgeable and articulate as a teacher and very approachable and generous with her time as a person. I cannot imagine this class without her!She was so humble and eager to learn herself (an unbelievable role model!) that she asked us for more information about qualitative methods!",

I think you need to come into the course with a good idea of what kind of grant\/project you would like to propose, because if you do not you will not get anything out of it.",
    "I would not recommend this course, unless improvements are made in 1) giving critical feedback to students throughout the course, and 2) the value of some of the class sessions, as discussed above.",
    "Excellent basis for NIH proposal",
    "This is a great course and very necessary for anyone planning to write NIH grants. You learn how the grant system works and how to write successful grants. The course can become somewhat tedious at times because of the nature of the material being covered, but it is a great course overall!",
    "You cannot miss this class! it will serve well for your whole career.",
