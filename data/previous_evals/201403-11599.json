   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture contained a lot of great background information on the inner workings of GIS - what different tasks do, how geospatial info is developed and used. The format (2 hours at 8 am) was a little rough, and I felt that most of my active learning occurred in the lab sessions when we actually applied lecture material to mapping tasks. The lecture could also stand to be more interactive.",
    "A strength was that the labs were easy to follow and it helped to re-enforce the lectures. A weakness was that one of the lab sections was before the lecture so there was often confusion on the material in the lab.",
    "Far too easy.",
    "This was a pretty disappointing course. The lectures were not as useful as I had hoped, although I liked Ted. I really wanted to learn the material, but the labs were really the only useful components. The set-up of the class didn't make sense -- we always had lab on Monday nights BEFORE we learned the material, so there wasn't much incentive to go to lecture the next morning (at 8 a.m.!) because we'd stumbled through it the night before. Also, the midterm probably didn't make as much sense as assignments or more in-depth projects would. I wasn't sure why I was memorizing things I would always look up in the future. (If the test had been more concept-based, that maybe would have made more sense.) Finally...the most frustrating part of the class was not having regular announcements! I often had no idea what was happening, and even if I made it to the 8 a.m. class, announcements were in the first minute. It became one big frustrating cycle. Email us announcements! Also, my feedback on labs was really, really great! Unfortunately it was mostly after Thanksgiving, when I was done with all of them.",
    "The labs taught me a lot and were the best teaching tool of the class. However the labs and TFs seemed disorganized, and we never received feedback on most of our labs until the last week of class. In fact I was almost finished with the final project when I finally received most of the grades back. It would have been much more useful to have the graded labs with comments to make sure I was not repeating mistakes.",
    "The content of this course is very interesting, but the lectures were not presented in an interesting way.",
    "The labs are very useful and comprehensive so as to help you navigate the GIS software. The course itself is a bit more theory heavy and sometimes is beyond what is expected of you, but the class is nonetheless very useful for any student interested in mapping diseases.",
    "Very comprehensive introduction to disease mapping",
    "The lecture can be taught in less than two hours, and in a much more interesting way. The lab is where I learned the most, but lecture was ultimately unhelpful.",
    "I thought the laboratory time was an excellent introduction and practical approach to using GIS in public health. However, the in-class lecture, which provided the majority of the theoretical and statistical background behind the program, was extremely tedious, difficult to follow, and not engaging. I'm not sure of a great method to improve this, however. I think part of this was based on the fact that I was in the lab section that had typically completed the laboratory before class met, so we had learned the majority of the practical concepts through the TAs and trial and error before we even got into class, to learn theoretical background. The final project was well-structured, though it is dangerously easy to let projects like that suck up a tremendous amount of time if not properly managed.",
    "I don't feel like I learned very much from the course. It was not too time consuming or difficult, but I don't think the lectures or labs were useful in helping me understand GIS.",
    "The class itself is kind of brutal not for the content but for the timing. It's a 2-hour 8 am lecture which is a recipe for sleepiness. The labs were awesome because you were walked through actual GIS applications which is a lot better than some other GIS courses. The midterm was rough but curved generously.",
    "The structured nature of the labs was definitely helpful. I had some trouble aligning the lecture material with the lab material (as there was a lot of material covered in lecture that was not subsequently addressed in lecture).",
    "good overall",
    "strength: - extremely useful course not just for those interested in spatial statistics but for anyone who wants to be able to show the distribution of disease on a map and learn GIS weakness: - class was at 8 am because of which a lot of students stopped attending lectures after a while",
    "The course had two components: lecture and lab. Overall, lecture was at a difficult time in the morning (8am) and covered theory; labs were in the evenings and covered practical use. I found the labs to be far more useful in learning GIS than the lectures.",
    "Useful course for introducing basic features of ArcGis software. However, classroom lectures were often unrelated to ArcGis and unhelpful. Feedback from professor was also very poor. Emails regarding questions about assignments often went unanswered causing unnecessary confusion and error. The course syllabus was also very unhelpful as it did not provide any information on major assignment due dates or breakdown of grading criteria",
    "Overall, the class should have much more focus on the program itself rather than on what really seems like irrelevant material. Frankly, this course should not be offered at 8am either.",
    "This was a great course, it is very relevant to public health, and I really appreciate that it was offered this year. The only weakness was the 8 am class meeting time.",
    "I liked learning about GIS but I didn't like the class or lab structure. The class content often seemed disconnected from the lab content. I would have liked more real life examples of how GIS is used in mapping health data early on in the class. Also, the labs were particularly frustrating in that we started the homework in class so if people had questions the lab instructors didn't want to provide answers since we were working on the homework. I would have preferred to do a problem example in lab and discuss each step and then do a similar problem for the homework rather than rush through the homework during lab and leave many questions unanswered. Also it took many weeks to get our homework graded, so it was difficult to know whether we were on track or not.",
    "Strengths: great TA, well-designed lab assignments, very thorough lecture slides Weakness: some glitches with GIS software, did not learn how to do geocoding"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Very nice.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0I like Ted and thought he was interesting, although his lectures were often dry -- keeping us alert at 8 a.m. is no easy task, but I every week I would start to drift off...",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Going over the GIS code and methods in detail during lectures is not useful. That should be saved for lab. The instructor should also have been more in tune with how the labs were going. We had some labs where we were unsure how to complete answers because GIS had changed during an update. We received little instruction on how to compensate for this.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He has great professional skills, but his presentation style is not very attracting.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford clearly explains concepts, which are main to the course. He is really helpful and willing to explain information to students. The only weakness is the reliance on the assumption that basic statistics was clearly explained on other bio statistics courses.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He seemed as if he wanted to teach the material, but did not structure the course in a meaningful way.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford The few times Dr. Holford gave us examples of real research he or his students had completed were interesting, though it would have been useful to have gone into some of the methods in-depth. Though I typically do not like the case-study approach to classes, I thought it might work well for a class such as this, if the methodological approaches to individual research questions were explained, rather than having a scrambled collection of techniques.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He wasn't very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He was clearly knowledgeable about the course material. The lecture was not very engaging. I also had trouble learning about computations or a software program like arcmap when someone else is just talking about them using powerpoint. The information could be conveyed in a way that is more conducive to student learning.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Dr. Holford is an excellent professor and his lectures were quite informative.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Lectures were often irrelevant to objectives and goals of the class, Dr. Holford's communication regarding classroom assignments was also poor. Emails were not answered in a timely fashion and many emails were not answered at all. More awareness should be given to students of assignment deadlines and policies regarding late assignments (ie: students should be made aware that an assignment submitted 15 minutes late will receive 0 credit)",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Very nice but not a very engaging professor.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Professor Holford is very passionate about GIS and its usefulness in public health. The lectures could be improved if the instructor could demonstrate in class what the different GIS outputs are demonstrating for example by making a map with the program in class.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0He was very nice, but I found the class content to be a little disconnected from the lab. I would have liked for him to pull GIS up on the computer and work through some examples in class rather than use screenshots. Also more real life health examples would have been useful. Lastly, I found he was not always responsive to emails. Overall nice person and you could tell he cared about the course and his work.",
    "Instructor: Theodore Holford \u00a0Great professor, really kind, no real problems, but sometimes monotone voice which is not great for early in the am. Otherwise, great."

   "comments": [
    "The lab is great and teaches applications of GIS to public health very well. The lecture can be difficult to get through (lots of information and a relatively long lecture without a lot of interactive portions). I would recommend it for someone with no GIS background.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student but I would tell them not to take it their first semester unless they have had a prior SAS course.",
    "It could be taught harder. Far too easy.",
    "This is a strange class. Parts of it, like my lab, were really helpful and interesting and parts of it, like Tuesday morning lecture, were not useful. I really wanted to learn GIS, and while I definitely learned some things, I'm not sure this class will actually help me in the future.",
    "I would recommend the course because I feel I did learn a lot of about how to use GIS software.",
    "This course is useful, but you need to spend a lot of time outside of the classroom by yourself if you really want to be proficient in it.",
    "I recommend this course because it doesn't rely too heavily on statistics and provides you with GIS expertise.",
    "I would recommend this course as good, understandable introduction into disease mapping.",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "I thought the laboratory section was great, and we learned a number of practical, usable skills for GIS and some associated programs. However, the lecture felt rather disconnected and tiresome. If the lecture was rehauled into something more engaging, I would definitely recommend the course, since it provides such a useful skillset in today's tech-heavy world.",
    "I think the course in concept was very interesting and useful, it was just not taught well.",
    "Yes, I think that the course expanded my knowledge of GIS and advanced statistical computations. I would not recommend it for a first semester MPH student unless one has previous experience with statistics.",
    "useful",
    "This course is useful for the lab component but requires a lot of time and effort for the final project and associated labs. GIS is a useful skill to learn.",
    "I recommend this course since GIS mapping is an important and relevant skill for public health professionals. However, I would warn the student that they must be very self motivated and be prepared to work and learn independently with very little guidance or feedback.",
    "If you enjoy programming and would like to learn more computer skills I would highly recommend this class",
    "course covers a lot of topics and the pace is somewhat fast for someone who is totally new to GIS. In hindsight I wish I took the workshops offered at the library as I feel they focus on building skill in the basics of ArcMap rather than introducing you to a lot of topics and mastering none. If you do take this class, I might suggest attending a workshop on ArcMap in order to familiarize yourself with the program before diving right in. Also, I recommend downloading ArcMap on your computer so you don't have to visit the lab every time you want to work on your homework.",
    "Good course, focuses on theory of GIS in lecture, application in labs."
