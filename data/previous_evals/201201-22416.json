    "Cell biology is an awesome course if you're looking to learn a lot about biology in a short time from an excellent professor. Professor Pollard is extremely knowledgeable about the field seeing as he wrote the textbook, and it shows in class. The weekly quiz system is also really helpful for making sure you don't fall behind. And no midterms! This is really a course to take it you're at all interested in molecular biology.",
    "Awesome overview of cell biology. Take it if you're remotely interested and can put in the time. Make sure to form a Monday-night study group early on though!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. If you pay attention in lecture, study the handouts, and go over the review questions and objectives with a study group then you will be fine. The handouts are so good that you really don't even need to read the textbook. Form weekly study groups to stay on top of the material and you will learn a ton and maybe even have fun!",
    "It is a comprehensive and detailed overview of cell biology. The class is a lot of work but very rewarding, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in medicine or the life sciences.",
    "Totally not the horror story people make it out to be. In my opinion, everyone who complains how they can't handle this class either 1) needs to reconsider being premed, or 2) is just that - a paranoid premed who bitches way too much to attract the much-needed attention. Guess for yourself which group is more prevalent (hint: we're at Yale). Beyond that, though, Pollard is a great lecturer, although his voice gets softer as he gets older (give me a break, man). His lecture notes basically tell you everything there is, so only buy the book if you want to give the guy some business (that's very well-deserved, mind you). Study for the weekly quizzes, drop 3 of the 12, and you're good to go. If you're not, DROP PREMED. You'll flounder in other classes if you can't even take this. But other than that, TAKE THIS. Material is fascinating and makes me want to become a cell just so I can see all of this happening inside of and around me.",
    "This is the best biology class that I have taken so far at Yale. Not only will you learn an incredible amount of material that will be important in whatever scientific field you later enter, but you will also become better scientific\/biological thinker. Make sure that you do not decide against this course because you are scared by the pace or the sheer amount of material. If you have a good aptitude for biology you should be fine. Especially if you are trying to choose between this and MCDB 200, I would wholeheartedly recommend this course over the other. Also, don't worry about not having had AP Chemistry or Orgo. I took this concurrently with CHEM 115, and had absolutely no issue - a solid foundation in chemistry only adds to the experience; it is not at all necessary.",
    "Yes. There is no better way to get a sense of what an education in medicine will entail at an introductory level.",
    "A tough class, but a great foundation to more biology at Yale.",
    "tons of material. but will ground you for any study of biology in the future.",
    "It's a tough class. It's a ton of information crammed into one little semester, and there will be lots of really intense pre-med freshman (this is coming from a not-so-intense pre-med sophomore, by the way) who are somehow simultaneously inspirational and discouraging. You'll be learning a lot, and you'll leave with a much better understanding of patterns found in molecular biology and how living things function, which is amazing. However, the journey to that understanding is a lot of work--I wish I'd put more work in during the semester! Find what study methods work for you early on because the weekly quizzes will whiz by quicker and more painfully than you'll want them to. Take it because it's rewarding, but know that it is hard.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to anyone needing a good background in the details of cell biology.",
    "Tom Pollard is so boring it hurts. But after having taken both Cell Bio and Developmental Bio, I can tell you that you will learn so much in this class that carries over to almost every other area of Biology. Go for it. It won't be easy: the weekly quizzes are stressful and you probably won't do well on most, even after they drop 3. But you will learn a lot more than you expect in a short amount of time.",
    "its a lot of work and the quizzes are hard. bc you have to take it as a bio major, you have no choice",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It's been my favorite class I've taken here. The applications of cell biology are fundamental to medicine, so if you're interested in the subject material I'd highly recommend it.Having said that, it's a lot of work and it's full of annoying pre-meds. I'd spend upwards of 6-7 hours a weekend studying, plus cram sessions on Monday nights before Tuesday quizzes. I'd strongly recommend taking MCDB 120 not only as a basis in the material, but for preparation in answering more thought-proking bio questions than you would see on an AP test.It's a lot of reading, but it's so comprehensive that everything comes together in the end so you understand larger functions like muscle contraction on a molecule level. Don't let the workload scare you away from taking the class, especially if you have Monday afternoons free. Prof. Pollard is AMAZING. His lecture handouts keep you from stressing about missing details said in class- I can't stress how organized he is. He's the kind of professor who wants everyone to succeed given enough effort put forth. The quizzes are hard but fair, and the lectures are fascinating if you're there with the right attitude.",
    "If you have interest in bio this is a great course. It also opens up more specific courses that you can see if you are interested in them. The quizzes every week may seem annoying at first, but if you commit like 4-5 hours a week then they are easy and you actually learn the material",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course, especially if you want to learn all about biology with a decent amount of breadth and depth. Tom Pollard is both an amazing person and a great professor. The quizzes are not very hard and having three dropped really takes the pressure off. There's also no midterm which helped around the middle of the semester. Overall, a great class that anybody with an interest in biology would find engaging.",
    "There's no other way of saying it--this course is a ton of work. However, the concepts taught in Cell Bio are essential to anyone considering a future in biological research or medicine, because Cell Bio is the basis for, well, LIFE. Take it if you're willing to put in the work. You will walk away with a frightening amount of knowledge.",
    "Take this course if you are prepared to a) put in the time to learn the material and b) ready to give up all your monday nights to cell bio. By the end, you will have enjoyed a very fulfilling course.",
    "It's a lot of work. Don't take if you don't have to. Honestly, save yourself the trouble.",
    "Yep! Great survey course.",
    "i would definitely recommend the class. the workload is REALLY intense. i studied for each quiz basically like it was a midterm even thought they were only 10 minutes long. there is a ton of information that it can be overwhelming at times but you learn an incredible amount in the end.",
    "It's a fairly difficult but worthwhile biology class. As someone who went into this having taken molecular biology (with Pollard) and genetics, the material in this class is essential to anyone who wants to do MCDB or is pre-med. I also feel that taking genetics and then taking cell biologyprovided me with a more solid foundation than the dev bio\/genetics combo.That being said, I took a relatively heavy course load along with cell bio and still feel like I did alright in the class, but that was only after the 4th week--the first 3 weeks were hellish because I couldn't understand how to properly answer the quiz questions (hint* key words and underlining). You should definitely come to every lecture --what is emphasized in class is frequently on the quiz the next week. Don't read the textbook, there are too many details (I got lower quiz scores when I studied out of the textbook). I spent around 3 hours on weekends studying for quizzes; I typed up notes in lecture, studied off of those and the handouts, that was it. Megan King was a decent lecturer but not as organized and straightforward as Pollard. Pollard just has to remember to turn up his mic so we can hear him. Devin Noblin's a good TA to have too, if he's around.",
    "This class was very good. It definitely has the most information I have ever encountered in the span of a semester, which is scary and was very very stressful before the final. However, they compensated by making the quizzes\/final exam pretty easy: you always get a choice of 2 possible questions to answer and I always found that one question was very doable. It definitely helps to have as much science background as you possibly can before taking this class: I'm speaking as a junior science major, so I feel like this definitely put me at an advantage over freshmenand sophomores, in terms of how much I had to study the material. I don't think I can recommend it for a freshman who has never taken a bio class before. I found Professor Pollard to be a pretty good lecturer, and the grading was very fair. The TAs, for the most part, were wonderful. Again, they recognize that you cannot possibly know all of that information, so they are just looking for you to demonstrate that you know something. I think this is good information for a science major to be exposed to, especially if you're serious about science. Just know that you will end up devoting a lot of time to this class, but it can be fun when done with friends! The quiz format is really laid back and not that scary at all. Having midterms in this class would have made it untakeable.",
    "Cell Bio is one of those quintessential Yale classes. Yes, the class is a great deal of work and moves at an incredible pace, and yes, it would be nice to have greater interactions with Professor Pollard, but overall, the material is interesting and easy to grasp -- if you put the time in. I would recommend this class to anyone: not only for the solid founding in cell biology, but it is a great course in discipline as well.",
    "Stressful class, but rewarding. If I could go back, pretty sure I'd take it again. So yes, I'd recommend it. Just be prepared to put in a few hours weekly to stay on top of the material.",
    "Cell bio was very difficult, but very enlightening. I learned so much, way more than I thought I'd ever be able to learn, and am glad I did. The weekly quizzes can be a pain, but when it comes time to study for the final, you'll be glad that you studied every week along the way. If you just stay on top of the material, it is doable and very rewarding.",
    "Basically, Cell Bio is the hardest class I've taken at Yale so far. It was very difficult for me and demanded a large amount of time in preparation for the weekly quizzes. It started out pretty rough for me, but things improved a lot once I got the hang of the quiz format. You soon learn what information is the most pertinent, and you can pick out the main themes of each handout\/lecture. You learn an incredible amount of information. It's time consuming, but I think it's definitely worth it in the end.",
    "The quiz format is so much better than midterms. The material can be difficult but it is absolutely fascinating. You will hate the class at points (usually Monday nights before the Tuesday quiz) but in retrospect, I've learned so much and it's been very rewarding.Thomas Pollard isn't the greatest lecturer (he's difficult to hear) but Megan King is great.If you fail the first quiz, don't worry it WILL get better as you get used to the format. I got a 4 out of 10 on my first quiz and then proceeded to get 9's and 10's on most of the remaining quizzes in the class.Overall highly recommend this class if you love biology and are willing to put in the effort.",
    "What I envisioned a Yale class to be like, challenging but extremely rewarding at the end. One walks out of each class knowing so much more than when they walked in. An absolute must for anyone interested in Biology",
    "This class will teach you an immense amount about cells, but it is a pretty fast-paced class that covers a LOT of material. Also, the weekly quizzes were hard because they involved not only an understanding of the material but application of it. I wouldn't have taken it if it was not for my major.",
    "Good",
    "Although the workload is really daunting, I'm really satisfied with the amount I learned in this class. You really leave the class feeling that you have a good handle on how cell biology works. The lectures aren't the most helpful, but the class notes are really solid, and this is one of the best organized science classes I've taken at Yale. The grading is also pretty fair.",
    "This is a pretty good course; there's a lot of material to learn and memorize, but it is all manageable. Given that the class is based on weekly quizzes, it may seem easy to just take a quiz one week and forget about that material - and it is - but don't forget to start studying early if that is the strategy you choose to use for the class",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. You will actually die - unless you have significant preparation in cell bio or research experience in this field, it will be very difficult and time-consuming.",
    "Tough, but definitely rewarding. Best if you put together a study group. The quizzes are designed so that it emphasizes applying knowledge rather than reciting facts, which I really liked. Also, each quiz gives you a choice between two questions, so the class is definitely fair. I put a lot of studying into this class, but it was worth it.",
    "It's a good class, required for the major, but it teaches you a lot of the important fundamentals of bio that you don't get in just an AP course. Not recommended if you have no further pursuits in biology however.",
    "Cell bio is a wonderful course. Make sure you study each quiz very carefully, this makes the cumulative final a breeze. No midterms means less stress, and the weekly quizzes are a great way to get you to keep on track of the material. If you don't stay on top, though, you will be buried by the pace of the course, so only take this if you're willing to make it a priority on your schedule.",
    "Take it as a requirement for pre-meds\/science majors, but expect a somewhat dry course.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! It is a lot of work, but well worth it. You'll be amazed how much you know by the end of the semester.",
    "A truly fantastic class. It is amazing how much material you can learn in only one semester. Grading can be frustrating when random points are docked off your quizzes, but it is all worth it in the end when you realize that you know so much cell bio than when you began. Of course, the facts you will forget eventually, but the fundamental understanding of how the organism functions will stick. Given any question regarding our bodies, you will be able to conjecture an answer, using the intuition that you gained in this class. Wonderful course, extremely heavy workload if you really want to delve into this material, but so incredibly worth the effort. I would recommend it to anyone, even non-science majors.Some tips- take notes directly in the margins on the notes that Dr. Pollard prints out for you to save time, especially if Dr. King is lecturing because she speaks crazy quickly. Don't study the book because the extra material will just muddle the brain. Memorize Dr. Pollard's notes, and that is all you need to do well on the quizzes. Also, don't write too much because any false information will just count against you. In other words, don't write it if you're not sure that it's accurate.",
    "take it...it's awesome. Credit D was a great choice for this class, too.",
    "I actually enjoyed cell bio and learned a lot. Prof Pollard does a good job of focusing on general principles instead of getting bogged down in the details. That said, there is inevitably a ton of memorizing to do each week before the quiz. Don't read the textbook--just look at the lecture slides and the packets they hand out. Memorize and understand the packets, then go over them each week with a friend. Also make sure you can answer the questions at the end of each packet. Warning: this class is a lot of work and it's hard to do really really well on the quizzes because sometimes it's hard to tell what answer they are looking for (the quizzes are short answer, not multiple choice). But it's definitely worth it because you learn a lot. Cell bio is great background for most upper level bio courses.",
    "A very, very good course. I would recommend reading textbook during the week and relying on the lecture handouts to study for the weekly quizzes. Cramming on Sunday and Monday evenings for the weekly quizzes was an effective strategy for me.",
    "This was my favorite class at Yale. It gets a lot of bad hype for being tough. It is. But JUST STUDY OK?! It will be fine. And you will learn a TON. Also, the professor is great.",
    "You have to for the major so yes.",
    "Excellent course. It is well taught, well organized and well devised. This course should serve as a model for how biology classes at Yale should be taught. Professor Pollard is excellent. He's committed to making sure his students learn, and his way of explaining through his slides is very helpful. I would ask that his slides include a little more text to help with reviewing them.Professor King lectured too rapidly. That's the only negative comment I have - everything else she did was excellent! She was engaging, interested in the topics she taught, and presented them in a clear way. Great job!The course has its flaws, though. I wish that there were equally committed TA's. I also believe having a few other lecturers would be nice, as rotating lecturers helps prevent students from getting bored. It can be difficult paying attention at 9AM. Include more of the current research too! Aside from that, I recommend this course.",
    "Most people at some point will have to pick between taking this course or taking molecular biology. I would strongly urge you to take this course. While it is perhaps more difficult and perhaps more stressful, the sheer amount of knowledge that you gain from taking this course is incredible.MCDB 205 will probably not be an easy experience but you will come out of it with the vocabulary and knowledge necessary to tackle almost any biological question, and you will be uniquely posed to take more advanced courses in the biological sciences. Molecular biology will give you an experimental viewpoint, but so will this course and this course simply covers more material.Also, Tom Pollard is an adorable old man, and a great lecturer.",
    "Cell Bio is a great class that I would recommend to anyone with any sort of interest in the MCDB field. Although the amount of material taught in the class is huge, Professor Pollard does a great job of letting you know what to focus on specifically. And even though there isn't any written homework, you should still spend a good amount of time each week to review the material and the review questions for the weekly quizzes, and going to section will definitely help you focus your studying. Most of the quizzes are methods-based and may not be entirely straightforward at first, but with some extra thought and creativity, you'll get the hang of it, and I felt that I learned quite a bit over the course of the year.",
    "Cell bio is a must course for anyone majoring in bio - there is a lot of material but the weekly quizzes make sure that you stay on top of the material. Lectures can get a bit a dry but Prof Pollard \/ King does a great job at organizing the material in the notes that he gives for each lecture",
    "Cell Biology is one of the most challenging yet most rewarding courses i have taken at Yale, and I would definitely recommend it to any fellow student. At first it might be hard to get used to its pace, but after a couple of weeks it will be easy to notice how the course is extremely well taught and organized, and thus establish an effective studying schedule to get the most out of the information presented in class and in the textbook. Having weekly quizzes will definitely provide the right motivation to stay on top of the material, but it will also allow to learn the information piece by piece, focusing on specific components each time. The most rewarding moment for me was during the review for the final, when I had the chance to connect all the dots between different topics and thus understand how much material we had been exposed to and understood.",
    "This course is a must take if you are an MCDB major or pre-med. Tom Pollard is a great lecturer but could turn up the mic a little bit. Megan King gave only 4 lectures but they were great although very fast paced. The quizzes allow you to digest material a little at a time, and you will be amazed at how much you've learned when you go back to study at the end of the semester. This class stresses the general principles and the quizzes are designed so, but they always make you think about some theme or another that you might have not thought about before but is crucial for experimental design or therapeutic medicine.",
    "This course was a very fast paced introduction to a lot of concepts in cell bio. Lectures were not great (early, long and information packed), but the material is fascinating, it's well taught, and structured so that it's not that hard to succeed. I recommend it if you like cellular and molecular biology.",
    "A challenge, but totally worth it. You will learn a ton of useful information.",
    "Weekly quizzes aren't as scary as they sound! In fact, they make this class more manageable because you're forced to learn the information in smaller chunks instead of procrastinating until a midterm. Also there's no other p-sets\/midterms\/work etc. Also wake up early to sign up for Andrea's section - she's by far the most helpful TA (she makes review study guides for each week's quiz)!",
    "Cell bio a lot of work, and it's kind of unfortunate that there is a certain way to do well in the class. The quizzes are usually pretty straight forward, but they're stressful; studying for cell bio quizzes every week really took a lot of time and energy. I really wish someone had told me this before I took the class, but you do not need to read the textbook. It is honestly a waste of time, and this is coming from a very diligent student who always reads the textbook. Don't. Learn the material in the packets. If you can do the objectives, then you can do the quizzes. Concepts over details.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is seriously interested. However, this is not a class for those with a peripheral interest in biology - you need to dedicate serious time to fully understanding and learning all the material.",
    "Cell Biology is not the big, scary course that everyone makes it out to be. Honestly, it is one of my favorite courses so far. There are weekly quizzes in open-ended format, which are fantastic because as they become routine, they become less and less stressful and the questions were always fair. There is a lot of material but between the professors, section, and study groups, there are a lot of resources for you. Cell Bio really builds a strong foundation for future studies in biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone seriously interested in the topic!! I had a great time and the quizzes although stressful allow time management for cell bio to be pretty easy. I would not recommend reading the book because it contains a lot of jargon and superfluous information and just takes up so much time (I never actually purchased the book). Pollard's lecture handouts\/summaries contain almost all of the information that you will need for the class and if you go to section (I especially recommend Andrea) to go over the material, you should be adequately prepared for each test. I really only spent time in section and Mondays going over the material from the previous week before the Tuesday morning quiz and although I did badly on the first two quizzes and was worried, I soon got the rhythm of the class and did exceedingly well and the worst three quizzes were dropped. I really loved this class and although it gets a formidable reputation for the intensity and time commitment, it is so worth and can be so manageable.",
    "I would recommend it, even though it requires a lot of work. The quizzes help you keep up on the material since there are no midterms, but you have to study hard for the final since it contains questions on anything, and there's a LOT of material.",
    "It. Is. Very. Hard. Like very, very hard. You will have to work harder than in any class you've taken at Yale. However, you'll know pretty much everything there is to know about hte cell by the end of the semester, which is the coolest feeling ever. This was probably my favorite class I've taken in all of my time at Yale because I came out of it with concrete skills and knowledge that were so far above and beyond where I started the semester. I'm shocked that we were able to fit that much information into all of our brains",
    "From all the other reviews, you already know that cell bio is a tough class. But honestly, it is totally manageable. Honestly, the quizzes are actually a nice mixup from your other classes, and besides, it would be a total nightmare to study for a midterm in this class simply because there is so much material. Rather than having cell bio be stressful only 2 times a semester like normal classes are that have midterms, it stays consistently medium throughout the semester. Pretty quickly you'll get into a routine of your weekly studying (read the chapter on Sunday, study with friends on Monday, for example) and you'll be fine.My recommendations: try and leave your monday afternoons free if you're going to take cell bio because the quizzes are every Tuesday morning at 8:55am, and you'll want that Monday afternoon\/evening free to study (cram). So, if you're pre-med and taking labs, don't do them on Monday. For that matter, don't do them on Tuesday either because you'll want to devote the end of your weekend \/ Monday to cell bio. Also, Pollard will tell you this, but find a study group that works for you. People can get really stressed out in this class. If that's your style, work with them, but there are also people who are chill if that's more your vibe.",
    "Take it. And study the questions in the handout really thoroughly. If you can answer them, you can answer the quiz questions.",
    "MCDB 205 is a good course to learn cell biology. However, I would not recommend taking this course with orgo-- the workload is too much to handle!",
    "If you are willing to put in a lot of work to learn, and not necessarily have that learning reflected in your grades, then yes. I learned a lot, but also had to sacrifice time spent on other classes to do so.",
    "Weekly quizes that are pretty tough at first but you figure out what they're looking for over the course of semester. Be prepared for a lot of memorization. But overall I felt like I learned a lot this semester and gained a solid foundation for my future bio classes.",
    "An overview of a LOT of topics in cell biology, and definitely a must take class for anyone going into the major. You will learn a LOT. If you are interested in learning cell bio, and willing to put in the work for the weekly quizzes, this is also a good class to take.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to learn the fundamentals of cell biology. It is very interesting and you will cover a lot of material, but it is also a lot of work and you should be prepared to dedicate a good portion of your weekends and monday nights to Cell Biology.",
    "While I'm glad I took Cell Bio and learned a ton, it wasn't always an enjoyable experience to say the least. The stuff we were learning was cool, but having a quiz on ~4 chapters every single Tuesday got pretty wearying. On the other hand, you can sort of get into a rhythm with the quiz schedule, you get to drop your three lowest scores, and it's better than having 3 massive midterms. Most of the lectures this semester were given by Professor Pollard, who knows his stuff and is very approachable, but has a rather dry lecturing style - not always the best way to stay awake at 9 in the morning. I recommend this course if you're interested in the material, but shop it and make sure you realize what you're getting into. And don't take it at the same time with other really demanding courses if you can help it (I took it with Orgo I, which was doable but probably not the best idea ever sanity-wise).",
    "I loved this course. Cell Biology was what solidified my decision to become an MCDB major. The class was immersive and packed with interesting facts and real world applications that I looked forward to every class. Cell Bio filled in a lot of blanks in my understanding about how life in the most general sense works. The pace and massive amount of information are quite daunting at first, but the course eventually slows down\/you get acclimated. The quizzes also required a learning curve but on the whole, I actually looked forward to them. They provide an outlet for creativity, critical thinking, and problem solving that is often lacking from college science courses. The course is about the \"big picture\". There were many times where I was bogged down with details that proved largely irrelevant in testing. On the other hand, there were times nitty gritty details had to be memorized, and it was often difficult to tell when this had to be done. Professor Pollard is kind and very intelligent, while he could always stand to turn up his microphone louder. Professor King was a refreshing break in the course and I really liked her lecturing style. The handouts were an ABSOLUTE GODSEND! I could not have been more happy to have them. Consider taking notes on the physical packet itself (it helps manage the insane quantity of information). Take this course if you are at all interested in biology. It is fascinating and very rewarding. A must for pre-meds and bio majors!"
