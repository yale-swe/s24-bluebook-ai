    "Biol 102 is an intro bio course that is interesting and prepares you for future courses in biology. However, if this was not a pre-req for your major or future classes you want to take, I'm not sure that I would recommend this course. Although it was interesting, at times it felt like an expansion of my high school bio curriculum, that will mainly be useful in terms of pursuing my major.",
    "Bio102 is cells. Cells. Cells. Cells. It goes very little beyond that. It is NOT as fun as Bio 101 nor as varied in topic breadth. It is a necessary course for most upper level Bio courses so it is a must take. It isn't a HORRIBLE class just one that I will probably look back on as a waste of my time. Take it if you wish to pursue a Biology major, otherwise please don't waste your time.",
    "It was an alright class. If you just need a science credit, don't take 101\/102, take something easier and less tedious. Almost all of this class is just rote memorization.",
    "Lecture: Quite informative, with good lecture slides. Often uncomfortable due to Dr. Horsely's hostility toward students. Section: Engaging, with interesting readings. Homework: Fair and not overwhelming. One project, which turned out to be quite fun. Quizzes: Often poorly worded, and quite rushed. Students overall definitely found these less fair than the BIOL 101 quizzes.",
    "Unlike BIOL 101, you actually learn a lot of new material in BIOL 102. Personally, I found a lot of the information a bit too esoteric for my tastes, but if you are into cell bio, you will love this course.",
    "Great course! Lot of work but you will gain a ton of new knowledge! Also, this course is manageable work load wise even without a strong preparation in biology. Very interesting content; would definitely recommend.",
    "tbh: this course was ok... the teacher always be knowin and she answers questions she never gets impatient or nothin when ppl ask questions.....homework is good if u do it right and do it good it should be a good grade for yall u need to read the papers for section fam u cant get away with not reading it... quizzes are hard my dude even if you study the lecture you ll get like 15\/20 cuz fam like i studied for 4 hours and i knew the lectures (which is the quizzes are based on) but i was like.................... bruh i studied for this why i aint get a higher score?? anyway rate: 8\/10 overall. 10\/10 for lecturer, 5\/10 for those QUIZZES that I study so hard for and never get.....9\/10 for section.",
    "I would not recommend BIOL 102 to another student unless they absolutely must take it for their major requirements. It is a poorly run module, and it needs serious revamping.",
    "It's a step up from BIOL 101, but in a good way. i would recommend it to another student.",
    "If you're a bio major of any kind, it's likely you have no choice but to take this course (unless you place out). The processes you learn about, however, are very useful and will be relevant topics when you take the MCAT or some other sort of grad school placement exam in the biological fields.",
    "It is an overview of cell biology, intended to cover the groundwork for higher level biology courses.",
    "Bio 102 is easy content, difficult to figure out what they want from you. I like bio, so I guess despite everything (Horsley struggling to lecture, unclear homework, slides based primarily on pictures with the absence of sufficient text, pointless sections) I would recommend it.",
    "A necessary evil for some. Please do not take this class unless you actually really want to pursue bio.",
    "I would not recommend this class with this teacher. The lectures, quizzes, and homeworks were all unclear, and the grading was very harsh and inconsiderate. The class created much stress and anxiety although the material was not very hard and was actually interesting. The class was just badly structured and taught.",
    "Yes, although this class is a requirement for most biological science majors, or for pre-medical students.",
    "Intro to Biology. Covers a large amount of material not in great depth",
    "Take this class! You probably have to if you're a biology person, but it's a good background in cell biology for anyone. As long as your section leader is helpful and you're willing to put in some time in understanding the material outside of lecture, you're golden.",
    "Biol 102 is a lot of work, but it is definitely a good class that I recommend. It builds a strong foundation in cellular biology, going much further than the AP Biology curriculum to introduce a wide breadth and depth of structures and processes.",
    "Not the most interesting course, but necessary for bio majors and pre-meds.",
    "Not like you have a choice (if you do, choose differently)",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you have to take it. The weekly quizzes are frustrating. Journal club format for section wasn't super helpful. Grading varies immensely based on your TA.",
    "too much materials covered in the course",
    "This course gets in a lot of information but is pretty dry. Professor Horsley is very organized, but not the most engaging lecturer. The quizzes are difficult, although the homeworks aren't bad. As a non-STEM major, I was not a huge fan of the course.",
    "Horrific. Factory production of pre-meds.",
    "BIOL 102 is a class everyone should take!",
    "Its basic molecular biology",
    "Get a study group and be prepared to go over lecture notes on your own!",
    "This course is necessary for anything bio or pre-med related. It's interesting, but the material is oftentimes not clearly presented. Additionally, quizzes and homework are not worded clearly and it often took far too long for assignments to be graded.",
    "I would call this a good introductory class for biology but with some tough weekly quizzes and homework.",
    "Don't take it. It is not a good course",
    "Fast paced and a surprising amount of material covered for a half semester course, however, the material is pretty interesting and very important for most science majors. You'll have to study for a quiz, do a homework assignment, and read\/comprehend a scientific paper every week, so a fairly reasonable workload.",
    "Like most biology courses, this is a course that asks you to memorize lots of interesting information about biological processes. I learned a lot of detail on the molecular level of concepts covered in high school biology. The course does a good job of offering plenty of help opportunities for students that need it, so even if you've never taken biology before, there's no need to worry about this course. The workload is consistent and substantial and requires students to be on top of their work.",
    "It is very detailed, not very interesting and when the learnig the favts it seems like pointless information and the class expects you to be able to set up experiments without teaching how. Only take this is you need it as a pre req",
    "BIOL 102 is a necessary evil. The course material is interesting but the lectures are dry and do not really enhance the slides. Quizzes are tricky in strange ways. There is a large emphasis on learning experimental techniques and applying these to concepts.",
    "If you are going to take bio 102, take it in spring with Horsley. It is a tedious class but everyone who needs it for major has to do it. Quizzes are somewhat unreasonable hard and time crunch is difficult but the curve makes up for it.",
    "I would recommend this class, it was very interesting.",
    "You are almost certainly taking Bio 102 because it is required and have likely taken Bio 101 immediately before it. Unfortunately, you probably will not like 102 as much as 101, though you will not be the only person who feels this way. Good advice would be to attend extra sessions and office hours generously, as lecture likely will not be sufficient to learn all material the first time around. Work as early as you can on learning lecture material; nobody likes memorizing things at the last minute, and most people simply cannot. Certainly, talk to other students about this class, as they likely share similar opinions about this class, and all of you will be relieved to discover that you are not alone.",
    "It's a lot of work but it's interesting and a required pre-med course, so just suck it up and do it. Quizzes and tests were difficult and worded strangely, but we all suffered together. Just try as hard as you can, and even when you fail, remember you learned something new.",
    "This class is a lot harder than 101 and it is not as well taught. The questions not he quizzes tend to be unclear and we are not given a lot of time. There is a ton of information to memorize and they expect you to know a lot. there is a very heavy focus on designing experiment and using tools to analyze data. Did not enjoy this class very much. Very happy it is over.",
    "Slightly more difficult than 101,but also super interesting. The material is dense, and ithe class could benefit from deemphasizing lab techniques and basic experiments, and using section to reinforce large topics. Would only recommend if you're going into the sciences.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "BIOL 102 is a biology class where you need to be able to memorize lots of information, even the tiny details. I don't think there is any avoiding this class if you're any kind of biology major.",
    "Biol 102 is a necessary evil for those who are required to take the course. I would definitely not take the course if it were not required, and I consider myself someone who loves biology. If I could take the course again, I definitely would have enrolled in enrichment from the beginning.",
    "Only take Bio 102 if you absolutely must. The class is memorization heavy, can be a bit disorganized, and overall, is something that you have to dedicate time to, especially if you are not familiar with biology.",
    "A fine class, fairly manageable especially since you probably need to take it anyway. It's more convoluted than 101, and possibly less interesting--though this probably varies person-to-person. Professor Horsley definitely meant well, though at times made some confusing contradiction errors that the class had to work through. Also tends to prefer class interactive activities, which can sometimes be helpful but often don't clear up much. In summary, not completely painless but generally fine.",
    "BIOL 102 covered a lot of topics that I hadn't previously studied, even in AP Biology. If you're looking to learn a lot about cell dynamics and specific pathways, you will get a lot out of this course.",
    "I broke down crying during this final because this class is going to ruin my record enough for me to have to switch majors. That should be telling ! Please, please, PLEASE don't take this course if you don't have to. 101 is fine. 101 is even great depending on who's teaching it. But holy wow, does 102 suck. If you're not pre-med, don't even bother touching this, because none of the examples are for the other science majors that exist at Yale (yes, we do exist). Just. Don't. It's not worth your time. And if you do have to take it, well, prepare for a lot of pointless memorization with little to no connection to non-medical fields.",
    "Difficult class, but definitely doable.",
    "It is a comprehensive introductory course that is not incredibly demanding. I believe that it is a good course to take whether it is towards your major\/premed requirements or if you are just looking for a science credit. It is approachable even for those who haven't taken biology courses.",
    "Cell biology has a lotttt to memorise. But it is a very satisfying class after taking it. There are weekly quizzes which might be a bit stressful, but it really keeps your learning in check. Each week we had to read a scientific paper, which is interesting but will take a bit of time - but will really provide you with a basis of analysing science papers.",
    "It is difficult and requires a lot of time for those who have not taken ap bio. Interesting and worth taking, but certainly not easy.",
    "It is... So confusing... It's not tons of work in and of itself, but to learn it takes so much time and effort",
    "The material was interesting but it isn't so easy to get help in the class partly because of the size of the class. For example there was only one final review session and it was difficult to get questions answered. Additionally there were no office hours for TFs or the professors regularly during the semester. There should have been regular office hours and many options for TF led review sessions.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it but if you're taking this class it's because it's a pre req.",
    "tedious but doable",
    "Bio 102 is going to be less interesting than 101 but that is because of the professor. In order to pasd, make sure you go into enrichment.",
    "BIO 102 is a solid intro to cell biology. The course is well organized and covers a wide range of topics, but it isn't always the most engaging class. I would recommend only for pre-med or science majors.",
    "No, it's very frustrating.",
    "I enjoyed my segment with Koeleske a bit more. This one I felt like I knew the material, usually felt OK while taking the quiz, and then got the quizzes back with more points off than I thought. I'd ask my TA and he would suggest I ask for a regrade. The regrade system is set up so there are a ton of hoops you have to jump through to discourage students from asking, so I always felt like I spent way too much time fighting to get points back. But I learned a lot, though I'm still not sure whether I like or dislike cell bio. I was initially quite glad I started the bio modules on the off semester, but now I'm not sure it's the obvious choice. In general, the attitude for the class is comical. If you don't write your name on every page, 5 points off. If you don't evaluate your TA, we will withhold your access to your grade.",
    "Introduction to biology with a focus on the experimental techniques used to draw conclusions about cellular mechanisms.",
    "literal yikes",
    "Take it if you're premed.",
    "If you stay ahead in the class, review lectures and study hard for the quizzes you will be fine.",
    "Hard, not well organized",
    "BIOL 102 is a great class and is very interesting, but it covers a large amount of information and is not the easiest of subjects. The instructors and TAs are all willing to help in any way they can though. I would recommend this class to another student, but I would say that they should be prepared to work hard and possibly not receive the grade they are hoping for.",
    "Awful experience. Would not recommend unless required.",
    "The material can be quite difficult at times, but a lot of it is memorization. A student MUST engage with the material in order to understand it. I would advise this class especially for pre-med students.",
    "Overall the course is interesting. If the microprocesses that make up the world are of interest to you, take the class. If the macro biology that is visible in nature is what interests you, don't take the class.",
    "There's a lot of rote memorization, but I enjoyed reading papers in section.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biol 102 to a fellow student. I would summarize it as a great continuation to college biology. This class is mainly lecture, with a weekly discussion section, weekly problem sets due and weekly quizzes on the material learned the prior week. There is one main final exam at the end of the course.",
    "A rather boring and challenging course, considering the material. Professor Horsley was a hard to follow lecturer, and quizzes rarely if ever seemed to match with course material.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course.",
    "Unless this is a requirement, I do not recommend taking it as it was overly difficult for the level of the material due to a lack of organization in the teaching such as slide coherence and overly difficult and discouraging quizzes.",
    "It was in intro course you would learn a lot from, but I suggest that you prepare AP in order to be at the same starting point as other students.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 102 to any student interested in biology and wants to go beyond the high school level.",
    "It is a moderately demanding class. It can be very rewarding however. AP BIO background comes in handy, though the class is very superficial in depth.",
    "More difficult than BIOL101 for sure, but that's important, because it's a transition to increased intensity and independence of advanced sciences. In this way, challenging and great intermediate course (between introductory level BIOL101 and further scientific studies)",
    "Challenging class only because the content is not clearly communicated and quizzes are unnecessarily tricky. Would not recommend as gut science. Only take it if you REALLY want to learn some biology and have no other opportunities to, or if it is a requirement.",
    "Tiring but good",
    "It is a challenging course with a lot of information in a short period of time. The sections go over papers while lectures go over overarching topics. The quizzes and exam are notably harder than the first module but manageable with studying.",
    "Biol 102 is about what you'd expect from an intro bio course. There will be a lot of memorization, and quizzes once a week, but I valued the quizzes; if it weren't for them, I doubt I would have forced myself to learn the material on a weekly basis, which would have made the final impossible.",
    "BIOL 102 provides a general view to cell biology and introduces us to reading scientific papers.",
    "I would recommend Biol 102 to another student because it is helpful in developing skills to read scientific papers.",
    "A much more difficult course than BIO 101 but very rewarding in its content",
    "This is a necessary evil. I would not take this unless you need to for a major. This is not a good science credit for non science majors.",
    "unfortunately required for premed track and many majors. not a class i would take for pleasure or for the sake of learning. boring, difficult (and not in the good way) and focused far too narrowly for an introductory class.",
    "I enjoyed this class overall. The class was more demanding than BIOL 101 -- the course material and quizzes were harder, and the class was not as well-taught -- but I thought the difficulty made the end result more rewarding. I think I walked away with a very solid foundation of cell biology. Professor Horsley's lectures were very comprehensive, and her review sessions were extremely helpful. I do think the class could have been better organized. Some policies were a bit unreasonable, especially rules for posting on Piazza and clarifying quiz questions. I also wish class materials and grades were posted in a more timely manner.",
    "The material in class is very difficult to get a grasp on, and instead of helping you understand the material, discussion sections are focused on papers that require you to have an understanding of the material in the class. Quizzes are really difficult, in which questions are often unclear in their demand and time is very limited. I do not believe they accurately test your understanding of the material. It is very unfortunate how difficult the course in, because it discourages any love for the subject and ruins the rest of the bio sequence for you.",
    "The 102 module is harder than the 101 module, but the structure of the class is the same. Work hard studying for the quizzes, because it is not easy to do well on them and cumulatively they make up a large part of your grade.",
    "Biology 102 is a class with interesting subject matter and it's a prerequisite for taking any upper-level biology or even Bio 103 or 104, so on the whole it's worthwhile. The class itself isn't especially enjoyable, mostly because it's so large, but the faculty and staff care about making it interesting and some parts of it -- like the papers we read in section -- are actually good.",
    "Quiz, homework, and test questions were often worded horribly, either with mistakes, left out information, or generally being too vague to elicit the correct answer. Quizzes are only out of 20 points and homeworks out of 14, so losing a single point to problems with the wording has significant impact. Reviews are held every week before the quizzes and are very helpful; Professor Horsley seems much more in her element when she is at a blackboard taking questions than in lecture reading off of a powerpoint. Enrichment with Prof Lin is also very helpful, and was pretty much essential for me in understanding the material. Lecture can be a bit frustrating as there are often slides presented that are not in the powerpoints posted for student use, and information is often skimmed over (even when it ends up being the subject of a multiple-point quiz question) or presented incorrectly (to be corrected later, often after studying the wrong information). It can be difficult to get a question answered because of the overly applied label of 'inappropriate' either because it was something that was already covered or might be seen as trying to get an answer\/advantage in the homework or quizes. Overall it was a frustrating class, but doable with a lot of outside work.",
    "Bio 102 with Prof Horsley became a bit of a frustrating class. She was largely a good lecturer and very good about encouraging questions which I appreciated. However, confusing issues from lecture had to be addressed through student questions a lot. It was refreshing to learn material that wasn't part of AP Biology! A lot of cell processes which became complex, and sometimes hard to see the bigger picture. The quizzes and final exam often had confusing questions which really needed clarification."
