   "comments": [
    "Take this class, because it's interesting, but be prepared to at times have no idea what the main point of a lecture was. Ian Quinn likes to keep his students on his toes, especially for tests. Not knowing the format of the test- that was the most frustrating part of the course. But yes, I'd still recommend it. Especially if you are a cog sci major and need an elective, but don't want to take some nonsensical anthro class, or some excruciatingly difficult MCDB neurobio class. This is a good alternative.",
    "This class is a great blend of science and music.I strongly recommend taking it to learn how your brain really perceives and translates music.Prof. Quinn is very nice and it is a nice small lecture.The 3 essays are easy while the exams are a little harder, but overall the course is pretty interesting.",
    "If you can put up with the strange essay questions and erratic exams, this class is worth taking. There is a lot of interesting material in there, but you really have to be patient to learn it. The readings are also very detailed and are not fully discussed in class....even though they play a heavy role in exams.",
    "A good course on the ways in which humans encode auditory stimuli, specifically in the form of music. Towards the end, there is some discussion of why people enjoy music and how different aspects of it (key, tempo, rhythm, etc.) affect the listening experience. I would definitely recommend the course to other students regardless of their major because almost everyone enjoys music. No other reason required!",
    "I highly recommend the course to other students.",
    "If the material seems interesting to you I'd recommend you take it Credit\/D.",
    "It's a great look into how you think about and remember music. Lots of interesting and new concepts\/research. Course also delves into some contemporary and ongoing research, which is cool. Has a required discussion section. Three short (500-word) papers and three exams, so not TOO much work. Expect to memorize a lot of stuff for the exams, though pretty par for the course in the psych department here at yale.",
    "Eh, this course had its ups and downs. It's good for musicians who are very interested in psychology and for psychology\/cogsci majors who are very interested in music. Only take it if you ACTUALLY are interested in both disciplines - if you're only into one, you'll be bored out of your mind half the time. The subject matter is interesting but the readings themselves are usually boring. The course is pretty disjointed overall and Prof. Quinn can sometimes come off as condescending. So, if it really appeals to your interests then try it out, but if not then it's not worth it.",
    "Great course! Cool material. Just make sure you like Professor's teaching style.",
    "I would definitely recommend 343 to another student. I found the course material very engaging, and even though the second half of the semester was a bit jumpy in terms of subject matter I really enjoyed it. If you are easily frustrated by not knowing what is coming next in a course, being unsure of the format of an exam, etc., you might not be as pleased as I was with the class...but if you are at all interested in music cognition, I'd say take it. I don't regret it!",
    "Over-all, I am ambivalent about this class. There are other classes which would cover similar material and be more inspiring\/well taught. I was frustrated by the discontinuity in the subject matter, and felt like we were just superficially looking at a bunch of concepts that I had already covered in linguistics, psychology, cog sci, music theory etc... The papers and textbook readings seemed unnecessarily long, and I don't feel like I gained a greater understanding of what music cognition even is or is trying to accomplish. That being said, if you REALLY want to do something with music cognition, this class will introduce you to a significant body of the literature on the subject, and give you a good idea of what kinds of research and theories exist.",
    "Interesting class to take for both musicians and people interested in the brain.",
    "This is a really interesting course if you're interested in both music and cognitive science and are willing to not be a \"purist\" as a musicologist or cognitive scientist (more of an issue for the former than the latter). Prof. Quinn gives excellent lectures and has great command of the material. My only complaints are that the tests, especially the first one, required an annoying amount of memorization, and the essay prompts were annoying - we had to do a meta-analysis of BS'd descriptions of \"the most meaningful music to me\" from our classmates, \"describe the interaction of melody, text, and a visual component\" in a video, and finally analyze academic response to an article. For all the effort, I only got anything out of the final essay.",
    "the lecures bored me to tears but the topics covered in the readings were very interesting.",
    "Good, but I felt it was slightly too heavy on music theory and soft psychology rather than neuroscience. Quinn is a solid professor, though he said that the second exam would have the same format as the first when it was actually completely different.",
    "Definitely take it if you are a musician. Many elements about performing will be analyzed more technically, and you'll gain a lot by taking this class. Most interesting class I've taken at Yale. Wish I actually did more of the reading.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class. The course is a survey of different cognitive issues involving music."
