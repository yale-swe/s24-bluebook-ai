    "This is a great class to take if you want to expand your talents as a photographer or journalist.",
    "YES. If you are interested in exploring social issues in New Haven (regardless of your photo ability) this class will provide you the opportunity to get very acquainted with that issue. The class is going to be what you make of it. Go in looking to create something meaningful, and you will.",
    "Professor Grinker's course allows students to learn about social documentary photojournalism, and to pursue an individual project. She is kind and passionate about this work, and the course reading is extremely light. However, pursuing a meaningful project is difficult, time-consuming, and at points frustrating.",
    "The best part about this course is that you are getting critiqued by somebody who is a working photojournalist, who will share stories about the field. It's a very simple final project--document something in New Haven. You get out as much as you put in. I worked to put together an audio slideshow and something that could be publishable online, but I had other classmates who got busy with their theses or other assignments; they still did well and got something out of the class. It's really a class for beginners, though--at least, I think the students make it that way, and our professor sort of just lowered her standards for how harshly she would critique.I als appreciated how open Lori was as a professor--she was very willing to recommend different internships and people to get in touch with, to meet before or after class and to just share her experiences.The worst part is that the class goes by very slowly. Instead of having us look at slideshows beforehand and asking us to come to class with critiques, we would load other people's work in class (which came with its own technical delays) and then talk about it. Since most of my classmates pretty much came into this class wanting to take photographs as a hobby (and as second semester seniors) but not really having too much background in art history or visual theory, our conversations were not very interesting. Lori doesn't really like visual theory so we couldn't get very deep into that.The other risky part of this class is that it really depends on the classmates you have. If you have classmates who are really motivated photojournalists, who think a lot about story telling and photography TOGETHER, then you're going to have a great experience. My class was filled with people who just \"liked\" taking photographs, so when they presented their work there wasn't a lotto talk about because they had not put a lot of thought into their projects, they merely picked something that was interesting to them and took some photographs. So our critiques just amounted to aesthetic things like \"you could get closer.\"",
    "This course basically walks you through creating a documentary photography piece (about new haven). There is maybe an hour of reading for the first 10-weeks and some discussion on various photographic topics, but the focus of the course is definitely on the project.The worst part of this class is the second week where you have to develop a project idea which is most of your semester grade. If you can get past this and develop a subject or two, the course is very rewarding and very fun. I forced myself to just walk in and start taking pictures and interviewing people, and my project kind of just developed from there. People are out there who will have and tell a good story, you just have to find them.I was absolutely amazed at some of the work my classmates put out. There were a number of excellent projects which are truly professional quality. Lori was fantastic at helping us fill in gaps in our projects and guiding them forward. She is also a master of the photographic scene, and brought in a ton of fascinating photo projects and speakers."
