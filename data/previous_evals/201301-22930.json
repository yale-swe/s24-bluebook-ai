    "Yes, I totally would recommend this class for someone interested in making video art!",
    "Whatever 'kind' of video art you are looking for, Sarah can teach you how. Cinema like, youtube things, how to, performance art, animation. Seek her out, and you will learn.",
    "i would recommend it to anyone.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone with interests and very little experience in video, though anyone with prior experience may be a bit sleepy during the walkthroughs of Fina Cut etc.I would summarize it as a great beginner video class, or a great art class, but if you can't stand abstract video then it really isn't the class for you",
    "Absolutely take this class. Sarah is a wonderful teacher. She's enthusiastic but also chill and really really nice. You'll get to see your peers make some fantastic and not-so-fantastic video art. You'll make some fantastic and not-so-fantastic video art. But video is an incredible medium, well worth investing time in. So if you're considering take it definitely do.",
    "This is a video art seminar\u00e2\u0080\u0094the video assignments are best when they produce work that is brief and experimental. Sarah frames the course as a place to play with video for the first time while drawing from a long selection of influential precedents. Discussion is open and honest and the class grows a personality unique to the students and the work they are producing. I'm going to be thinking about this course for a long time. Highly recommended.",
    "GREAT CLASS, take it with SARAH LASLEY, she made the class. Like most art classes, the more you put into it, the more you will get out of it. Sometimes it's hard to find ideas to make into a project, but the more you play with the video camera the easier it gets, and sarah is very supportive of basically anything you want to do as long as you commit to the idea."
