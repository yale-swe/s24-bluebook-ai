   "comments": [
    "It is NOT a gut. There is a lot of work involved. It was probably my hardest class of the semester, but it was also my best. The work is fun and enjoyable and I loved every minute of it.",
    "This is a great course, but there is a lot of reading, and 50% of your grade is the final paper and final exam. Reading is around 100-150 pages per week, and there is a required movie screening every week as well.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you are a film major or are interested in working in film. Professor Connor is amazing and you'll watch a lot of diverse films and have intering discussions about them. The essay assignments are kind of convoluted though and the final was hard, so it's not a gut.",
    "yes if you are strongly interested in hollywood",
    "Art& Industry is a great class for either film studies novices or majors. It's a wonderful mix of learning about close analysis of film as well as the way that the industrial side works. JD Connor is a brilliant profesor -- he's knows just about everything about film, and is very approachable and willing to help out. Don't be fooled by the screening list, though -- this is a tough course with a lot of work. There are three papers and a very intense final. It's also a big time commitment, the twice a week lecture is an hour and fifteen minutes long, in addition to a weekly screening and section. In the end, totally worth it. If you work hard you can do well.",
    "Definitely more about the industry than the art. It's a great excuse to watch a movie once a week, but be prepared for a lot of work (if you're not a movie buff, consider taking it cr\/d. I wish I had!) There's three written assignments and a final.",
    "You should take this course. It is very interesting and manageable. It is a lot of reading (a lot) and a fair amount of work. However, it is really interesting. JD is a great lecturer the selection of films are also really interesting: some you might have seen, some you may have wanted to see and some you would never see.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Film Studies 334. Even if you have never taken a film class before, it is worth it to give this course a go. Professor Connor is unbelievably good and is always more than happy to meet with you if you need help. The lecture environment is incredibly intimate; you can ask a question at any time and often are expected to provide the answer to questions that Professor Connor poses. The topics are interesting and the movies you watch are worthwhile. If you are interested in Film Studies, this is the course to take.",
    "It's way more work than you think it will be. Don't take it if you are a busy person. The subject matter is really interesting though and JD is amazing so it's definitely worth it if you can make time for it.",
    "Yes but only if the industry of Hollywood is something that interests you.",
    "Yes. A good course with interesting material.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in the nature of moviemaking today. The class taught me a ton!",
    "Absolutely. Because.",
    "Although anyone can take this course without a film studies background, it's probably better to come in prepared with some idea of how to write proper film papers. Grading in the course is tough, and JD and the TFs demand a lot from the students. It's a high-level, theoretical course that challenges almost everyone who takes it, so definitely do not take it if you're looking for an easy course where you can watch movies for homework. Film 334 is not that class. Instead, you'll learn a ton of new information and learn to view films with a lot more attention to detail from production to distribution to exhibition. I loved the course despite how difficult it was, so true film enthusiasts should too.",
    "This is a great class and you will learn an incredible amount about specific films and Hollywood in general. However, it is very time consuming. You need to put a lot of effort into all of the assignments because they are worth so much of the grade.",
    "It was great. Prof Connor is brilliant, sometimes a little too brilliant (i.e. sometimes his analysis was beyond the reach of a good chunk of the students in the class), but it was a very enlightening class. I definitely recommend it to another student - it really has changed the way I view movies and inspired me to take more film classes. It is very work intensive so I don't recommend it as a fifth class, but I think it's a must take. The assignments, especially the final paper, were actually pretty fun (when they weren't stressful) and Prof Connor and the TFs were very invested in helping to improve your writing so that they were a great learning experience. The final is a marathon but I emerged from it feeling really confident that I'd learned a lot from this class. I ultimately didn't put as much effort into this class as I should have (I credit Ded it out of fear from the workload), but I still got so much out of it. Definitely take it.",
    "A lot of work for something that really doesn't deserve that much of your time. I took it cred d fail and still slaved on essays for hours on end. Not really worth it if you're not in the major or if you're only into watching cool movies (and not writing excessively academic papers for them). Some pretty cool stuff though if you don't have to do the work. Audit it or something if you're bored",
    "I can't imagine taking this class for credit because of the substantial amount of reading and information that we learn in lecture, but this class is an incredible use of a Credit\/D. You learn a ton about the Hollywood industry, and J.D. Connor's lectures are so mind-blowingly insightful that I really enjoyed going to class every week. Definitely take this class if you like movies.",
    "This class is one of those you walk into because it sounds like fun or sounds like an opportunity to see films you've always wanted to see. You'll walk out, though, with a totally changed view of Hollywood movies and how they work. JD may rely a little too heavily on corporate allegory, and sometimes it's hard to fully buy in, but more often than not, he's onto something. Writing assignments are graded fairly, and the last one especially can become really exciting if you choose a topic that truly interests you. JD really wants the course to serve students' interests, so he'll accept and help with final papers that focus a little outside the scope of the class (i.e. television instead of film). As an American Studies major, I got major credit for FILM 334 even though I'm not Art History or Film Stud, so if you're in that situation, consider this class (especially if you're concentrating in visual, audio, literary and performance cultures). To anyone remotely interested in contemporary film and how it got to be how it is, TAKE THIS COURSE. Consider Credit\/D, though, because the final is tough.",
    "Great class. Makes you think of film both from a creative and business perspective. The workload is quite heavy though and the material can be difficult.",
    "Yes!"
