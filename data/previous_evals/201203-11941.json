    "Homework assignments every night and biweekly tests. The tests get exponentially harder but they are still always manageable.",
    "German is a great language and German culture makes for some fun cultural activities. I would recommend starting German at Yale, although don't expect to make too much progress in your first semester. The German department at Yale is active and student-friendly. Tanja is a good and helpful teacher, but I would recommend shopping around to see which of the instructors is the best fit for you personally.",
    "Take it! Not a lot of people take German so class sizes are small. I really felt like I learned a lot in one semester. The homework is manageable and the tests aren't too difficult. Plus, there's no final exam! The German department is really supportive too.",
    "It was a very good class. Not a lot of work compared to other intro language classes. Very well-taught. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot and would recommend it to everyone. However, the requirement of having to take two semesters in order to receive credit was pretty harsh. It would be more understandable if it were some certificate that would not be granted unless two semesters were completed.",
    "Take it if you're interested, but maybe not the best language class for just distributional reqirements"
