    "this course was a good overview of different types of cancers- however, because all the lectures were so different, there was not much comparability- for example, we got a lot of biology on some cancers and not others. it is therefore not all that easy to compare al the cancers.",
    "It gave a comprehensive overview of cancer trends. I am glad that it focused on the United States. Too many Yale classes focus on global aspects and barely touch what is happening in the US.",
    "This course is an excellent overview of the different cancer types and the major exposures associated with cancer. Guest lecturers are frequently there to teach on their topic of expertise which gives a great deal of insight into each type of cancer.",
    "Strengths: The broad picture as well as carefully selected topics was very helpful. Each class was taught by experts in that area, which was exceptionally inspirational. The assignments were designed to strengthen our understanding and use of knowledge learned in class, which was great experience.Weakness: none."

    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0brenda was always very responsive to us with emailed or asked questions. she is nice and funny and knew her cancer information.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0She is very nice and obviously very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Dr. Cartmel is excellent. She knows a lot about cancer epi and makes the course very interesting. She is extremely helpful in class.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0very helpful with students. Always responds back to emails that you pose, etc.",
    "Instructor: Brenda Cartmel \u00a0Strengths: The way Dr. Cartmel taught each class helped me get a good understanding of epidemiology research, how it is carried out and how knowledge is achieved from research. She is also responsive to students' questions and needs, providing useful references and resources. What's more, Dr. Cartmel's encouragement to each student was very helpful.Weakness: none."

   "comments": [
    "a required course for cde students- but also good for non-cde students as it did not go too heavy into epi or biology. good for an overview of different cancers. not too demanding. the class itself, however, was not that engaging or interesting- but that depended on who was presenting as the class is mainly guess lectures.",
    "An excellent and important class with a top-notch professor. Highly recommended!",
    "Excellent course. I would definitely recommend it if you would like a broad overview of the different types of cancer and the associated exposures.",
    "Overall, this is a very good course, deserving to be recommended to fellow students, for its wide covery of relevant topics as well as opportunities to getting access to a variety of resources."
