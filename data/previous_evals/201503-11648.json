    "I would recommend it. It's a lot of work with weekly section quizzes, but the terms are given to you in advance, so that's helpful. But it's an interesting topic if you pay attention and go to class (which for me was sometimes difficult since the slides were online and going to class wasn't absolutely necessary). Professor Johnston and the TA's were awesome.",
    "A very thorough introduction to Roman history and history as a whole. Prof. Johnston tells a really interesting narrative, and I would recommend to another student, probably one who is at least somewhat interested in the subject. I do think the class is accessible to everyone, as I didn't have any significant prior background in classics\/Rome. Section is enjoyable too. There's a lot of reading, some of which can be dry but some of which is great! The grading is fair-to-generous, and the expectations for the two papers and exams are very straightforward. I've always enjoyed history, and this class was a nice way to contextualize what history is.",
    "One of the best classes you will have the chance to be in at Yale. Johnston is great, really engaging and a great person to talk to - go to office hours! There is a fair amount of reading but you can get away with not doing most of it because lectures are so informative, but you'll probably want to read it after hearing Johnston speak so passionately about it. Section is really well structured and was well-led. Grading is fair, two papers, a midterm and a final. You will learn so much not just about the Roman Republic but also the field of history and the implications of history for the present.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. I mean, who doesn't love learning about Kings, power-hungry tyrants, stabbings, gang wars, and large-scale military operations involving elephants? In short, you'd be losing out if you didn't take this course.",
    "Anybody even vaguely interested in Rome should take this class. It is a good amount of reading but intensely rewarding. I was very impressed with how much I was able to learn in a semester.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any other student - even someone who is not particularly interested in history. This course was by far the most interesting, in depth, and enjoyable history classes I have ever taken. Professor Johnston can keep his students' attention for the entire lecture, and is clearly very excited about the subject (and succeeds in passing on that enthusiasm).",
    "Take the class. Professor Johnston is an absolutely amazing! He is excellence in teaching personified. He always goes out of his way to help students and get to know them. His course did a great job in outlining the history of the Roman Republic.",
    "Even if you have only a slight interest in Rome, I would recommend this class. This might have been one of the best classes I have ever taken. There is a decent amount of work that comes with it, but it is completely worth it.",
    "Roman Republic is a really good course. It's definitely more work than a typical lecture-- weekly quizzes in section mean that you can't really let yourself get too behind. But the material is fascinating, and Professor Johnston is an amazing professor. His lectures are really interesting, and he puts a LOT of work into the course. He's one of those professor who actually enjoys teaching, as well as being extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter. The two papers aren't bad at all, and the first one is actually kind of fun. It's a perfect course to take Credit\/D. I would 100% recommend it to another student.",
    "Absolutely take it.",
    "The Roman Republic is an excellent class for those with an interest in world history. It covers not only the entire history of the Regal and Republican periods -- from the foundation of Rome to the rise of Augustus -- but the historiography of the era, the notable figures who defined it, and the changing culture of Rome and its empire. I found it both comprehensive and interesting, from the lectures to the textbook to even the sections. Professor Johnston was engaging and knowledgeable, and the TAs were excellent as well. I find it hard to say anything negative about this course, which was one of my favorites at Yale. I should make clear, though, that some people might not love it as much as I did. If you're genuinely interested in learning about Roman history, I can guarantee you'll like this one and learn a massive amount. But if you're looking for a lightweight history class or an easy credit, give this one a pass. There's plenty of reading and studying to do -- understandable for a class that covers 700 years -- and there are lots of names and events to remember. I wouldn't say it's notably harder than most Yale history classes, but it isn't a walk in the park either. All in all I absolutely suggest this course for those with an interest. There's so much to recommend it -- a professor who makes centuries-old events interesting and accessible, the chance to read from some of the greatest Roman texts and authors, a thorough and insightful examination of the Roman world beyond Italy... this class was a blast, and it only left me wanting to learn more.",
    "Excellent Class!",
    "Professor Johnstons dynamic teaching style really enlivened the subject of Roman history. I found the breadth of material covered, from architecture, to politics, to war strategy, to give an incredibly well-rounded picture. The precedents set by the Romans are so important to the ensuing European and American history, the course is an essential to any history major. I wish it had not been divided into two courses, one on the Republic and the other on Empire, but I am so happy to have had the opportunity to delve into Romes early history, something I believe to have less attention focused on it. The origins of the republican government and the amalgamation of diverse traditions, Etruscans, Greeks, and other groups, was fascinating. The reading of Livy at the beginning of the course was a highlight.",
    "This is an excellent class, possibly the best one I have taken at Yale. Professor Johnston is a very good professor--knowledgeable, thoughtful, and funny. He connects well with the students and is an approachable professor. The class is a well rounded overview of the rise and fall of the Roman Republic, which examines many aspects of Roman history, culture, government, and literature. The midterm and final for the class are both very fair and manageable if you have paid attention in class. You have a free choice of final paper, so you can explore whatever topic interests you, whether that be culture, military, literature, economics, imperialism, or even reception in later authors, artists, or societies. In conclusion, Professor Johnston is a truly great professor, and I would be interested in any class he offers.",
    "The Roman Republic (and the follow-up class The Roman Empire) are probably two of the best classes I've taken at Yale. If you aren't at all interested in history they are probably not for you, but the Romans are incredibly fascinating in a number of ways (especially given the parallels you can see between their society and ours) and if you're even remotely curious about them, take this class. Andrew Johnston is an incredible lecturer, and his lecturers do an amazing job of making a 2000+ year-old civilization come to life like it's something out of a fantasy novel. The class covers a very broad range of topics in Roman life, politics, culture, society, and more, and the tests are balanced between those (generally with 3-4 topics, each of which you have 3 prompts to choose from for an essay). Workload is not light, but you can definitely get by without doing most of the reading, as Johnston gives out handouts with quoted primary sources that tie into each lecture. It's a great class to Credit\/D if you don't want to worry about keeping up on everything, but the grading is also quite fair so you can very easily do well if you put a bit of effort in. Overall I can't recommend this class or its \"sequel\" enough - it's worth taking for Professor Johnston alone, but the topic makes it an even more fascinating and enjoyable course.",
    "This is a wonderful class on Roman history taught by a passionate professor. A liberal arts education at Yale is incomplete without this class.",
    "The best class ever. Well, if you put the work into it. This class can either be regrettable--sparknotes, memorize the IDs, doze in and out of lecture--or it can be the most rewarding and interesting class. I tried it both ways, and the latter is far superior. If you take it, be prepared to engage with difficult primary sources and answer questions based off of incomplete information. Be prepared to have an opinion because Roman history is not clear-cut. You get to handle Roman coins, produce a research paper that you dictate and listen to Professor Johnston, who is one of the best lecturers I've ever had. In my final opinion, take the course. It's the best.",
    "Roman Republic is a great course that covers the history of this time period. It is not a class to take lightly as there is a lot of materials, and with both essays and exams throughout the course, it requires both breadth of knowledge and depth. Still, Johnston teaches an incredible history that truly inspires awe.",
    "Take this class!! Professor Johnston is dreamy and smart, the material is fascinating, and you'll come out a more understanding person afterwards. It goes spectacularly in depth but also moves at a fast enough pace to stay exciting. The assignments are fun. The things that you're learning are fun. Roman history is crazy. Take the class, no matter the major!!!!!!"
