    "In an school environment that does not assume previous academic experience, I think it would make sense to structure the projects in a way that best highlights the skill sets of the school's students. Specifically, I think that the paper assignment is geared towards a student with a specific academic background and is therefore not a very sensitive tool with which to measure a student's absorption of the material. Many students spend much more time worrying about how the paper will be crafted (a skill that is most practically useful only to dramaturgs, critics, and perhaps directors) instead of thinking about the material itself. I think a more open ended project, through which the students could engage with the material in a way that corresponds to or overlaps with their own area of expertise, would make the course feel more relevant and less overwhelming.",
    "We arent tested on what we've learned in the class but rather how well we can memorize material for the exams.",
    "The Fuchs paper is a great way to ask students to write that allows a focus on production. It highlights the aim of the course to provide inspiration, rather than lean academic for its many non-academic students.",
    "I enjoyed the play I read for the paper and I was glad to have an easy topic in the middle of such a busy semester but since I pretty much approach every play as described in the Fuch's essay it felt like busy work.",
    "RE the paper, the reality is we have so much to do at this school between course work, homework, production work, production assignments, and workstudy that the paper becomes more of an albatross than an opportunity for learning. It becomes that thing in the way the week you try to do it, and end up pulling an all nighter to fit into our already chaotic lives.",
    "I feel like 2 papers is fair.",
    "The paper for this class not only allowed for deeper study into the world of a particular play, it opened me up to the Elinor Fuchs style of analyzation.",
    "The canon of what is covered in this course is slanted. There is a Euro-centric focus that I think should be evaluated because we miss out on the wealth of theatre history that is not focused on European advancement."

    "It's hard to get the readings done with all the work we already have.",
    "Honestly, the amount of assigned reading is the bare minimum that I can give per week. TDs and Designers are unfairly swarmed with crazy schedules that it is just unfortunate that I can only give no more than time to read the text. Earlier in the week I was able to read Oscar Brockett's books and research other materials online, but then things became really really impossible, and some weeks, were simply impossible. Its just unfortunate, because it is such a privilege to receive lectures by Paul Walsh and have break-out discussions by an amazing team of TAs, and I wished we had more time.",

When I met with the chair of my department last semester and Drama 6, and my performance in it, was not even mentioned, I felt that there was some institutional schism between my department and the mandated course, or that my department does not truly consider Drama 6 to be part of my essential work at the school. So I tested out. But I still wanted to leave comments because I think this is a valuable class.",
    "Yes. I think it's important that students in all departments keep thinking broadly about performance, and this class helps do that. For students outside the Drama 50 club, I also think it's important that people keep reading plays consistently.",
    "Only if they have an extra 4 hours in their week for all of the reading.",
    "I would recommend it but I believe the work the class entails should not get in the way of the real reason why we are attending this program. It should be catered to the fact that all the different students in the different fields have workloads that don't permit them to absorb the valuable information this class delivers. Things need to be structured in a different way.",
    "No. Unfortunately, I felt as though due to the nature of the way in which the information is spoken at us, one could learn just as much from simply reading a book or the very powerpoint that the professor uses. There is no need for a lecture. Discussion groups were useful.",
    "Yes, I do feel it has a useful place in the course of study.",

    "Yes indeed!",
    "Definitely. Paul Walsh gives a comprehensive oveview on Theatre and its evolution. I was able to draw comparisons between periods into the present and to hypothesize the future of Theatre as well as what I am interested in creating myself. There is a lot of information to cover and not everything peaked my interest which I think could be solved through a survey at the beginning of class allowing students to voice from what perspective they are interested in studying Theatre ki.e. female artists, black artists,lgbtq artists) as to ensure they are included in the class more.",
    "No, because I believe it's a skewed view of Theatre History, and lacks a significant information on the contribution to the inception and evolution of theatre by people of color - specifically on the African continent, reducing the contribution to that of ritual and plays created in response to colonialism.",

    "What was presented, with the exception of theatrical contributions of Africans and African- Americans, seemed to be very thorough. Additionally, the information that was presented on European contribution to theatre, like Grotowski, his connection and studies with the African and Afro-Carribean content in the development of his theatrical practices and theories were not acknowledged by Paul. I find examples like this, and the formerly mentioned lack of information extremely troubling, because it marginalizes the presences of Blackness in the inception of theatre world that we know and respect. Thomas Richards' book \"The Edge Point of Performance\" highlights his work with Grotowski and where the man drew great inspiration from. This was one of the books I read this semester researching for an acting class, and discovered this information. I'd have never known about it otherwise. However, learning of this, I was able to appreciate that there was a mixing of cultural contribution to create the work we study and respect, rather than everything having derived from Eurocentric conception. I believe there should be more information to support this idea, and therefore taught, so we can have evidence to support the call for diversity within the theatre. If we see perpetuate the lack of diversity within the historical study, we'll have less support on the modern day end."

I understand you are using the slideshow to give us more information - but I miss a LOT of things in class because I am either trying to read the slide or listen to you.",
    "Things got really really confusing, particularly distinguishing different types of romanticism. And also futurism and the rest of the modernist movements. They are so subjective that it is not only difficult to remember. They are also difficult to really grasp. But I am grateful that the lecture and section on Brecht made it so clear for me, because I never understood him. But thanks to Paul Walsh's lecture in clarifying that Brecht and what makes a production 'Brechtian' was not simply attributed to his 'estrangement' techniques, but also dramaturgically embedded in his text and others. Brilliant. But I still don't find Brecht too fancy.",

I wanted to see less male white writer s although I understand those writers were the ones being produced most.

For example, a classmate asked a question asking about the role of the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Theatre Movement in relation to a lecture Paul gave that happened during that time period, and he answered, \"you mean, like the contribution of people like Langston Hughes and Lorraine Hansberry?\" - two Black people he'd briefly mentioned in his lecture, as to say that he had serviced her request. He failed to answer her question, and I believe the point that was missed was that, those two people don't represent and entire movements that spanned decades, and the mere mention of them, was what my classmate was asking for or about. The defensive demeanor by Paul was very discouraging, and after witnessing, I didn't feel welcomed to engage him with questions of the sort."

    "I found it frustrating in the final exam when we were expected to know plays that we did not read for this course (plays that were mentioned in lectures but not really discussed) There is barely time to learn the material covered. There is no time to do any extracurricular reading. If we had been able to discuss plays within our knowledge base that were not discussed it would have been better than having been asked about very specific plays that I did not know.",
    "I would desperately beg that the material and the history being presented in class was not so white, european centric. There was a LOT of history that was either unspoken of or just barely skimmed over. I do realize that it is impossible to cover everything in this one class BUT I think it is extremely irresponsible of this institution to give less weight and importance to movements such as The Harlem Renaissance, or The Chicano Movement, or the LGBT Movement, among others. There is such emphasis on the canonized history of the theater, but the canon is not necessarily the best representative of the collective historical progression that has led to where and how the theater exists today. We need to be more responsible. This is not a condemnation of the professor. This is a call to arms. Priorities need to be made and met.",
    "As I said above...less from the white make perspective on Theatre."

   "comments": [
    "To help create opportunities for grading, and to encourage the students to engage with the matieral closely, I think that students should be asked to lead the discussion sections once or twice during the semester. They would send out questions to think about at the beginning of the week, come into class with a short (2-3 minute) presentation of some aspect of the text that interested them and connects to the questions they asked, and then lead their fellow students in discussion. I think this might be a good idea too, because public speaking and clear explanation of ideas and moderation of discussion applies across disciplines -- its a skill that can be used effectively or not so in production meetings, meet and greets, rehearsal rooms, etc.",
    "Discussion sections are extremely useful.",
    "Discussion groups were invaluable.",
    "I feel like one term was more beneficial than the other - based on the TA and the percentage of students who had done the readings.",
    "I enjoyed my discussion leader, and i was one of the more vocal members of my section. I find that the usefulness of these periods is due to my fellow students, much more than the T.A. Their divergent and vocal opinions create a great discussion."

    "Instructor: Jennifer Marie Schmidt \u00a0Jenny was always prepared, honest, and excited to be there. This made discussion group productive and fun.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Marie Schmidt \u00a0Jenny was always accessible and a welcoming presence as a discussion leader. Sometimes though, we looked to her for more context and direction than she provided. Jenny was at her best when she brought in other work of the period studied (like music), and when she pushed the discussion toward imagining the work in production or how we would produce it today. She should play to her strengths and prepare more activities along these lines. The more academic discussions this semester were less valuable. Similarly, her weekly writing questions were best when clearly designed to get the juices flowing for discussion. Sometimes it was clear in class that that was the intention, but the written question had seemed very specific or technical. I think making it clear that the question and the discussion are designed together would help students be more excited and engaged.",
    "Instructor: Jennifer Marie Schmidt \u00a0Ms. Schmidt is kind and encouraging, but was seemed confused by most questions that didn't have to do directly with her personal expertise.",
