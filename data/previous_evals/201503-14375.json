    "Absolutely, take it! You get to spend two hours in the art gallery doing close looking at different paintings every week. Prof. Suthor is an excellent teacher she always always always gets you to see something you didn't see before, and I can't tell you how many times I've had \"wow\" moments when looking at an artwork and very understanding. It's a low stress, enjoyable, and enlightening way to spend your Thursday mornings.",
    "Easiest class I've ever taken at Yale. However, you do need some background in art to make it worthwhile. The only work in the class was 1 paper (10 pages) and 1 class presentation (15 min).",
    "This was one of my favorite courses, and I loved being in the gallery."
