   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone with at least the slightest interest in poetry. Poets of all levels would do good to take this class as well as those who have never written poetry before. You really do study the craft and get to practice it in your own way as well.",
    "Yes. Take it. It'll change your life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. If you are interested in poetry at all TAKE IT! You won't regret it.",
    "Given the chance, I wouldn't hesitate to this class again. Every day and every assignment was such a pleasure--it didn't feel like a class at all. Every week we had a set of poems to read and we spent Tuesday discussing it. We also wrote one poem a week based on a prompt and we spent Thursdays workshopping them as a class. It was such a wonderfully-organized class and the professor is really great too! He loves poetry and teaching--both show every day of class!",
    "If you love poetry, take it! It's a great class to share your work with people who will truly appreciate it. Workshops are never critical and people always say nice things, and it's just a wonderful environment. Most of the reading is contemporary poetry, so if you don't quite like modern stuff the class might not be for you",
    "WONDERFUL course. One of my favorites at Yale. It's not too hard, and is mostly centered around your own poetry writing. There's really no way to go wrong as long as you show up, are attentive, and kind to your peers and the professor. I learned a lot about myself as a creative thinker in this course, and I'd recommend the class to ANYONE.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I would say this is a very intimate course that you should take if you are interested in contemporary poetry and want to develop as a poet. Writing poetry or having some prior understanding of poetry is beneficial to the overall experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone who is in anyway interested in poetry. The readings may be long, but they are interesting and, because most of them are poetry, easy to take in small chunks. The writing assignments are fun, and class is always entertaining. A great poetry class no matter what level of poetry study you already have.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Try it, especially if you love poetry but have never had the balls to write. You might surprise yourself."
