    "An excellent class. This semester we studied a number of techniques in chromatic harmony (using the harmony textbook by Aldwell and Schachter), analyzed a number of Beethoven sonatas, analyzed Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin song cycle, each wrote a leid, and wrote a number of analysis papers. We finished the semester with a brief study of atonal music and advanced topics in modern theories of pitch. This being only an intro class, I was surprised by the depth of topics we were able to cover. If you can take it with John Muniz, I highly recommend it as he is an outstanding teacher.",
    "Much harder than 210. Only take it if you have to for the major.",
    "If you have a good instructor and a good section, this can be a lively, enlightening examination of the theory behind the works of Beethoven, Schubert, and their ilk. It makes a very clean continuation of 210, and the course ends at a pretty natural stopping-point, so even if you plan to take no further theory at Yale, you could still get a pretty fulfilling experience from this course.",
    "TAKE IT! It's a great introduction to topics in 19th-century music. Less theory\/composition and more analysis and interpretation than in 210.",
    "It's a great course! You look at really great music and learn about some really useful methods of analysis. If you can take it with John Muniz, definitely do it! He's really engaging and made class discussion fun and interesting. Only thing to note--you will have to do a fair amount of work for this class... Mostly part writing assignments in the beginning, readings every week, and for the first 3\/4 of the semester, we had to write a paper nearly every week (ranging from 2 to 6 pages). You will definitely have some sort of assignment due for nearly every class. Still, I recommend taking it if you can, even if you aren't majoring in music and don't need to take it.",
    "i would recommend it, it is a great analysis class",
    "Yes! Great discussions, interesting assignments.",
    "If you're a music major you have to take this",
    "Music 211 is a continuation of Music 210 in terms of content; however, the class structure is much more discussion driven. Be prepared for a similar amount of coursework to Music 210. If you really enjoy analyzing classical pieces such as Beethoven Sonatas or Schubert song cycles, this course will suit you perfectly.",
    "Music 211 takes the basic theory taught in 210 and 205 and applies it analyzing real (piano) music, such as Chopin, Beethoven, and Schubert. It also introduces more advanced topics in theory, like 12-tone theory and atonality. I had a hard time following a cohesive thread throughout the course or understanding why many of the observations we made were actually significant, but I think this is a problem with this level of music theory in general. Do not take this course with John Muniz."
