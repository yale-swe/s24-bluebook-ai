    "Applied Survival Analysis is about 75% theoretical. I have never understood so little in one class in my life. Compared to the first half of the semester (Design of Epi Studies, which most people would pair with this class), Survival is more difficult, more theoretical, involves much more advanced math, and has a much worse textbook. A textbook that was easier to follow and had exercises at the end of chapters would have made this class much more manageable.As one of the few non-biostat students in the class, I thought that the other students probably found the class much easier than I did. However, at the end, I don't think this was the case. A lot of people were just as lost as I was. 2 of my 3 problem sets were posted by the TA as \"model\" answers, and I felt like I had no idea what I was doing.One other thing that would be very helpful in this class is a SAS reference or guide. There is very little SAS instruction in the class and the Professor and TA both admitted to their weakness in SAS (I think they work in R), but the problem sets and final required quite a bit of SAS.",
    "terrible class. this class is called \"applied survival\" but it was anything but applied. the lectures were very dry and dr. zhao presented too many proofs and not enough examples and applications. both classes should have been taught as full semester classes. tuesday's should be designated to presenting the concepts and theory, while thursdays should be to reinforce the material with applications with SAS. also, it was very difficult to do the homework and data analysis by ourselves because the SAS code was either not given to us or it was unclear what the SAS code did. i spent too much time googling how to do these commands, where it should have been taught in class. that's why either the TA or professor should provide original, annotated SAS code and notes for the thursday lectures.",
    "This course titled 'applied survival analysis' was not applied at all. The formula derivations that we were asked to do are not applied and are irrelevant to future work for the majority of the class. This course was significantly worse than other BIS courses that I have taken at EPH. I do not feel like I gained any practical knowledge above and beyond what I had already learned about Kaplan-Meier and survival analysis in Dr. Makuch's Clinical Trials.",
    "It is a good course.",
    "this course focused too much on mathematical proofs which seems unhelpful for non-biostatiticians.",
    "I thought this was an excellent course that is critical to the MPH toolbox. The only thing that I would suggest is that it be made into a full semester course. The amount of material is very large and having a full semester would make it digestible. Also, I would have set it up so that Tuesdays were the theory days and Thursdays were some type of practical application, the equivalent of a lab (but not creating a separate lab section - that would not be needed)",
    "The lectures were so hard to follow was the survival class was mostly theoretical rather than applied. Most of the time, I taught myself as I was unable to get anything out of the lecture. The homeworks were difficult only because the lectures were not helpful. The final was long and again, I taught myself how to complete the whole exam using my own resources. I could have easily not participated or attended the class (even though I went to class) and have gotten the same exact grade and knowledge. The lectures need to be improved drastically long with the structure of the course."

    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0This was Dr. Zhao's first time teaching this course. He is a very nice guy and could become a really good professor, but needs to figure out how to better relay information to students who are at a completely different level of understanding than he is.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0very nice and approachable professor, but he could not teach. he emphasized too much proofs and theory rather than applications.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Dr. Zhao should not be teaching survival. He was often unable to answer students questions and is not accessible outside of class. Dr. Zhao teaches via rote memorization of formulas and derivations rather than explaining why and how formulas are used. I now know many new formulas from the class but have no idea when or how to use them - which makes my new knowledge useless.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Professor Zhao is good at teaching. What he teaches in the classroom is very clear.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0too obsessed with showing mathematical proofs on the board, leaving many clueless about the material, and even more clueless on the rationale behind this motive, especially when the class consists of predominantly non-biostats majors.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0I thought he was very approachable, flexible and was easy to work with. This is difficult material, so it was a hard task. I think Hongyu did a very good job given a limited 1\/2 semester timeframe.",
    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0Very nice and friendly. Very approachable."

    "Greg is my favorite biostat TA for any class. I wish he knew SAS a bit better, but he is great at helping to find the answers even to SAS questions that he doesn't know.",
    "greg was very helpful in explaining the material, but he was a very tough grader. it would have been nice if he came to lecture and explained to the class his expectations of the homeworks, that way we would have a better idea what he's looking for.",
    "Greg is a sub-par TA. He shouldhave been holding at least 1 SAS session a week in order to teach how to do SAS survival. Also, he graded on a different scale than the professor taught. Numerous times, Dr. Zhao would tell us something was correct as a class and then when you put that on the homework, Greg would grade it as incorrect. Also, when you emailed him a question he usually sent back \"googled\" documents on the topic instead of an answer. I can google on my own - when you ask a TA a question they should be able to answer it or they should clarify it with the professor. I would not recommend him to TA BIS courses in the future as his teaching skills are highly lacking.",
    "The TA is good. He prepares detailed answers to all the homework and is very helpful.",
    "He\/she never came to class. Consider conducting tutorial classes to explain concepts and go through computer programs.",
    "Greg was readily available and happy to help, which is what you need from a TA.",
    "Hard grader but fair",
    "The office hours were at bad times along with his grading as he took off points for the smallest things. Grading was very inconsistent. The professor should have just done the grading."

    "I believe biostat students and phDs are required to take this course. If that is not you, think about it carefully. If you do not remember calculus (at least how to take integrals and derivatives of complex functions), then you will be at a major disadvantage. Unless you have a specific reason to engage with Survival Analysis (requirement, thesis data, future job, etc.), I wouldn't recommend this course.",
    "terrible class. if you're not a biostats major, i do not recommend taking this course.",
    "Unless you are required to take this course, do not bother wasting your time with the biweekly lectures as you will not learn anything applicable in the class.",
    "I would recommend it to other students.",
    "I won't recommend this unless you are a biostatistics major looking to see mathematical proofs in real time.",
    "Good overview to basic techniques of Survival Analysis. I would recommend it to another student who was interested in survival analysis and statistics.",
    "Could be improved lecturing wise as it got too theoretical compared to the HW",
    "Major improvement is needed esp in lecture content. More application is needed rather than theory and proofs."
