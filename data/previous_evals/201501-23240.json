    "I would recommend this course to all who are interested in learning spanish.",
    "Span 120 is a fast paced continuation of spanish from level 1. It quickly covers past both preterite and imperfect and goes into the subjunctive for most of the rest of the semester. By the end, you reach the future tense as well as the perfect tense. The class involves watching movies, speaking in spanish, and a lot of homework. I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The workload really helped to learn the material and I feel like I really learned a lot of spanish this semester. I feel moderately proficient in basic spanish.",
    "It's a good class. Pretty standard language requirement.",
    "SPAN has homework work everyday, which often is unnecessary and uninspiring. Additionally, the class meets every single school day which may become draining. That being said, the weaknesses and difficulties in the SPAN 102 course are nullified by the strength of the instructor. I highly recommend that students take a course with Prof. Bautista. In truth, I feel much more competent and interesting in Spanish, largely owing to the professor.",
    "the overall course does what it needs to do in terms of teaching you Spanish. there is a lot of work as in something every day with more on weekends. but then again this is a 1.5 credit class. however i Highly suggest taking the class with Luis. he is everything a Spanish teacher needs to be with the great bonus of understanding where the students are coming from. he really has your side in a way which helped me greatly through the semester. sometime learning language can be struggling with memorizing the nuts and bolts and jumping through hoops but with Luis it was simply smooth sailing."
