    "I learned everything I could hope to know about wood anatomy. I learned about the development and function of all of the relevant anatomical features in wood. I learned the basics of wood identification and am easily confident with identifying a few common types of wood. I also understand the tools I would use to identify wood beyond those few common types, and feel competent at that. I learned many interesting things about different uses of wood and the underlying reasons different woods are applied to different things. I learned the fundamentals and some interesting applications of dendrochronology.",
    "Everything about wood!",
    "Wood identification, function, structure and dendrochronology.",
    "Starting from a very limited knowledge of wood anatomy, through the course of the semester I was able to get to a point where I was comfortable identifying random pieces of wood and microscope slides--no small feat! I learned a great deal in the course.",
    "We learned about the anatomy of wood, how that influences certain properties of wood, and how to identify species based off of these properties and features."

   "comments": [
    "The instructor presents the material in a clear and concise way. He makes it interesting and relevant for all of the students in the room. He encourages feedback, answers questions thoroughly, and facilitates interesting discussion. He is a great lecturer - when he's got a clear directive, it's like listening to a TED talk or a speech from Obama or something, aka truly a pleasure. The class environment is also very chill, which makes it really easy to listen and engage. There is room for improvement in practical wood identification. We could spend less time looking at microscope slides and more time identifying samples. The lab activities lacked direction, which made them really laid back and awesome, but perhaps some of this time could have been applied to practicing and talking about wood identification.",
    "Field trips are strengths no weaknesses",
    "Strengths are all aspects of the course. The weakness may be the field trips. The trips were all great and if there were a way to incorporate more, that would be great.",
    "I love the hands on aspects and the lectures--it's all fantastic! I would pick the pace up a bit in lectures and focus a bit more on the math side of things--there are all sorts of formulas and such in the book on wood products, and I would have liked to focus more on those."

    "If you don't care about wood, don't want to learn about wood, find wood boring, or aren't interested in wood, then do not take this class. Otherwise, DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Take it",
    "Take it. This course, in my opinion gives the student insight into how to determine the ecological conditions a tree (or stand) at a landscape or regional level had to endure via dendrochronology. And, can give real insight into why certain woody species are more sought after than ours via their structure and function down to the molecular level.",
    "An amazing class with a legendary instructor! You will learn so much and you will never look at wood the same again!"
