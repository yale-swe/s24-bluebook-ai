    "Learned the basics of valuation, portfolio optimization theory, and options pricing. Also learned a little bit about topical events that occurred in finance while taking the class, like the Uber IPO and the spectacular fall (from grace) of The We Company.",
    "You learn basically all that you need to be financially literate (valuation, bond valuation, accounting, option pricing, corporate structure, IPOs, stock pricing, etc.). It's the perfect course if you're looking for finance interview prep, because Pascutti covers literally everything that they could ever ask you. You do gain tangible skills in the class, as you're learning techniques (or the basis for them) that are used in the world daily.",
    "I learned how to better understand the finances underlying large corporate decisions. I also learned about the structure of these large companies and the everyday politics and current events that affect decisions made within the industry",
    "gained a basic understanding of concepts in corporate finance as well as current events (WeWork, etc).",
    "I learned the fundamentals of corporate finance: net present value, accounting, bonds, annuities, perpetuities, capital structure, portfolio management, options, and more. I also improved my math skills.",
    "I didn't learn much of anything in this course. I found myself having to memorize how to do things just to pass exams.",
    "Learned about firm decision making and basic finance concepts",
    "In class focused on real world and real time examples of IPOs, stocks, and options. Focused a lot on the value of buying\/selling securities like bonds, stocks, and options, in the future and in the present day. We also learned a bit about deciding whether a company should undertake a certain project, and how public companies are governed.",
    "I became literate with the basics of corporate finance (capital structure, bonds, options, futures, corporate governance). I had no background so that was helpful and makes financial news easier to understand.",
    "As someone who isn't an economics major and had never even taken an Econ class previously, this class was awesome. The breadth of the course was great -- I learned so many different things about finance including present value, annuities, perpetuity, portfolio management, options theory, arbitrage theory, etc. The class also kept us up-to-date with real-world examples of things we learned in class (e.g. WeWork).",
    "vocabulary for the finance world and basic valuation",

    "Great course that gives a great introduction to equity and fixed income evaluation",

    "I learned about the fundamentals of finance and how to make informed financial decisions. I also learned a lot about how companies raise money.",
    "I learned a lot of intro finance concepts (valuation, bonds, options, etc)",
    "You will get a fairly good understanding of various topics within the world of finance. You will learn about how to price bonds, equities, and other assets like options. You will also learn how to think about various issues facing companies, from the choice to put debt on the balance sheet to agency problems between managers and owners. This is a great class, and it will also prepare people for finance interviews if they are interested in that career path. My level of understanding of finance is significantly deeper due to this class.",

    "Learned a lot about finance, hands on practice with valuations, now I am much more comfortable with the finance terminology \/ applications.",
    "Solid general intro to corporate finance. Definitely tends to be broad and theoretical, whereas professors like Damodaran at NYU focus their courses more heavily on practical applications and tend to assign problems using real company data.

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The major strength of the course is that it provides a firm foundation from which students are able to approach corporate finance in a real world setting. Another strength of the class is the instructor, Prof. Pascutti -- a super fun lecturer, who really does mean well and tries to iterate according to what the students want (within reason). A major weakness of the class is the (non-mandatory) section. Section leaders routinely provided us with incorrect approaches to problem set questions.",
    "Class and PSETs should have been more closely intertwined. Could have been better organized.",
    "All of the psets in this course were not handed in instead, he posted the answers shortly after he posted the problem sets, and then you had a quiz the day it was due in class which was one of the problems from the pset. This certainly added to the workload of the course (and at times the stress), but you could drop one, and forcing yourself to understand the material as the semester progressed made it much easier to study for the midterms and final. The first midterm was very fair in terms of what we had studied, but the second kind of felt disconnected, specifically with the non-math, case-study driven questions. But, the curve is still strong so it didn't end up being that bad. Pascutti is SUPER engaging (he doesn't use a slide deck, so you do have to pay attention and take notes), so you definitely feel like you learn a lot. He also really cares about the class and the students, which is refreshing. The TAs weren't as helpful, as they graded the exams and never actually marked clearly what you got right or wrong the first midterm literally just had a grade at the top with no explanation.",
    "Professor Pascutti is a very engaging lecturer. I think there could be better preparation for the exams woven throughout the course. Perhaps either in having the problem sets contain similar questions to the exams or providing students with practice questions to better prepare prior to an exam. Another weakness was the ambiguous manner through which exams were graded. It would have been helpful to have exams contain the number of points that a student received clearly visible.",
    "Professor Pascutti is both the main strength and the main weakness. He is passionate and enthusiastic about finance, and his lectures are very engaging and funny. He is also knowledgable; he knows what he is talking about. However, he is very disorganized. He jumps from one topic to another in lecture, and it is sometimes hard to follow. Also, the discussion sections had no structure; they were not helpful.",
    "This is the least organized class I have taken at Yale. There is zero structure. We come into class and talk about whatever the professor feels like talking about that day and then have tons of equations to memorize for a weekly problem set quiz. The tests are entirely unpredictable and we have zero resources to help us prepare besides a practice problem here and there and lecture slides that could have been written by a 5th grader, where half of the material in the slides are not covered in lecture and the other half are not relevant to any testing or lecture topic.",
    "Wish lectures were more clear and structured. Very easy to get lost in lecture when Professor Pascutti talks fast",
    "Strengths: The style of the course forced you to actually learn the material. The problem sets were technically optional (and we were given the answers), and for each one we would have a 15 minute quiz in class on one of the questions. Having the answers meant that I actually learned how to correctly do the problems rather than aimlessly guessing and not learning correctly. Weaknesses: A lot of the learning had to be done independently, and class was focused more on current events. The problems we had to know how to do were mostly learned from reading the textbook\/doing the problem sets and sometimes we did not get examples for all problem types in class. Sometimes this felt unorganized since we only covered some topics in class, and if you weren't already familiar with the topic it was hard to follow.",
    "Pascutti is an entertaining lecturer and the course is pretty low workload. If you're not interested, it's going to be very boring, but thats sort of the case for all classes.",
    "The TFs were very unhelpful",
    "The class is great. One improvement I can think of is having class content (outside the math) be more clearly defined to give students a better idea of what will be on exams. The TAs could also be a little better but I didn't really go to section (they were optional) so it didn't matter much to me.",
    "Class felt a bit disorganized. Notes could be made better, and better attempts could be made to explain some of the more tricky concepts. I found the book better at explaining concepts like options with dividends, black scholes, ect. and felt that material could be covered in the same manner in class.",
    "weakness: you don't really do any of the problems from the problem sets of the midterm in class and are expected to learn them on your own. Strength: Pascutti is willing to meet and make time to help you learn the material and also knows what he is talking about",
    "Strength: weekly quizzes terrifying but made sure you learned Weakness: expected to know concepts on exams but not really explained prior",
    "Pascutti is a very eccentric lecturer, he enjoys incorporating current events into his class at times when they're not really relevant. There's a little bit of reputation as well. Strength: you get to sit in a class with Pascutti who has years of experience in the field",
    "This is great course. Hard but great.",
    "The strength of the course is the weekly incorporation of current events and the structure of the psets. The weakness of the course is the lecture notes: some of the material glossed over and is overall very dense to read.",
    "More clear feedback would be better so we knew where we stood in terms of grades and the like.",
    "Strengths-interesting, engaging",
    "Pascutti is absolutely amazing and them material is great. All around great course",
    "A big weakness: the disorganization!!! It was frustrating to have to sift through his notes from Canvas that were oftentimes mismatched with what we were covering in class. He would jump around from topic to topic and there was no cohesion to the class other than the fact that we were doing finance-related stuff. Even lectures were half the time so incredibly hard to follow because he couldn't stay on topic. I guess a strength is that he's a funny guy but I much rather an adept professor than a funny guy.",
    "It is a well structured course. Quizzes every week and they give you a pset with solutions to study off of. TAs could be improved though. Tests seemed like they were graded randomly to be honest too.",
    "This course could be improved if the weekly quizzes were substituted for regular problem sets every other week and quizzes every other week.",
    "The psets are a lot of work.",
    "The main strength was the professor. He is really engaging during lecture, and he makes every class enjoyable. Often I get bored in 75 minute lectures, but I didn't really have that issue in this course. The material is interesting as well. In terms of improvements I would perhaps have the slides for what we did in class be a tad more accurate to reflect what was discussed.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is the professor. His teaching made all the lectures engaging, and I enjoyed hearing about his insights on real world topics. The problem sets were also very helpful. I think that the feedback and grading of the midterm exams could be improved. Another pretty large weakness of the class was that the online notes were not very well organized and were just a brick of text. The exams also had a small portion of questions that were very specific to things he mentions in class about current events but are hard to study for before the exam.",
    "The strengths are the professor's enthusiasm for his lectures, and his inclusion of his own experience and opinions. He's an engaging lecturer, and can be funny. Weaknesses are that the lectures often felt quite unfocussed and weren't always clear. The course itself wasn't very structured and I wasn't always sure what a given lecture was doing. Also, I felt the professor repeated himself quite often when he was speaking about contemporary events, in particular WeWork. However, that was also when he brought his own insights and commentary, which were also fun. Maybe going forward having more of a lecture structure, or using slides more, would be useful.",
    "I think that the course moved kind of fast as we covered a lot of material throughout the semester. I attended nearly every lecture and wrote down everything on the board in my notes but still didn't have a solid understanding of the material. A lot can be learned from paying attention to the professor's discussion and making sure you understand what he is saying, but this can be difficult to do sometimes. Also the lecture notes posted online contained a lot of information, but it wasn't always clear what would be tested on and what was really important to know. I thought sometimes the lecture notes lacked pictures and examples of some topics which is crucial to understanding what we are learning. I think that sections were poorly organized and not a beneficial use of time for students to go to. For a 50 minute scheduled section, I remember my TA went over one question for 20 minutes and got the wrong answer. This was a waste of my time and confused me prior to my quiz. I think that sections should be reorganized to discuss the weekly topics that our covered during lecture. Some notes should be presented to clarify some ideas and then a couple sample problems similar to our homeworks, quizzes or exams should be ran through during section time to clearly understand how to solve these problems.",
    "Weakness: - Most of your classmates will have way more experience in finance than you, and it can feel challenging at times because of that. - Professor Pascutti doesn't have that much structure to his lectures and can make the the class really confusing at times - The sections aren't very helpful Strengths: - Professor Pascutti is an engaging lecturer and will share stories\/cases from the market instead of just lecturing on theory",
    "A major strength is that Prof. Pascutti's lectures are entertaining with his distinct flavor of sarcasm. He also fits a lot of material into one semester, which can be both a strength and weakness. A weakness is that exam questions don't really mirror the lecture material.",
    "The problem set quizzes are helpful. However, I think it could be beneficial to have more conceptual questions on the quizzes.",
    "No weaknesses. I really liked how the psets were in class quizzes for a few reasons: 1) it stopped people mindlessly copying the material 2) I learned the material as I went along and got instant feedback from the answer key on where I was going wrong. The answer keys were very useful to see the proper way to do things 3) To be completely honest, it forced me to not miss class",
    "I think that this course is very applicable to the real world. However, I dont think lectures helped at all in regard to preparation for completing psets or exams.",
    "I think a big strength of the course is Professor Pascutti and his knowledge of\/experience in finance. I think one weakness is that lectures can sometimes be disorganized and hard to follow.",
    "The sections were pretty useless, and the slides were terrible. I thought some better slides would've helped a lot.",
    "Strengths are that Pascutti is an engaging professor and the class is useful for a background in the financial world. Weaknesses are that the class is a bit unstructured, so can be difficult to follow at times. Great as a Credit\/D",
    "The course is extremely disorganized. It was hard to me to follow lectures sometimes because topics were only covered briefly instead of going in depth. Also, the problem sets were very long and difficult to do on our own if the solutions wouldnt have been provided.",
    "The class covers a lot of good material, it is well explained, and the professor is very entertaining. We also discuss current events every day, which is a great way to apply what we learn to the real world. The class is a little fast paced, and we don't always get feedback on how we did. For instance, I never saw either midterm for the class after I took it, just my grade.",
    "Strengths The course covers a lot of the fundamental topics in corporate finance, which I really like - breadth over depth! Weaknesses I think lectures should be posted online - it is very hard to gather or take notes of all the disparate topics covered in each lecture. The course is not very well structured in general. I think there is very minimal coordination among the TAs and between them and the instructor. I often found that the TA did not really attend lectures so they wouldn't know what we know and wouldn't know what to help us with.",
    "Professor Pascutti is very funny and straightforward when it comes to explaining dry financial concepts. However, the class is very fast pace and requires a lot of self-taught knowledge. The class could be improved by being more structured in its agenda and delivery.",
    "Great lectures and instructive problem sets (we were given the solutions which was a great teaching tool) Beginning course content felt more applicable to day to day life than the end, but if you're really into finance then all of it should be interesting.",
    "I memorized formulas to pass this class; I really didn't understand concepts, though",
    "Could be organized a bit better. We tend to jump around a bit. The lectures he posts would have slides on topics we wouldn't cover until a couple of weeks later. Many of the TAs didn't really know what was going on. Went to section\/office hours and the TAs gave us wrong formulas\/didn't know how to answer a couple of the questions. Pascutti is very knowledgable, though. He does a great job explaining the topics.",
    "Strengths: Pascutti is clearly very knowledgeable about the finance industry and you'll enjoy going to class for his at times entertaining teaching style and dry sense of humor. Classes are for the most part interesting and we cover a lot of material. You'll come out of it with a broad overview of finance and the bond market. Weaknesses: lectures can get pretty dry when Pascutti is trying to teach more technical material. It's hard to follow and his lecture slides are more like bullet point notes for himself rather than something you can refer to. Make sure to take notes (as much as you can, given that sometimes he starts a thought and pivots to something else without finishing that thought)",
    "The course felt rather personal for its size -- Professor Pascutti's use of examples and reflection emails certainly helped this. Moreover, I really enjoyed the textbook. I'm not sure if anyone else read it, but it felt incredibly informative and taught me a good deal of information beyond the scope of the class. That said, the class could have been much more that it was. At times, we moved at a snail's pace, which was frustrating since there is so much material that we could have covered.",
    "Strength and weakness: weekly quizzes. On the one hand, it encouraged to actually learn the material every week, which was super helpful around time for exams. At the same time, having a quiz every week was definetely challenging, and it was hard to understand the problems even with the solutions at first. However, I would still keep the quizzes over having to turn in the psets just because I feel that this facilitates learning.",
    "Strengths: Pascutti is engaging and funny, and if you're taking this course you probably find the material interesting. Weaknesses: not as organized as it could be, and very heavy on theory, tending less toward more practical applications.",
    "More structure + more connection between classwork and the psets",
    "The overlap between lectures and psets\/tests was very low.",
    "Very engaging lecture, psets were well designed. Tying in somenof the math for psets in class wouldve been helpful",
    "strengths are the breadth of subjects we learn and the problem sets weaknesses are a bit of variability in test info covered and lack of study material",
    "Very technical, good to learn about the industry.",
    "Taught well A bit more problem solving in class",
    "Very loosely structured.",
    "The material was not super complicated, but not much class time was devoted to this material, instead looking at the news, which was interesting, but I wish there had been greater support for the actual calculations. The sections were not very helpful as they were often reviewing questions we already had seen and been tested over.",
    "Strengths are that is fairly engaging. Weaknesses are absolutely that expectations are unclear, particularly on testing",
    "The course covers a good amount of interesting material and real-life examples. However, it would be better if the course were a bit more organized.",
    "More structure",
    "The workload for this class is not too difficult during the week (one in-class quiz based directly on the weekly problem set), but the exams cover a lot of material and are somewhat difficult to prepare for. Despite attending lecture \/ taking notes, I still found the \"current events\" questions \/ theory questions very difficult to answer, especially since the problem sets were math-based and we did not practice any short-answer theory questions."

   "comments": [
    "YES. If you're even considering going into finance, you should definitely take this course. It's a straightforward (although sometimes fast paced) introduction that will prepare you for interviews. Honestly, financial literacy is important for everyone, so even if you're not hoping to work in finance, it's still valuable and one of the few pre-professional courses at Yale. There are definitely easier econ electives (and the SOM version of the course is supposed to be easier). BUT, it's not that bad (I had no finance experience going in) and it was fine. Pascutti is one of the best professors in the department, I think, so it's worth taking it with him. Definitely PAY ATTENTION TO THE CASES IN LECTURE!! There are exam questions about them (usually general, but you can't just zone out and say, oh, this is a current event, I dont have to write it down). Everything in lecture is fair game. Overall, a great course.",
    "I would recommend taking this course to another student as a non-letter grade or if they already have a strong background in accounting, economics or financial principles. It is not well suited for students with no prior experience in those subjects.",
    "Yes if you want to gain a understanding of finance, but be prepared to do some background research on your own for certain topics",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in corporate finance. It's an engaging and interesting class, and Professor Pascutti makes it fun. I came into this class having no financial knowledge, and now I feel confident with the fundamentals of finance. What you learn is very practical if you intend to go into finance. Be aware that a lot of the learning happens through the psets, which are not actually turned it (you're given the answers to them, with weekly quizzes testing your knowledge of the pset material). The pset format keeps you from falling behind on the material, but it's also time consuming to study for an assessment each week (I probably spent about 3 hours on this class per week.)",
    "No, this course is so poorly organized and if you don't have any previous knowledge of finance you are in big trouble.",
    "Yes, if you are really interested in finance. Pretty theoretical, but some good concepts for thinking about management\/firm decision making",
    "Coming into this course with almost NO knowledge of the stock market, bonds, and definitely not options was definitely intimidating to begin with. In the first few classes I had to look up a lot of terms I was unfamiliar with, so it would've been helpful to have some sort of glossary or introduction for people who truly are unfamiliar with the world of corporate finance. If you are comfortable teaching yourself a lot of the material through the textbook and looking at problem set answers, then you will learn a lot in this class and do very well. That being said, class time is not super helpful for learning the material, but will end up being somewhat necessary because he discusses current events that will be asked about on the exam. This class had a lot of real world relevant and helpful information, but the style definitely took some getting used to.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in learning the basics of corporate finance. What you're getting is a crude, somewhat but not always straightforward, survey of the topics in the financial world from a pretty funny practitioner. If you are so inclined, you will be able to learn more about these topics on your own time or in future classes. I would recommend this class though. Low workload, and helpful material.",
    "100% would recommend this class to anyone with any interest in finance. Especially if Pascutti is teaching it. He'll keep you entertained.",
    "only if you want a basic introduction to the finance world, but this class moves quickly and having a basic knowledge beforehand helps",
    "Depends on their interests, class can be quite disorganized but interesting material",
    "Yes! If you go to class and properly do the psets and don't just look at solutions you'll genuinely learn a lot and Pascutti is always available.",
    "Yes. This class is the real deal if you genuinely care about finance. It's not for you if you are looking for an easy econ credit that will boost your GPA. The concepts you learn in this class will help you learn how to make real money.",
    "I would mostly recommend to course to a student seriously interested in financial theory and real world events in the market. Else, probably not.",
    "Yes. I took it Cr\/D\/Fail and honestly it was worth it.",
    "YES! Best class Ive taken at Yale",
    "MEGA GUT. Hammer this class. I never studied for a single test, and the pset quizzes were a joke. If you didnt get a 100% on every one of them idk what you were doing with your life. I got blackout drunk and stayed up until 4 am the night before the final and still got comfortably above the mean. 10\/10 recommend this course.",
    "Yes, definitely. Loved the material and Pascutti did a great job of tying it all in with current events",
    "Take an accounting class over this one. If you are looking to gain real, practical skills in an organized manner, DO NOT take this class. This is coming from a student who has done well in the course (so I'm not being salty over poor grades in the class). Do yourself a favor and find other means to learn about finance but do not take this class.",
    "I would definitely take this course if youre going into finance. I CR\/D it after the first midterm because I didnt like the way they graded my test. I learned a good amount Id say! Like I know about options and shareholder activism now. And about bonds! The professor is also very cool and so funny. We talk about current events a lot which helps with finance interviews too. I would take this before your finance interviews though tbh like sophomore spring so that you can learn this stuff in class rather than on your own for your interviews.",
    "I would recommend this course, but it should be taken credit D.",
    "I would recommend this course but be prepared to invest a lot of time into it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Pascutti is amazing and super engaging in every lecture. He is also really approachable and easy to talk to about anything, whether it be current events in markets or about a topic with which you are struggling. If someone is at all interested in finance, they should strongly consider this class and definitely at least shop it. It will also be a big help for finance interviews, if that career path interests you. I definitely didn't expect it at the beginning of the year, but this has been one of my favorite classes I have taken here. 100% recommend. Take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students. You learn a lot of useful information for life, and Professor Pascutti is amazing. The tough part is that the curve of the course is quite hard, so keep that in mind when deciding to take the course or not.",
    "I'm not interested in working in finance but I did find the class pretty interesting. The professor isn't always very focussed, and sometimes relies too much on telling funny stories and irreverent humor, but it is generally an interesting class. There isn't a crazy amount of work, but the lectures aren't always clear so you may have to do research on your own. Overall a pretty good class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in finance and is possibly pursuing an internship or career in the financial services. There aren't many other finance courses at Yale so this is somewhat the first step one can take to learning these subjects after taking introductory econ courses. I think taking Accounting before may have been useful for this course, especially when learning about financial statements, but isn't required (I didn't take it before). By taking this course, you will gain a wide exposure to various topics in finance at a fundamental level. It is important to understand how certain processes work and how actions can affect an individual. You will have to master explaining these topics and why they work the way that they do and be able to do calculations using formulas.",
    "A relatively difficult course, but a great way to learn a lot about corporate finance and markets in general in just over 10 weeks.",
    "Yes. If you plan on going into banking or finance in general, this course will give you an ample base to build upon for interviews",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course to a student if they have no background in finance. I would recommend this to a student if they are interested in investment banking.",
    "If you are at all interested in finance, yes! This course provides a great introduction to finance concepts and is also extremely helpful in preparing for interviews in the industry.",
    "Yes if interested in finance",
    "Yeah if you're planning on going into finance or banking. Great Credit\/D.",
    "Absolutely, you will learn a lot.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course the way it is structured. I feel like I didnt learn as much as I could have.",
    "Not really, the way the course is taught right now, it is too unstructured to make the course both an enjoyable experience and an instructive one.",
    "Yes, great lectures, and provides a really solid background for people looking to go into finance or otherwise just understand the basics of the field.",
    "Yes, you learn important skills",
    "yes, overall I enjoyed this course, and learned a decent amount. I have a better sense of the finance industry and the type of personality that works well in such an environment. Take it with Pascutti for the mostly engaging lectures and go to class.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not going to teach you all you need to know about corporate finance (or all you need to know for interviews, if that's your goal), but it will make you much more aware of the main topics in finance and much more comfortable with the field. That is, it is a solid introduction to corporate finance. Professor Pascutti is generally a plus (he's incredibly knowledgable and passionate), but could stand to be a bit more structured and a bit less repetitive.",
    "If you want to learn more about finance but already have some basic knowledge, are comfortable with math and can think quickly - then yes. This is a useful, but not an easy course.",
    "If you're new to finance and interested in the material, go for it, but be ready to use a Credit D since the curve is rough. If you already have a good understanding of the material, it's still a solid class but also hard to get the A since a good chunk of the class will, like you, already have experience with the material.",
    "Yes",
    "For anyone interested in finance, this course is a must. Maybe the most useful class I have taken in the economics department at Yale yet.",
    "I would recommend it only if you are highly interested in pursuing a career in finance.",
    "Yes",
    "yes for anyone going into finance some very important skills that can help with interviews are taught",
    "Yes",
    "Yes great intro to corp finance",
    "If learning the topics is worth a frustrating academic experience. The course is taught in an extraordinarily disorganized way. The syllabus topics will randomly not be covered, the class notes posted after a class will have no relation to what was actually discussed, and the problem set and test answer keys are always riddled with mistakes and typos that make it hard for you to know if you actually understand a concept. Pascutti is also not great at answering questions in an intuitive way that connects with the misunderstandings students have.",
    "I definitely would. This class taught me so much. If you are interested in finance, take this course. Pascutti is great.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, as I believe it is useful for even those who are not Economics majors.",
    "Would be a good class to Cr\/D.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to students, as it is a great introduction to the topics concerning corporate finance.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in developing a baseline knowledge of corporate finance. The exams are very difficult, and the material is often confusing, so many people opt to take the class Cr\/D."
