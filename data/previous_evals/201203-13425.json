   "comments": [
    "You'll learn to argue effectively, clearly and concisely. But also, you'd be able to analyze arguments effectively into logos pathos and ethos",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students! It will help you develop writing skills, learn how to peer edit, and read and analyze some interesting works on power. Mostly though, the small seminar setting allowed for engaging, in-class discussions which led to great ideas. Favorite class I took this semester.",
    "I would definitely recommend English 114 to another student. It cleans up your writing skills and teaches you what you have to do to get that sought-after A. For me, I need to write about two drafts and get another person to take a look at my paper to get that A. But beyond getting that A, you get a feeling of what a finished paper should look and feel like.",
    "It is absolutely necessary as a freshman to learn how to write. This course will help develop your skills in Academic Writing, and will also indirectly improve your understanding of how authors write. I highly recommend this, specially for ESL students.",
    "I recommend that you take the course! I loved it!It was my favorite course of the semester. The papers are interesting to write, and the class discussions really encourage you to interact with the amazing Yalies in the course.",
    "Writing Power is a fantastic class for anyone who wants to learn to write with a purpose. You learn to tailor an argument to a specific audience and write clear, concise prose. Professor Silverman is one of the most dedicated and nurturing professors and will really help you become a better writer if you put in the effort. I urge students to take advantage of his office hours and also start writing early. You will learn that drafting is very important, and that writing a paper last minute is really not a good idea. Every freshman should take 114 because you probably will not get as much guidance in higher level classes.",
    "This class will improve your writing without hurting your GPA. I'd recommend it if you aren't that confident in your writing skills for college.",
    "A good introduction to writing course which should be very helpful to learning the standards of college writing. Yes I would recommend this course because there are different types of essays that you learn to write.",
    "I would not recommend it. I feel like the main thing I learned from the class was that you should peer edit, which is a valuabe lesson, but not worth taking the class for. Peer edit. Great, now you can go and take a different english class. I felt that on the whole it was rather weak and did not teach me all that much.",
    "English 114 really enhances your writing. Professor Silverman allows you to have your own perspective in the class and really cultivate it in your final two papers. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "English 114 is a great way to get your feet wet in college level writing. Professor Silverman is great. Though his class organization is not the strongest, you learn a lot and he helps you develop really good habits that will allow ou to be a successful college writer in the future. Also he's just hilarious and helpful.",
    "It was a very interesting class. I would recommend it.",
    "4 main papers, each in increasing length and complexity. Each paper has a specific prompt regarding the readings and coursework. You are given a lot of lee way in regards to how you write your papers and the topics you wish to address."
