   "comments": [
    "More knowledge on wetlands and the science behind them, a little more knowledge on the connection between wetlands and the rest of the world.",
    "This course was primarily motivated by two questions- 1. How and why do we delineate wetlands? and 2. How are wetlands influenced by human activities and what do these impacts mean for people? For the first question, the field trips were particularly useful for understanding how soil quality, vegetation, and water movement change at wetland boundaries. This course was also based in a lot of the primary literature, so it was great practice at reading scientific articles with a critical and analytical eye.",
    "I learned a lot about wetlands",
    "Learned a fair bit about wetlands. Got a chance to study one in detail.",
    "Wetlands are amazing! Like the course name suggests, you get to learn about the multifaceted aspects of wetland ecology, conservation, and management. We got to go on a few field trips in the semester (eg. to a salt marsh) and had some cool guest lectures from wetland scientists (eg. a soil scientist, representative from the Everglades). I learned about the social and environmental importance of wetlands and how we can incorporate these perspectives into management practices. The readings were all fascinating and also focused on the importance of local & traditional knowledge when looking at environmental issues. This was one of my first environmental classes where we got to read such a diverse range of readings! You learn about wetlands at a global scale and also at an everyday scale with each class starting off with a \"Wetlands in the News\" from one of your classmates. Wetlands are critical ecosystems no matter where you live and it is important for everyone to learn about them!"

    "Aligned pretty well. Hoped for more field trips as part of the course, especially to Connecticut's RAMSAR site.",
    "They were met quite well. Learned the basics of wetlands. I think more field trips could have been useful.",
    "It aligned very well. I appreciated the mix of fieldwork and discussion that we were able to experience in this class. The readings allowed me to understand a lot of different perspectives."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the guest lectures, the wetlands in the news, and the final presentation. All of those things helped me to see some of ways that wetlands, beyond the science, interact with other fields or disciplines or other things in the world. I think there could have been more organization to the course and other feedback and guidance. For example, it was a little unclear how the lectures were organized or why we were covering some of the material that we were. In addition, we never received any feedback on the reading comments that we were submitting and rarely used them in class, so that did not seem like a very helpful exercise to be doing each week, as we often had a lot of readings that were not discussed in class. Finally, while I liked the final presentation, I thought the topic was too broad and would be been helpful to have more guidance from Kealoha in the beginning about that, and have a more narrowed-down criteria list from the start. I also think that learning the scientific names of the plants was not well done and very unhelpful.",
    "I wish that the course had been a bit more technical and specific, because I feel like I have a lot of general wetland knowledge but did not gain an ability to speak about wetlands more specifically. I also wished that Kealoha and Andis spoke more about their research throughout the course.",
    "This class was very good. I liked the le-minar style (part lecture, part seminar). The guest speakers were interesting and the field trips were informative. Professor Friedenburg taught well and the week-to-week structure was great. I also really liked the 1 page reading response assignment, it was a good tool for processing what I had read and reading through my responses also proved to be very good preparation for the exams. However, I did not find the Wetlands in the News all that informative, and I wish that we had had a case study project of some sort.",
    "Strengths -- good knowledge base. Both Kealoha and Andis are knowledgeable. Weaknesses -- I think the class needed a bit more structure. The lectures didn't seem to all cohere super well and the study guides were pretty sparse.",
    "Strengths: Well organized lectures and clear connection with readings, good balance of learning materials, clear instruction, good community of both undergrad and grad students, cool guest speakers, Weaknesses: Class is a little long, reading load was a little heavy on some weeks"

    "Can be good if you want to get in-depth about the science and study behind wetlands, but not the most applicable class for other subjects.",
    "Take this class, but have a little initiative of your own.",
    "Take the class! Start your readings early, maybe keep a study guide throughout the semester to prepare for the midterm and final, and make sure to go on all the field trips. Whatever you are interested in doing in the future, you will find a connection to wetlands!"
