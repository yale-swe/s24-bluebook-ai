    "This is a presentation of a couple of topics of physical chemistry: thermodynamics, electrochemistry, kinetics and a couple of physical chemistry-related instruments. The focus is on thermodynamics. The workload is pretty light (3-4 problems\/week), but you do need to study and remotely understand the material to do well on the exams, which are very fair by the way. While the material is fairly interesting, Prof. Cross' teaching is often lacking and confusing. Fortunately, he's a very nice guy and posts all his lecture notes online for everyone to have. If you are a chemistry major, then you have to take this class for the degree; it won't be that great (especially after taking Freshman Orgo with Prof. Ellman and Prof. Miller), but it will be good enough for you not to hate it. I guess people interested in physics can also take this class - it would not surprise if me people with stronger backgrounds in physics than in chemistry would fare better here than the others. Otherwise, I would look for more engaging and more well-taught chemistry classes.",
    "Take this over CHEM 328. It was pretty painless and sometimes even interesting, whereas I heard CHEM 328 was scattered and generally just awful this semester. If you're actually interested in chemistry + somewhat mathematically-minded, you may even enjoy this course.",
    "P-chem is your typical science course at Yale, and not as difficult\/scary as you might have heard. In fact, it's probably the least stressful class I have this semester. Homework and exams are straightforward, and Professor Cross posts beautiful lecture notes.",
    "A decent class; the psets were somewhat hard but some of the questions had answers in the back of the book, and if you worked with other people you could eventually figure it out. The tests were a lot easier than the homework; the midterms each consisted of 3 questions that were relatively straight forward. Make sure to study a little bit of everything in the textbook though, because if you skip a concept and it's one of those 3 questions, you're pretty much screwed. The professor's not a particularly great teacher, but the textbook is really great (for the most part he just regurgitates the textbook) and he also posts his own powerpoints and lecture notes so overall not a bad class to take.",
    "First semester pchem is a great course; I would highly recommend it, even if you are not a Chem\/Chem E major (ie MB&B), as it's a very good introduction to many of the processes that govern chemical reactivity. Workload is quite manageable, and exams are very straightforward.",
    "I would not recommend this class, tests are based on memorizing equations that you forget the next day, class material is interesting but you learn it on your own anyways",
    "Very fair class.",
    "You probably have to take it for your major, but definitely don't be afraid of it. Be sure you brush up on your partial derivatives and get ready to memorize loads of equations! But there are only 8 psets and tests were straightforward. Enjoy Prof. Cross's stories! And hope you're in a room with a microphone or you'll have to sit in the front row to hear.",
    "Well if you're in it, chances are it's because you have to be -- actually a pretty good course, though. Exams are reasonably straightforward, and Prof. Cross is pretty good at explaining concepts and derivations. You have to put in the work, but it's doable. I definitely feel I got something out of it (as an MB&B major who opted for this course instead of CHEM328).",
    "Although this class was not required for me (I am physics major, not a chemistry major), I took p-chem thinking that it would be an interesting elective. My interest in physical approaches to chemistry quickly faded after taking the course. I ABSOLUTELY regret wasting my time trying to learn things in lecture from Professor Cross, who is an awful professor and is too old to even remember what it was like being a student (or at least that students now are different than they were in the old days at Yale). The exams were too short to evaluate anything, and your grade on them is entirely based on luck, not how much you study or how well you learned the material. I would consider taking the class if you didn't have Professor Cross, but if you do, avoid his teaching at all costs. Easily one of the worst courses I've had at Yale.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless they have to take it. It is not an overwhelming amount of work but it is not taught particularly well.",
    "Good class, but the exams are built in such a way that if you screw up on one part, it's really hard to recover. They are 3 question exams. Be careful of the curve here. Much of the class knows what it is doing.",
    "Good class. Reading the textbook helps you understand the topics better, especially for thermodynamics.",
    "Interesting class, very difficult. You'll learn about physical chemistry in a very quantitative way. I hear the curve is good, and I really hope that's true.",
    "Professor Cross was an awful teacher. So boring, so mumbly, and just generally very disappointing. Gosh, it was just taught so terribly, and it made me beyond frustrated. The tests weren't terribly difficult, but I was so uninspired it was killer. Don't take this class unless you have to, and hopefully Cross won't be teaching it.",
    "I took this as an MB&B major even though 328 was offered. My friends in the class were mostly chem majors and a lot of my friends in MB&B were in 328 so here's my comparison: TAKE THIS ONE. Elsa Yan is terribly difficult to understand. This class is actually very good. Cross is SUPER old school but in a pretty cool way. I feel like I had a more enjoyable, rigorous (but not much harder), and definitely better experience with physical chemistry because I took this course rather than taking CHEM328. The course is *possible* for freshmen and though a lot of the class will still be really really smart (you might think taking premeds out would be good for lowering the curve but it only leaves chem and chemE majors behind so it doesn't actually help). The class does quite a bit with partial derivatives at the beginning and then the level of math needed drops off down to pretty much just algebra. If you're a freshman thinking about this I definitely recommend it over general chem or 118: just don't do the lab at the same time. you can do it later no problem.",
    "80% of the course covers concepts taught in Gen. Chem (thermo, kinetics, etc.) with a little more mathematical rigor, though not too much multivariable calculus knowledge is required; background helps though! Last 20% of the course covers experimental techniques that can get a bit complicated. Course notes are very helpful and make it easy to catch up on missed lectures, and Cross is a very interested person to get to know. If you're MB&B like me, I'd recommend this course.",
    "I'd recommend this class. It's got a pretty scary reputation but it's really not too bad. Definitely a manageable class, and you'll learn a lot.",
    "Overall, it's not too bad. The chemical engineering majors seem to have the easiest time with this because they're generally around this sort of math and chemistry together. The chem and MB&B majors had a harder time, but we got through. It's doable, don't give up after the first exam if you're feeling defeated! But ultimately, if you're not a chemical engineering major, you'll probably find yourself wondering where any of the chemistry in this class is. Because it's like 75% math and physics, but that makes sense if you think about physical chemistry from a theoretical standpoint. It just gets frustrating at times if you're in biology\/chemistry sphere and not the physics\/engineering sphere.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 332 for fulfilling the pchem requirement for CHEM\/MB&B majors. Prof. Cross is not the most engaging lecturer, but he is a fair and understanding teacher, and I appreciated that he made himself very available in person and via email.",
    "I mean, this class is what it is. Cross was a good professor, although lectures were very dry. You can get by for the most part by just reading lecture notes and the book without attending class.",
    "It is an excellent introduction to physical chemistry.",
    "Good class overall. The first portion of the class on thermodynamics was more mathematically rigorous than the second portion on kinetics, which covered many experimental techniques in chemical kinetics. The problems sets were of very manageable length, but some of the problems on them were difficult. It helps a lot to find someone to work on problem sets together with. Professor Cross is an awesome professor. He was very approachable for questions and is very kind. His lectures were quirky and he incorporated facts from his own experience, which was interesting. Some of the topics in the course will probably require some reading and going over in order to get a thorough understanding of though. That being said, tests are quite fair because they are similar to homework material and the structure of the tests are similar to previous years, so looking over the topics that were covered on the practice exam from previous years will be helpful.",
    "Probably the reason that you are taking this course is because you have to. Although I actually think the topic matter is interesting, if you don't have to take the course then you probably shouldn't. The problem sets, though not difficult, were extremely obtuse in that it was always unclear what they were asking. The lectures, though the professor meant well, were difficult to understand and often pure derivations that had little to do with the conceptual things that would have been useful to learn. The tests themselves, though not difficult, were focused much more on blindly memorizing equations than on actual understanding.",
    "Physical Chemistry is very challenging course and will often times force you to reread and look closely at detail. That being said, I believe most students can achieve their best in this course by asking questions to their TA's and being active throughout the semester. I would recommend the course to anyone who wants to understand the underpinnings of chemical thermodynamics and the processes involved in kinetic reactions.",
    "Take it if you are mathematically or scientifically inclined. it's certainly interesting.",
    "It's a very good class if you want to learn more about not just physical chemistry, but also lab techniques.",
    "If you are an MBB major, I would recommend this class over Chem 328. The problem sets are straightforward, attending class is essentially useless, and the curve is not terrible. If you are prepared to learn from a textbook, are cool with skipping class sometimes, and don't mind 925 am exams, go for it. Know that the material is quite dry--it's all kinetics and thermo, and it's not at all applied. i don't even think it's applied to the physical sciences, as the name would suggest. it's just equations. every so often you talk about lasers. that's it.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to or have a weirdly unfound interest in physical chemistry.",
    "A very interesting course that Chem majors will enjoy. The focus on deeper explanations and the physics behind chemistry makes the course very enjoyable. The class requires you to have a mild understanding of calculus."
