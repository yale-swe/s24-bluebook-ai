   "comments": [
    "Turk-Browne is a fabulous professor and the quality of the lectures is a strength. There have been some great guest lecturers too that were very entertaining and interesting. It is not a particularly challenging course. The lectures are sometimes boring if you have any prior knowledge of psychology as it sticks with fairly basic intro level material.",
    "The class is perhaps the most well-organized lecture I have ever taken. All materials are perfectly presented, engaging and memorable. The only weakness is the uneven grading of tests. Some questions are graded fairly, and some deduct points for purely semantic reasons.",
    "As a survey of fun psychological ideas this is a great course. It could have been improved by going more in depth into how psychological experiments are conducted and the work of both clinical and research psychologists. That would have given me more of an understanding as to whether or not I would like to continue studying the subject.",
    "The way of testing was horrible. They told us that the tests would not be memory based and that it would be more application of psychological methods, but then took off points for missing specific details.",
    "Homework is easy, relaxed, and normally very interesting. Tests are open-ended and leave lots of room for answers based on an understanding of course material, rather than memorization. Lectures are quite interesting. Overall, the course is filled with interesting learning and easy work. A great class.",
    "Strengths: interesting topic, engaging professor, fun activities that went along with the slides (the professor didn't just lecture the entire time; he had student participation and brought in interesting speakers). I really liked that the lecture before each test was a fun topic. I like the way we were tested. Weaknesses: the lab experiences were not very fun or engaging, and they seemed kind of pointless to me. also, the review sessions before tests were really not helpful at all.",
    "Strengths: lectures are amazing (definitely should not skip class), and assigned readings after every lecture don't take much time and are very insightful. Honestly cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "Strengths of the course are the professor, teaching fellow, and the way the lectures are taught, with many examples and demonstrations. The assigned readings and activities usually relate to the lectures and helped with my understanding of the material.",
    "strengths: always use interesting examples to help you learn about the thesis and invite several interesting guest speaker to the class (eg. magic). weaknesses: really a lot of work, especially for the addtional work for graduates. I did not know how to write a literature review and spend almost 5 whole days to do the reserach. If professor can change the additional work into read a Psychology book, I think I can learn more. And the TA don't have office hour, sometimes I have a lot of confusion about the content but do not know where can I find the answer.",
    "great class great prof. more notes on lecture slides would have been nice.",
    "For an intro course, it does a good job of going over the important material and providing a good background",
    "",
    "The lectures themselves were very slow paced, which made it really hard to pay attention and stay focused.",
    "Strengths: From social psychology to neuropsychology to applied psychology, the course did a really effective job of introducing (and diving into) many topics of the human mind.",
    "The only strength of this class is that it opens up other more advanced and more interesting psychology classes. Its weaknesses include no serious or deep engagement with a given topic, no sense of how the first exam would be testing the material, very little motivation to attend lectures.",
    "Not too bad workload, just go to lecture and review at home after each lecture. Make sure you understand the main concepts. The research requirement is kind of annoying. Professor Turks Browne is a really, really good teacher who's passionate about his field.",
    "Strengths - organization, interesting lectures, passionate professor",
    "Strengths are the teaching structure, lectures, relevant and interesting articles for readings, and overall design of the class and grading. No weaknesses.",
    "Strength: Prof. Turk-Browne made the course engaging. Sometimes the material could be a bit dry, but for the most part the way he explained studies made them not see boring. Also the readings for this class were probably the only readings I've ever enjoyed from any classes I've taken, which is probably because Prof. Turk-Browne took the time to find articles from places like the NYT or the New Yorker that were relevant and interesting instead of simply choosing a chapter from a textbook. Weaknesses: N\/A\/",
    "I felt that all the lectures seemed kinda disjointed and very much followed to pattern of statement then experiment, but maybe that's just psychology?",
    "Strengths: Lectures were always personally interesting, you take all exams during class, including the final exam (which isn't really cumulative). Also, there really wasn't a lot of work; readings were short and there was minimal requirements outside of class. Professor Turk-Browne is awesome: super nice guy that makes everything interesting. Weaknesses: Nothing I can really think of. You're required to do 5 hours of experiments of which you're the subject, which took up some time but was kind of interesting, and over the course of the entire semester it's not much at all.",
    "A strength of this course was its structure and how engaging it was. I appreciated not having a textbook because we were able to learn about concepts from a modern perspective. Furthermore, we were able to focus on understanding instead of memorizing obscure theories that are no longer relevant. For this reason, I found myself constantly able to apply what I learned to my own life and change how I act for the better. The environment was very collaborative and encouraging. My only request for improvement is to post the lecture slides earlier.",
    "I wish that there were opportunities to practice the kind of questions on the exam. Even if they werent graded having optional post lecture questions would be nice.",
    "The best part of this class is that unlike other psychology classes, you're not asked to memorize names\/terms and regurgitate the. Rather, the emphasis is all on the concepts.",
    "There was not enough explanation of the expectations for the first exam, and it was daunting to feel so unfamiliar with content worth 33% of the grade.",
    "Super interesting class! However, it would be great if the expectations for the exams were clearer before the initial test. Also, it would have been nice if it was easier to meet with professors and TAs.",
    "I really really enjoyed this course. I thought it was well taught and well facilitated for student learning. I also really enjoyed the material.",
    "This course was great! The lectures were super engaging and definitely impacted me and made me think differently about daily decisions and opinions I have. The research participation and TA activities were also fantastic and a great addition to a big lecture course. If anything, I'd swap out 1 or 2 hours of research participation for an additional TA activity. Also, the in class demos were highlights and more of those would be super cool.",
    "strengths: interesting lectures weaknesses: useless readigns",
    "The professor's lectures are very informative and the content is enough to keep you engaged. The only downside is that the class notes posted by the professor are not detailed enough so if for some reason you missed lecture or forgot some things, the notes are not much help.",
    "I think the class was well organized and the research participation and lab experiences really added another layer of understanding to what we learned in class. The exams were fair and well designed to facilitate student learning.",
    "It's a big lecture and Professor Turk-Browne was a great lecturer. I liked the research hours but make sure you don't leave them for the last minute. I really liked his slides and how organized they were.",
    "This course did a great job of incorporating relevant current events and psychological studies into our curriculum. The lab experiences were an interesting way to learn more about psychology and were not too stressful. However, lectures could sometimes be a bit boring and I wish there was more discussion of the readings.",
    "A strength of the course was the labs because they acted like a section and allowed for more discussion.",
    "It is well organized and engaging.",
    "Easy material to learn, almost too easy",
    "It could be more engaging.",
    "Strengths: really interesting subject matter, readings were interesting and not very long, Prof. Turk-Browne is a great lecturer. Weaknesses: it's a survey course so you will not go into depth on any subjects, but this is just the nature of an intro course in a field as diverse as psychology.",
    "Strengths: No unnecessarily hard textbook readings. Our readings were poplar press articles\/ accessible scientific articles that related directly to what we learned in class. This kept students engaged because we learned all the technical terms and vocabulary in class and then got to do interesting engaging readings at home. I thought the exams were very fair (answer 7 out of 8 short answer questions) and the exams tested application of things we learned in real life situations. The tests are graded very fairly; each TF grades the same question on every test and they give detailed feedback.The lab experiences we did with the TF's were also interesting.",
    "Lectures were engaging with clips or small cool things at the end that made it more interesting\/real. I appreciated that there wasn't a textbook, even if studying for the first exam felt weird and kind of confusing not having the structure of a textbook. In the end, not having it and realizing you don't need one was pretty cool",
    "Really helpful",
    "I think the weaknesses of the courses were the mandatory lab hours--the labs weren't exactly interesting and many of them just had us clicking different shapes. The strengths of the course were the lectures; they were extremely interesting and Professor Turk-Browne is a very engaging teacher.",
    "Professor Turk-Browne was good.",
    "Very broad. Interesting topics.",
    "Thought this was a very well taught course. I wish there were discussion sections to review information.",
    "The professor could perhaps be more engaging- I got distracted very easily",
    "The strength was how great Professor Turk Browne was.",
    "great, clear, concise lectures!",
    "The course was very informative and the lectures were always engaging. It could maybe be improved by having more time for student questions or having discussion sections.",
    "I really liked the way that the course was laid out with the lectures and corresponding readings that were very interesting. However, I found that the lectures could get a bit monotonous and think it would be nice if it would be possible to break them up in some way.",
    "I loved the style of the examseight open response questions (you pick seven to answer) that force you to apply the concepts covered in lecture to real-world situations. We never had to worry about memorizing specific terms, names, or dates. The focus of the course was understanding and applying concepts in psych.",
    "The lectures were engaging for the most part, but I think some lectures were definitely more exciting than others. I think the course could benefit from more interactivity within the lectures, ie: different demonstrations\/activities during lecture to keep people engaged.",
    "Strengths: Insightful lab experiences Weaknesses: Each lecture was not very interactive.",
    "This course assigns many readings that do not appear on exams. There is a lot of content covered in lectures and not much support in reviewing the content.",
    "This course was all around great, and I have no improvements.",
    "Well organized slides and presentation, but practice questions would be helpful before tests.",
    "I have no complaints about this course.",
    "I am better able to analyze large amounts of information and apply them to practical situations because of the class. I also have improved my study skills in order to meet the demands of the tests given to us.",
    "One of the most enriching experiences was the laboratory experience portion of this class because it exposed students to upper level clinical and social psychology research currently going on at Yale. I also really enjoyed the enrichment activities from this class as they often provided a unique or unconventional outlook on topics that were covered in a more traditional way during the lecture portion of the class.",
    "Maybe a discussion session in place of laboratory experiences.",
    "Good teacher and good content.",
    "Strengths of this course include the method of testing as well as the materials covered. Weaknesses include explaining the first exam in depth so that students may know what to expect.",
    "Strengths: No textbook; rather readings and online activities. The two required lab experiences were both a lot of fun as well as really informative. Weaknesses: None",
    "The strength of this course was the professor. He made the class very interesting and it was fun listening to him. The weaknesses were the tests. They were extremely open ended.",
    "This course was pretty strong on the whole. The testing system was pretty weird and not necessarily constructive but it wasn't too brutal.",
    "Great real-world examples!",
    "Amazing lectures and interesting readings. No negatives.",
    "Very informative class. Wish it was a seminar",
    "The course has interesting content but was not challenging. Me and many of my peers had difficulty finding motivation to apply ourselves in the course because it was too easy to do well with minimal effort.",
    "Lectures were very good, engaging and clear. The testing format was also very fair and innovative.",
    "The class was well organized and easy to understand. Slides and lectures were good. Content could be more interesting, some of the information seemed obvious. Also maybe a section on the flaws in some of the psych research out there and more understanding of the ways psych research has been used to perpetuate harmful narratives.",
    "Strengths: good exposure to all psych aspects Weaknesses: not enough connection with professor and TFs",
    "Professor Turk-Browne made the material very accessible to students. However, there were some difficult concepts here and there that were watered down, and at times he did not make it clear as to what he wanted us to understand. I also think that some of the questions on the exams were too broad, which made it hard to know what he was looking for from us in terms of the correct answers. Overall the class is one of the better survey classes Ive taken and it is a good pathway into the psychology major.",
    "I liked that we learned about so many areas, but wish we had breakout sessions to learn more about certain areas of interest!",
    "good course but tests are very hard",
    "The workload is fair and the tests cover the material we cover in class, but sometimes the lectures are too long and run over class time.",
    "Strength: like the visuals, and even though a hassle, the Surveys were interesting. Exams were also a good format! Weak: I would have preferred some more depth, I cant talk about any of the topics with any founded knowledge.. the graduate assignment was handed out way too late to do a good job, i didnt understand why that was not possible to communicate in the beginning of the semester Why not do in class quizzing through clickers or an app?",
    "The teacher is extremely organized and very engaging which makes coming to class easy. The homework is a pop-psych article to read each week."

He makes lectures as fun and engaging as possible, and brings in great guest speakers. His whole course philosophy is based off his own lectures about how to best test memory and learning, which is through retesting. His exams are online, easy, and pretty stress-free. He tries his best to get to know and interact with all of his students, even in a 100+ person lecture.",

Whether it was Professor Turk-Browne teaching or one of the guest speakers, I always learned something. What I learned was always relevant in my life and allowed me to explain so many things.
