   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this class if you're able to find an easygoing, understanding, and flexible TA. However, the department does its best to make learning French as difficult and time consuming as possible with the course packet. If you aren't ableto find a good TA then a summer program might be the best way to eliminate the language requirement.",
    "L4 is significantly worse than L3. The books are worse and longer. The vocab is less useful, the grammar is more tedious, and unless you get in an awesome section with a great teacher, I'm not sure how much your french will improve over the semester.",
    "Only if you need to take French for a really good reason--like I need it for my major\/ grad school. If you have a reason for wanting to get good at French, you'll be self-motivated enough to endure this course.",
    "The structure is very similar to 130, though 140 focuses more on grammar exercises and reading comprehension. It is less focused on listening to and speaking of the language.",
    "I would recommend this class (probably with another instructor) because the reading is interesting and some of the grammar is very useful. It's not an easy class, but very rewarding to read a 400 page novel (if you actually do it) and I think that my reading skills improved a lot.",
    "i would recommend aaron schlosser to anyone, yet i would not recommend fren140. their is no independence in the curricula, therefore the teachers aren't teaching what they want to be teaching. the class would have been much better is aaron had been able to come up with his own lesson plans.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're serious about French or are trying to fulfill a language requirement. However, if you are just on the French track for the sake of learning a fun new language, I would wait to try to learn the language elsewhere. Here at Yale, the department is extremely structured such that every single section follows the exact same curriculum. There is no room to respond to an individual class's needs or desires. Most of the texts we read are really boring, which doesn't need to be the case, and some of the units are pointless for the type of French that most of us want to be learning: conversational French that will get us through a French-speaking region\/country comfortably. That said, Aaron is a great instructor and a lot of fun, although he won't beteaching again.",
    "Sure, it's on your way to proficiency with the French language! I still think the French department has wonderfully structured intermediate-level courses, and this is no different. It's probably less work than French 130, and the grammar is very straightforward. Stay up to speed with the reading though, or you could easily find yourself 200 pages behind in the last unit!",
    "It's a class heavy on listening and reading comprehension. It's not too time consuming but you need to exert some effort to do well in the class. Sure I'd recommend it since it does help your french improve.",
    "No because I feel like you don't learn very much French and do a lot of busy work."
