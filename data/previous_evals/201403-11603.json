   "comments": [
    "hard to get a sense of the whole course without any cumulative assignments",
    "The subject matter is important, but it did not seem well organized overall. I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to be learning each week. The book is not very helpful. And it was pretty difficult to understand the professor and the TAs; English is not their first language.",
    "This course is suitable for me and the workload is just appropriate and allow me to have enough time to review the text.",
    "I really did not enjoy BIS 625. The lectures were quite boring and all of the material and examples were taken directly from the textbook. Each lecture consisted of the professor reading off of a series of PowerPoint slides. Often times no new information was provided along with the slides. Without any candid commentary or additional information, it felt that class was not particularly valuable. All of the material could have been learned from reading the textbook. The class could be improved from having the lectures add to, rather than repeat, the information in the textbook. It would also be much more useful to have real life examples and datasets. The careful constructed datasets in the textbook are not helpful when considering real world problems.",
    "Good for students who have limited prerequites Easy homework and real-life project: benefitial for students in theoritical and practical training",
    "This is a terrible class and one of the worst ones I've ever taken in my life. I took the class because categorical data analysis will be a big component of my future work, but I can't say I'm much better off now than I was back in August. The most helpful part of the class is the labs led by TAs on Friday afternoons. The lecture component is very theoretical and not very useful. One improvement would be including more examples that start with a problem, detail the SAS code used (and why), output, and interpretation. Then we could translate theoretical material into practical application. The textbook is also a bit opaque, and the lectures seem pretty derived from the textbook chapters. The class is designed well, however. The weekly assignments and emphasis on a final project with real data is great and makes more sense than large exams. The problem sets were also a manageable size for the most part. This class could be great if the way the material was taught was improved.",
    "This is a good course if you are interested in learning about categorical data analysis methods beyond biostats I and II. The lectures are good, but do not thoroughly go over topics like diagnostics and remedial measures.",
    "The course is very helpful.",
    "one of the most helpful courses I have taken at Yale. However, the instructor , though knowledgeable, can't really teach. The slides were helpful though. I really really really really don't like non-biostatistics students taking this course. The material is dummed down and no theory can be taught without scrutiny. This puts biostatistics students, who will be pursuing actual biostatistics careers, at a disadvantage later in life.",
    "Good, imformative",
    "Strengths: Homework assignments keep you updated Weaknesses: Long project at the end",
    "I had a difficult time understanding the lectures. The professor was very quiet and hard to understand. I essentially taught myself from the powerpoints.",
    "This course did what it set out to do, but it took a lot of work! The final project might be a fair reflection of real world data, but it required a lot of self-directed learning to complete. I don't feel that it was a good reflection of the learning in class; having a few recommended references on problem solving in data analysis\/SAS could have been helpful.",
    "There should be more clarifications on the final project",
    "Strengths: the book was good and very helpful; some of the topics were really interesting and useful, especially if you expect to analyze categorical data for your thesis or future research Weaknesses: it was often REALLY hard to follow the instructor and so a lot of the time I had to rely on the book to understand concepts. The homework assignments were NOT consistent from week to week; as mentioned, some weeks were fairly straightforward, but other weeks were really confusing and difficult. Also, the class lectures spent way too much time on understanding concepts, whereas the homework assignments were testing our practical skills of the concepts (didn't always connect)",
    "strengths: - a very useful course for anyone in public health who will be working with categorical response variables - the book used for this course (Agresti) is excellent weaknesses: - there are no midterms or final which meant less workload but as a result I felt that my concepts were not as clear as I would have liked; it would be helpful to have at least one midterm",
    "Instruction is sometime confusing ; TA session is more clear structured; This class provides me a pretty good tool for practical research.",
    "Strengths of the course include useful material that is transferable to the workplace setting. Weaknesses are such that the book (Agresti) used is not always entirely clear, and that problems that we get are rather rudimentary and may not test knowledge beyond the scope of the chapter. I would suggest employing a different book, or using a different book in conjunction with this text.",
    "weaknesses: sometimes hard to understand professor\/TAs, too much homework!!!! strengths: very good slides"

    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0good explanations and helpful in person",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Language barrier exists. Bad at explaining material. Never provide homework solution.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The subject matter is important and the instructor is nice, but the class did not seem well organized overall. I had trouble figuring out what I was supposed to be learning each week. The book is not very helpful. And it was pretty difficult to understand and follow the professor's train of thought when she speaks during lecture. On the bright side, it was helpful not to have exams because it allowed me to focus weekly on the homeworks and on developing practical skills instead of preparing to take exams.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor is very good and teaches very specificly about categorical data analysis, she is willing to share experience with us.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0She is nice and patient.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Her strength was her availability and willingness to answer questions. However, her lecturing style was quite dry. I think her teaching could be improved if her lectures weren't quite so scripted. Reading off PowerPoint slides each class is not particularly stimulating for students. Additionally, simply restating what is in the textbook seems like a slight waste of time.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I wish Prof Wang could explain key concepts more clear",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Lecture notes are well-organized; detailed explanation is provided during lectures",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor is so nice and understanding! However, she is difficult to understand (and not because of the language barrier). I tried to faithfully attend lectures to get used to her teaching style, but did not get much out of them. Walking through examples and emphasizing practical application (in addition to some theoretical material) would help make lectures more accessible to students.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor does a good job of thoroughly going through lecture slides, but can be a bit repetitive.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Prof Wang is great at teaching. She can explain materials clearly and unequivocally. The lecture is very useful for us to understand the categorical data and logistic regression.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The instructor is very good but she delivered the course in a very plain way.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The pace was too slow.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Nice teacher, knowledgeable and approachable, can't teach though.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Professor Wang is very patient. She may need to improve her oral English to explain things more clearly.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Dr. Wang is knowledgeable and the class is informative.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Strengths: Keeps class very simple Weakness: The lectures are dull",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0good but should give more instructions and clarifications on the final project",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0The language barrier made it difficult to understand her fully, but besides that, she did a fairly good job at explaining things clearly. The class would benefit from less discussion on abstract concepts, and more about how to apply concepts to real world examples",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0Strengths: - Professor Wang's slides were extremely helpful and she would make sure that students understood all concepts in class. Her warm personality also makes her very approachable.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0It was quite difficult to follow Professor Wang's train of thoughts as her enunciation was not always clear. For this reason, I found it quite challenging to keep up with her.",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0she is nice, but did not gain much from the lectures",
    "Instructor: Zuoheng Wang \u00a0I LIKE THIS INSTRUCTOR"

    "Worst course ever taken. Never recommend to others if with same instructor.",
    "The class is painful to take in that the instructor and TA's are difficult to understand and are not very engaging in class. But the subject matter is important and I do not think it is a class that should be skipped despite how painful it is to take. On the bright side, it was helpful not to have exams because it allowed me to focus weekly on the homeworks and on developing practical skills instead of preparing to take exams.",
    "I will strongly recommend this course to fellow student.",
    "BIS 625 provides an introduction on categorical data analysis. There is a focus on log linear models and logistic regression. There are problem sets each week in addition to a final project. I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. The lectures are quite boring and all of the material can be learned by reading the textbook.",
    "Good intro course, average workload",
    "If you are an MPH student... Don't take it! I know you want to learn more biostats methods, but this class isn't the way to do it. Save yourself some tears and take something else. If you're still on the fence, read the first couple of chapters of the textbook. They're about as good as it's going to get, so if they're confusing, get out while you can.",
    "This is a good course to take if interested in advanced biostatistics beyond biostats 505a and 505b. However, I would recommend additional courses, such as linear regression, to learn more about diagnostics and remedial measures.",
    "The course is very helpful.",
    "Yes, useful",
    "Yes. The course is very useful.",
    "I will recommend this class.",
    "I would say this course is based on an interesting subject. The class does not have any tests, so it is a very easy going course in that aspect, but the homeworks take up a lot of time. I would recommend it to another student, if they want to learn biostatistics from a different perspective.",
    "This class seemed extremely easy for biostats students who had likely seen the material before. Several epi students struggled with it as the lectures were not very helpful. I would not recommend it.",
    "As a novice to code this course was a challenge! Well worth it, but a lot of learning and hard work.",
    "useful",
    "I am on the fence about this course. While I feel like the topics and concepts are really important and useful, I feel that I did not learn as much as I would have expected or hoped. Most weeks I was just so frustrated with the homework assignments that it was difficult to enjoy the course. The great thing is that there are no exams, but the final project is definitely time-consuming and challenging. We were given a real data set, so it was great to be able to apply what we've learned to a real-world example.",
    "Definitely a useful course for anyone in public health as most of us will at some point work with categorical response variables in research. The class is graded based on homework (60%) and a final project (40%) so for those students who don't like exams this is a perk.",
    "Even though the learning process is not easy, I still think it is pretty useful course.",
    "I would encourage students to take another statistics course that may be more helpful to them.",
    "I would recommend it if you think you will need it for the future. Do not take it just for fun.",
    "I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANOTHER STUDENT, BECAUSE THE INSTRUCTOR GIVES GOOD LECTURE AND THE COURSE IS NOT VERY DIFFICULT THOUGH."
