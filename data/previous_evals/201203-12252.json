    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is a laid-back and very informative course. Do not be intimitated by Professor Gonzalez's fast speaking if you are not fluent in Spanish. In the end it will all work out. The quizes are not difficult they really are just to make sure you are keeping up with the reading and the final essay and midterm are also very fair. If you are interested in Literature you should really take it!",
    "Overall, I really enjoyed taking this class. It consists of 3 very simple quizzes based on the readings and one final paper. But be warned, the final paper is 15 to 20 pages long and will take a very long time to complete. I would suggest starting it weeks in advance- I did not do this and regretted it. However, Professor Gonzalez is very flexible and allowed us to turn it in a few days late if we felt like we needed the extra time. I appreciated the light workload (we were only responsible for reading a new short story every class period), and the readings were fairly interesting. The class is more of a lecture than a discussion though. Professor Gonzalez will always find a way to make the ethical dilemma in the stories about language, writing, and the responsibility of the author to his work. If you're looking for an interesting Spanish class that won't take up too much of your time, I would recommend this class.",
    "Basically a lecture in a seminar room. Interesting lecture but dont expect much discussion",
    "The course was outstanding and anyone with a strong enough level of Spanish should consider.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! It was a very interesting course, and not too much is asked of the students until the final essay."
