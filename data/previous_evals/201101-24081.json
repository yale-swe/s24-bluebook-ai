    "Yes I would recommend this class. Its not particularly hard (not too much reading, and small assignments). The topic is depressing but incredibly interesting. You would HAVE to like sociology to take this class and enjoy it because it is a COMPLETELY sociological take on Mass Incarceration and Family Life. Don't expect any deep philosophical or theoretical conversations. But it is pretty good for what it is (a discussion of the prisons effects on families) and the professor is quite personable and engaging if a bit limited in his teaching methods and assignment creation. He is young though, he will probably get better at this stuff!",
    "Interesting course- starts off with a look at African American families, and segues into readings about mass incarceration and its effects on families and communities. About 100 pages of reading a week, with six (approximately two pages, double spaced) reading responses over the course of the semester, with three five-six page papers. A must-take if you are at all interested in prisons. Christopher Wildeman is a cool guy.",
    "Yes. Take it!",
    "A course that covers the fundamental of mass incarceration and its effects on the urban family. While it is a seminar, the assignments (3 papers) are largely focused on demonstrating that you paid attention in class, did the readings, and can provide information of dominant and relevant literature in the field of mass incarceration. Do not expect to critically engage your own thoughts and arguments in the paper. The expectation is more that you acquire a solid knowledge of the material. Reading responses were sometimes Class discussion were great. Despite the early start, I never had any hesitation to go, even not being a morning person. Great professor, important material tobe aware of, and unique among the classes offered at Yale.",
    "Yes, i recommend this class to other students. The class puts prisoners in a social context that is often overlooked by the media. This class will definitely change students' perspectives about prisoners and the communities they belong to.",
    "No. If you are interested in the subject, you could do the readings yourself. This class didn't involve much critical thinking and class and the assignments just involved summarizing the readings. Only one perspective was covered.",
    "Good class. Not very demanding work wise, and if you are interested in why we put so many people in prison you should take it. Good conversations and readings about an important topic.",
    "If you do not know much about the discrepancies of our prison system and the side effects that no one ever talks about, TAKE THIS CLASS. Demanding but definitely manageable.",
    "This is an amazing class, with a really chill professor. The discussion and readings are really interesting, and even for someone who's never taken a sociology class, was easy to understand. This is a must take if you are interesting in urban or af-am studies, or even in just learning more about the justice system. Readings not too heavy if you space them out over the week, 3 papers plus 6 short reading responses. Don't expect to get a lot of helpful feedback on papers, though.",
    "I totally recommend this seminar. Professor Wildeman is knowledgeable and approachable; he shows great grasp of the material, promptly answers e-mails, and allows students to make their points in class. The material is very interesting and the readings seem to have been carefully chosen, making you keep the big picture in mind. If you're interested in the social consequences of mass imprisonment, you should take this course.",
    "Good class. Take it if you want to understand an important issue of our time.",
    "Take it. Important topic, great professor, interesting class.",
    "A fabulous exploration of the circumstance of urban families before and through mass incarceration. It is a balanced and interesting class."
