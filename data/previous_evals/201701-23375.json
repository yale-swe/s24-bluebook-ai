   "comments": [
    "The layout this year was that we formed groups and stayed in those groups for the entirety of the semester in which we worked on real-world projects for real entities that required our help. We learned a variety of information and that was the major strength of the class. In general, the most glaring weakness is the lack of cohesion the course had every week. It seemed like the general layout was established but course activities were determined in class at that moment with very little forethought (at times this reflected as more work was being put in by the students than the actual prof). Projects should have also been worked on during class time in order to increase the efficiency of the course during its allotted time. Lastly, the last class was the COOLEST! I learned the most in that class than all the others combined. I almost wish we did a little more to gear up for it and had that play a bigger role in the course as a whole.",
    "Very interesting and interactive course. Very useful for anyone interested in a career in government organizations or public health.",
    "strengths: ability to work on a project that has the potential to be used in the real world weakness: professor, constantly altering syllabus, waste of class time (except the last two classes)",
    "This course felt like a trial and that's because it was. I like the bold decisions Dr. Bazell and Shoshanna made about the syllabus and how to structure the course. It worked out well. I learned a lot, especially from Joanne at the end she was great. The projects were relevant and working with external organizations gave us focus, which I think is critical because working on assignments that all built off of each other is much more effective than doing fragmented, unrelated assignments. As an improvement I would love to have seen a more consistent assignment schedule. Again, this class was sort of an experiment of something new so the professor was trying to adjust workload accordingly. But for the future, it would help to have a syllabus with an assignment schedule that is set in stone (use our semester as the determinant of how many and which assignments to do and when they should be due). It was difficult to keep up with the announcements coming in from canvas regarding due date changes and figuring out when we did and did not have a blog post due, etc. Also, I think it would have been totally fine to have blog posts due during weeks when other assignments were due, as long as you stick with the blog posts as they were described in the syllabus which is students can write about anything public health-related of interest to them.",
    "Interesting topics and projects",
    "I enjoyed the fact that this course was almost like a mini-practicum course and that we got to work with well-known New Haven\/CT organizations. I just think that by trying to stick to the syllabus so much, it limited what we could actually give to our organization that they actually wanted. For example, our organization expressed interest in more social media posts, stickers, and print media items. Thus, I am not sure how helpful our long podcast and video will help them with their needs. The syllabus needs to be more adaptable to what the organizations want.",
    "Poor organization; seemed like professor made up lecture and assignments 20 min before class. Little feedback given. Current structure represents a seminar, not a full class.",
    "I liked this class! A huge strength was that we partnered up with community organizations and actually worked on different projects each week that those organizations can actually use (creating a podcast, a promo video, press release, etc.) Although these were really interesting topics that we learned every week, I wish we had more guidance and clear instructions for each assignment. The cool thing about it was that our group had so much flexibility on how we wanted to approach these different projects, but a bit more structure on expectations would have been good. Also, some of the guest speakers that were brought in were hit or miss. The most interesting guest speaker was brought in at the end of the semester, when we discussed Crisis\/Emergency Public Health Response -- she was so engaging! Also, I really enjoyed the Connecticut Department of Public Health Epidemiologist. Having him tell his story about working as a state Epidemiologist and his super interesting stories about his experiencing with the news media and how he prepared for news interviews -- and then ACTUALLY showing the video of him on the news looking super nervous -- was hilarious and a really interesting look into how state health departments have to navigate public health communications. Also, we have a legendary journalist as our instructor, how cool is that?!",
    "Dr. Bazell is very knowledgeable about communications, but I would have appreciated it if his lectures were much more organized. There were some great guest lecturers, especially the last one that focused on emergency preparedness. I did feel that the course was a bit unorganized at times.",
    "This course had real world outcomes. Additionally, the class had an opportunity to work directly with New Haven organizations.",
    "Strength - it provides interactive methods to learning, encourages collaboration and innovation, professor has a background that provides unique perspective to class Weakness - not enough opportunities to explore various methods of communication Ways to improve - incorporate more and different types of projects at the beginning of the semester",
    "This was an excellent skills based course that provided great opportunities to learn various modalities for conveying health information. It was well organized and very interesting.",
    "It's a good course that gives you direct experience with working with and for a public health organization. Its strengths are definitely the opportunity to pair up with local organizations to work with and possibly publish things for to help advance their cause and the structure of the class that puts you in groups. Working in a group was awesome and one of the best parts of the class. As for weaknesses, I think a more solid foundation on the communications part in class was more needed. There are extensive readings on this, but I think hearing more from Bob's experience in the field with clear cut tips would've been helpful.",
    "Strengths - I think working with organizations was a great part of this class. Getting real world experience by helping orgs with their communications strategies was a great way to develop our skill sets. Weakness - I would have liked to see a bit more demonstrations in class for the more complicated projects like editing for the videos and podcasts. We ended up relying on the people who had previous experience with editing - but not all groups will be lucky to have one of those people in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Bob is great and has a lot of information to provide. As I mentioned above, it seemed like he got a lot of his lesson plans as ideas at the moment which detracted from the class. However, he does have a lot of connections and the guest lectures that came to class every week were really engaging.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Fun and friendly.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0has great stories and experiences that would make a great guest lecturer, but unfortunately does not make a professor for an entire semester with his rambling and offering nothing to discussion. barely any feedback is given and little is given in terms of parameters (rubric) for the assignments. for example with the ever changing syllabus... first the syllabus says blog post every week. then week by week the blog post would be cancelled or specified the week of despite the syllabus not reflecting these actions. then before spring break announced the rest of the assignments for the rest of the semester and said a blog post is due the weeks there was no assignment due, which was once in april. then during the week 11 class, it was announced that in addition to the PSA being due next week, a blog post would be due and no acknowledgment was made that this went completely against what was said prior to spring break also it was not appropriate, following his informing the class that emails would be going out to inform students about how they were doing (in terms of grades) because many students were inquiring (and these emails were never sent), for him to say, \"i don't think we'll have any suicides\". the best part of this course was the last 2 classes when Lt. Col. Joanne McGovern ran the show and it is my recommendation that she take over this class as the main professor if at all possible.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Dr. Bazell made this class dynamic and interesting and fun. He is a communications guru and it showed through his ability to share his wisdoms with us. It would be helpful if he can lecture a few of the classes rather than have speakers come in. The speaker curriculum got a bit tedious after a while. For instance, the people who came in to talk about using the recording studio wasn't really necessary to have for an hour. A 15-minute presentation would have sufficed. I would have like to have seen a bit more in-class discussion or lecture about the readings. Some of them got pretty complex (especially the Pink Book), but then we never heard about it or got a chance to talk about it in class.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Very knowledgeable, wished the instructor shared more of his own personal experiences",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0great! So knowledgeable and great to get to know and learn from a real leader in the field of PH communications.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Bob Bazell was great! I think having him teach Communications was an awesome idea, he really brings his experience as a journalist into the classroom. Also, watching his news reports and having him talk about it in the context of this class was really interesting to see. I only wish he showed more of his journalism pieces during lecture! Great overall!",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0He knows a lot about the media, and would have liked to have a class with him that focuses on media or communication studies, but I am not sure if his teaching style were best suited for a public health context.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0This Professor has real world experience which made the class more credible.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Strength - has a unique background that provided interesting content to classes, brought in interesting speakers Weakness - did not speak about his background to the extent that I had hoped for. Very interested in his professional background, and wanted to hear about it during class. Ways to improve - Bring in more content from past as correspondent.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Very knowledgeable about the course material and receptive to student questions\/needs. He also had several great guest speakers to come in for a few of the lectures. He is helpful in assisting students in and out of class and made sure classes were interactive and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0He's great! Clearly an expert in his field and willing to help out any student who needs help. Good instructor, great at giving feedback as well. I wish he talked more about his experience and what he learned over time about communications--I feel like that would've been helpful for us as we did our own group projects.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Strengths - Very passionate about public health communications and passionate about how to communicate health information in general to the public. Dr. Bazell also strongly emphasized that the projects we pursued should be of help to the organizations, even if their needs didn't follow the outline for the class. Weakness - I appreciated the concept of having guest speakers talk about the specific topics we cover, but sometimes this can make the class structure seem a bit chaotic. During certain classes where we are learning practical skills (editing, press releases etc) it might be better to make learning these skills the focus rather than the guest lectures."

   "comments": [
    "The course provides a good sampling of communication styles and techniques that need to be improved upon for a career in public health. You also learn low tech and high tech methodologies to drive your message home: podcast and PSAs.",
    "Very useful for anyone interested in a career in government organizations or public health. Would strongly recommend it!",
    "don't take this time unless Lt Col. Joanne McGovern has become the professor because otherwise it is really not worth the hassle of a disjointed course with the potential to be great, but unfortunately misses the mark.",
    "I would recommend the course but maybe in a year or two. It needs to grow into itself. I think part of the hardship is that public health communications is a really really vast subject area that deserves its own entire concentration, which it does at some other schools. But here we have this one class and it's a bit awkward in this way. It's not really an introductory class because we don't get a lot of lecture about broad communications subjects, and it's not an advanced course because we can't be expected to do advanced work when there is not intro. So it's somewhere in between. Even if we don't have an entire concentration, it would help to add a couple other communications class and situate this one in the middle. For example, I picked up some skills with using iMovie and Garage Band, but I don't think that's what professionals use to edit their media. For me to recommend this course, I think there would need to be some more concrete and applicable skills offered.",
    "I will recommend. The class in informative.",
    "A unique and interesting course. You won't learn this kind of material in your other courses!",
    "At the beginning of the semester, lots of organizations from the community presented on their communications needs and you select your top 3 choices. Based on those picks, you get put in a group that you work with for the remaining of the semester. Every week we learned a different topic (one week we learned how to record a podcast, another week was making a promo video, one week was writing a press release, etc). Cool class to take!",
    "The class is okay. Takes very little time, and your experience is dependent on your project and group.",
    "Any student interested in healthcare PR, this is a great course to start with.",
    "Great course because it provides skill sets that other courses at YSPH does not provide.",
    "Would highly recommend.",
    "This class is a great experience for students looking for \"in the field\" work. You get to work with an actual organization with an actual cause and work on incredibly diverse projects throughout the year. I'd definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class in its current format (Ie working with real organizations) to another student. I think its one of the few YSPH classes that lets us practice and develop our skill set to be more useful in the real world."
