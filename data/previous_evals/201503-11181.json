    "The Wire is a life-changing show and this seminar is an amazing interdisciplinary approach to unlocking its lessons. Our class had film majors, social sciences majors, American Studies, etc, so I really gained a lot of different perspectives. Fantastic learning experience which I highly recommend.",
    "Yes! Take it! It's kind of an insane amount of writing, but it's worth it. Hazel Carby (and Nick if he TAs this again, which I don't think is a thing but whatever) is so smart and really knows The Wire, its relevant scholarship, and other pieces of scholarship that you wouldn't expect to encounter in a film studies\/AFAM class. It's also just incredibly gratifying to write 20,000 words on a subject and really engage critically with one piece of media. Be wary of the time commitment it's a lot of writing due every week. But it's completely worth it, I highly recommend this class!",
    "Incredible course and incredibly demanding course. Over the first five weeks of the semester, you watch all five seasons of \"The Wire,\" probably the best show ever made. Professor Carby's insights are brilliant, the discussions are rich, and the later weeks in the course spent linking the show back to non-fiction urban American experiences and sociology are eye-opening. You study the show from every perspective possible: from philosophy, film theory, sociology, political science, race and ethnicity studies. And you leave the course with new perspective on and motor to engage with our world. Forewarning, though, that the class is a lot of work: over the first five weeks, you watch 13 hours of television per week; over the last seven weeks, you read a book (+ perhaps an article or two) a week; in ALL weeks except one, you are expected to submit a polished 1,500 word essay analyzing the week's material. There's no faking this class. Would recommend it especially in a semester with three other classes. You either do it well or shouldn't do it. If you do it well, it's an incredible journey.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The workload was rather intense, but I learned so much from the secondary sources and the show itself was wonderful.",
    "This was likely my favorite course at Yale. If you're interested in TV studies, take it. If you're interested in race relations, take it. In representation of minority cultures, take it. In sociology\/ethnography, take it. In Baltimore and other urban centers, take it. If you're interested in understanding how people are taught to understand, take this course. It really has changed the way that I view media - for the better. Something like this course should be required for anyone interested in going into the industry."
