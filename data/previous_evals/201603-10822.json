   "comments": [
    "I learned an unbelievable amount about these two countries--their respective histories, the reasons why many of their stories have been silenced in history, the issues of colorism and racism in these cultures, the perceived-to-be tumultuous between Haiti and the DR, and much more. These cultures are rich and full of nuances that everyone would appreciate exposure to.",
    "I loved this class. It challenged me to view Haitian and Dominican history in a new way. I think Dixa did an amazing job at choosing works of literature that challenged common notions of Hispaniola's history as a whole, which was refreshing for me.",
    "I developed better writing skills in this course.",
    "I gained a much deeper understanding of not just Haitian and Dominican literature, but also the history of both of these nations. I learned a lot from doing deep analyses of all of the novels and really felt like I got way more understanding from them than I would have if I had just read them on my own.",
    "This course helped me engage with a topic that I hadn't really thought about before. I think it's wonderful that Yale offers a course like this that allows students to learn about the Dominican Republic and Haiti on such an extensive level. I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot about DR and Haiti, and I developed a lot of analytical skills for varied sources that I didn't have before."

   "comments": [
    "The materials in this course were amazing! A variety of novels, short stories, non-fiction articles, music and movies provided a great launching point for seminar discussion.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely its syllabus. The readings week in and week out were engaging and interesting. The discussions that followed in class were equally as engaging and interesting. I would say that this class engaged the syllabus more than many other classes that I've taken. There weren't many weaknesses in this course but it could have been cool to have an event outside of class once or twice to experience the culture in real time, i.e. going to a live concert, having a lunch or dinner event with Dominican or Haitian food, etc.",
    "Strengths: The syllabus is amazing and Dixa actively tries to choose literature that most wouldn't immediately think of using for a class on Haiti and the DR Weakness: Although there was some interesting readings, I did feel slightly overwhelmed by the amount of reading that had to get done from week to week. I wish I hadn't felt this way because it may have allowed me to enjoy the course more.",
    "I generally thought it was strong overall. I don't have specific suggestions."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It expands your views on Haiti and DR--breaking down the cliches and stereotypes that plague otusiders' views of the island.",
    "Absolutely. This course should be a must-take course, especially for people with family backgrounds in these two countries. The readings are fantastic, the professor is amazing, and the material is rich in both its history and the vibes.",
    "I would definitely recommend anyone take this course. Although it does have a focus on Hispaniola, it challenges your reading and writhing skills (which I sincerely appreciated).",
    "Yes, this course had an ideal combination of examining the literature and also looking at its context.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student! This was my favorite class of my semester. The novels we read were so interesting and I really got so much out of our discussions as well. I learned so much about the history of these two countries. I would highly recommend it, especially if you're of Haitian or Dominican origin, as its a great way to learn about your culture on an academic level.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is very engaging and the 2+ hour class goes by incredibly quickly. I learned a lot and engaged in a lot of great material and overall found this class very valuable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it is important for more students to engage with this subject. Yale definitely benefits from having this course. The workload and structure of the class are great, and really allow for in-depth discussions."
