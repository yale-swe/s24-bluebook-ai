    "Music 475 was a very intimate, explorative, and educational experience. Professor Kreuzer was extremely professional and inspiring, and the conversation in our small seminar was always engaging. Kreuzer did a fantastic job structuring the course, and the time that she put into the students and the material, in turn, inspired us to put forth our best work. A wonderful senior seminar to take for music majors.",
    "This seminar was very deliberately tied to the centenaries in 2013, so it is unlikely to be offered again, which is a pity, because it was a phenomenal course. The papers were a bit rough, but Kreuzer is an excellent seminar leader: Brilliant, enthusiastic, and encouraging, this was honestly the best seminar I have taken in my time at Yale. If you have _any_ interest in opera, find a course that Kreuzer is teaching and TAKE IT!",
    "Verdi, Wagner, Britten in 2013 is a senior seminar in the Music Department. In this course, you will study the commemoration of these composers at their anniversaries as well as take in-depth looks at musical examples. If you can take any class with Professor Kreuzer, do so!",
    "An open-ended survey into some great composers, with special focus on their current-day impact. Very useful for a greater appreciation of old music in our lives."
