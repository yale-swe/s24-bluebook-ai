    "Great introduction to American political behavior. Well-done syllabus. Highly recommended.",

    "This is a thorough overview of the major issues in American political behavior. I would consider it necessary for anyone planning on being an Americanist, and I think it would be extremely useful for comparativists (both substantively and because it showcases some of the most advanced methodology in political science) and certain theorists (those who use psychology in their research)."
