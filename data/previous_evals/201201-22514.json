   "comments": [
    "This is a great class! Even if you are not that interested in Canada, Quebec is a great starting point for a lot of interesting discussions that apply to many other things.",
    "This class is a nice and soft introduction to the history major. The actual seminars usually run long, but are, for the most part, actively fun. The class is highly interactive and runs like a well-informed conversation between friends, rather than a lecture structure. And the reading is not actually as threatening as it looks on the syllabus. I would definitely recommend this class to someone who thinks they might be interested in trying out History as a discipline, or to somebody looking for a welcoming, inclusive seminar.",
    "Take it if you need an easy seminar and don't mind being bored often and not having a lot of structure.",
    "This is a pretty easy history credit if you're looking for one. You will probably be bored a lot and I didn't really learn anything.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The course in fun and the subject is one that we are not really taught. I learned a lot about Canada, of which I knew almost nothing before.",
    "I would definitely recommend HIST 168J. The readings are very worthwhile, seminar is enjoyable, and Professor Gitlin is both very knowledgeable and a lot of fun.",
    "A must take. Great way to learn a forgotten history",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! I knew nothing about Quebec and very little about Canadian history before taking it. Turns out it's absolutely fascinating. Professor Gitlin is amazing and truly cares about his students; strongly consider taking both Quebec and Yale and America if you can. This is one of the few classes I've taken at Yale in which I've made friends. Prof. G makes sure that people know each other, and he creates a fun, collaborative learning environment. The work isn't bad (3 page paper, group presentation, 15 page research paper). You'll learn a lot and have a great time. Absolutely a win-win.",
    "This is a fun history seminar about an interesting topic. There is a lot of reading, but you actually don't need to do most of it. The main assignments are a short 3 page paper and a longer term paper. Take it for relaxed Tuesday afternoons.",
    "A not particularly rigorous history seminar with a passionate, interesting, committed, and funny. However, don't expect a rigorous course from which you exit knowing everything there is to know. The rigor is low but the end-product is only a broad strokes understanding of the history.Significant but not excessive reading with minimized pressure to do it.Midterm paper 3 pgsFinal research paper 15-20 pgsGood class for non-history majors too"
