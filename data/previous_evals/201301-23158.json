   "comments": [
    "I read Professor Lee's reviews prior to enrolling in this class and expected the course to be excellent. I was disappointed. While the reading list was great (enjoyed watching Clueless and reading Bridget Jones's Diary as part of the course, in addition to the Austen novels) and discussions were okay (less stuffy than discussions in many courses in the English department), this course suffered from disorganization. Papers took weeks to get back, and aspects of the syllabus were altered throughout the semester. Many people felt dissatisfied with her comments on their papers, although I found meeting with her pretty helpful in improving. Eighteenth-Century Novel, her first-semester junior seminar, seemed almost a prerequisite for fully appreciating significant portions of the discussions. Maybe this will improve in the future as in future years there will be some precedent, but I would be cautious to enroll in this course. If you had Prof. Lee for Eighteenth-Century Novel and are familiar with her, I think you will have a better time than if this is your first course with her.",
    "Enjoyable but unrigorous course. Wonderful readings and interesting discussions but too limited to the immediate sphere of the novels. Good professor who leads interesting discussions and gives good feedback, but at times felt more like a book club than a college course.",
    "Enjoyable overall, but harsh grading, unclear assignments and expectations. A lot of metadiscussions about the quality of Austenian narration that only the professor and a couple of students engaged in, and a certain amount of favoritism showed to students who had taken the professor's Victorian novel class. Basically, fun, but definitely Cred\/D this one if you take it!",
    "Jane Austen novels are great, but class discussions were sometimes too plot-focused and the professor is a deceptively difficult grader (even though the class seems like a gut). The professor is really nice though and it's a really laid back class environment.",
    "Take it! There isn't too much reading (and all the reading is Jane Austen anyway, so it's fun) and Wendy Lee is SO GREAT. She leads amazing discussions that will get you to think about Austen in a whole new way.",
    "No.After an entire semester, this class taught me three things.1. I don't like seminars that feel like Jane Austen appreciation book clubs2. I don't like seminars where not doing the reading makes class less frustrating and marginally less boring.3. While I still love Austen, it is possible for a professor\/class to almost make you hate one of the best novelists ever.Those are the only things I learned in this class.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who loves Austen!",
    "Low-stress, make sure you enjoy reading Austen because that's all you'll be doing.",
    "If you're looking for a relaxing 5th credit this is for you, however if you don't want to feel like you're in a bookclub with difficult grading I say keep looking.",
    "Reading and review of Austen's books and style."
