   "comments": [
    "The class is genuinely interesting, and I definitely learned a lot, but at the sametime it was easy and low-key enough to never be a source for great concern beyond the actual class time and problem sets. Tests are open-note, and the math is really basic, so it's a great science and QR credit for non-science people.",
    "Good course. Not much to say. Didn't leave a bad impression, but not a great one either... Easy enough of a QR.",
    "good for filling a science\/qr requirement. interesting stuff good teachers",
    "Summary: A fairly easy QR or Sc credit. Be prepared, however, for extrasolar planets to be a lot less interesting than you expected.Recommendation: Neutral.",
    "It's a study of three of the hot topics in astronomy right now. Easy QR and interesting material. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend it if you are good at math and science. It is easier than most math\/sciences at Yale but still hard.",
    "take the course if you want an interesting, fun, not too challenging Qr\/Sc",
    "Yes, but only if you are really actually interested in astronomy. If you're just taking this as an easy QR, you will be bored.",
    "Yes... Take the course. There is a generoud curve at the ned of the semester and the Problem Sets aren't that hard.",
    "Low workload:A problem set a weekThree tests and a finalNo class-readingsRequired Section attendanceFlexible lectures: no set syllabus because new things are being discovered all the time in this field of study. Very exciting but at the same time lack of structure expected from traditional lectures.Other thoughts:No textbooks; you have to go to lecture for course material (attendance is checked thru. handing in questions after every lecture).",
    "I definitely recommend this class, especially if you have interest in physics.",
    "If you're at all competent at math, it'll be a pretty easy and interesting course.",
    "While I personally did not enjoy this course, I think students who are looking for an easy quantitative reasoning class would like it.",
    "I would take this if interested in current topics in astronomy and willing to spend some time on problemsets.",
    "As a non-science major looking to fulfill my SC requirement, this class was essentially just what I wanted. The content covered was very interesting, and I felt as though I was learning a lot of important information about how the universe works. At the same time, the workload was definitely manageable. Definitely recommend.",
    "Great class, take it.",
    "The best way for those interested in astronomy to get started on their major and also and interesting subject for those who want to fulfill their science credit;",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's not grueling and it covers interesting subjects (exoplanets, black holes, dark matter), and to top it off, you get a QR or a science credit. You have a fairly basic problem set every week or so, and lectures are always very interesting. Professor Geha is enthusiastic and engaging. I could not shut up about the stuff I learned in this class. If you're at all interesting in awesome stuff about space and physics, take this class. Oh, but a warning: you will do math. Mostly math. If you took high school physics, you'll be set.",
    "Definitely go to the lecture, do the problem sets and enjoy the liquid nitrogen ice cream if they do it on the last lecture again.",
    "Astronomy is an introduction to the newer advancements in astronomy such as discovering new planets, black holes, and dark matter. I would recommend the class, especially if you need a science credit. The work load isn't bad and there plenty of opportunity to do make-up work. If you can do algebra, than it should be easy.",
    "Definitely take this class. Not too difficult, very interesting, supposedly much better than Astro 120.",
    "I would recommend it just keep in mind that there is no text book which can be frustrating",
    "Definitely. This class is very interesting and not too difficult.",
    "It's interesting, I have never taken a class about black holes, exoplanets, or dark matter. Plus people are always think I'm smarter than I am when I tell them that I take astrophysics, so there's that.",
    "It's an effortless science distribution requirement that is still interesting. An excellent choice if you need a science credit.",
    "If you are looking for a course that covers the most interesting aspects of astronomy and fufills a SC requirement, take this one. Well worth it.",
    "Take it.",
    "Terrific class. Prof Geha brings to life a pretty cool topic that is not readily accessible to the everyday person. Though I took the class for the Sci\/QR credit, I legitimately enjoyed the material. Not at all difficult, but requires good attendance in lecture and section.",
    "yes",
    "This class was a truly interesting introduction to planets outside the solar system, black holes, and dark matter. It was perfect for a non-science major. I would definitely recommend it - by far the best QR\/Sc class I've taken and not very much work (only weekly problem sets)!",
    "Take it. Lots of fun.",
    "This course gives an intro to exoplanets (planets outside the solar system), black holes, and dark matter. There are very doable problem sets every week, though I recommend taking going to office hours either with Prof. Geha or the T.A.s. If you are comfortable with basic algebra, and highschool-level (or lower) physics, this course is for you. Reasonably easy SC and QR credit.",
    "I would recommend the class because the material is interesting and the class workload is very reasonable.",
    "I'd recommend it. The concepts are interesting."
