    "Great!",
    "The course is obviously helpful for anyone who is interested in empirical research, but my experience in the industry suggests that this course could be helpful even for professionals. Professional services industry is heavily dependent on meaningful analyses of extremely big data for better or for worse, and some of the mistakes that researchers were advised against in this course are fairly common in the industry too."

    "One of my favorite courses at SOM.",
    "This was my first exposure to econometrics and empirical research, and the course as it is structured gave meaningful insights into empirical research methodology. I really appreciated the content, and the discussions which provided context to the content that was being covered. The course goes only as far as the quality of the class discussions, and I hope future students realise that."
