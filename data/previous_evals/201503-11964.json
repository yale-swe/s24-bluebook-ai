   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested or thinks they might be interested in field work in environmental studies. Because the class has weekly labs, it gives you a sense of what field work would be like and lets students find out if this is something that they would enjoy pursuing further.",
    "This course was incredibly enjoyable and I learned a lot about scientific writing and lab report writing and I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "This is a really really great science credit for someone who doesn't have a wrong background in the sciences. I felt able to keep up and negate with the topics even though I had not taken any sciences for several years. Kealoha is a great professor and you will get to know your classmates very well over the semester. There was more writing than I expected, but lots of support if you ask for it.",
    "As I said above, I really enjoyed the class. As a non-science major, with a limited science background, EVST 234 was a fantastic introduction to field science methods and research. The class is a lot of work, with multiple lab reports due throughout the semester - but you are supported along the way, and you learn a ton. It's so fantastic to spend so much time in the field - from the trip to Yale Myers, to visiting local farms, to utilizing the Peabody's research forest in Guilford - it's an absolutely fantastic introduction to field science methods! It's certainly not a walk in the park, and that's good - there are multiple lab reports, and Kealoha and Max cover a lot of ground throughout the semester. But, if you're looking to learn about forestry, reading the forested landscape, ecological approaches within field science, agricultural field science, urban ecology - you'll come out of the class having learned a ton. And Max and Kealoha are very supportive, and make the class a joy to come to. They're really wonderful people, and are committed to making sure you learn the material, even if it's challenging for you!",
    "This class has two parts: lecture\/discussion and lab. Tuesdays are focused around two to three papers, read before, that are then discussed for an hour. Thursdays are a four hour lab period that is almost always spent out in the field collecting specimens or tree samples. The field trips are enjoyable and you learn how to critically read a scientific paper",
    "This is a great opportunity to work outside while learning how to analyze. You learn a lot about sustainable land use practices in a variety of settings, and by the end you know how to hammer out a decent lab report. I would recommend this class, there's certainly a decent amount of work involved, much of which is not fun, but if you have a good class that you can draw support from it's not too hard and you'll have a good time and learn a lot.",
    "This is certainly a class that has a fair amount of work (especially when the labs are due), but overall it's really really fun. You'll learn a lot and get to be outside.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, especially if you're itching to get outside more! The lab write ups can be a little stressful, but other than that it was a lot of fun."
