   "comments": [
    "Interesting, important information, taught in an engaging manner. It's hard as hell towards the end of the semester, but you'll learn some stuff.",
    "This is probably one of the better taught MechE courses. That being said, it was frustrating that the only relevant reference material for this course was lecture notes. It would have been nice to have a textbook with more sample questions.",
    "Professor Dufresne may be one of the best teachers at Yale. He takes Thermodynamics and makes it totally understandable to everyone in the room. If you're looking at this class, you probably have to take it. But even if you don't, you should really consider it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need it for your major or are genuinely interested in thermo. You definitely need to be ready to work hard, but you learn a ton, and a lot of the material is really applicable! Go to class, take good notes and understand the homework then you'll learn a lot. Plus the power plant tour at the end of the semester was awesome!",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. You will feel like you've accomplished something once you finish it. Take it if only to get to know Dufresne.",
    "Would highly recommend to anyone who likes physics\/chem\/engineering.",
    "This is a really valuable course. Thermo is at the base of everything a mechanical engineer does. This class teaches you not just how to apply the laws of thermodynamics, but also to look at a problem, make reasonable assumptions, and apply the laws of science in an appropriate manner. If you're interested in engineering, energy, or anything involving applications of math, take this class!",
    "Awesome. Take it.",
    "MENG 211 is a course that you probably have to take if you are considering taking it. It is no more work than any of the other engineering courses you have to take as a Mech E major and Professor Dufresne makes it one of the more enjoyable courses. He is really helpful and keeps the material simple enough to develop a good understanding, maybe even sometimes too simple. The course is also good for non-majors with an interest in thermo as I had a friend who was an EP&E major and still enjoyed the course. This course is a pretty good one so just take it if you are considering it but try to take it with Dufresne.",
    "One of my favorite classes thus far taken at Yale. Dufresne is an absolutely amazing professor, who made the material really interesting and understandable. Definitely take this class.",
    "If you've already taken physical chemistry don't take this course. Everything will be review.",
    "Fantastic course. Professor Dufresne is undoubtedly the best professor I have had at Yale. He cares about his students and their understanding of the topics of the course, something all professors at Yale should try to emulate. He met with me for both course related topics and for personal engineering interests outside of class. He understands that there are more to students than just their grades.",
    "If you're going to take thermo, take it with Professor Dufresne! He is great and takes the class to see the grave of Gibbs at the end of the semester. Some of the problem sets were unnecessarily time consuming, but I think that I definitely learned a lot from them.",
    "Dufresne taught this for us, both the mechanical and chemical engineers. I really liked it, especially compared to some other engineering classes. It's a fundamental topic, and Dufresne is passionate about it, teaches the fundamentals well, and even appropriately encourages our involvement. Problem sets took some time, but they aren't too bad and actually are good for learning the material and getting ready for the tests. There was typically at least one problem set question on each test, ver batum so that is nice too.Well taught, interesting subject, not a crazy amount of work.",
    "You have to take the course if you're Mech E or Chem E, but it's a great class and Dufresne is the man. I recommend this class to pretty much everyone.",
    "Take this class! There's no book, so you know all you need to know is in the lectures. However, this isn't an easy class; it is, however, a doable class. Be warned: the tests are harder than expected because there are tricky questions, but studying and doing the practice problems helps a lot. Go to the review sessions before the midterms and the final if you can.",
    "The couse itself is fine and pretty fundamental to engineering so it's not hard to keep an interest in the material. Dufresne is a nice guy and explains things pretty well when he has time, but he was incredibly unorganized and we had to rush way too quickly through the last part of the semester, and the amount we learned dropped off substantially.",
    "The math in the course is not very difficult at all but you have to make sure you go back and understand what's going on. The hardest part for me was combing math skills and the concepts to solve problems. The class is a must for any engineer and I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND the class.",
    "Basics of heat and entropy, its an interesting class. I recommend it.",
    "As a bs12 I almost didn't take this course but I'm very glad I did. Dufresne really made the experience mostly pleasant.",
    "Great class. One of the more enjoyable requirements.",
    "Dufresne is a great teacher. He's very enthusiastic and makes it easy to pay attention during his lectures. He also makes himself accessible, so although the problem sets can be a little stressful, his office hours are helpful.As for the class, the content is pretty cool, and I learned a lot. You do a lot of derivations in class and end up seeing some things in a new way.",
    "THIS IS A GREAT COURSE! Made me want to be a mechanical engineering major again.Eric Dufresne is one of the most enthusiastic, engaging, relatable, and adorably nerdy professors I've ever had. Eric Dufresne is one of the most enthusiastic, engaging, relatable, and adorably nerdy professors I've ever had. He is probably the best professor I've had for a STEM course at Yale. His extra credit opportunities for students are hilarious and show his genuine interest in the pursuit of knowledge. He knew everybody in the class' names before the first midterm---there were over 40 of us! He even brought us to the grave of Josiah Willard Gibbs, his idol. And the power plant tour. Not to mention his very clear and understandable teaching method. What a great guy.",
    "The only engineering class at Yale that is actually worth it, esp with Dufresne",
    "Easier than fluids.",
    "Fun class, as long as you have a decent math background you will be ok. Dufresne is a great and really fun professor.",
    "Extremely well-taught and interesting class. Professor Dufresne builds everything from the ground up. I took the class without the prereqs and did fine. If you go to lecture, do the work, and seek out extra help during office hours, you will get a lot out of the class. The problem sets are fairly hard, but if you understand everything on them you are extremely well-prepared for the exams. Exams are hard, but not unfair.",
    "I would recommend the thermo. You gain a better understanding of how engines work and turbines work and how they are limited by free energy. It's a pretty cool subject.",
    "This is a fairly difficult class so if you don't have to take it, I don't know if I would recommend it. Certainly only if you enjoy psets and a challenge. Going to class is a must. If it is a requirement for your major, then as far as those go, it's not too bad. Dufresne makes class bearable. I recommend doing psets with friends. The midterms were fairly difficult but the final was easy.",
    "This class is the best engineering class at Yale. It can be challenging but Pr. Dufresne is a very good instructor.",
    "Take this class with Professor Dufresne if you need to take the class. He is the cat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pyjamas when it comes to teaching thermo. The work is usually straightforward, but the exams will stretch you even if you understand the problem sets. Best part of the class: hearing Professor Dufresne rave about the genius of Gibbs. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t miss it."
