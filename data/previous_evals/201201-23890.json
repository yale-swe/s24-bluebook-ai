    "Instructor: Joel Sanders \u00a0Yes, everything was fine.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0It would be better if we had section ta's that were actually involved with our production. Last semester I saw my ta twice and am seriously questioning the pedagogical intent of the school. I'm surprised we had ta listed as I cannot recall seeing him in our studio more than once and maybe receiving three emails from his throughout the semester. What is the point of having a ta if they are barely involved in our education and never in studio?",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0yes, satisfactory.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0The resources provided were fine, though common tables in studio would have been nice so that BP teams could meet more effectively.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Yes, all the resources were adequate.",
    "Instructor: Joseph Moore \u00a0Budgets should have been available for each team in the building project.",
