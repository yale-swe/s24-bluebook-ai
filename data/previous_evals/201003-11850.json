    "ENGL 248 is a class where you will read mostly non-fiction accounts of nature writing (i.e. personal experiences in nature) with the exception of one fiction account. There are 3 papers, two of which can be creative writing (i.e. your own experience in nature) and one that is analytical and is based on a particular nature writer that you choose.",
    "Good class to take. The second half got into more environmental issues and conservation than I would have liked. You get to take sweet field trips!",
    "This is a great class if you are interested in the natural world. It is a nice refresher from other course work at Yale: there is little reading in the middle of the semester, the option of creative papers is fun, and the subject matter is enjoyable. I enjoyed nearly everything that we read because it was material I would have loved to read in my free time. Professor Peterson is knowledgeable, helpful and kind. She always accepts (encourages) revisions of papers, so you can do very well if you try. She offers field trips which are great to go on, and really supplement the class well.",
    "Professor Peterson is a wonderful professor and very approachable. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely take it, especially if you haven't taken an English seminar before or aren't an English major; this is one of the most accessible English classes of the considerable number that I've taken at Yale.",
    "A memorable classroom experience. Not just for hippies and tree huggers or anything - great for anyone, especially those that have had real experiences in nature. Amazing professor, reasonable workload (3 papers - about 20-25 total pages), a enjoyable readings, tons of class participation. Tough to get into this semester (15 spots for 40 people). Do it! It's quite a privilege and a pleasure to read about nature.",
    "Very enjoyable, about as much creative leeway as you're going to find for a pre-1900 credit.",
    "TAKE IT!!! At least, take it if you appreciate nature, and would enjoy reading about it. The writing assigments are fun and manageable. I learned a lot and enjoyed myself. Also, I highly recommend going on as many of the field trips as possible. Professor Peterson treats you to tasty food and you go walk around pretty places and have a good time.",
    "I came into this class thinking we would really read the \"greats\" of the environmental writing\/nature writing movement. However, what we ended up doing was reading excerpts of various works, which was much less satisfying. We read 4 authors per week, so while we were able to cover a lot of ground, it was pretty superficial. Its great to get exposure to these, but now I just have to go back later and re-read many in full. Also, I wasn't very impressed with the discussion prompts from Prof. Peterson, and sometimes class felt a bit forced. But, overall the class has a light work-load and the reading is enjoyable, so if you don't mind the pace, then I recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you can get in! The authors that we read are all worth reading for their prose as well as their significance in the canon of great nature writers.",
    "I definitely recommend this class! It is great - Prof. Peterson is wonderful and the reading list is fantastic.",
    "English 248 is the rare class at Yale where you learn a lot while having a lot of fun. The syllabus covers the major works of British, American, Colonial and post-Colonial nature writing. Professor Peterson is a wonderful professor, and she leads very focused discussions. You get to go on a field trip and choose a large part of the syllabus, and you also have a lot of freedom with paper assignments. As an English major, I was a little disappointed with the lack of rigorous literary analysis, but this class is far from fluffy. It has an interdisciplinary approach, and you'll be encouraged to bring historical and scientific readings to the text in addition to traditional close reading. If you like Thoreau, Abbey, Carson, and spending time outside, take it!"
