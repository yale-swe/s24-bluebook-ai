    "I would recommend it strongly because it's a topic so central to social psychological research and so relevant for everyone's lives.",
    "Psych 505 is the perfect introduction to prejudice and stereotyping research. If you want a comprehensive view of the field, taught by an expert, it's a great place to start.",
    "Psych 505 01 is a fantastic course for all students interesting in social justice, it gives you the tools and awareness to recognize and address key sources of tension and discrimination.",
    "Good primer on topics across social psychology, particularly concerning diversity and prejudice. Jack is an expert in the field and shares his expertise freely.",
    "Yes, I think the information provided in this course was invaluable."

   "comments": [
    "I did not expect it to be relevant to my research, but it did end up deepening my understanding and I might pursue this line of thought in the future.",
    "This course allowed me to get a comprehensive view of psychological research into stereotyping and prejudice in just a few short weeks. It contributed to my research in a general sense by alerting me to areas of the literature I might have otherwise overlooked and giving me a forum to discuss new ideas with students from different disciplines.",
    "I really appreciated the flexibility of the course's topics and assignments to match research interests.",
    "It was good to be exposed to topics across stereotyping that rarely get due coverage. There was a strong focus on social psychological approaches too, so this course is a good primer for neuroscientists looking to get a good intro to social psych.",
    "This course has been immensely helpful in my research."
