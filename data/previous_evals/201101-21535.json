    "This will not be the best math class you've ever taken. I definitely learned new Calculus and enjoyed getting a refresher on stuff I'd learned in high school, but my teacher was not good at explaining the material and I had a very hard time learning it in class.",
    "Don't take it unless you want to eventually take better, higher level math classes. You can teach yourself the material and will be more fulfilled than if you take the class. If you love math, try to place into a higher level class which will be taught better. If you hate math, do not take this class--take something else to fulfill your QR. To summarize, I was disappointed and wish that Yale had a better math program.",
    "Personally, I would have rather have shot myself in the foot. Forcing myself to go to this class was an internal struggle three times a week. Do not take it with Di Brino, while he tries hard, he does not teach well.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless it is necessary for your major or for your premed requirements.",
    "Terrible course, although it depends a lot on your TA. Look at online evaluations-- if you get stuck with a bad TA, you'll end up teaching yourself most of the material. Gennaro di Brino, while a likable guy, seemed unable to put concepts into context, leaving me confused at the end of many classes.",
    "A pretty well run course, problem sets and tests not to bad... don't take it with Gennaro di Brino if he's teaching it, Michael Triniecky did one of our review sessions, and he is phenomenal.",
    "Math 115 (applications of integration and series) is not the best. Your TA matters, I wouldn't recommend Di Brino. I also wouldn't recommend taking this class because the psets may be easier, but the tests are alot harder and those are what count. If you do have to take this class, go to review sessions and read the book.",
    "Absolutely not! Take MATH 118 instead."
