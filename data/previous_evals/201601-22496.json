   "comments": [
    "It's definitely a great course, especially for those who want to get to know more about biophysics fields. Homework could make you more familiarize with new concepts, which is great practice.",
    "I would not recommend this course, more trouble than it was worth, in my opinion.",
    "This course teaches you how to think about and simulate physics at the molecular level. I would recommend it to other students studying mechanics and\/or physics.",
    "Great intro course on Biophysics with a clear focus on the physics. Would recommend.",
    "Not a particularly difficult class, homework assignments are often more educational than lectures (and they're really good homeworks, especially as the semester goes on), and it's important material for any biologist with quantitative leanings. I particularly want to note that the co-teacher (Wendell) and TA (Qikai) involved in this class were extremely generous with their time, and they're a terrific and necessary resource.",
    "Cool stuff. You should do it if you are already comfortable with MATLAB",
    "This is a great class for learning MATLAB, but the lecture and the match part is a little bit hard and not very well organized.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "If you know something about matlab, they will tell you how to use it for simulation. It is pretty cool.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are required to do programming in their research, because it gives you practice with different techniques and different types of problems. I found the programming aspect more useful and interesting than the lectures.",
    "I would summarize it as classical physics applied to different biological systems, with an emphasis on modeling these systems in Matlab. I would definitely recommend it to another student because the range of material is very interesting and is broadly applicable, the gained coding experience is invaluable, and it isn't extremely difficult in terms of time commitment.",
    "I would recommend this course because you learn a lot of matlab programming skills and get exposure to modelling in biology.",
    "I would not because it was a class that was difficult to relate what was learned in the lectures directly to the homework assignments.",
    "PHYS 523 is a class that teaches you how to use computational methods to answer biological questions. It isn't an overview of biophysics, but the topics you do cover are fun and instructive.",
    "If that student is very familiar with MATLAB coding, then I would suggest it. The homework and the lectures felt so disconnected at times, that going to the class after a while was almost unnecessary. I learned most from doing the homework, not necessarily from attending lecture. Also, they say in the beginning that MATLAB experience is not necessary for this class, but in my opinion that is a huge lie, it is necessary.",
    "I would high recommend this course to students who are interested in computational study of biosystems."

   "comments": [
    "The skills I learned in this course may help me in my research, there is probably a 25% chance it was worth taking to help with what I am studying specifically. Regardless, I liked the course.",
    "Great applications of the concepts learnt in thermodynamics to biology.",
    "I learned a lot about how to use MATLAB to do math modeling, but I wish to understand the math taught in the class better.",
    "Simulation is an important part of computational biology.",
    "I do research in biophysics, but nothing related to cell biology, so the lecture material wasn't relevant to anything I'm doing in lab. However, some of the mathematical and computational techniques will be helpful for me to know and to have had exposure to.",
    "Lots of exposure to modelling\/simulating in biology that I didn't have before. I will use my matlab knowledge in lab.",
    "I gained knowledge about specific models that people use in biophysics, such as the Viscek model and the vertex model, which could be directly useful in my research.",
    "To me, this course provided a very special way towards the bio-topics. It starts with the problem we want to tackle, and offers various useful tools along with the knowledge. It's a completely different way of teaching comparing with the other knowledge-based courses. It makes me feel easier to actually use the formulas instead of just staring at them. Also, learning matlab is a good contribution to my research in future."
