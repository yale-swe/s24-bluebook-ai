   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend the class if the student did not have a strong background in economics (like myself). For someone who has studied econ in more depth this class would probably be quite easy.",
    "As included in my answer to Question 1, it would be very useful to take this course to gain a strong background in microeconomics both in theoretical and empirical terms.",
    "The class provides a good overview of microeconomics without getting too technical or overly simplistic. I feel however that the course has the potential to improve by increasing its pase and focusing on covering more of the material in class.",
    "If you need a basic econ class, yes.",
    "If you need to meet the requirement and don't care to understand as an economist might the detailed principles underlying basic micro-economic concepts, this course is for you. I would not recommend the course beyond the previous statement. I'd be clear that it is not a thriller course, but a refresher course for all who've taken undergrad microeconomics.",
    "This class is a good foundations economics class, ideal for anyone inexperienced in the field of economics who would like to learn how these basic concepts relate to the field of international relations. This is not a good class for expeienced economics students.I would recommend this class for first year IR students who have limited econ experience."

    "The fact that we were able to choose what we wrote our papers on was incredibly helpful. I was able to understand particular issues in my field (e.g. weapons build-up in Israel\/Palestine) in a different context from what I would usually look at. This was helpful.",
    "It solidified economic concepts and built upon them.",
    "Minimally, beyond what I had learned completing admission requirements for the program."
