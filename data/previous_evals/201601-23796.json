   "comments": [
    "There is something for everyone in this class. Professor Jiang is an excellent, engaged lecturer. That being said, the problem sets can be intense at times, so be aware of this. I enjoyed the class.",
    "Great class. Exciting opportunity to learn about quantum computation\/information from a great professor with impressive breadth and depth of knowledge. If you're interested in the field and have solid foundations in quantum mechanics, 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Great class!! Put in the effort, and you'll be amazed at how much you know by the end of it. No need to know any computer science in advance - you'll pick it up as you go along.",
    "not too bad of a class. Bi-weekly problem sets with a final presentation constitute your grades. The grading on the problem sets seemed quite arbitrary, and often times the hardest part of doing the problems was figuring out what the question was actually asking you to do. I feel like I learned a lot and simultaneously understand nothing after taking this class",
    "This was a good course to take if you have a decent background in quantum and are interested in the topic. It is definitely accessible to undergrads who have taken 440 and 441. Very cool, emerging field and great professor! I really appreciated Liang's philosophy that our goal was to learn, not to be stressed out by assignments. So we had an instructive problem set every two weeks, and a final presentation at the end.",
    "PHYS 601 is an accessible introduction to quantum information. It will be easiest to digest if you have a solid background in quantum physics, but may not be prohibitively difficult for students with other backgrounds. The workload is not too heavy. Problem sets are reasonably challenging but not too long or frequent.",
    "This is a fantastic introductory course on theoretical quantum computing, perfect for interested students who have never studied the subject in great depth. It covers almost all of Mermin and a good chunk of Nielson and Chuang. Professor Jiang is also a great lecturer, as he teaches with just the right balance of rigor and intuition. This class was definitely worth going to at 9am.",
    "A thorough but challenging introduction to a large, quickly-changing field. Professor Jiang is an average-to-good lecturer, and gives a decent motivation for the nitty-gritty detailed proofs that occupy much of the course. As a senior undergraduate, I felt adequately prepared with a bit of extra review, but would definitely recommend having a study group as the psets were VERY hard. The structure of the course (one pset every two weeks, final presentation, no exams) was low-stress most of the time, but led to some brutal nights leading up to the due dates. Professor Jiang is a nice, reasonable person when you need to interact with him outside of lecture."

   "comments": [
    "This course was exactly what I wanted.",
    "This course was directly relevant to a subfield of physics that I am interested in, and helped me decide if it is a topic that I want to pursue further. It also gave me the background necessary to be able to pursue research in the area.",
    "I learned a lot about a topic that, while not directly relevant to my current research, may have applications down the road. I'm glad I took this course.",
    "Even though I have studied theoretical quantum computing in the past, this class was still able to enhance my understanding of specific parts of the subject. In addition, because the class covered such a wide breadth of material, I feel like I have a better understanding of the field as a whole.",
    "Quantum Computing is a hot field, and I wanted to get an introduction to it before entering grad school. The course convinced me that I do NOT want to do my PhD in the area, which is actually extremely helpful. Anyway, it's nice to have a handle on what all the buzz is about and have some breadth as a physicist."
