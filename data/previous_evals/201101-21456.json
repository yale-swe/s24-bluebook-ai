    "classic spanish",
    "No, unless you have to have it for distribution. There are much easier languages, don't take Spanish unless you really want to.",
    "more spanish! you like it or you dont.",
    "If you have to take it, then I guess do the best you can.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning the language and spanish culture. It was great to read spanish books and watch spanish movies to improve spanish skills. There is also a lot of discussion in class which helps better spanish skills.",
    "The course isn't very challenging, but can be very frustrating, especially for those who have a pretty good grasp of Spanish. Personally, I didn't learn anything that I hadn't learned in high school, but my speaking skills were still lacking. The course places little emphasis on speaking, which is very, very unfortunate.",
    "My Spanish class was filled with students who don't actually care about learning the language, myself included. The result is a class dominated by apathy and a desire to earn the best grade rather than learn the most Spanish. The course feels like high school, but there is little the department can do to fix this simply because repetition is needed for language learning. Take the course only if you need it for your language requirement, as I'm sure most of you do."
