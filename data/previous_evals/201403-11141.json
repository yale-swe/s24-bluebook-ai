   "comments": [
    "My summary for a fellow student: in this class we examined the various ways in which several prominent thinkers have thought about God other than as a kind of explanatory hypothesis. We then consider what the implications are, in those alternative ways of thinking about God, for how one thinks about religious faith and practice. I would (and have) absolutely recommend this class - just the right proportion of depth and breadth, immensely informative and enlightening.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. Great selection of authors and great professor.",
    "A course that I think anyone would love. What do we do with faith and what is a faithful believer according to different scholars and theologians. I would definitely recommend this course because from it I gained knowledge that I felt be actually useful in my life unlike many classes that I have taken.",
    "Half lecture, half discussion. We examine some of the most fascinating minds I have ever encountered, and you could not hope for a better guide than Gabriel. I absolutely recommend the class, both for its content and for the professor who runs it.",
    "This course was excellent. I would definitely recommend it to another student.",
    "Take it. It will change your life. To my fellow student: You need to take this course or similar courses because it will force you to rigorously examine your own life and what it is you believe. And by the end, if you took the course to heart, you will be changed. If you don't believe me, take the course. If you're not sure what I mean, take the course.",
    "A study of philosophers pushing beyond the traditional conception of the a God Hypothesis.",
    "In this class, you will be expected to read a lot, but the readings are very enjoyable and important, not only for the course but for personal enrichment. This class provides classical responses to the God Hypothesis (which treats the existence of God as a thesis that can be tested). Although some people may have trouble with this concept fundamentally, the experience of questioning God's existence is a powerful one for believers and non-believers alike. I would highly recommend this course to other students because the professor is very interesting and so is the material.",
    "\"Beyond the God Hypothesis\" looks at some of the reasons that have been offered in defense of the claim that it is deeply misguided to understand faith as a hypothesis, and God as a supernatural being whose existence is hypothesized. It also examines a series of Christian and Jewish attempts to explain what faith might be if not a hypothesis and what God might be if not an entity. I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in philosophy of religion or questions having to do with faith, salvation, or how we should live (and who *doesn't* care about that last question)? It is not only informative, but inspiring."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Something like this course should be a requirement for all Religious Studies departments and Divinity schools. Exactly the kind of thing I was looking forward to when I decided to pursue the academic study of religion and the philosophy of religion. I have a hard time imagining this class not having a very considerable impact not only on my dissertation, but on every paper I write from here on in, on the topic of religion. I wish I'd taken it in my first year - it offers such a great foundation to build upon; such a variety of possible topics of future research. Just great.",
    "I am a MAR.c. Philosophy of Religion student. I came to this school with Kant as my primary research interest. This course has shown me a legacy of thinkers who engaged in the same problem which Kant discovered in the wake of his 1st Critique, but they all arrived at different answers and, at points, felt the need to refine their questions. This class was a vital component of my intellectual development.",
    "Dr. Citron provided an excellent entry-point into the worlds of Jewish Thought, the Protestant Liberal Tradition, and the Philosophy of Religion more broadly. I learned much through him about all three of these areas, which more than fulfilled my reasons for taking this course.",
    "I feel more certain than ever regarding what I am about as a human being. And that is more precious to me that any amount of help this course contributed to my knowledge of my discipline or my own research. We need more men and women like Gabriel Citron to teach at Yale. And lastly, question 6 is legit, but isn't Yale in the business of transforming people? Why not ask a question regarding how we have changed as human-beings as a result of taking this course?",
    "Professor Citron helped me fall in love with this subject matter and taught me a breadth and depth of information.",
    "Each of the readings provided sufficient material to reflect on my potential dissertations\/research, and changed it in some small ways. Kant is someone I plan on reading much more thoroughly in the future. Lastly, the readings illuminated several ways of thinking about God I had previously not considered, but fundamentally change what the term \"God\" means. This opened a new line of criticism for the God hypothesis I plan on using in the future.",
    "My research and teaching concerns a number of topics related to - but not identical with - the central topics discussed in this course, so this course was invaluable with respect to both broadening my knowledge of my field and inspiring deeper thinking about the topics about which I am most interested. I am very grateful to have had to opportunity to be a part of this course, and hope to incorporate what I have learned into my research and teaching over the next few years and beyond. Thank you, Gabriel!"
