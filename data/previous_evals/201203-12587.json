   "comments": [
    "Definitely take Cold War if you get the chance. A great review of world history in the second half of the 20th century. Helps explain current political dynamics and pop culture as well.",
    "Good, interesting lecture. Take it.",
    "Yes! I think every Yale student should be required to take this class. However, keep in mind that there's a LOT OF READING to do each class. The reading assignments are not really necessary for the exam, but they are necessary to participate in the discussion sections.",
    "This class is an overview of the Cold War. There is a lot of reading, but you don't need to do all of it. One paper and two tests. The lectures are definitely worthwhile.",
    "It's a great history course. Don't be expecting any miracles though. (I recommend cr\/d\/f)",
    "It's an interesting course, but I am SO glad I took it Credit-D because there is a TON of reading and the exams are graded pretty harshly. Topics are cool and it's an important part of world history, so I do think other students should take this course in that sense. Also, Gaddis is one of the best professors I've had- it would be fair to take the course simply to listen to him.",
    "would absolutely recommend. even as a non-history major",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Great class. One fo the famous classes of yale for a reason. And decently easy to boot.",
    "History 261 is an excellent class, both for majors intending to develop perspective on the cold war and how to approach history and for others looking for an informative and enjoyable humanities credit.",
    "This is an excellent class, and I'm genuinely sad to be over with it. The workload is very manageable. There's a lot of assigned reading, but most of it is interesting and very little is essential for success in the class, so it's not too bad no matter what you decide to do with it.I absolutely recommend this class, and I feel like it would be a shame to graduate without having taken it. Gaddis is one of the world's best Cold War historians, and the lectures are magnificent.",
    "You know pretty much exactly what you're getting with this course. I highly recommend it.",
    "Phenomenal class. I have really nothing to even attempt to complain about - I was legitimately sad to see it go on the last day of class. The class is perfectly timed to pace out the whole Cold War within a semester, and has a nice mix of pure historical fact and Professor Gaddis' lighthearted quirkiness (I remember a lot about Mao Zedong but most clearly his obsession with swimming.) I know I join the ranks of hundreds of cliche Yalies in saying this, but as an International Security concentration in Political Science, this lecture course was one of the best taught courses I've been in in my three years at Yale. Couldn't say enough nice things about it.",
    "This course covers its title, the cold war, but it goes deep in detail. I would recommend this course to a fellow student because the cold war tensions are still prevalent in our society and international relations today.",
    "Yes. Cold War is a great class if you want to learn about 20th century history and I would urge other students to take the class even if they are not interested in majoring in history",
    "I would recommend that every student take Cold War before they graduate. They have the opportunity to learn from an authority in the field.",
    "YES. TAKE THIS COURSE. lectures are very fun to attend--you will regret not taking this course.",
    "Yes, it is a nice class on the cold war.",
    "From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, Gaddis reigns supreme.",
    "like going to class and having story time every time",
    "A must-take. Prof. Gaddis is simply a boss - he's one of the leading experts on the Cold War, and it shows. Every one of his lectures is perfectly crafted and fascinating. There is an incredible amount of information to learn, which can seem very overwhelming (especially as exams approach), and the readings can be very dry. But this is, by any standards, a classic Yale course - you absolutely have to take it before you graduate!",
    "This course is a quintessential Yale course for a reason. Gaddis' lectures are excellent, and the material covered is very fascinating. It had no relation to my major whatsoever, but I took it out of sheer interest in the subject matter and am glad I did so. I think my enjoyment of the class was helped out by the fact that I really liked my TA also--not everyone had as understanding and coola TA. Don't take it if you hate film clips, as about 25-40% of each lecture seems to be comprised of watching clips from TV series about the Cold War, but otherwise I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Cold War was a great class. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student because it was very educational and informative. I knew almost nothing about the Cold War before this, and now I have learned so much more about it. It definitely lives up to its reputation of being one of the best courses at Yale.",
    "Take the class! I'm not sure if it is going to be offered soon again, but when it is, take it!",
    "This class was rather mediocre for me and was the only course I have ever skipped more than a few classes of. Prof Gaddis is great, but he plays video clips for a huge portion of class, so it is easy to lose focus and half the time you think you could be watching the clips on your own time. I would only recommend it to another student if she\/he has a natural interest in the Cold War, and is not just taking the course because Prof Gaddis is teaching it. The latter is why I took the course, and I was pretty disappointed.",
    "Cold War is an awesome class, my favorite so far. The history is so recent and rich and still relevant, and Gaddis truly is an expert in the field. Lecture is always interesting.",
    "This class is AMAZING. I really enjoyed learning about history that was so recent and so aptly shaped the world as we know it today. Before this class, I did not really grasp the reach of the Cold War upon my life today. Additionally, Professor Gaddis is awesome. I genuinely enjoyed class and looked forward to the lecture every time. The use of video was incredible as well. It was a very dynamic and interesting class.",
    "This is a tremendous lecture. An absolute pleasure for all kinds of students, history major (like me) or not. Gaddis is a maestro and the plot lines are exhilarating, important, and disgusting all at once. Gotta take it.",
    "A comprehensive overview of the Cold War. You don't dive deep into any particular topic except the one you write your paper on, but you learn all the essential pieces of knowledge that one needs to know about one of the most important periods in modern history.",
    "Definitely! One of the best classes at Yale, no question about it! There is a lot of reading but it isnt all necessary to be able to participate in section and do well in the class.",
    "Survey of the cold war (a little bit neo-con biased)",
    "One of the best courses at Yale. Gaddis is a rockstar. The lectures are just the right amount of media and lecturing to keep you engaged. The material is interesting. The reading load looks a little scary but if you skim the other books and really read Gaddis' book you will be just fine. Last day of class everyone in that lecture hall stood up and applauded for a solid minute and a half. If that doesn't convince you, I don't know what will.",
    "Yes.",
    "Gaddis relies on documentaries a little heavily - just play black ops and you'll find out everything you need to know about the cold war",
    "Informative, fun, and the books are great. Take it!",
    "The Cold War is a huge and interesting topic, and this class makes it even more interesting to study. It has a lot of reading, and it is very helpful to do it before class. Do not miss the lectures, they are dynamic and interesting. Professor Gaddis' way of thinking is quite interesting and very well explained during lecture.",
    "Gaddis is THE MAN. Great teacher and great class - take it.",
    "Covers the cold war from 1940-1991. It is a fantastically interesting course, and the work load is not too much. Weekly readings are assigned, but if you attend lecture regularly, readings are not necessary, more so a complimentary thing. Highly recommended with Professor John Gaddis.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the cold war. Gaddis is an amazing professor and really gives you a comprehensive account of the cold war including all of the major players and the differing viewpoints.",
    "Honestly, while Prof. Gaddis' lectures were great, a huge portion were parts from the CNN documentary series on the Cold War. I feel like I should have spent the credit on something else that I can only learn at Yale. Everything was already on film, and while that did make the course more enjoyable\/interesting the course was basically a condensed summary of the documentary, which makes sense since Gaddis had a pretty big part in creating it. Every lecture pretty much corresponded to 1 episode, in order from 1 to 24. I took it because I heard great things about it, how it's one of the \"must takes\" of Yale, but if you're really interested in the subject just download the documentary, that's basically the entire course.",
    "It's a good class to take. Very relevant to the world today. Fair amount of reading, but a pleasure.",
    "cool class. people will shit on the videos, but i thought they were interesting and informative! you should take it",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! Doesn't matter what major you are, it is THE best course at Yale.",
    "Must-take. The assigned reading is burdensome, but it isn't necessary to do it all and still do great in the course. Do it for Gaddis, if nothing else, but the knowledge you gain in this class in really critical to understanding today's global political climate.",
    "It's a shame that this was probably the last time this class was taught, seeing as Gaddis is going on sabbatical. Even if the course itself is offered again, it will definitely be different without Gaddis. That being said, if you're at all interested in 20th century history (American or otherwise), this class is amazing and fairly straightforward.",
    "Yeah but no.",
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class. It is a great history course, but in general, any student with any background could take this course, enjoy it, and take away many things.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student, even one who typically doesn't like history classes. Lectures were interesting and the writing wasn't enough to turn off anyone who is paper-averse.",
    "Yes. Take it. It's a bit over-hyped, but still a good class.",
    "I would summarize it as a comprehensive and valuable overview of the Cold War era. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I say definitely take this class.",
    "Don't take it unless you like learning things you could read on wikipedia. Didn't change the way I \"think\", it was only a memorization class.",
    "Take this class. The workload isn't bad and Gaddis is awesome.",
    "Really good class. I would recommend it to everyone, history major and non-history major alike.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IT'S PERFECT.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, if it's still offered!",
    "Must take at Yale. Take it asap before Gaddis retires. There gotta be something in this complex time period that catches your heart.",
    "FANTASTIC. If you are looking for a really good lecture class to fill your schedule, look no further... Gaddis is AMAZING -- hilarious, so interesting, material is so relevant. Work is manageable -- just a short paper and a nice midterm and final. Section leaders are really well prepared, but be prepared to actually contribute. Readings are super enjoyable, especially Gaddis's book. But the best part is the lecture...",
    "Take this class! It is a once in a lifetime opportunity.",
    "Definitely take it!",
    "Yes, absolutely take no matter what.",
    "The Cold War is a must take, even if you are not a history major. It's so good!",
    "The History of the Cold War has been my favorite class that I've take so far at Yale. Professor Gaddis is a legend. He's got a great sense of humor that kind of puts the absurdity of certain actions of leaders of the Cold War into perspective. I've learned so much from this class and was always interested to know more about certain events. The course load isn't bad at all - there are a decent amount of readings with a reading response for section, but the readings are generally all pretty interesting. It's definitely in your best interest to stay on top of the readings, though, as the class moves fast and Gaddis can't cover EVERYTHING that happens in lecture. He's not offering it next year, but take it if you can!! I'd recommend it to anyone interested in current American and international politics or history.",
    "Of course I would! It's a wonderful course about a fascinating topic. Gaddis is a legend and you should be so lucky to be able to learn from one of the experts. Gaddis is particularly interesting to learn from because he has, well, very strong viewpoints. This is not a bad thing necessarily. I certainly don't agree with all his points, but it's so important to learn through different lenses at some points, especially when Gaddis wrote the book on the Cold War (actually, many books). But I think because of Gaddis Bias we overlooked some important aspects of the Cold War. For example, we did not talk the Iran-Contra affair even once. It was in one name-drop in one reading. I don't bring it up to be unnecessarily inflammatory, to say \"look, not everything Reagan did was perfect!\" But it's a very important moment. It involves two places we study - Iran and Nicaragua - and it's significant to show the extent to which the US wanted to undermine communism in Latin America, going so far as to illegally sell arms to Iran, with whom we havean arms embargo because, oh yeah, a few years prior they had taken our embassy hostage! Omitting this from our learning is negligent. So to sum, Gaddis is wonderful in the way he presents material, his book is accessible and actually fun to read, but go into the class knowing that you are getting a lot of the story but not all of it. Make sure to maintain your own views, too, and know you don't cover all the material, even the relevant material.",
    "It's a decent course.",
    "Take it. Gaddis is amazing, and makes the material super interesting. One of my favorite classes I've ever taken.",
    "Enjoy the story.",
    "Great class- definitely take if you want a more thorough understanding of the Cold War time periods. You go through it all. I feel much more confident about my knowledge of US history. It is actually a fun class as the material is interesting.",
    "Learn about everything that brought the US to where it is today. Take it. Gaddis is a legend.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Absolutely take it. So cool to take a class from someone like Gaddis. Lectures are actually interesting and most of the readings are good too.",
    "YES. Take it. ID's are difficult on the exam though so study a lot.",
    "Cold War was an amazing class. You will learn a tremendous amount and be entertained the whole time.",
    "A survey course on the Cold War with a focus on the big personalities (eg., Stalin, Mao, Reagan, etc.) Pros: I knew very little about the Cold War going in, and can say that I know much more now. Also, there's barely any work: a short paper, a midterm, and a final (reading is essentially optional). Cons: As a history major, I often found myself wishing the class were more rigorous. I felt that lectures and section discussions oversimplified Cold War events, while the most compelling debates and questions were only briefly touched upon. Note: you're definitely getting one man's view of history. Granted, he is perhaps the most well-known scholar on the Cold War, but there are other interpretations and you're not going to hear them in this class.",
    "Cold War isn't being offered next term, but if you ever get the chance--take it. It's one of those must-takes at Yale, and frankly, I can see why. He may use a lot of videos in his lectures, but they're integrated well! Be wary on the final. There's always something ridiculous in terms of IDs.",
    "The Cold War was a very good course. Professor Gaddis does a great job teaching students about the events of the Cold War, and their causes, connections, and how they were affected by domestic and political leaders and events. The course uses a lot of video material from the CNN documentary, which can be quite frustrating. However, there were a handful of lectures in the course that were the best lectures I have ever been to. The class was rather easy. I attendedevery lecture and took very close notes, and studied hard for both the midterm and the final. But that's all - I managed to do (I assume) quite well in the course without buying or reading any of the assigned books. This class is very reasonable if you are taking it for a grade, and an absolutely phenomenal class to take Credit\/D. Make sure to get a good TA for the course, and you'll have a great experience.",
    "Cold War is a high quality must-take history lecture that DOES in fact live up to the \"hype.\" The lectures are 75 minutes but do not drag on because Gaddis adeptly integrates documentary content into the lectures. UNderstanding the nature of the Cold War is integral to understanding world affairs today, and I feel like a much more informed and engaged observer of international relations after taking this class. THat being said, realize that it is not a gut and you can't skate by on the exams. The IDs on the final were exasperatingly obscure and made the hours I spent studying seem futile, so unfortunately I left the class with a bitter taste in my mouth. Overall though, I think Rihanna said it best when she said \"I hate that I love you,\" Gaddis. A truly wonderful class with a preeminent scholar who is simultaneously the leader in the field and able to engage with undergraduates meaningfully.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. If he were a history major, it's a good course to take to fulfill requirements, and the history of the Cold War is just really interesting.",
    "Great course! Be aware that doing really well in this class takes concentrated effort and the exams can be tricky.",
    "If there was one class I don't regret taking in my time at Yale, it is Cold War.",
    "Absolutely take this class. John Gaddis is a once in a lifetime lecturer on this material.",
    "The Cold War is a great survey class. I do feel as if most Yale students should take it, and the workload is relatively light throughout the semester, with only a midterm, a paper, and a final.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Not only is it very interesting, but Gaddis is an incredible lecturer.",
    "I would recommend Cold War if it's with Prof. Gaddis. He's a great professor who obviously knows the material well, but he's also just funny and personable. Make sure to grab a meal with him and friends!",
    "Pretty easy history course. Sometimes heavy reading, but you definitely do not have to do it all. Lots of time spent watching documentary clips in lecture rather than listening to Gaddis. Do not take it if that will annoy you. Otherwise, summary of a very important time period to understanding the modern world!",
    "Yes. Because it is fantastic.",
    "It is exactly as its billed. You will learn the history of the cold war from 45-91",
    "Yes. Such a interesting coarse on a very presently revalent subject.",
    "Gaddis' Cold War is one of those must-take Yale lectures. You learn about such an important war that took up most of the 20th century. Gaddis is a great lecturer, and the books are interesting too. It's a very straightforward intro history course in terms of workload (paper, midterm, final) and section can be fun. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would say that Cold War is a class that everyone should take while at Yale. The subject matter is extremely interesting and is taught by the best possible candidate. Best class I've taken so far.",
    "Don't believe the hype: this is a very easy survey lecture that covers a very huge topic in a very shallow way. Gaddis, for as famous as he is, is not a very good lecturer, and he focuses a lot more on events and people than on larger historical processes. The tone of the lectures and readings is more triumphalist than critical, which gets annoying. It's an easy A, but if you are looking for a thought-provoking and challenging history lecture, this isn't it. You'd probably be better off taking a class with Beverley Gage, Jennifer Klein, Timothy Snyder, or Douglas Rogers if you want to know about how the Cold War played out in the US and Eastern Europe, and not just what different leaders thought about nuclear weapons.",
    "Yes! Gaddis is a legend, and fairly so. This class is a classic history lecture. Material is fun, and incredibly relevant to our lives!!",
    "Must take for anyone really. It's not life changing, but it's gotta be one of the best classes at Yale. It's also fun to be in a class with so many friends. You all learn together.",
    "Cold War is definitely a great class, but it is a little overrated",
    "The history of the world during the cold war. It's a lot of time to cover, but it's interesting and worth taking.",
    "Yes, it is a great course given by a great professor, worth taking.",
    "Just take it ok?!",
    "sad gaddis won't be here to teach it, I really loved this class. but be aware a lot of athletic teams take it which can be annoying.",
    "It's an incredible class, take it at some point in your Yale career even if it's credit\/D\/fail",
    "Everything you every needed or wanted to know about the Cold War. Great course.",
    "Must-take. This is a course that everyone at Yale should take at some point.",
    "For anyone who is at all interested in the Cold War, this class provides you with a comprehensive understanding of the era, and really altered the way in which I view the 20th century for America and for the world. There is a lot of reading, but Gaddis's book in particular is intriguing, and I found lectures to be interesting.",
    "Great course. A little over-hyped (it is a huge lecture course, a lot of reliance on video, and the quality of your TA is crucial), but an amazing class for anyone even remotely interested in the Cold War.",
    "Definitely enjoyed taking this course. The lectures can be very long at times though the use of video keeps them interesting. Much of the reading seems unnecessary and you can definitely get by without doing all of it. However, the conflict itself is absolutely fascinating and for this reason alone it's definitely still worth taking the course. Be prepared for some ridiculously obscure ID's on the midterm and final.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Significant history presented in a interesting way.",
    "Only take this class if you want to sit in SSS and spend 70% of your time watching a documentary (available on YouTube) and 30% of your time being exposed to right-wing bias about St. Reagan.",
    "Take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to my peers. I'm sure tons of people have said this before, but Cold War is a must-take class at Yale even if you don't agree with Gaddis' take on history; you'll find that most people (even the TFs) don't agree with him either. The material is interesting and it's not very much work overall (make sure you do all the readings), but the TFs grade harshly.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to another student. It earns its title as one of Yale's \"legendary classes\". Professor Gaddis is a fantastic lecturer who uses a lot of videos while teaching. They are not boring at all and he uses them masterfully. He's also really funny in lectures which people enjoy; this is the only class I've ever seenwhen the professor gets a standing ovation after every class. The work is extremely manageable, you'll have about 200 pages of reading a week. Assignments wise you only have 1 research paper (10 pages) to do which you get all semester to do. The exams aren't too bad and they are graded very fairly. All of the TA's are very good and helpful, they host many review sessions during exam time. By the time this class is over you'll have a whole new perspective on 20th century history. I didn't want the class to end",
    "Yes- a great summary of the history of the later half of the 20th century.",
    "It's a great class! Lots of reading, but in terms of assignments, it's just a midterm, a paper, and a final. Totally doable! And if you're interested in the subject matter like I was, then you should definitely take it. Cold War history is something every college student should learn about.",
    "If you're interested in Cold War history, you'll learn a lot. Otherwise, you could learn the material just as well from watching Gaddis's videos or simply reading his book. Not as great as it's worked up to be.",
    "Yes, it was a really great class.",
    "I would recommend this class. I am a science major, and this was the first history class I took at Yale. Professor Gaddis is very engaging, and the readings--if you do them--are extremely manageable. The midterm and essay are fairly early in the course, making the workload easier when other classes rev up later in the semester.",
    "This course is a must take.",
    "I would, it s Yale must!",
    "Not sure if Gaddis will return after his sabbatical, but if he does, then definitely take this class. There are some tricky IDs on the midterm and final, but otherwise the exams aren't too hard, and neither is the paper. You get to listen to fantastic lectures and while the reading is great, you can getaway without doing much of it and still do ok in the class.",
    "Take this class!",
    "If you're into history and want to learn about the Cold War or from Gaddis, take the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Cold War to fellow students, it's a MUST TAKE CLASS AT YALE! It is a lot of reading though.",
    "Definitely take this class. Gaddis is a phenomenal lecturer and he presents the information in an interesting and manageable way. There is not too much work - only a paper and midterm\/final",
    "This class covers the time period of the Cold War through lectures and video clips. Professor Gaddis put a great deal of time into each of his lectures and each one was engaging and well presented. The material is awesome and the class was the best I have taken thus far at Yale. It was not a lot of work - the paper is what you make of it and the midterm and final were straightforward.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it is not only a Yale staple, but it really is oneof the most well orchestrated classes I have taken at Yale. The work load is not very heavy, but there is a lot of information that must be retained and demonstrated in order to do well on exams and on the paper.",
    "Take it. It's important, and relates to pretty much everything else. No need to do the reading, but the final's IDs will be utterly random and out of the blue, so don't expect to do well on those.",
    "I would recommend the course.",
    "Absolutely take it. You will learn an incredible amount about the conflict that shaped the modern world in the years before we were born. Gaddis is legend, with good reason. Go to lectures and do all of the reading if you really want to learn. If not, you can still scrape by but the learning is so much more valuable than the grade. Don't pass it up.",
    "Definitely recommend, just beware the ID's on exams.",
    "A brief history of the latter half of the 20th century. Necessary information.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone.",
    "A classic Yale course and everyone should take it at some point.",
    "This course is EXTREMELY OVERRATED!!Do NOT take this class if you are solely taking it because of its positive reviews and not because you are interested in the subject.I thought this course was good. The material was interesting, the class was insightful and the professor is extremely knowledgeable. Although it is unquestionable that the professor is an expert in the field though, I did not find his lectures to be anything extraordinary and I thought they included too many documentary clips (which may or may not be your style).I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in history or the Cold War but not necessarily to a student who is just interested in taking the course for the professor or for the course's reviews.",
    "Overall it is a very interesting lecture and informative class. Gaddis is a great lecturer but does use the move a little too often. If you can take this class before you graduate you should.",
    "Definitely. One of the best courses at Yale, if not the best. Gaddis is delightful and the material is great. TAKE IT",
    "Absolutely. Gaddis is brilliant. A true expert. Always engaging. Too much video though. The books weren't nearly as fulfilling as the professor.",
    "IT IS SO GOOD. It's a classic for a reason. I had never taken a history class in college before this one, and I don't regret it for a bit. Professor Gaddis is famous in his field, and the fact that he has had so much personal contact with the great players of the Cold War gives lectures that extra spark. The course is beautifully designed and put together, he has it down to a science, timed to the minute. I really can't praise this course enough, and I wish Professor Gaddis could teach this class forever and ever.The only complaint I might have is the grading structure with sections. What grade you get is 100% dependent on which TA you get. Maybe because I had the head TA, she was especially strict and had a long list\/rubric by which she graded our work to the point where going to section was stressful (she had all these criteria about how you could earn the participation grade in section), and she openly told me that I would've gotten a lower grade in the midterm had she graded it (she had too many and so another TA graded my midterm). I know my final grade won't be as good because of that.",
    "MUST TAKE. period.",
    "An amazing course. Definitely take it, decent amount of work but the subject matter, professor, and strong TAs make this class a must!",
    "Fabulous lecture which examines the Cold War from start to finish as it occurred all over the world. Looks at both the international and domestic stage in all the major countries involved. Focus onindividual leaders in addition to central events and conflicts. Professor Gaddis is wonderful and the class is a great joy to take.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Cold War to another student! Why? Cause it is the best!",
    "This is most definitely a course to take whilst at Yale. Professor Gaddis' sense of humour makes lectures interesting and engaging and it is a great privilege to take a course with one who is such an authority in the study of the Cold War. Readings are long but their detail is informative and rewarding.",
    "Great survey, but not so much for experienced poli sci students",
    "History 261 is an excellent course and it really gives an excellent broad representation of the Cold War. It doesn't just focus on events in Europe, but also on those around the world including the third world. The course talks about all the factors involved in time period and really provided me with a great view of the Cold War. John Lewis Gaddis is an excellent lecturer and presents the material well.",
    "Take the Cold War. It's a Yale institution for a reason, and that reason is that its a great course. The reading is great, the lectures are great, and Gaddis is great.",
    "Take it! Professor Gaddis is awesome, the documentary that he helped make and uses is incredible, and lectures don't get much better than this.",
    "Yes, I absolutely recommend. It's one of the classic Yale courses that every Yale student must try to take.",
    "Great class! I came in with very little knowledge of history and enjoyed this class very much. The lectures are heavily dependent on video segments, but the videos are very well-done, and Gaddis supplements them with his own interesting experiences and provocative questions.",
    "Not the must take that everyone said it was.",
    "This course was incredibly interesting, although I would recommend taking the class Credit\/D as there were far too many readings to stayon top of them all. Due to the fact that the Cold War covers quite a bit of time, you'll learn a lot about world history in en enjoyable manner.",
    "Fantastic! Take it! Gaddis is absolutely wonderful. In addition to the facts, he has lots of really cool anecdotes that personalize the material. There's a reason he's one of the most respected Cold War historians in the world.",
    "The Cold War is just one of those classes you have to take. Gaddis is a legend, and you'll learn a lot, some of which is actually applicable to the current global political situation today.",
    "This class is a great overview of the Cold War and a Yale classic. Absolutely take this class if you are at all interested in it. John Gaddis is great and it is a very interesting topic.",
    "YES! If you are a history, polisci, global affairs major, etc, you probably already know you will love this class, but I would honestly recommend this class to everyone. You learn so much about America's very recent, and very important, history, but you focus on other countries and secondary players, as well. The workload is very manageable for a history class (midterm, 5-10 page paper, and final), just so long as you accept that the reading is too much to realistically accomplish and you're ready to do some serious skimming.",
    "Cold War is a terrific class to take if you are looking for a big history survey. This course has a legendary status and I think it is well deserved. Professor Gaddis not only gives well organized and engaging lectures that demonstrate his years of experience in the field, he will also make you love lectures with the personal anecdotes and viewpoints that he adds in. My one complaint about the class is that sometimes I felt I didn't get to fully digest and discuss the material, because the course moves along pretty quickly.",
    "Awesome class, definitely take it. Don't say you're just gonna watch the documentaries instead, because you won't and you won't gain as much.",
    "The Cold War is one of the best history classes at Yale. You will learn information covering a vast geographical expanse. In lecture you will learn mostly from video, and Gaddis's commentary- which is often very similar to his book. There is a lot of reading and it certainly not an easy class, but it is very rewarding!",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. Harder and more work than you'd expect, but definitely worth it. One of those necessary \"Yale\" classes.",
    "Take it!",
    "Never thought I'd be interested in PoliSci, but this course made me so.",
    "intro to cold war with a lot of learning",
    "Take it! It's a lot of reading, but not unmanageable, and it's worth every page.",
    "I highly recommend Cold War. It's well organized, interesting, and important in understanding American culture and leaders from the 1940s to the 1990s.",
    "HIST261 is an incredibly interesting survey of the Cold War, from the end of World War II to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. I would highly recommend it to another student, with the advice to study in groups, as there are always concepts and events that certain people remember better, and thus group studying is a great way to make sure that you understand all of the material.",
    "It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all in the name; this class is a great comprehensive look at the international tensions of the second half of the 20th century. The tests aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad (essay isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t either), and the readings are interesting, though not completely necessary if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re just looking to take a fun, interesting political science\/history class.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at this school. As a science major, I really benefitted from the material because the time period is so relevant today. Gaddis has a great sense of humor, and I always left his lectures feeling like I learned something profound. That being said, if you don't have a great background in history you'll have to really keep up with the readings."
