    "This class is absolutely a great class, both for beginners and for who has some experience in bayesian.",
    "This is an excellent course on Bayesian statistics.Its main strengths are in both its accessibility and its depth. It starts from the very basics of Bayes' rule and all the way to the most widely used methods of Bayesian statistics - hierarchical models and relevant computational algorithms. It provides students with a comprehensive overview of Bayesian statistics, as well as hands-on experience on building and fitting models on real data. Both the homework assignments and the exams are great, in the sense that they closely correspond to the theories and skills covered in the class, and are also good practice on programming. Overall it is a truly exceptional class that is among the best classes I have taken at Yale. If I have to suggest one thing that may be considered for future offerings of this class, I would love to see slightly more time on the existing tools of Bayesian analysis (and maybe one or two homework on those) in later parts of the course.",
    "I really enjoy this course and definitely think it is a good one. It provides enough background on basic Bayesian methods and at the same time cover some application. The structure of the whole course is clear so I know exactly where each class is in the whole structure of the course. I think the course may become even better to include more examples and application. Yet overall, this is an excellent course.",
    "The course materials are very well-designed. The homeworks help me to get deep understanding of the methods taught in class. But the final project is much too time-consuming...",
    "Pace was too fast, wish there could be more examples. Wish we could meet 2 times per week for lecture so that the instructor wouldn't be trying to squeeze everything into one lecture and that he had to go over the materials really fast such that it was kind of hard to follow through. Lecture of 1 hour 50 minutes in a row was too long.",
    "Well organized. Very interesting and useful.",
    "I really liked the emphasis on building the foundation of Bayesian statistics by hand and not using software without understanding the underlying processes. Occasionally topics or comments were over my head, but that was probably just me and the homeworks and exams were very fair. I would suggest including probability theory and\/or mathematical statistics as a prerequisite for the course, and possibly including a \"homework 0\" to help students determine whether they have a sufficient background for the course. I knew several students who didn't realize they were in over their head until after the add\/drop period ended.",
    "Very good course. The instructor was nice and helpful. It would be better if the course could be more theoretical.",
    "I really got immersed in the topic and enjoyed the course a lot. The contents already proved to be useful for my work at multiple occasions.",
    "Overall, this is a very good course and I learned a lot.",
    "This course is one of the best courses I have taken here at YSPH. The instructor is very patient and gives everything in detail. Besides he tries his best to arrange office hours for students. The workload of this course is not too much, and the homework corresponds to what is taught in class.",
    "This was a good course that covered the important topics in the area."

    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Josh is an awesome and truly admirable teacher (one of the best professors I have had at Yale). He is clearly exceptionally knowledgeable in Bayesian statistics, and has a great talent for making complicated concepts and methods easy to understand (without losing any rigor or depth). His devotion to making this course as good as possible is easily seen. He carefully designed the course and the sequence of contents to be covered (which is different from many popular textbooks on this subject), with materials building upon each other in an intuitive and coherent way. His homework assignments and exams (yes I mean it) have always been enjoyable, challenging, and instructive. He also sincerely cares about his students. He always makes himself available for questions and discussions, and goes out of his way helping students in trouble. I am very grateful to be a part of this course. Thank you sooooooo much Josh!!!",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Professor Warren is definitely an excellent instructor. He prepared well and organized the course perfectly. He was also very helpful and willing to answer my questions all the time. He is also very good at assessing our performance as I feel most homework and exams are not too difficult but also challenging enough to help me.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Josh is great! It's obvious that he spent a large amount of time in developing the slides and homeworks. Also, he is so responsive and patient to students' questions.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0It would be more easy for us to follow the lecture if the instructor could write on board instead of going really fast using slides. Wish he could slow down the lecture a little bit.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0The instructor is very responsible. He is good at explaining things clearly. Also, he is willing to use the blackboard to show the examples to the students which helps the student follow the course and better understand the question.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Dr. Warren was incredibly helpful and very patient during office hours. You could tell he was invested in helping students understand and succeed in the course. The lectures were good and I appreciated the combination of slides and board work.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Nice and responsible. The class content was well prepared.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0I enjoyed Prof Warren's teaching style a lot. He is an engaging instructor and it is obvious he is passionate for the topic. Furthermore, he was always helpful with any issue arising inside or outside of the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Excellent teacher. Very clear.",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0He is a very good teacher, though he told us it is his first time teaching. He is very patient, besides very detailed in explaining problems students have raised. I have benefited a lot from his office hours, whenever you have any problem Josh is always there ready to answer your questions. He is excellent!",
    "Instructor: Joshua L. Warren \u00a0Presentation was clear, and use of notes and examples facilitated learning. It would have been helpful to have slides for the equations. It was sometimes difficult to read the board, and it was time consuming and distracting to take notes instead of listening to the key points that were being made."

   "comments": [
    "A truly exceptional introductory class to the wonderful world of Bayesian statistics. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Bayesian statistics (or statistics in general). Simply the best resource at Yale to get one started on Bayesian statistics (The stats dept also offers a class on Bayesian from time to time, but it is a topics class and much less well organized and accessible than this one)",
    "I'll definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. This course is introductory and suitable for people who are interested in Bayesian statistics or Bayesian methods but do not have extensive background in math. It provides a comprehensive background of Bayesian and may support one to learn more about more complicated Bayesian methods or applications.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to work as statisticians. Bayesian thinking is an important methodology of statistics. And this course will nicely introduce the fundamentals of Bayesian statistics.",
    "Very good course. Recommend students who have taken the statistical theory to take the course",
    "The course is a great introduction to Bayesian statistics and you get enough homework and exam practice to be able to fully complete an analysis on your own at the end of the course, which is very useful. I would *only* recommend to students with a super strong math background and coding skills in R. Just being mathematically inclined doesn't cut it here, and neither does a basic understanding of R.",
    "Very good and worthy of taking.",
    "This is a good introductory course that I would recommend to other students."
