    "An interesting window into the Baroque period, but possibly a little unfocused. I would recommend it in general.",

    "This course enabled me to better understand the colonial Baroque from a transatlantic perspective and to consider the relationship between literature and politics in the colonial context.",
    "A solid foundation of Colonial Latin American literature is fundamental to my dissertation research and future career as a Hispanist. For this reason SPAN 765 was exceedingly helpful for me. In addition, Professor Adorno's approach to studying literature helped me to understand the level of seriousness required to be a successful researcher in this field."
