   "comments": [
    "Take this class! You will not regret it! A very human way of looking at nature as opposed to one based solely on science. The articles are interesting, the professor is super engaging, the workload is very manageable, and the class changed how I look at the world. Cannot endorse highly enough!!",
    "Take this if you're willing to stomach theory and defer any conclusions--you'll come out at the other end of the looking-glass, for sure. There's a lot of reading, and the course is going to get real repetitive if you don't do it. So do it. Karen is a wonderful lecturer and a forgiving discussion leader, but--I repeat--don't let that stop you from doing the readings, or you'll have wasted the class.",
    "Everything that you can think of relating to nature and globalization. I would recommend it because the class moves at a reasonable pace and the reading is manageable. The assignments require thought and effort but they are not that frequent.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It opens up your mind to ideas you may not have contemplated before. The set up of assignments makes it easier to transition to the midterm and final. The class is over before reading period.",
    "This course takes a very anthropological approach to contemporary environmental issues resulting from the forces of globalization. The breadth of the course material is extensive and so appeals to a variety of interests.",
    "Yes if you want a manageable class that is pretty interesting but no if you want to learn exactly what is promised. The grading is extremely tough- beware!! But overall, I'm happy I took the course and I picked up a few analytical skills along the way.",
    "The title of this course is a bit deceiving, as we spent the majority of the course covering issues related primarily to globalization. The reading load wasn't too unreasonable, and the short papers worked great. However, even though I've already taken one class in the anthropology department, I had a pretty challenging time trying to understand and interpret a lot of our anthropological texts. I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in better understanding the history and processes of globalization only if they have experience in reading and understanding anthropological texts.",
    "I definitely recommend it , it makes you analyze and take consciousness about global nature problems.",
    "I would highly recommend this course--the professor is amazing, the coursework is interesting, engaging, and highly relevant, and grading is neither too strict nor too lenient."
