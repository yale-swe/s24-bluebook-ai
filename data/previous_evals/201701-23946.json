    "Alan followed his syllabus as closely as possible and was able to cover most if not all that was proposed at the beginning of the term. I do wish that more time had been allotted for the study of contemporary designs and ancient Eastern theater design (Chinese\/Japanese\/Indian\/etc) but understand the limitations of a semester-long survey course.",
    "I wish I could take this class twice!",
    "It gives a really nice overview of the way that theatre architecture has evolved in the west and also how classical influences have travelled and adapted for performance requirements over the ages. But it doesn't really touch upon how this has influenced theatre architecture in the eastern hemisphere, the why and the how."
