    "I learned a great deal about the specifics of Russian history, as well as overarching themes. I developed an ability to read dense and long historical works, including primary sources.",
    "Excellent and in depth history of early modern Russia.",
    "I learned so much about Russian (and world!) history from 800-1820.",
    "Good knowledge of russian history",
    "In this course I learned about the history of Russia from the founding of Kievan Rus to the birth of the Russian Empire. This class introduced me to an entire swath of history I had never been exposed to previously. Professor Bushkovitch' emphasis on primary documents encouraged me to engaged directly with the events covered in the class. Also, professor Bushkovitch' use of powerpoint helped me engage with Russian art and architecture. The exams and paper required that I integrate my knowledge of the material into coherent arguments. The course is well designed. The accessible pace of the class allowed me to digest information thoroughly. I never felt the need to regurgitate facts. Instead, the course demanded that I think critically about and comment on major historical trends. I appreciated this emphasis on critical thinking over unnecessary memorization. Over the course of the semester, I grew as a thinker, reader, and learner.",
    "I gained an overview of russian history to 1801"

   "comments": [
    "This is a very good class for someone looking to get a pretty detailed look into Russian history, or even someone interested in Russian literature that wants to know the background. Some of the readings were unnecessarily dense and difficult to read, in particular Martin's book. When studying for the final, I went to the library and read a bunch of summaries of Russian history. They were far easier to read, and contained a similar level of detail as the lecturing in class. It would be great if the reading could be changed in order to make it so students learn the most.",
    "The course is very straight-forward. The readings were pretty interesting, and the content is very fun.",
    "This class was exactly what history lectures at Yale can and should be: well-organized, engaging, and in-depth presentations by people who clearly know everything about the topic. I want PB to teach me all of world history. I wish the class went to 1917.",
    "Interesting material but it was sometimes lacking in variety",
    "Excellent!",
    "I was delightfully surprised by the strength of this course. I entered the class not knowing whether or not I would enjoy learning about medieval Russian history. Luckily, Professor Bushkovitch does such an excellent job of teaching the material that I left the class remarkably satisfied. The texts for the course are excellent. The required readings, even the textbooks, are engaging. Professor Bushkovitch has put a lot of thought into the course materials. Also, I found the exams very reasonable. Professor Bushkovitch is of course an excellent teacher. He has a no-nonsense style and is knowledgeable on even the most obscure issues of Russian history. At times his lectures could be slightly disorganized. He might repeat information unnecessarily or skim over what appeared to be crucial details. I would have enjoyed a more consistent pace throughout all of his lectures. Also, Professor Bushkovitch would often lecture for 45 minutes and then facilitate a discussion in the final 30 minutes of each class. These discussions sometimes dragged. I would have preferred a full 75 minute lecture or at least a more structured discussion. These are small criticisms of what was an overall solid class that I greatly enjoyed.",
    "Course is very strong, the class somewhat lacks engagement with the reading"

   "comments": [
    "Yes! It's fairly low-commitment, plus you learn a ton about Russian history.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. Bushkovitch is a really fun professor and I always enjoyed class. He is straight forward and the workload is incredibly manageable. Really great class, would recommend.",
    "Absolutely. Do you think you have no interest in the region? Take it anyway. Paul Bushkovitch is a joy and seeing him twice a week will make you a better person.",
    "Structurally speaking, this may be the best history lecture I've taken at Yale. Professor Bushkovitch fits a great lecture, as well as an interesting group discussion, into each class and eliminates the need for the chore that is section. On top of this, it's a fascinating subject. I would recommend it to any history major, and to any non-history major who is prepared to be pushed to think like a historian.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, absolutely. Ahhhh professor Bushkovitch. So knowledgeable. So capable of digesting and communicating history in a basic way to his undergraduate students. Professors of this caliber are hard to come by these days. He can answer virtually every question about the material and go on and on in more detail.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's a great class on an intriguing body of history. Professor Bushkovitch is an excellent teacher. Very fair and thoughtful. At times the course could be slightly boring. Nevertheless, the class is worth taking if you're interested in understanding how one of the most influential nations in the world came into existence. The work is manageable and the exams are straightforward. A very solid class that does nearly everything right.",
    "Very good class for anyone interested in russian history."
