   "comments": [
    "A delightful course - it gives you a deeper appreciation of music and a new mode of self-expression. Not too demanding in terms of workload, but you'll get much more out of it if you do more than what's simply required",
    "Very fun. Very interesting material, and you'll learn a lot of stuff. I would recommend this course to ANY musicians. Prof. Shimada (or Toshi) is very friendly, and a great teacher. If you can read notes in different cliffs and know the orchestral instruments, you should be fine. You'll have some time to pick up some musical ideas if you haven't learned them.",
    "Yes, very chill and relaxing while worthy of time and energy, take it!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. One of the best music classes I've taken. Toshi gives us some really great insight in conducting. What I love most about this class is that, not only do you gain practical knowledge and the confidence to stand up in front of a group of people and lead them, but it's also a pretty stress-free class. Much needed amongst the many ridiculous classes at Yale. Toshi is the star here though. He obviously really cares about students and was willing to meet up with people individually to practice, and also to discuss about grades. No exams too (the assessment is obviously ongoing though). The lab orchestra was also super fun! I absolutely loved it.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you're excited about conducting and have room for another course. Definitely take it if thre aren't too many students.",
    "If you can't read music, don't take this classToshi probably wouldn't let you anyways. It's designed for people who already have a very good idea of what is going on in music, and just want to learn to conduct it. If you want to get a real \"introduction\" to classical music, consider theory courses or 'Listening to Music.' If you're a musician and you want to be a conductor, definitely take this class. Toshi's approach is fairly quick-and-dirty but you'll learn a lot without working overly hard."
