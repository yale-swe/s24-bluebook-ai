   "comments": [
    "I learn a lot about Latin American thought, got to know new material, new theoretical approaches. The historic approach which included the 19th century was extremely valuable to understand contemporary debates. The syllabus was pluralistic and provided a lot of variety, giving us impulses of how to develop our ideas with further reading. It was really well-balanced, including Brazilian thought, Indigenous perspectives, gender perspectives and at the same time helped us to understand canonical works (texts by Bolvar, Mart etc.). This is an extremely valuable course that is very helpful for my future projects! It was really great to have a class conducted in Spanish! Therefore, I could develop my Spanish skills and debate in the language in which the texts are written.",
    "In this course, I developed an appreciation for and skills in close reading and in deciphering intellectual narrative across a broad timespan and several languages. The course gave me a comprehensive understanding of Latin America and also encouraged me to dig deeper into a number of topics which tend to be undercovered at Yale and are now influencing the direction of my future work.",
    "I developed a good perspective on Latin American thought from the beginning of the 19th century to the present. There was a good balance among the Spanish-, Portuguese-, and French-speaking regions of Latin America.",
    "Apart from an introduction into the development of Latin American Thought over the modern period, I gained greater insight into how to dissect an extensive text."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Historic approach and variety of methodological framework. Many different sorts of texts helped to sharpen our arguments and engage in a profound conversation with the material. It was a wonderful class with great colleagues and I really enjoyed all the debates where we could learn from each other. The material presented is very imporant and helps us all on the job market as we really tackled all urgent issues in the field of Latin America.",
    "This was undoubtedly one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The course attracted a range of knowledgeable students from diverse backgrounds which made class discussions enriching and engaging. The fact that it was held in Spanish facilitated discussion surrounding our texts and provided the opportunity for the class to go into greater depth on complex topics relating to Latin American intellectual and political history than would likely have been possible otherwise. The students were more engaged in the seminar than any other course I have attended at Yale.",
    "I think one of the strengths of the course was the input that we had as students. That is to say, inasmuch as possible, every week, we selected texts to present and share with the rest of the class, and also could offer input into what would be covered in subsequent weeks. I very much enjoyed the course, and have little to suggest in terms of improvement, except perhaps that it would also be great as a year-long, two-part seminar."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, because if students want to learn about Latin America, this is *the* course! It really helps to understand the nuances and different movements, providing us with theoretical skills to comprehend Latin American thought. The historic approach is great and there is really time to discuss.",
    "Absolutely. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Latin American literature and history or the history of politics and colonialism generally. I would especially recommend this course to anyone looking to place their work and interests in a broader context in Latin America since there are not many other courses available which provide the opportunity to do so.",
    "Yes",
    "I would recommend the course to other students because an understanding of the intellectual thought in Latin America over the modern period is a key aspect to understanding its literature."
