    "A basic introduction to political parties and how they have affected American politics.",
    "The course provides an understanding of the importance and utility of parties in the American political system and also some of its inherent problems.",
    "I gained an in-depth understanding of the function, causes, and possibilities of political parties in the United States. This course was heavy in theory, but I left with a better understanding of how crucial the two-party system is to American democracy. I truly feel like an expert in the subject now.",
    "A basic understanding of the politics and how the government actually operates",
    "It's a good overview of the political parties, discussing their role in elections and in government, and the relationship between the political parties and the American populous.",
    "It was interesting to learn a bit about the parties from a more detailed historical framework.",
    "Not much at all but i did learn more broadly about political parties",
    "This course talked about the ways in which political parties function in America, including the transformation of political parties and their current role in American politics. There was occasional discussion of current events, and a decent amount of technical material.",
    "This was a wonderful introduction into concepts surrounding American Political Parties and U.S. Politics as a whole.",
    "How parties worked, their history, power, etc.",
    "This class helped me talk about current things I've observed going on in our national government regarding parties (polarization, gridlock, party leaders, presidential candidates, etc.), as well as historical trends, and explain them using political theory.",
    "Good option for a little more quantitative side of political science",
    "Virtually none.",
    "I gained valuable insight into the role of political parties in U.S. government.",
    "An intro to political science and the history of parties.",
    "I developed my knowledge of the influence, roles and inner working of the political parties in the US and how they manage their members and maximise influence.",
    "Greater knowledge of the political system",
    "Hhh",
    "I learned more about the American political system and different political terminology.",
    "Gained insight into American politics, elections, the nature of parties, etc. The content was more interesting than I assumed it would be.",
    "new knowledge of the trends of the two-party system in the US",
    "How parties allow our government to function. Theories of representation, party formation, realignment, party ID, party bias and asymmetry, party reform, redistricting, how parties work in Congress, and more. Essentially a survey of the role of political parties in US government, with some limited comparison to other democracies in the world.",
    "This class was a great introduction to the American political system and how parties influence elections.",
    "I learned a lot about political parties.",
    "I gained tools with which to understand the American political system.",
    "I learned how to see historical events through the view of political science."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Well-structured, good and informative.",
    "The course is thorough in the knowledge it imparts, but it seems rushed in parts. The reading load is fairly heavy.",
    "Strengths: the readings, TAs, and how all-encompassing the material was. Failures: Perhaps better suited for a seminar or leminar, rather than a lecture for the level of student engagement expected by the professor. The pace was really slow at times too.",
    "Strength: Slides are very clear and so are expectations for midterms and papers. Weakness: Lectures aren't very engaging.",
    "This course is unnecessarily liberally biased. Professor Henderson was pressing his own agenda the entire time, and his anti-republican examples did not contribute to the better illustration of course concepts. Benjamin Miller (TA) was also infamous for pressing his own agenda and docking grades with more conservative angles. Political science does not have to be approached\/taught with a \"blue glasses\" on to be understood.",
    "The weekly responses in section need to be communicated in the syllabus and were not consistent across the TA's. The class did not follow the syllabus and the professor fell behind in the course material. It was a fairly informative class about the legislative process and party ideologies, which was nice.",
    "The lectures were boring but in studying for the midterm i learned a little. Everything was pretty disorganized and no one was engaged.",
    "The strength of the course is that it is not difficult or too much work. However, lectures and sections were not very engaging and much of the material was very surface-level.",
    "Everything was wonderful. Keep it the way it is.",
    "It couldve gone quicker, we fell behind the syllabus",
    "Strengths: Thought-provoking material if you're at all interested in American national politics or its history. Straightforward exams if you complete the study guide and memorize your answers. Case study was a really great assignment and allowed you to have a lot of fun with the material. My TA (Marco Biagi) was also really helpful, but I haven't spoken to students in the other sections so I don't know whether this was universal. Weaknesses: I would have loved to do the paper, but the way things are set up now makes doing so really difficult. Not only is it due in the last week of classes, which is a really busy time, but we also don't cover the readings\/content necessary for the extended case study until the very end of class because we were behind the syllabus since early on in the semester. Also, it's pretty clear that a lot of kids in this class were disengaged -- too much reading of which you really need very little to succeed, and in-class lectures that do not expand much beyond the slides that Henderson uploads on Canvas.",
    "I think the structure of the course was pretty solid",
    "This was an incredibly biased and boring course. The professor doesn't even try to hide it anymore. The political bent is just frustrating, even if you agree with him. He also did not have the decency to email the class when lecture was canceled one Thursday.",
    "Strengths - Interesting material, relatively easy to complete assignments, valuable feedback for papers. Weaknesses - Not a lot of reason to go to lecture",
    "I loved the sections. The lectures could be slightly more engaging.",
    "More readings could be incorporated into lecture",
    "Vggbh",
    "The classes were very short and rushed, while sections dragged on but did not seem to cover much of course material.",
    "It's an average poli sci course. Section, lecture, study for exam, etc",
    "thought it was pretty good as in it met my expectations as to what I thought I was going to learn when I signed up for the course.",
    "I'm afraid the course content is rather dry, and the survey model of several different topics prevented us from going more in-depth on some of the more interesting topics, like redistricting and party bias. Within a few weeks of the beginning of the semester, lecture attendance had dropped to perhaps 1\/3, and slid down to maybe 1\/4 by the end of the course. Any lecture with that kind of attendance issue needs to receive a hard look, as it suggests that students were getting all they needed to or at least enough out of the lecture slides posted on canvas. Professor Henderson assigned several books for us to read throughout the course. It soon became apparent that the books were not covered in lecture or section and thus the reading was hard to justify with all the other work I had to do. Professor Henderson also bizarrely assigned \"recommended\" additional reading, as if the 100+ pages of required reading could be taken for granted even though we essentially never covered it. A mark of a disengaging lecture is one with a mandatory section, and while attendance was excellent, participation was limited to maybe half of the section. It sometimes felt as though we just had to fill the time because the content wasn't that interesting and there was no plan for section.",
    "The lectures were enjoyable as well as the discussion sections. The paper was also a very instructive assignment due to allowing us to apply concepts from class.",
    "The course itself and the material in it is very interesting but not very challenged. I would have appreciated more application of the concepts in and out of class.",
    "I think a strength of this course is its connection to our present political landscape and helping one understand how the past connects to the present."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are looking for a relatively chill introduction to politics. The case study can be tough sometimes though.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone sincerely interested in American politics. Otherwise, it is not for the casual student.",
    "Yes, if you want to understand the technical machinations behind political parties in the United States.",
    "Yes, especially if they do not know very much about American politics and the parties and just want to gain a better understanding of them.",
    "I would only recommend this student if you are a political science major. Otherwise, it is pointless and not worth taking.",
    "Maybe, but probably just as a 5th class because it's not that engaging or interesting.",
    "Only take it if you don't mind the liberal agenda being shoved down your throat.",
    "I would recommend for a relatively easy, gut course that will teach you relevant material to know about politics which could be useful in life.",
    "If you are looking for an easy class then this one is for you. You won't learn much though.",
    "Probably not; it wasn't too difficult, but it was hard to know what to expect and it wasn't very interesting, even though the course title seems like it would be.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It will deepen your understanding of relevant concepts.",
    "Yeah, its an okay gut",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if you're genuinely interested in national American politics and want to learn some new theories for being able to articulate things you may have observed\/noticed about the way our system works.",
    "Yes, of they are looking for something a little less mainstream for a political science credit",
    "I would not recommend this course. The instructor does a poor job introducing the topic to the students.",
    "I would not. I have done well at Yale so far, fortunately, and I am glad I took this class Credit\/D\/F. The grading is not forgiving, even though he tells you the test questions in advance. I thought that would make the course easier, but answering those questions can be tricky and subjective.",
    "Yes, I thought the workload was manageable and the topic material was interesting.",
    "Yes. I still enjoyed the course.",
    "Yes, it is a great introduction to American politics and the material has a good balance between being in depth and easy to understand.",
    "Yes!",
    "Uehehe",
    "Yes, as long as you get a good TA.",
    "Sure. If you're a poli sci major or want to understand American parties better, go ahead.",
    "Yes",
    "yes because it was interesting to learn more about the party system in the US",
    "I am happy to say that this is the first Yale course that I have taken that I would not recommend to another student. If you're a poli sci major it's a good backup if you don't get in to seminars, but the class just isn't that interesting.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student especially if they have never taken a political science class and want a solid introduction to American politics.",
    "Yes, great PLSC class!",
    "No, I felt like the course could have been more rigorous than it was.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students as I think it is an essential piece in understanding our political system and American life."
