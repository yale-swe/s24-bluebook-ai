    "A tremendous course. Take it with Ken Winkler; you won't find a more dedicated or talented professor.",
    "DS Philosophy with Professor Winkler was my favorite class this semester. If you are lucky enough to get Professor Winkler, DO NOT SWITCH.",
    "Get Professor Winkler!! He is amazing. He is so willing to help and so easy to understand. With him, I came to really enjoy philosophy.Oh and take DS even if you don't htink you can commit to doing all the reading. It's awesome whether or not you do the reading.",
    "DS is good. Professor Winkler's a pretty great teacher, too. However, be warned - Philosophy is tough.",
    "My favorite course of the three. I have definitely enjoyed my time in DS so far. As I've only taken two classes outside of DS, I don't have too much of a basis for comparing DS classes to other classes. That said, I am still very happy with my decision to do the program: it's demanding, for sure, but I've been learning a lot from professors and students, and you read some great works that you probably wouldn't make the time to read otherwise.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Kenneth Winkler's section. He is a very friendly, helpful, and interesting professor. His sections were always fun and insightful. I really appreciated learning about the ways philosophers look at the world and come up with different arguments. The readings made me rethink many issues about which I thought I was self-confident before. Winkler was always prepared for the class and would often bring some papers that would give us more insight into the material we covered. To sum up, ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "philosophy can get pretty mind-boggling sometimes but it's rewarding if you work at it long enough. papers are pretty straightforward as long as you reconstruct the arguments sensibly. winkler's fantastic, nice, and really knows his stuff.",
    "Professor Winkler is truly \"the man.\" If you are so fortunate as to have him for section leader, DO NOT SWITCH (I actually sacrificed econ to stay in this section). He is BRILLIANT, honest, and receptive to everyone's ideas, pointing out their faults but seeing the merit of every argument (unlike a certain someone you will be reading). The stuff we read will no doubt make you evaluate the way you live your life but only in section will you be able to flush your ideas into coherent arguments with the help of your peers and an erudite but unassuming professor. And then you see life\/yourself in a new way! Also, I had this section Wednesday and Friday, and I still loved those Friday classes! Didn't miss a single one.",
    "I would most definitely recommend the Philosophy section of the Directed Studies program to a fellow student. As an introduction to the major works of Western philosophical thought, it served its purpose well. I was largely unfamiliar with most of what we read before taking the course, but through both the lecture series and section discussion I was able to come to a beginning understanding and appreciation of the curriculum. The lectures are for the most part top-notch, and leave little to be desired. The sections, however, are where the course really shines. Section instruction and discussion enabled me to truly begin to come to an understanding of the works, with my peers challenging me in a beneficial way at every step.",
    "A great intensive introduction to philosophy. I would definitely recommend it."
