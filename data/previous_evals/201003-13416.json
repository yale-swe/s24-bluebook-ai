    "The instructor is incredibly well-informed on the topics and often has inside stories about how different policies and guidelines came to be. It is not just about learning the research behind the guidelines but really about learning the difference between the data and the executed policy product...the politics and power-play and gray areas that lead to a gap between evidence and outcomes.",
    "Absolutely wonderful and engaging class! Really enjoyed the combination of lecture, discussion, and student presentations! So informative and pertinent!",
    "Very interesting topic, and a wide variety of topics were discussed in the weekly lectures. The final paper was a great exercise, it was really valuable to learn how to do a systematic review. Anyone interested in nutrition\/diet or maternal\/child would love it.",
    "Without exaggeration, this is the best class that I have taken at YSPH. Dr. Perez-Escamilla combines material from almost all previous required classes on epidemiology, statistics, and SBS to bring it home in a relevant, practical, this-is-the-way-it-really-works style, at the end of which I feel like I have a quantifiably increased knowledge base on the topics of nutrition and maternal-child policy. Weekly Paper selection was excellent. Class format was excellent. At the end of the day, you realize that Dr. Perez-Escamilla is in this because he deeply cares about the women and children who are impacted by subpar nutritional status and policy. Amazing combination of professor knowledge and dissemination of that knowledge in a carefully thought-through curriculum.",
    "The course presents interesting topics in maternal and child nutrition, and they are covered well and from interesting perspectives. The weekly assignments can seem a little tedious but the readings are generally interesting.",
    "Great class - organized very well. Enjoyed lectures a lot. Workload and assignments are fair. Professor Perez-Escamilla gives great feedback.",
    "Course is excellent and well worth the effort. The topics are clearly defined and the assignments enhance the learning. The project and presentation are appropriate. The professor is clearly the biggest strength of the course - he is wonderful.",
    "This was an enjoyable class. It would be better if the powerpoint presentation was before the paper. There were way to many guidelines for the paper. It was almost impossible to pick a topic and answer everything while also being creative.",
    "I really liked the content and would advise those who are particularly interested in MCH to take it. The readings were interesting and the amount of work was just right. I liked the small class size and the professor is always cheery. The paper was long and I would have liked a bit more instruction that I would need to modify my topic.",
    "I would have preferred a more focus on global issues realted to malnutrition and food security. The course was too focused on America and western world.",
    "Didn't like doing the presentations BEFORE the final paper- would have been better to do them the other way around. I changed my paper entirely after the presentation and would have liked to present the more thorough, complete version to the class."

    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla is a very interesting lecturer and is incredibly well-informed about the topics. He is also incredibly humble about how much he knows and how high up he is in the world of public health nutrition policy in this country and throughout the world. He expects a lot from his students (this is in no way a blow-off class), but he offers and equal amount back. Overall, having him as a professor was a very positive experience and his class encouraged me to engage with the material and learn a tremendous amount.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Really engaging and interesting professor! Always friendly and ever so helpful!",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0One of the best instructors I've had at Yale thus far. His command of the subject is incredible, and he's also a leader in the field out in the \"real world.\" His ability to answer student questions - on ANY topic - is unbelievable. He's also flexible, designed very useful weekly exercises (to help us make sense of the readings), and I like how he got all students involved during student presentations by having us do peer evaluations of each person's presentation.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Please see above.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0I really enjoyed having him as a professor. He creates very clear presentations for class and clear expectations. He also makes himself readily available if you have questions for class or help with your final paper.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Professor Perez-Escamilla was great! I loved hearing about all of his amazing experiences.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0The professor is amazing. He clearly has extensive real-world knowledge about the course topics. His teaching style is clear and thoughtful. He engages the students in conversation and inquiry. He is clearly interested in his students learning. One of the best professor I have encountered.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Dr. Perez-Escamilla was very knowledgeable and a very good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0He's always pleasant and willing to meet up - he also responds to emails quickly. He's knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter, too.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0Great instructor! Always positive. Enormous experience in the field and knowledge on many areas.",
    "Instructor: Rafael Perez-Escamilla \u00a0I thought Professor Perez-Escamilla was approachable, responsive, and helpful, and I thoroughly enjoyed having him as an instructor. He is clearly an expert in this field and it was great to have him as a teacher!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, definitely would recommend! It was a wonderful and highly useful class!",
    "I would definitely recommend it!",
    "This course combines epidemiological and statistical principles as they apply to policy formation and implementation in the field of domestic and international maternal child public nutrition. Would not recommend for 1st semester 1st year students--this course is greatly aided by a solid understanding of epidemiological and statistical concepts. Would Definitely recommend to any 2nd year student interested in putting an ear to the door of behind-the-scenes nutrition policy decisions and all of the factors and considerations to be made.",
    "The class is pretty interesting, it covers many topics very quickly and then you get to choose a topic to focus on for your final presentation\/paper. It is a laid back class, with lecture followed by brief discussion of the readings. The only real con is the weekly reading summary assignment, but it goes quickly as there is a required format. I would recommend this to anyone with interests in maternal\/child health or nutrition.",
    "Wonderful! Definitely would recommend it.",
    "Take the class. It's great.",
    "This is an interesting class, however not very \"global\" even though it was listed under the global health electives.",
    "If you want to go more in-depth about MCH Nutrition, take this class. The readings each week are interesting, short and relevant to that day's topic. Start early on the paper and ask for constant feedback to make sure you are not rushing at the last minute to hand it in. Don't spend too much time on the presentation because it's graded more like P\/F."
