    "I think the class this year was very different than it has been in past years because of the change of professor. Professor Englot is very nice and takes time to explain things in an understandable way, but I didn't really like the way he paced the class. We spent a lot of time in the beginning going over circuits, etc. (which everyone should have been familiar with since EENG200 is a prereq) and we didn't get to spend as much time with feedback control at the end. The grading of the labs seemed arbitrary, and our TA wasn't very helpful. I wish the class could have been handled better because the material is actually interesting and applicable.",
    "Good class on systems with a hands-on lab component. However, lectures are a little dry and a lot of the material is a review from EENG 200. This year was more experimental, because of change of instructor, so hopefully it will be better next year.",
    "If Professor Englot is teaching it, I would definitely recommend this class. The work load is very manageable and the material it pretty interesting. If you have been studying ME though, be prepared for a LOT of new material.",
    "I would recommend this class to ABET students or to others who are interested in mechatronics. I would warn students that the class is a lot of work though, and you have to be ready to put in the time to figure out some of the material.",
    "The course covers intro electronics (basically a review of EE200), transfer functions, and basic control theory. The sections on transfer function and control theory were well taught and interesting new material for most MECHEs. The course consists of a biweekly lab and class, with two exams. The labs are timed, which is incredibly stressful. It can be very interesting if you are a MECHE, but do not take it if you are anEE...it will be all review.",
    "This class covers some interesting material, but the way it was presented this year was just not good. First of all, about the first third of the class was spent reviewing electronics, which was WAY too much time considering we had just taken EE200 the semester before. And for people who hadn't taken EE200, the pace was too fast for them to learn anything. So it was in that in-between area where it was too advanced for people who knew nothing to learn anything and too basic for people who knew something to learn anything. So it was useless.The material for the rest of the semester (especially control theory) had the potential to be very interesting, but it was poorly taught. Even though the basics aren't that complicated, they were presented in a confusing way. In the end, kind of a disappointing class.",
    "Most rewarding engineering course that I have taken so far at Yale.",
    "You'll learn about motors and transfer functions and sensors and Laplace transforms (in a semi-practical way, not just stuff you learned in DiffEQ). It is definitely a lot of material if you don't already know anything about transfer functions. You will learn a lot. It will be a bit of a struggle.Labs were kind of awful, but at least they're not every week. Near the end they involved a lot of programming in C and debugging.In short: glad to have gotten through this class and to have learned the material (I'm a MechE major so most of it was new to me; I hear it was a lot of repeat material for EE majors), didn't enjoy it very much while I was taking it, but it would have gone better if I'd put more time into it.I don't think I'd recommend it if you don't need it for your major. Unless you need to know about motors. Then go for it.",
    "Mechatronics is a good course as it allows for the practical application of electrical engineering ideas to mechanical components; we were able to program a motor to spin at a certain speed and in a certain direction. It was a bit frustrating that the professor was not part of Yale faculty as this meant that there were no real office hours. The course is pretty good so if you have to take it don't worry too much."
