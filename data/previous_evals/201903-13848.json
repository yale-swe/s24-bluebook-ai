    "I learned how to read and write Hindi. I learned a lot of grammar principles and began to start speaking as well. I am amazed at how much Hindi I picked up on only a few months.",

    "Basic sentences in Hindi, Hindu culture, and speaking in Hindi",
    "The fundamentals of Hindi vocabulary and grammar as well as a near complete understanding of the written script.",
    "Basic conversation skills, reading and weiting",
    "I learned basic Hindi vocab, grammar, verb tenses, and sentence structures.",

   "comments": [
    "The course was very fun but could have been improved with more structure\/ clear cut grading policies",
    "I think that the teaching in the class is done very well. One thing that can be improved is that the grades could be a bit more transparent.",
    "Great introduction to Hindi. Would be nice to have more listening exercises.",
    "The course does a great job of taking students through the base material behind the language without going too fast or overwhelming the students with too much all at once. There are also a remarkable amount of out-of-class opportunities for additional mentorship and tutoring. The only problem with the course is that material is a bit scattered at times. Sometimes it felt like there wasn't a clear program of study; we'd jump from one topic to the next without complete explanation. I still learned a lot though, so just a minor fault.",
    "More opportunities for conversation in class",
    "I like how they are so open to asking questions and always encourage speaking in Hindi inside and outside class. However, I think the class could use more structure and I wish our grades were posted online."

    "YES! Hindi is such a fun language and both instructors really care about their students' learning process",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone that wants to learn a new language and about a great culture!",
    "Yes! Swapna ji is incredible!",
    "Yes. It was a very interesting class and I enjoyed learning. Seema Ji and Swapna Ji are great teachers. They understand that not every student comes from the same background and do a great job adjusting accordingly. I am certainly glad I took it.",
    "Yes, especially if the language is of cultural significance to you, the professors do a fantastic job of providing you the tools necessary to read, write and speak the language in a relatively low-stress environment.",
    "Absolutely, amazing language class, not too stressful, weekly quizzes and midterm\/final projects are very conducive to learning the language but also very stress free",
    "I would probably recommend this course to other students -- if you want to learn Hindi, this is a good way to do so.",
    "Yes! I love learning Hindi and our professors."
