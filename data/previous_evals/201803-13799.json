    "In this course, I was exposed to a variety of thinkers and scholars that really helped to stretch my thinking about what Asian American Studies entails. As someone coming into this class with little to no knowledge, it was very helpful for me to be learning and thinking about methodologies and practices for academic writing and thinking more like an Asian Americanist.",
    "I was introduced to a wide range of Asian American criticism. In addition to learning how to read a field that is often under-covered in mainstream humanities discourses, I learned how to engage in conversations that cut across ethnic, historical, and literary studies. It became clear to me by the end of our seminar that Asian American is a broad label for an interdisciplinary field of humanistic study that is dynamic and increasingly abundant in critical possibilities."

    "I would definitely recommend the course to another student, and be sure to explain the workload, not just reading but also writing. It was a learning curve for me, but rely on the instructor because she is definitely the highlight of the class.",
    "Absolutely! From refugee studies to techno-Orientalism, the course is field-encompassing enough to contain something for everyone, no matter whether students are explicitly primarily interested in \"Asian\"\/Asian American literary studies or in other disciplines."
