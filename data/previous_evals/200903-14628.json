   "comments": [
    "This course was fun and extremely relevant to my studies. Orientalism is a subject that everyone should look into precisely because it is so much about marginality, and examining power from the margins.The texts at some points became redundant, and there was only so much more you could explore. However, the concepts we covered in these texts were great. I would have preferred to do a little bit more of Said's theory.Professor Ghambou is very eloquent and communicates his analyses in a captivating manner. He is, interestingly, somewhat bitter and pessimistic -- which is always amusing to encounter (like when he talks about a past girlfriend's affinity for \"imperial breakfasts\"). You could tell that he is truly invested in his work. At times, though, he does dominate conversation.I would recommend this course to people who are truly interested in topics such as postcoloniality and who are intrigued by the reading list. There has to be a genuine engagement with the course's topic.",
    "LOVED this class! It gives you a sense of the West's approach to the Orient unlike any other, since you're looking at the topic from a literary perspective. We had to read about 1 novel per week, which worked out quite nicely. The class itself was also really enjoyable (thought it would probably come down to who else is taking it), and went by a lot faster than you would think a 2.5 hour seminar would. Also, for a WR credit, there wasn't really that much writing- just a 5 page midterm paper and a 12 page final. AWESOME class.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to any student, regardless of major or discipline. The course (aside from a Hu credit) hit upon many different topics, ranging from ethnicity, stereotypes, and racism. The class was also very thought provoking, and the literature pushed the entire class to engage in some great discussions.",
    "Good professor fosters interesting discussion which is a little too lecturelike and does not really bring in other points of view--which would be nice when dealing with Orientalism.",
    "It's a good class but you won't get multiple sides of the orientalist argument. The reading list is interesting but limited. The professor is brilliant, but he will be forceful about his views."
