    "If you're an AP or Int. Physics major you have to take it so suck it up and get through it. It's really boring and really hard. If you're looking at it as an elective for something, turn elsewhere.",
    "I thought this was one of the most interesting 400-level physics classes I've been in. However, it jumped in difficulty in the middle of the course from 3-5 hours a problem set to 10-15 hours, so reconsider just taking this for fun. However, it's worth it if you want to go into physics.",
    "yes. because you need to and because it is important to appreciate the FD\/B\/MB\/Rel-nonrel etc concepts. Nagai always tells us (and it's true): STAT MECH IS EVERYWHERE IN SCIENCE!!!!!!!",
    "Yes! Take it! Prof. Nagai is amazing and the class is incredibly relevant to a wide spectrum of scientific problems. It's a bit of work, as you would expect for a 400 level physics class, but nothing unmanageable. Camille, the TA for this year, was incredibly helpful and accessible. The tests are straightforward, although sometimes rather focused. Study hard and you'll learn a lot :)",
    "Phys 420 is a difficult class to evaluate. On the one hand, you will learn powerful tools that have extremely wide applications. However, the derivations in lectures and the book are massively unsatisfying. There is a lot of handwaving and guessing without a lot of substance to many of the derivations. A routine occurrence is to see a result derived for some extremely simple system, then applied to EVERY system. It is not rigorous at all, which annoyed me.Another annoyance was that Prof. Nagai sort of left us in the dark about what would be on the midterms and final. Most of my other professors gave us practice exams or recommended problems from the book, but Prof. Nagai basically just told us that the exam covered chapters 1 through 6 and wished us luck.Despite these two complaints, I would recommend that any physics major take this course. Statistical mechanics is a hugely important field, and you definitely need to learn a bit of it to have a real physics education.",
    "Take it. Statistical mechanics is one of the most applicable fields in physics. The material is difficult, but Nagai was a very clear professor and the workload wasn't too bad.",
    "Great course. Well taught, thorough, fascinating material. I wish there were more courses like this one in the physics department. Daisuke is very lucid and insightful. No better way to learn the basics of some of the most interesting aspects of modern physics: Black body radiation, Bose einsten condensation, photon gases, and many more...",
    "Take it. As a scientist, there is no knowledge more important than how the microscopic and the macroscopic meet. Not as boring as you've heard, and Nagai is a very thorough teacher who reviews a lot.",
    "Physics 420 in a great introduction to Statistical Mechanics. You will learn many methods to approach a variety of problems. You will work hard, but the material you learn will be well worth it.",
    "If you like physics, take it"
