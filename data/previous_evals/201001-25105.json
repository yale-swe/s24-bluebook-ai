   "comments": [
    "Take it early and often :) Research for credit is great.",
    "Actually do work when you are in lab and get cracking early. It will make the paper and presentation go a lot smoother. Oh, and pick a reasonable advisor.",
    "Absolutely. Research rocks. And why not get credit? Also, practice giving talks is always good.",
    "Yes, find a good project and keep working on it in summer!",
    "Yes, great, do it. But find a good person to work with. Be careful.",
    "472 is a great opportunity to do research during the semester. It's a very valuable experience. For the aspects of the \"course,\" the reports were helpful in ensuring that I knew where I was headed, and the presentation is a good experience.What you do depends completely on what lab you're in. Make sure you talk to the professor beforehand and possibly any postdoc\/grad student who will be your main mentor in the lab. Don't be afraid to explore beyond the traditional boundaries of physics, or even beyond the professors in the department.",
    "Take it if you're a physics major and need it. If you're just doing research and want the credit, that's also a good reason to take it too.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who is self-motivated or can find a motivating advisor. The requirements of the course are pretty chill - the focus is on the research you do, and your presentation and paper are meant to share your work rather than be your work. You can build off of what you wrote previously from semester to semester when working on a long project. Professor Barrett is great - he is very understanding about deadlines, and he is a good resource if you have questions or need guidance."
