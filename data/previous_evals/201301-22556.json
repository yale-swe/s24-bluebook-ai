    "It wasn't horrible.",
    "I think that Classics of World Politics had a good foundation, and I certainly learned a lot about the basis of modern international relations theory. However, it didn't quite come together for me. It appeared to me that the class would have run better if it were larger; there were only 5 students in our class, and I think discussion would have been easier to facilitate if there were more participants. The low number of students also meant that the course turned in to more work than suspected. Every week two students are responsible for presenting on the reading and leading discussions; this meant that everyone's turn came around more often than it would have had the seminar been at capacity. There is a fair amount of reading, but all of the authors are important figures so doing it is worthwhile, if not always interesting. Despite my reservations, I would recommend the course without reservation to someone who wants a crash course in the writings that have shaped the way we look at IR today.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! This was one of my favorite courses (even though I'm a science\/engineering major). This is a great introduction to political theory. It sometimes felt like a philosophy course, but I appreciated being asked to apply the theory in modern international relations. It is really important to do to the readings--it's not that much, but you come away learning a lot more. The seminar is mostly student-led, so typically two students would lead each week's discussion (this discussion is really informal and not something to stress about at all!). I found it helpful to take notes (quotes\/key concepts) while reading when completing reading responses (you only do about 5 a semester). My notes also served as talking points for our in-class discussions.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The readings were all very interesting, but since it is a small seminar, you better be prepared to participate in discussion! I can honestly say that my critical thinking skills have improved since taking this seminar. It really forced me to engage with the material and dissect political theses. I definitely recommend it if you've ever been intrigued and\/or interested by political, realist philosophy.",
    "Yes. Great class"
