    "If you have a play itching to be written, but just don't have the time, this is the perfect class for you. If you don't have the faintest idea how to write a play but want to try, this is the right place for you. If you just want to sit around a listen to a bunch of people talk about themselves, come! But if you want a highly structured environment which will give you all the answers about playwriting, seek elsewhere.",
    "Yes. Take this class. You will have an incredible experience with an amazing teacher and human being.",
    "Take this class. If you write plays. If you want to write plays. If you don't think you can write plays. Do it. Deb is incredible. Even if you don't end up taking this class, take something with her. Or just meet with her. My only regret about this class is that we had so many people in it (because it is such an incredible class) that we weren't able to spend as much time on each individual person. You will learn how to write a play. It makes you write all the time, with half a play due at the midterm andthe full play due for by finals. Once we got going, we would talk in a circle and do exercises for the first half of class, and then just read scenes from our plays for the second half of class. I wish that we had had a little more time to do exercises, especially since we were each only able to have a scene read every couple of weeks or so. But this is a great, great class.",
    "A great class if you want to jump into writing.",
    "This class should be taken by all theater studies majors whether you plan to be a playwright or not. For actors and directors, it makes you think about theater in a different way, and Deb really helps you think of yourself as a playwright.",
    "Yes, I'd absolutely recommend it...forced me to write when I felt stuck, and I learned a lot from class readings. Work is very self-driven and dependent upon students putting in the necessary time.",
    "This course gave the class an incredible opportunity to learn about ourselves and about the art of playwrighting in a completely supportive environment. I would recommend the course to anyone who would like to write a play, but doesn't know how.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is a great place to explore playwriting.",
    "THST 321 is a wonderful and illuminating experience. Deb is helpful and supportive. However, I would advise any prospective students to really \"work\" the class. Follow Deb's advice and write every day!"
