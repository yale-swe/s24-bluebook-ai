    "Like many Yale courses populated by the species Grandus strategitis, The Art of Biography can quickly devolve into a kabuki theater of BS. This is no one's fault but your own. Read the books and work on your biography, and this may be the most intellectually rewarding of your classes at Yale.",
    "A really solid course! This is a very interesting class with a fantastic reading list. Sadly, because of this, it's full of section a$$-holes, but don't let that get you down! The assignments are interesting and thought-provoking. The end-result is a massive biography, which can be incredibly rewarding if you put enough time into it.",
    "You read biographies, discuss them, and write a biography. I REALLY did not like the weekly discussion. The discussion felt forced and dry; there was little substance to discuss every week. The questions boiled down to \"did it work or didn't it work?\" \"did we like this character?\" \"what IS character?\" in a way that left me unfulfilled. It felt like an English Department writing class without the depth or rigor of those writing classes. We didn't really go sentence-by-sentence or paragraph-by-paragraph to boil writing down to a science. It felt like a book club -- which is not exactly what I was looking for in a junior seminar. That said: the biography assignment was one of the most fun, rewarding, creative academic assignments I've had at Yale. It is so wonderful to have the opportunity to reconstruct a person's life primarily from primary sources in the archives here. I actually think the final assignment made up for the boring discussions, so much so that I'd recommend taking this class. The reading list is good, too -- mostly well-written biographies, which are a pleasure to read.",
    "This course is pretty much Book Club with John Gaddis, but that's not a bad thing; Gaddis is not just a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer and brilliant war historian, but a caring, warm, and masterful teacher. The final project is daunting but rewarding. Take the course if you get in. Also, be warned that this class, like most taught by famous Yale faculty, attracts a lot of gunners.",
    "Definitely take this if you can get in. If you can't read the whole book each week, try and skim as much as you can strategically as much for craft as for content. The biographies give you good ideas for style and structure you can use in your project.",
    "We read one biography a week and discussed its strengths and weaknesses in class. We experimented with using a class set of iPads and incorporating them into the classroom experience. I would have been happier not using them, as I prefer people don't use laptops in class - it's too easy to get away with not doing the reading. Since it was pretty obvious that most people were not doing all the reading, discussions were pretty unsubstantial. The class would be better if it were smaller. I enjoyed most of the reading list, but Gaddis reads many of the books for the first time along with the class, which was frustrating, as some of the books were less than stellar. I wish it included more classic works of biography. Read the syllabus, and take it if you like the books included, but don't take it just to take a class with Gaddis. It's a lot of work, and you should do all of it!",
    "This is a great survey of the genre of biography. I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in biography: both reading and writing. Perhaps the most important thing about the class is that it gives you the opportunity to immerse yourself in primary sources (such as diaries, journals, and letters) in the Beinecke or Sterling collections and use these to write a biographical research paper. Doing this was a fabulous experience.",
    "Yes for the reasons I say above. Great class but so much work. Immense workload that attracts the best and brightest students at Yale.",
    "Gaddis is obviously an amazing professor and a wonderful seminar leader, and the class's topic is unique and interesting. However, be sure to shop your classmates -- full of sophomores looking to do GS.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The biography is the kind of project you rarely get to do at Yale. Be wary of the final project \u2014 it's a lot of work.",
    "extremely disappointing, especially given the professor's renown and positive past reviews.",
    "Take this class. Micro history is great fun, and the final assignment is a fantastic trial run for the immense research and writing you will need to do for your senior essay. The reading list is intense (a book a week), but I can't think of any History class with readings as enjoyable as the ones we had for The Art of Biography."
