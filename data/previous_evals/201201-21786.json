   "comments": [
    "If you're EE, you have to take it. You probably won't enjoy it, but you have to take it. It's not difficult, but the labs are a train wreck, so just grit your teeth and get it done. The labs amount to \"copy this schematic from the lab handout into the CAD program\" without much of any explanation of how the circuits you're copying actually work. Have fun!",
    "i guess if you really want to learn something about engineering take it, but the software is infuriating and the things you learn not all the practical (as admitted by the TA's not me). the class was never worth going to and at no point was i ever really excited about doing work for the class.",
    "I very much enjoyed the material and the labs, but can't say that I liked the course itself. The teaching and lectures were absolutely awful: I learned much more reading the textbook and playing around with gate level design than I ever did from class.If the current professor (Savvides) is no longer teaching this class then I definitely recommend it. Otherwise stay away unless you have to take it for the major.",
    "A good intro to digital circuits. There's no graded homework. Labs require very little thought...although you will wrestle with the software a lot. Exams can be strange but overall are doable. If you're on the fence about EE this class is probably not the one to try out, go for 202 instead.",
    "Do not take if savvides is still teaching. He is confused, confusing, and his tests can be somewhat unfair with regards to the course material. If you're interested in the material, get the course text and read it, and ask to be put on the v2 site. You will get far more out of it and won't have to go through this miserable course.",
    "EE 201 is a great hands on course about computer engineering. No EE experience is necessary. The labs can be frustrating and time consuming, but you have the ability to do some cool final projects by the end of the course.",
    "The class can be very frustrating at times. The material can be boring at the time you learn it, but once you start implementing it (for the labs and the final project), the knowledge becomes very rewarding. Through the labs, you will build a simple computer processor, and you will improve upon it for the final project. It's the type of class that really does get much better towards the end of the semester. This is because the material becomes interesting once you've built enough of a knowledge base to truly understand the work you're doing in the labs, project, etc.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in learning how processors work. The subject is quite fascinating, and the course is enlightening because it teaches you the logic behind a computer. By the end of the course, you understand a simple processor, and can understand the basic functioning of such devices as a calculator or a stopwatch.That said, the last lab can be quite long, and the software we used this semester was slow and unpredictable at times (make sure you back up your project to the classes server after every lab), but if you are interested in electrical engineering, digital design, or computers, you should not let this keep you from taking the course.",
    "Easy class, but horribly put together. Expect to constantly ask questions regarding due dates, logistics, etc.",
    "Don't take this course unless you are an engineering major. The lectures are a waste of time and the software we use for the labs is so horrible and dysfunctional that it ends up taking hours to finish the labs.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in EE or EE\/CS as a major. It's not too hard of a course if you are willing to put some time into the lab portion. The lab portion isn't bad at all. It's mostly just following instructions and doing them in the software. The last lab is a project, so that can get tricky. Most of the class had problems finishing the last project I think.",
    "The class was very unorganized, which made it very stressful. The material is definitely worth learning, but the lab assignments can end up wasting a lot of time because the software we used was very old and slow.",
    "Do not; I repeat do not take this class unless you are 100% sure that you want to be an electrical engineer; if you are interested in the material just buy the textbook and read it yourself.",
    "This was, by far, the worst course I have taken at Yale. If you are thinking of taking this because it sounds fun, you will be disappointed if Savvides is still the professor.",
    "I heard great reviews about this class before I took the class, but upon taking the class I am not impressed. I think there was a change in professor and the class has dropped off significantly. Overall, it was a very dull class that required a significant amount of time in lab just debugging your program. Not a fun class to take at all if you do not need it.",
    "Take it if you're interested in Computer Engineering...or if it's required.",
    "If Savvides is teaching, do not take the class. He is a terrible professor and has no idea what he's doing. You will be frustrated with him and with the program you have to use to make your projects.That said, I hear it was good last year, so if its a different teacher, go for it.",
    "A good fifth class but make sure you don't fall behind on the lectures. The labs are easy to do but take time.",
    "Yes, by all means",
    "This class is an introduction to digital circuit design. You learn how to design small processors and circuits to perform simple tasks. I found the material very interesting and I learned a lot from the labs. I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in computers and how they work. You will learn a lot about them and have a much better idea of how they are built.",
    "Material is good, but the class itself is extremely disorganized. The professor typically let us out of lecture 20-30 minutes early every class. He rarely responded to emails and wasn't very clear about deadlines. The lab TAs, on the other hand, were AWESOME - so helpful with both the labs and general explaining of the material.",
    "Yes goo course for prospective ee majors",
    "If you're interested in electronics (even if you're not an EE major) this class is quite interesting. You don't get the same hands-on experience you would get with MENG 185 in mechanical engineering, but in terms of concepts you basically design a computer, test it, and then build a project that uses your architecture - that was pretty amazing.",
    "I would not recommend EE 201 to another student unless another professor with a very good reputation teaches it next year.Though the premise about learning about computer architecture is a good one and the course topics are interesting, the quality of the professor, the planning of the class, and the buggy program took away the worth of the class.",
    "I would recommend that a fellow student take this course when Prof. Savvides is not teaching it. The course itself was fabulous, the material challenging but not impossible, and the book very helpful.",
    "Electrical Engineering is an introduction to computer engineering and is great for students interested in how computers work."
