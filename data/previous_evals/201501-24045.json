   "comments": [
    "Cartography is an amazing course, one of the best you can take at Yale, I promise, if you prioritize it when you take it and cover most or all of the readings each week. The assignments also take a lot of effort and thought, but are incredibly rewarding. If you can do those things and have any interest in maps, geography, history, the world, people, take the class.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want to change the way you think about nations and territory. If you just really like maps, then this may not be the class for you because maps end up being pretty incidental to the point of the class. Well taught, interesting readings, will change the way you think about geography, territory, nations, even categories.",
    "Don't take this unless you are really, really interested in the topic. I thought I was really really interested in the topic, but it turns out I wasn't. I wanted the class to be more theoretical, but you will spend a lot of time reading hundreds of pages about medieval mapping, or a set of 16th century Spanish colonial maps, or about mapping Thailand's borders. There's a huge focus on nationalism. It's a great class and I got a lot out of it, but it will be irritating to spend so much time on these readings if you are not really excited about them.",
    "Cartography, Territory, and Identity was a great course for rethinking the way history is done. Importantly, it is not a history of cartography, and as Professor Rankin warns on the first day, it is not a class to take just because you find maps cool (though that may help). It is, instead, a class rich in multidisciplinary analysis and critical theory--daunting at first to those not versed, but a helpful lens to have afterwards. The discussion always seemed to flow, and I liked Professor Rankins use of the end of every weeks class for something other than discussion, like presentations or a primer on finding good maps online. Professor Rankin knows his stuff well and is always eager to share--youll come to love his hard drive full of maps from seemingly every place and era. And the make-your-own-map assignment was both fun and challenging.",
    "This is not what you would necessarily expect from the title: a history of map making. That being said, this is by far one of the best seminars I have taken at Yale. The readings are always interesting and the research projects give you free reign to address topics that interest you. Prof. Rankin leads amazing discussions so it never feels like the conversation is dragging. Admittedly this course has more work than other classes, but if you are interested in the topic it is totally worth it.",
    "It's lots of work so be prepared!",
    "Yes, it is a lot of work and you need to buy the books, let me repeat that, YOU NEED TO BUY OR RENT THE BOOKS to get through the class, you can't just rely on what is posted on V2, but if you put aside a few hours a week the class is very interesting.",
    "Great introduction to the really interesting field of map history. A chance to study subjects you're interested in and make a map of your own (on photoshop, GIS, or just by hand). The course is very heavy on philosophy. You have to think carefully about the readings to answer weekly discussion questions and participate in class. Professor Rankin is a super impressive scholar and a caring teacher. It wasn't my favorite seminar ever, but still very good.",
    "Overall HSHM 422 gives you a broad overview into the world of cartography, power of expression, and the ever changing concepts of space and time. I would recommend this class to another student interested in the topics, but would warn them that it entails quite a bit of work. The readings and discussion questions are a steady task throughout the semester.",
    "This course was an incredible experiencing of unlearning what I knew about geography in a historical context, and then relearning about the history of geography and the history of science. The strengths were everything. No weaknesses really.",
    "Yes.",
    "This course could be called \"Problematizing Maps.\" You spend a lot of time rethinking all of our assumptions about geographic representation, putting in historical context what is often thought of as \"objective.\" There is a lot of reading, some of it beautiful, some of it quite difficult. Overall, I think it really broadened my thinking."
