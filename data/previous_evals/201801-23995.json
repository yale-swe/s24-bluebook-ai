   "comments": [
    "I think there were interesting speakers that had applicable backgrounds we could relate to and learn from.",
    "Strength is that you learn from leaders in HC space Weakness is sometimes the speakers do not address topics I would normally attend for.",
    "It was a great opportunity to hear diverse speakers talk about their past and their current careers. A way it could be improved is to schedule it on Tuesday nights instead of Thursday nights.",
    "Inspiring speaker series that lets you connect with potential mentors.",
    "great guest speakers.",
    "good - great speakers and was some of my favorites were surprises! Also appreciated the opportunity to get to know some visitors better via dinners Wish we knew we were going to have to write a final paper at the end of the year. Would have written it sooner right after my favorite speaker.",
    "Loved being able to hear from a different speaker each week about their background\/experiences, lessons on leadership, perspectives on healthcare, etc. I prefer the room to be set up lecture-style so that all attendees can see the speaker's face when he\/she is talking (as opposed to all sitting around the large table). It was great to be able to go out to dinner with several of the speakers - I would have liked to be able to attend more. Colloquium was also scheduled on Thursdays, the same day as SOM Closing Bells.",
    "Amazing speakers. More dinners with the speakers for each student.",
    "Strengths: Fascinating presenters",
    "amazing way to learn about the health care industry directly from amazing health care leaders",
    "one of my favorite at Yale so far",
    "Strengths: speakers are INCREDIBLE! Howie does a great job of assembling a diverse line-up and creating an environment for candid story-telling and discussion. Weaknesses: it would be great to have more notice about the final paper! The quality would be much better if I had taken time to write it immediately after a particularly inspiring talk, rather than during exam period. Also, this is minor, but it's unfortunate that the class time conflicts with Closing Bell, which is a nice opportunity for HCM and MBA students to socialize.",
    "Strength: diverse range of inspiring speakers Weakness: speakers sometimes have quite generic speeches",
    "It's really incredible to get the chance to meet such a diverse group of highly successful professionals in your chosen career path."
