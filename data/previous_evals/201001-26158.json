    "Many of these questions are notapplicable to this course, since the course is a doctoral lab that does not have regular instruction or readings. Rather, we use it as a forum to present and discuss ongoing work and projects of people within the social ecology doctoral group, and to discuss other key skills or topics of interest to the group, like preparation for qualifying exams or applying for academic jobs. This course is extremely valuable for me - I've learned a lot from my peers and greatly benefit from their feedback.",

Why can't we think together in a formal setting? Do we feel on a stage all the time? Have we adjusted to think according to the context? Although this lab is the best place I found to share ideas in my all program, I still think there is something that can still be improved."
