    "CHNS 151 is a continuation of 150. The format is essentially the same. I'd say that if you've come this far you should continue on to 151. It gives you a lot of new vocab and sentence patterns that will be really useful in talking about common subjects, e.g. trade, economics, movies, and will help you learn how to read Chinese news (EXTREMELY USEFUL).",
    "same as last semester, reasonable amount of work, wished it improved speaking more. improved reading and writing a lot. if you want to take L5 Chinese and aren't a heritage speaker, this is pretty much your only option. that being said, it's not a bad class.",
    "Chinese is a well-taught language here, 151 is no exception. Li Laoshi and Wang Laoshi are both great.",
    "Fluency will degrade over the year, but if you plan on continuing your Chinese studies (esp. after Light Fellowship \/ ISA if you did that), this class is indispensable",
    "Take it if you are really committed to bettering your Chinese. The work load is not enormous but steady: there is a quiz or something due everyday so if you fall behind, it's hard to catch back up.",
    "Yes, if you're willing to continue the grind. It's worth it to keep up your Chinese, if that's what you want.",
    "A good continuation of Chinese 150. I feel like during this semester in particular, my recognition of characters improved. While you're studying for the lessons every day, the characters you're memorizing seem really random, but then when you try to read news articles or books in Chinese, you see the same characters being used and you realize that they're actually important. The course spends a few weeks specifically targeting characters and grammatical structures that are common in newspaper articles, which is really helpful for getting started reading Chinese newspapers. Overall it's still a lot of work, but you know exactly what to expect from the workload if you took Chinese 150, so just make sure you have enough time to dedicate to the daily studying.",
    "Not the easiest class, in that it takes quite a bit of work especially at certain points in the semester, but while throughout first semester (Chinese 150) I wasn't sure if my Chinese was improving beyond where it had been after spending the summer in Beijing, at this point I would say that it certainly has greatly surpassed that level, in both knowledge and fluency of speech.",
    "If you came from a summer program, you will be disappointed as that focused type of pedagogy is not present in this class- it moves slower, the teachers aren't as on top of things, and you don't learn as relevant material. However, you still come out having learned quite a bit, and you get through enough material to start reading the news at the end of the class, which is somewhat satisfying if you've hung on that far.But if you're not retaining all the characters every week (about 80 a week, but you memorize them over the course of two days) then you will most likely leave the class somewhat depressed from your lack of perceived progress.",
    "Chinese 151 is a great course! It's a continuation of L5 Chinese, but on a much deeper level. The course is didactic but also indicative of broader social, political, and economic commentary on both old and modernizing China. I found it more difficult, but definitely worth it. Professors are great, too, and very understanding and nice.",
    "I would recommend this class to students seeking to retain what they've learned after doing Light for a summer, but overall, I don't feel like I learned that much.",
    "If you went to a summer program, this class will probably not be too hard for you, but it will be extremely helpful to cement all the knowledge you gained over the summer. I pretty much forgot all the Chinese I had learned over the summer by the second week of school, and it was great to see the same characters appear in our book. This semester was great because we learned how to read newspapers, which is a pretty big deal. Take this class!",
    "Basically exact same as 150. The quizzes three times a week get to be a drag, especially towards the end of the semester. But as the class was winding down and we were finding news articles online (real content woot!) I realized that I learned A TON of Chinese, especially w\/r\/t reading, in 150-151.",
    "Chinese 151 is much more challenging that 150, and is meant for someone who wants professional proficiency in Chinese. It's a good class, and you will learn more than just the language - you will learn a lot about Chinese history, culture and politics.",
    "Definitely take it. Same deal as 150, both laoshis are great, and Yale\u0092s Chinese program is the best place to learn the language if you\u0092re interested in doing it at any point. The class is a huge time commitment (five hours of class a week, plus almost one hour of tutorial, plus another five hours or so of homework), but the nature of the class makes it hard to fall behind, and if you don\u0092t use it, you\u0092ll definitely lose it.",
    "Chinese 151 is a great class and very similar in structure to Chinese 150. The workload is heavy at times, but the teachers are always enthusiastic and you learn a lot in class. The main difference between the fall and spring semesters is that the topics covered in the spring are somewhat more academic (ie Chinese media, history, economics etc.) than those covered in the fall."
