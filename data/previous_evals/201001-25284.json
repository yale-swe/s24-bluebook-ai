    "This class was horrible, unfortunately it's required for the sociology major so I had to take it. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. Seriously, It's horrible. So boring, so dry, absolutely hated it. And it was seminar style so it was 2 hours long, and was absolutely painful. I dreaded going to this class each week. Trust me, find something else. I guess the one perk is that there's not too much work, a midterm paper and a final paper and I got away with the paper without doing any reading. But little workload is not enough reason to take this course. It sucks.",
    "The subject matter for this course is very philosophy-like. The readings are somewhat dense, but it's fun to try and figure out what each writer is talking about.",
    "Various theories in sociology are introduced and discussed in the class. Unless you are a sociology major or have strong background on theories, I don't think it's a class to take for fun.",
    "The reading list is good. That's about it.Stamatov is useless. He has no idea what hewants to achieve with the class and so nothing gets achieved (beyond what you can just read from the assignements.)",
    "Yes if you're interested in dense, challenging, sociological theory. And even though it wasn't quite my cup of tea, I'm happy I took the class because a lot of what we read is informing my senior research.",
    "Overview of contemporary social theory. Take it if you need it for the major, but it wasn't exciting enough to merit taking for it's own sake.",
    "It seemed like the people who got the most out of this class were the people majoring in something other than Sociology. Maybe being forced to take a class sucks the life\/discussion out of people, but the class seemed genuinely interesting and the reading wasn't heavy.",
    "Take it if you're a Sociology major. It's pretty difficult and there is a lot of work",
