   "comments": [
    "This class is an incredible amount of work. But parts of it can be fun, and you will be proud of the work you have accomplished by the end of the semester.",
    "I would, it's way more fun than the fall studio.",
    "I found this studio to be a pleasant surprise after fall semester's. There is more work (which I didn't think was possible) but Joyce and Sunil make it bearable. The nature of the studio is more practical\/less conceptual, and it's nice to be working on one continuous project (you always have a precedent so you aren't starting with a blank page). Ask for help when you need it! I found the entire teaching team to be so much more flexible\/concerned about our wellbeing this semester. Really hope that Sunil stays on because he and Joyce are a great pair! Good luck!",
    "Great course! be prepared to produce a lot of work but it is a very fun progression of work and each step makes sense and you won't have to completely come up with new ideas. You bring ideas form the very beginning into your final works",
    "I came into this class thinking it would be the worst class I would ever take, and came out believing it is the best class I have ever taken. Joyce and Sunil are a great pair, matching hyperactivity with chill, specificity with abstraction, along with two distinct design aesthetics. I learned equally from both, and would strongly encourage them to teach the course again. The projects were smartly crafted: from synthetic drawings, to bento box, to landscape, to final building. I enjoyed seeing the translation from one project to the next as much as the critics did. I loved our review critics, and enjoyed the constant challenge to understand what they were saying and what they meant by their comments. This class pushes you to grow, and gives you all the room to exercise your creativity and learn new production methods. It will stretch you at some point, but in contrast to previous studios, it always seemed worth it this semester.",
    "I pulled one all nighter for Emmanuel, 4 for Bimal, and maybe 9 or 10 for this class and it is still, somehow, my favorite studio I've taken at Yale. Sunil and Joyce are a great pair and they will ask a lot out of you EVERY OTHER DAY, but you will know by the end of this semester if this is something you'll want to continue and you'll be proud to put everything you made in your portfolio.",
    "Even though you technically get more time per project than in the last studio, the amount of work, intensity and expectations in this studio are unbelievable. I thoroughly enjoyed it and think that having Sunil paired up with Joyce ended up being a fantastic combination. However I should say that I've aged about a decade in the course of the semester. Sleeping stopped being a requirement for me to function. Be prepared to work and produce like you've never done before.",
    "Studio!",
    "Buckle down and buckle up. It's fun but intense and overwhelming at times. Learn to manage studio and your other life; but don't be scared. Sunil and Joyce are a blast.",
    "This has been one of my favorite semesters in architecture. Joyce and Sunil work really well together but I don't think he'll be teaching undergrads again next semester so the class dynamic will probably change. I'd remember that you're going to be stuck with the food you choose the first week. People have said that's its more work than last semester, but it didn't really seem that way to me because you're constantly testing you're own ideas that generally relate to a type of program\/ actual use instead of being very abstract and only formal which I liked more than first semester.",
    "If you're taking this class, you're an architecture major and don't have a choice, so not recommending it is out of the question. I guess I'll use this public box to give you anonymous advice that will be ignored: don't expect to know exactly what you're supposed to be doing all of the time. You will feel utterly, completely lost with your project very often. It's fine! Just keep going and things will work themselves out one way or another. Not to say it won't be hard and the most infernally demanding thing you've gone through. But it will be OK."
