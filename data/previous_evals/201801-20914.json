    "This class helped me focus on my close reading skills, and gave me a good grounding in a variety of modern poets' work.",
    "This course improved my close reading skills in poetry. It also helped me craft literary arguments in a clear and effective way. It helped improve my oration skills around a seminar table.",
    "Professor North did a great job teaching the material. I appreciated his introductions to the texts, and I think he did a great job lining up our insights so that the class discussion was always moving toward something.",
    "A solid knowledge of English poets.",
    "I learned a lot about writing directly. I learned to format my argument well. I learned to prepare to talk about a topic for a long amount of time, which meant that I had to analyze it myself first, or read it at least twice before really getting the details.",
    "I developed a greater understanding of major English poetic works, from a perspective that focused on their literary significance as well as their relation to gender."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is neither a survey class or a course with a specific focus. Each week we rapidly move through time periods, not with the hope of getting to understand any of them, but only to learn how to close read and analyze. I wish we took more time to understand the periods within which we read. I felt the class went too quickly for a course that was not an overview of poetry.",
    "The strengths were due to Professor North. The weakness was Alexander Pope.",
    "This course has taught me so much about different ways of read, think about, discuss, and view poetry. I especially appreciated Professor Norths essay prompts, which were major learning experiences for me. I dont know if theres necessarily a way for the course to be improved. I did like the bits of literary theory that we readI would like a little more theory or introduction to texts like Aurora Leigh and Ondaatje. Otherwise I really loved how the other texts spoke to each other.",
    "This course is very strong in teaching students to read poetry with a more critical eye, as well as creating a greater dialogue in which students can place the works in a greater historical context and consider the gendered differences that characterize the poems. One weakness is that the last few works towards the end did not feel as cohesive within the greater context of the poems."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely. It is a good course to expose you to writers whose work builds off of one another and adds to the modern traditions of poetry, and it is a good chance to sharpen your critical writing skills.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise there arent many better poetry classes Yale that will bring you much more fulfillment.",
    "I would definitely recommend, to a student who wants to take 126, that s\/he take it with Professor North. He did an excellent job engaging everyone in the room with the texts, and I came away with a nuanced understanding of all the poets discussed (as well as the contexts that they wrote in).",
    "Joe North is a great professor to have for 126 if you have to take it for the major!",
    "This course is amazing!! Please take it! You will learn so much from the books you read, which span a couple hundred years but surround a particular theme. The essays themselves are exciting challenges in that you will be pushed to think about the work differently, but you will also learn so much through the writing process. Please take this class, especially with Professor North!",
    "Yes, if they are looking to develop a greater understanding and appreciation of poetry and especially if they are considering the English major."
