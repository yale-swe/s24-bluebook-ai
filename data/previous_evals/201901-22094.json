    "This course is AMAZING! Shiri is an outstanding professor who cares so much about her students and their learning. She is flexible and always willing to give feedback and amend the class to support students. It is fun and there is not much busy work. The only weaknesses of the course is that it is a fair amount of work, but Shiri really tries to keep it manageable.",
    "Strengths are use of digital media and personalized sections.",
    "I didn't always like the way grammar and new verbs are taught",
    "Strengths: The class was relatively low stress, but I learned a lot and my Hebrew greatly improved. I looked forward to class and there was a strong community among the students, teacher and TF. Weaknesses: Some of the homework felt tedious, but Shiri was responsive when we provided this criticism and was conscious to try to ensure that the work we did was meaningful and did not feel like \"busy work.\" The class was relatively unstructured, which sometimes made it more difficult to retain the information.",
    "A weakness was that this course was only twice a week and we didn't have a lot of time to practice speaking. In addition, we din't get many lists of vocabulary to learn, so we were at a loss for new words this semester.",
    "Strengths - unique teaching style that is based heavily on student goals and feedback provided in 1 on 1 meetings with the professor. Interesting course material and cool projects that were engaging. Weaknesses- in the beginning of the semester some of the work seemed like busy work, but this was amended later in the semester. Also, I was not a fan of yomanim"

   "comments": [
    "ABSOLUTELY! Shiri is wonderful and I actually feel my Hebrew has improved greatly after L4, i.e. I can speak and write much more organically.",
    "Yes, it is a great way to learn Hebrew.",
    "Yes, I think it is a fun course where you just get to develop your language skills",
    "Yes! I learned a lot in this class and it was relatively low-stress. I felt supported and engaged throughout the semester.",
    "Yes. This is the natural continuation of L3 and it is was a good, fun class.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to solidify their Hebrew or language learning skills. This was a fascinating, fun and engaging class. I have been taking Hebrew for several years, and this was by far my favorite course."
