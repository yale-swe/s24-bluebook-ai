    "None, because Ms. Wenyu Pan was such a terrible teacher, I had to drop the course.",
    "I developed some math skill, but most of the content covered was review of high school math.",
    "I developed the skill of learning and teaching myself topics outside of class, whether it was through videos or friends who had already taking the course.",
    "I managed to really learn how to apply oneself to a course and seek the teacher for extra help and go to office hours as much as possible. I also learned how to work harder and harder even when I thought not possible and devote as much time as possible to the course when it is needed. Lastly, I learned how to stick with something even when it is very hard to or seems impossible to succeed.",
    "I better developed my calculus skills so that I can take future math courses at Yale. I now how a better foundation in Calculus so that I can take a higher level of math.",
    "I have improved my precalculus skills a lot in this class."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: none Weaknesses: teachers",
    "English skills of instructor are sub par and detract from the learning of the students.",
    "This course is very helpful in teaching you differential and integral calculus but most of the teacher are unable to explicate topics in a manner that students can understand.",
    "I believe we can have more quizzes on less material and also have PSet office hours where students can come in and receive help on their PSets. I think since some of the students had either only done basic calculus or even precalc, the material needs to be explained more in depth or at a slower rate.",
    "The strengths of this course is that you are actually taught the material in class and then they expect you to do the homework. The class is well-taught and I did much better in this course than in Math 115. I prefer the way that Math 112 is taught than 115 is. I still do not like flipped classroom that much but it is used in a better way in Math 112. Weaknesses of the course are that sometimes the class was not very engaging. Multiple times the other students did not care and I felt bad for the instructor.",
    "The instructor was really bad and didn't answer questions so that wasn't really helpful.",
    "Better TAs. I felt like my TA could not do the best at exploring the subjects of the course"

   "comments": [
    "No. The teachers, specifically Ms. Wenyu Pan, are terrible.",
    "I mean, for an Econ major who only has to take one calculus course, this is the best option since all of the other courses are equally as poor in quality.",
    "I think I would not suggest this course directly but instead ask the student whether he or she requires it or not. I wouldn't have taken this course had it not have been required.",
    "This course was a prerequisite for me. Otherwise, I would have shopped and dropped it. I would advise people to only take this course if they are willing to do the extra work outside of class to make sure they excel in it. For the most part, the actual lessons do not do much to advance a student's understanding.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is very confident in their math skills and has a strong understanding of calculus and may have taken AP Calculus in high school.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students if they were not confident with their math skills. I prefer the way this class is taught compared to Math 115 so I would recommend this course over Math 115. The material was also presented in a good way that helped you fully understand the concepts.",
    "No, I really will not recommend.",
    "I'd recommend the course if they got the best TA."
