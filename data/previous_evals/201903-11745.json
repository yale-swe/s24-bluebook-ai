   "comments": [
    "No significant weaknesses to speak of. Materials (both primary and secondary) were interesting and engaging. Seminar structure was effective. Meeting room was not ideal, but that does not reflect on seminar itself.",
    "Annotated translations as assignments, a good way to learn how to properly translate things; anthropology theories as a companion, easy to bring back to Western scholarly context. suggestion: Other than the translation assignments, for secondary readings, it is better for students to write a response before the discussion.",
    "The course was excellently designed, with a high focus on a single text that allowed us to work deeply. There was also a wide range of secondary material presented, covering key scholarship on the topic of ritual."

    "For East Asian studies, Buddhist studies, etc.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in classical Chinese Buddhism."
