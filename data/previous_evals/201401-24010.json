    "It felt like there was a bit of a disconnect between the more conceptual ideas taught in class and some of the expectations for the problem sets...i spent a lot of time going in the wrong direction on some of the questions, and wouldn't have understood others without going to office hours. Both Eli and Rob were generous with help, however.",
    "This class was a great way of understanding how contemporary literature attempts to assign value to nature as capital. It provides a deep understanding of analytical methods and spreadsheet tools, and helps to improve command of Excel. It forces you to think in a new way about analyzing our environment in useful, policy-relevant ways.",
    "The syllabus did not flow logically - the difficult concepts could have used much more lecture time, whereas too much time was dedicated to demonstration and discussion.",
    "The class is very helpful, but focuses too much on the nitty gritty math. I think the class could be improved if more conceptual context was provided. This class is excellent for MESC students who want to do research on environmental economics, but could reach more students if it wasn't so math focused.",

    "Getting some of the intuition down for how natural capital is measured, and how different management approaches change optimal resource use. Very helpful professor and TA.",
    "Format was very interactive. Both Eli and Rob were very approachable and willing to help.",
    "big-picture applications, class discussions",
    "The enthusiasm of the students, the diversity of problems, and Eli's ability to parse through very difficult math and make it digestible. I was always hankering for more difficult or advanced problems because of how easily it all came.",
    "Lectures and discussions were great. Prof. Fenichel is lively, and is great about addressing students' questions and curiosities.",
    "The course was awesome and fills a much needed gap in the FES curriculum.",
    "Professor Fenichel responds well to students and is very encouraging when the material is difficult.",
    "Eli's ability to draw out the fundamental questions posed by natural resource economics (grounded in a strong understanding of natural science) as well as those areas where there is room to question traditional valuation."

    "The course sometimes felt a little disorganized in connecting lecture and problem sets, and in distinguishing between less critical concepts that wouldn't be discussed again and more critical concepts that would pop back up in a few weeks.",
    "Either lighter or more dispersed work load-- many assignments, exams, etc. came all at once at the end of the semester.",
    "Clarity of the written problem set\/midterm\/final questions. Sometimes they weren't full sentences...",
    "The 'fishing for beans' and 'climate chairs' exercises were a bit unnecessary (though fun). I think we could have gotten into some more 'meaty' material instead.",
    "Syllabus and scheduling.",
    "The problem sets essentially require hours of office hour help. I would rather have had weekly assignments that help cement the information than such long, difficult homeworks.",
    "Connecting class lectures largely grounded in calculus to real world examples. I think the big picture was clear, but sometimes individual classes felt too theoretical."
