    "Really great course for fulfilling the junior seminar requirement for the music major! It is definitely a LOT of reading, but Professor Z. is one of my favorite professors at Yale, and she will really improve your skills as a writer and a music scholar. The class is also fun because you trace a really broad timeline of music history (i.e. medieval chant to contemporary pop music), so it helps you think about music as a changing art that means different things to different people.",
    "Take it! Lots of reading, but quite worth it and not too dense.",
    "Amazing! It's a little early-music heavy, but thinking about authenticity applies to all the music we do and the reasons we give for doing it."
