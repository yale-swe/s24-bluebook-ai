   "comments": [
    "Although this course wasapparently pretty bad last year (based on the evals), it was much, much better this year. Professor Miller-Jensen made a huge effort to improve the course quality and the material is actually really fascinating stuff. My advice is to try not to get lost in her derivations of some of the concepts, as this was the most challenging part of the course. However, she is a really caring professor and I appreciated the improvements she made from last year.",
    "I would recommend BENG 351 to other students. It is a well-organized, well-taught class. The topics are very interesting and applicable.",
    "This class is about the the transport and reactions\/kinetics going on within a cell. It is very interesting because it applies concepts previously learned in differential equations to biological situations. I would recommend this course because the problem sets were not too hard and the information was interesting. However it should be noted that the three midterms are not easy.",
    "I really liked this class, and Prof. Miller-Jensen was great.bShe ties in lots of biological context to the class topics, which is nice. Problem sets are definitely doable, and satisfying. Would recommend!",
    "You'll have to take it if you're a BME major. It's a really interesting course and you learn a lot about different types of mass transport in cells. Prof. Miller-Jensen is really sweet and tries really hard to make the material relevant and easy to understand. The problem sets are manageable and the exams (for the most part) are fair.",
    "BENG 351 covers a lot of important and interesting material that's foundational to much of biomedical engineering. In general, I enjoyed the class largely because of that, although if you don't find the material interesting, I imagine it would be a much less enjoyable course. The workload in the first few weeks was pretty intense, but it quickly slowed down after the first midterm. Prof. Miller-Jensen is very nice and definitely wants everyone to succeed, but the lectures occasionally got bogged down in the details of simple math and became confusing. That being said, I do feel like I learned a lot during the course, and it was a positive experience overall.",
    "This is a decent class, much improved from what it had apparently been like the year before. Covers binding, reaction kinetics, and diffusion at an overview level. Not too much work overall.",
    "It is a course that explores the basic math and theory that biomedical engineers use to answer problems of how molecules move and bind to the cell.",
    "Very good quantitative explanations of a few broad biological processes",
    "Really great course. Material is very interesting, and the first look at a real BME course. Professor M-J is GREAT, such a sweetheart and a very good teacher. Work load was very manageable. I really liked the class structure too.",
    "Decent class. Only really need to take it tho if you're a BME major",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Don't listen to the reviews from last year- the class has been completely revamped and is now very organized and interesting. The homework is very doable, the lectures are fairly easy to follow and KMJ puts a lot of effort into making sure you know the material and are prepared for the exams. The class covers your basic cellular level kinetics, protein interactions, and diffusion. I would recommend it to any chemistry or biology-related major interested in small scale interactions.",
    "351 is a required course for BME, but its a really enjoyable class. The material presented is pretty straightforward and Prof. Miller-Jensen does a good job of connecting how what we learn is actually applied in BME research. Straightforward PSET each week and manageable exams (aka not the ones where everyone is meant to fail). Miller-Jensen really cares about her students--just look at her course evals from last year. She COMPLETELY revamped the course in response and continued to make adjustments throughout the semester based on our feedback.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this if you are interested in medicine\/biology\/drug development.",
    "This class basically ties in everything you've learned in past science courses and relates them to the principles of transportation within biological systems. The conceptual difficulty is not very high, but the class is competitive, and the midterms can be a bit of a time crunch. If you're a BME major, you have to take this, so you're probably not using the evals to decide whether or not to take it. If you're not a BME major but like quantitative thinking and problem solving in a BME setting, definitely take this class. You'll learn a lot.",
    "This was a really interesting course that focused on schematically and mathematically modeling the movement of molecules throughout the human body. It was challenging, but not too difficult, and the workload was moderate. The class, section, and problem sets all complimented each other in a way that allowed the material to build on itself. By the time I completed all of the problem sets, lectures, and sections for a particular unit of material, I felt like I had a comprehensive understanding of the information. Prof. Miller-Jensen was wonderful; she is a brilliant woman who really understood the material. She was extremely nice and approachable, and always had time to explain things if I was confused. I would really recommend this class. I thought it was fascinating, and it has encouraged me to pursue a biochemical focus within the field of biomedical engineering.",
    "It's a tough course but if one stays on top of things I suppose it'll be just fine. But definitely some background knowledge on differential equations is needed (especially towards the end of the class) since some things are skimmed over and not fully explained.",
    "BENG 351 is a really great class. If you are taking this class, you probably have to be taking it, but it's really good! Prof. Miller-Jensen is incredibly nice, and a very clear teacher. The problem sets are reasonable and the three tests are non-cumulative, which is really nice.",
    "I think it is not a bad class, it is also not too hard, so if you are a BME major, then you have to take this class! Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it."
