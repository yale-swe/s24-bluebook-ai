    "Perhaps because I was not able to complete the readings before the course began, I was expecting something different from this course. I thought the material covered would be more geared toward the decision process for project planning and design, but the course focused more on a specific tool used by non-profit groups.",
    "The concepts are good, the skills are important, the format is terrible. 2 weekends is not enough time for the content, and the long days were hard on motivation. Also, the client relationships, though interesting, were probably too much for the tiny course. 1\/2 the class was learning about the organization and it's mission, 1\/4 was learning software and 1\/4 was learning the concepts and processes.",
    "I think it would make more sense to fold the class into another course about similar topics and programs\/software that could be used.Two weekends are one way to work on it but it seemed that some groups were really slowed down and waiting for others - something that wouldn't happen if the class was held over a semester and students could take the project home to work on.Also, if it's a weekend course, there should be coffee and food available.",
    "No further comments",
    "This course was weird. There was way too much focus on how to use the software (available for purchase) and not nearly enough focus on how to think about designing and planning a conservation program.",

   "comments": [
    "It was really, really difficult to be in class for 4 eight-hour days, particularly in February when summer funding applications were due. A course with a more diffuse structure might be better.",
    "the time format was unfortunate. More time\/more spaced out time and maybe more time on the logic before going directly into the Miradi software would be good.",
    "time management - knowing how long to give students and sticking to the schedule. I felt there was a lot of downtime as my team waiting for the other teams to finish.",
    "Pace was too slow. WOuld be better to have everyone on computers doing exercises with instructor.",
    "Having more information about the clients and their work\/project of interest before the first class would have been helpfulThe all-day classes were not optimal for learning. I would have preferred more class sessions over long class sessions over a handful of days to learn and process the information in a better waySpent a lot of time learning about the project\/client during our assigned sessions which took away from time used to design the projectSome groups completed assignments before others, and because we presented our results to the entire group, there was often a lot of downtime where groups that finished early were waiting for other groups to complete the workWould have preferred presenting to the instructors once we finished our assignments, rather than the whole class, because after our presentations most of the time was spent with instructors giving us feedback that wasn't useful to people not in the particular group. Perhaps next time the individual groups could do a presentation to the entire class on the last day, rather than every single day. Most students were unfocused for the end of the day presentations so we didn't get much out of them",
    "It would be helpful to get exposure to the entire adaptive management process, even if choosing a single case study that everyone worked on.",
    "Timing, projects design exercises",
    "The duration - additional portions (or its entirety) of the framework should be studied and applied in more detailThe software has room for improvement",
    "I think the pace could have been much faster& the lectures more engaging.",
    "It should be sold as what it is-- as TSM in a particular software--Miradi-- which is marketed pretty hard and used as a tool in solving conservation problems. The software is interesting, but particularly flawed in dealing with complex human problems, and a little dated in its approach. We talked very little about the integration of monitoring and evaluation data into reshaping programs.",
    "The teaching. The women didn't really have a good way of explaining the material. They often forgot to mention things. And really the whole course was focused on how to use their software.",
    "Clearer expectations would help, as well as perhaps trying to cover less content but covering areas more in depth.",
    "Length of course could be extended",
    "I wish we could see our conservation project through more or that they were more real world. I also did not like that the course was taught to one software program (Miradi)."

However, knowing that this tool is widely used by non-profit groups I am glad that I will be able to confidently use Miradi in my career and will use that to my advantage when applying for jobs.",

There are very few courses at FES that are related to conservation science and planning, so I am glad this course was offered and I hope the school will continue adding conservation classes to the curriculum.",
