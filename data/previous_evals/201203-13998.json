   "comments": [
    "The course is a nice overview of a plethora of Empires and their internal dynamics. Its themes are very interesting, and class discussion, though sometimes relatively unstructured, is very enlightening. Take this class if you're interested in a class that combines sociology, history and political science.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you're at all interested in empires. Good mix of economics, politics, social theory, etc. Fun. You won't learn all that much about \"how imperialism works\" so to speak from a philosophical\/theoretical point of view, but you'll go over many imperial civilizations and you YOURSELF will form the connections that tell you \"how imperialism works\".",
    "You should take this class. It is an easy writing credit for those who might need one, and it provides an interesting perspective on the processes of imperialism. It doesn't focus on one specific empire, so if you're hoping to get an in-depth picture of the history of empires, you'll be disappointed. Overall, though, the reading load is easy, and there are only two papers.",
    "I would. It is a good overview of the major empires and really pushed me to look at modern society through the lens of imperialism and critically analyze the possibility of empires today.",
    "It isn't a political theory course, so knowing that going in is important. The professor didn't seem to like philosophical arguments, but wanted to keep things more on a historical level. It was a fine course, but not amazing.",
    "Very interesting course. If you are by any means interested in empires, you will not be disappointed. Usually a small class (around 10 people), good discussion. By the way, should be a fairly light WR."
