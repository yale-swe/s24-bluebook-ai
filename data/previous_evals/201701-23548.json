    "The course was intense but an excellent learning experience for me.",
    "A must take energy class. Ken is an excellent teacher, really puts thought and effort into structuring the class, all of the material, problem sets and readings. He is also great at lecturing and leading an engaging discussion.",
    "The course was oversubscribed, although I assume the enrollment of 51 was due to its unavailability in Spring 2016. This large class did not affect lectures but did make it all but impossible to attend office hours (which were confined to a small room designed for six people). The course lacked sufficient coverage of quantitative methods that were tested on problem sets.",
    "The course was a lot more work than anticipated - four problem sets, one group presentation + paper, and final exam. It was challenging to try to get everything done in time and keep up with the readings.",
    "Less problem sets -- material was often not relevant or had us learn skills that is not needed to understand subject. I suggest a paper or an exam",
    "Tremendous course overall. Ken is a great teacher and Yale is lucky to have him.",
    "This course provided a much needed discussion of energy policy issues, which otherwise feels lacking at FES. This area is invaluable towards any study of energy and environmental issues and should be continued for future years. Ken Gillingham offered clear and engaging lectures, and I would definitely recommend this class to future students.",
    "The overall course readings sometimes are too theoretical and lack to practical application in a context other than research.",
    "8-12: This course is an excellent overview of energy economics and policy. Ken is a deeply knowledgeable and excellent lecturer, the readings are very interesting and the group paper is an excellent way to dig deeper into a topic of interest."

   "comments": [
    "The breath of content covered in the course was one of its strongest aspects. I found the sections on oil and gas markets and transportation policy to be most beneficial because I knew very little about the economic impacts of policy in these sectors.",
    "Readings",
    "Range of topics, all interesting, all very well explained, very interesting readings, and interesting problem sets.",

    "The readings, quality of lecture, engagement of the professor iwth the class.",
    "Great papers and great insights from professor and TAs",
    "Great class discussions. Ken was always willing to entertain questions and listen to different perspectives about various issues.",
    "The lectures were engaging, the exams were challenging but fair, and the final project was a great way to apply what we learned in class to a real world context.",
    "Lectures were well-prepared, engaging, and connected with the readings well.",
    "The course was extremely well organized and structured. Professor Gillingham would upload the readings for class a week in advanced, as well as his slides the day before. All this assignments had a clear purpose, from the problem sets to the group project to the in-class exam.",
    "Best aspects: the professor is very competent",
    "Professor Gillingham does an excellent job teaching to students with all levels of energy familiarity. He is one of FES's finest professors, and course demand (51 students) for an 8:45 class clearly shows interest for energy topics.",
    "A wide range of project topics to choose from.",
    "Definitely the course lectures. Professor Gillingham does an exceptional job working class discussion into the materials he teaches, making the class interactive even with a fairly large class.",
    "Professor Gillingham is terrific; the course was very comprehensive and all-encompassing - really enjoyed it!",
    "Very interesting discussion of readings and very useful group project.",
    "Content and expert analysis often given by the lecturer (and sometimes by extremely knowledgeable students in the class)",
    "Ken's thoughtful summaries of complicated readings.",
    "Provided an in-depth and comprehensive overview around different areas of energy policy",
    "The best aspects were understanding how economics and policy interact and the policy paper which let students dive into a topic they were interested in and really understand the economic impacts of a policy. I also really enjoyed the readings.",
    "Very well organized. Contents are interesting and helpful too.",
    "Ken was really engaging and his instructional methods were really strong. Also the subject matter was broadly applicable and very well put together.",
    "This course provided a great overview of a variety of energy policy topics and specific explanation of economic modeling for some of these topics (SCC, oil markets, etc). I also appreciated the opportunity to conduct a deeper dive into energy policy and markets through the presentation and paper assignment.",
    "This course should be required for any energy student. Gillingham brings fantastic industry and policy insights to lecture, and he does a wonderful job of engaging such a large class (40 students) every Tue and Thur at 8:45 AM. I learned a ton from this course, and I come from an energy efficiency background. I feel like the case studies and economic concepts lent a lot of depth to my understanding of valuing the energy system and services. I will definitely apply what I've learned to my future career in renewables.",
    "The teaching and the project work",
    "This course provided a deep dive into policy framework of the energy sector in the US. As an international student this really helped to understand the present legislation and how they vary within states. The Economic analysis was quite useful in evaluating the impact of legislation on a particular group e.g households,manufactures etc.",
    "The class lectures and readings",
    "It is one of the few policy analysis courses that uses (basic) quantitative tools. I wish there were more courses like this one for other topics (e.g. land use).",
    "The variety of themes explored during the semester.",
    "The lectures and the group project (if you don't mind it being extremely time intensive)!",
    "Ken's lecture style is very clear and engaging and the way he asks questions and promotes students' participation keeps us awake at a 8.45 am class!"

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "The class covered a lot of important concepts in energy economics, but very little time was devoted to talking through the quantitative components of policy and economic analyses. I found it challenging to complete the economic analysis because I was given little time to practice the required skills in class.",
    "Cap the class to 25 or so.",
    "We weren't taught how to actually do the economic analysis used in the homework assignment. It would be useful to do this instead of just reading articles.",
    "Many students I think struggled with the methodology portion of their final projects, and could have used a bit more guidance in the beginning of the semester.",
    "Not letting random student questions take the lecture off-track.",
    "I think the problem sets were too disjointed from the rest of the class. We almost never talked in class about the types of quantitative economic questions we received on problem sets. I think part of that was Ken's expectation that we had already taken the intro FES economics class or equivalent, but even the people who had just taken that class the semester before struggled with what the problems sets were asking for. In the future, it might serve the class well to be a bit more tied to the problem sets, or alternatively make the problem sets less economics-heavy to better align with the class material.",
    "This course had a lot of work - readings for each class, 4 large problem sets, a midterm exam, a final exam, a final group project, and a final project presentation. I would narrow the workload so students can focus on doing each assignment well.",
    "If Paige\/Hao could write comments where points were deducted in the problem sets, we could better understand our mistakes and not have to find them during their office hours.",
    "The lecture tended to move a bit slow - I think it could be more challenging - but the problem sets were very tough, and the mismatch was frustrating.",
    "Office hours should be held in a room large enough to accommodate at least half the enrolled class. A semi-monthly recitation session outside class hours could be used to cover quantitative techniques asked in problem sets. The problem sets' quantitative questions were so frustrating as to inhibit learning and understanding. To liven up lectures, perhaps students (or TAs) could give an occasional presentation on topics. I appreciate the \"policy analysis\" portion; it was covered in reference to social cost of carbon, but I would appreciate a general framework to become a better policy practitioner.",
    "The homework seemed very disjointed from what we covered in class. It would be very helpful to teach the calculus or at least mention that something like derivatives will be needed in the homework, as most people havn't done that since high school.",
    "Course material discussed in class was very qualitative, and homework assignments were quite quantitative, so it would have been helpful to do a few things with problem solving in class...",
    "The problem sets took a lot of time and were only worth a total of 20% of the grade. I think it would be fairer to make them worth at least 25-30% of the grade.",
    "There was a lot of work for this class--roughly double other comparable classes. I'd suggest cutting some work in the future (either the problem sets, the exam, or both). Because we had so much work I was never able to do the readings, which seemed to be one of the most valuable parts of the class!",
    "Reading material workload is extremely high (given the other workload most students have to sift through). The reading is very relevant, but it becomes rather difficult to keep up with all the material as the semester moves along",
    "There was some overlap with other energy classes such as ESA.",
    "This course needs a weekly discussion section to go over the problem set materials. Problem sets are very different to what we do in class and we never really went over them in detail other than in the exam review sessions. The TA office hours were far too full for any real value to be gained. I don't think we learned that many policy analysis tools. In our group, the person who ended up doing the analysis was someone who had done it in her previous job.",
    "The course focuses on various author's economic analysis to inform policy decision. However, the course is not focused on teaching current students how to do those studies. It is not a prerequisite but somehow it is expected that students already know how to do these economic analysis because that is not taught in class.",
    "Readings are a bit too much sometimes.",
    "More attention could be paid to instructing toward the homework assignments - often the sections or classes didn't provide the technical skills needed to complete homework assignments. While this may be due to my own lack of substantive background in economics, it could have been compensated for more attentively.",
    "I would be interested in a subsequent course that takes a similar approach of energy economics and policy analysis with a focus on international energy markets. Essentially, I think it could be valuable to take the themes covered in the course and apply them to international contexts in developed and developing economies. It would also be great for such an approach to leverage this course and build on it. In addition, the final exam felt like it was longer than the time allotted for it. Although I felt I understood the concepts, I was ultimately rushed at the end and did not have sufficient time to convey my understanding. Some of the questions in the final and homeworks were also occasionally poorly worded, and could have used additional clarity.",
    "Nothing. This course was exactly what I was hoping to get out of my time at FES.",
    "Overall, this class was excellent and I highly recommend it. My only suggestion would be to better coordinate the problem sets with the class topics\/ lectures since the problem sets were very challenging and the class did not seem to equip students to complete the psets.",
    "The group project selection process was slightly disorganized",
    "The readings could have a less research intensive focus. Some of the students are eager to apply the concepts in the business environment, and are not particularly interested in research. The final project offers this option, but the readings don't.",
    "The group project was extremely time intensive--like a class onto itself almost!",
    "I am not sure how helpful the problem sets are outside of academic setting. I know they are important to help understand academic concepts but I wonder if there is a way to make them more useful for the majority of students who want to go into professional careers."

    "I am focused on the intersection of energy regulatory policy and new markets for clean energy technologies, so this course is integral to these studies.",
    "This course deepened my understanding of the valuation of energy systems and services, which underlies all my other energy coursework. Specifically, the weeks we spent on market failures and policy mechanisms to address them was really interesting and valuable. I'm not planning to work on energy policy in the future, but how to value energy resources is relevant to all careers in energy, and this course definitely strengthened my understanding of how energy is priced.",
    "My previous experienced with energy policies was rather limited and local but this course gave me an understanding of the US energy polices and their economic impacts and a peep into what happens in other countries. This is quite useful as I can borrow lessons from such case studies when developing or advocating for the right policies in my country-Kenya",
    "This class was integral to my studies and provided an excellent overview of energy economics and policies.",
    "The application the science in the energy field is valuable to my overall goal and focus on the energy and environment.",
    "I was trying to decide whether to focus on energy or sustainable food systems, and while absolutely excellent, this course made me realize that I am not interested enough in energy to dedicate my career to it. This was a very valuable learning!"

    "Absolutely",
    "Exceeded!",
    "This course involves rigorous exploration of topics in the field of energy economics. Informative and inspiring. This course shapes my understanding of the complexities of the energy issue, with which I could become a better analyst\/investor in this sector.",
    "Yes, it was very helpful",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Yes, this course was very useful.",
    "Yes",
    "No. My expectation was to learn to do economic and econometric analysis o guide policy decision and not only learn how to interpret other author's work",
    "yes",
    "Totally.",
    "Mostly yes, I would have benefitted more from more instruction on the actual economic equations and how to do them, but this is likely again due to my own lack of experience on the material.",
    "This course provided a deeper dive into the economic and policy research available on concepts I was superficially familiar with. The one area I would have liked to spend greater time on is electricity markets and regulatory environments. Although I enjoyed the discussion around California's electricity markets, it felt like we could have learned significantly more with exploration of other electricity markets.",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to any of my energy-focused mentees.",
    "Yes",
    "I was impressed by the outcome. We were able to work on a solar project as a team of four with the guidance of the lecturer and TAs and the report will be shared with National Renewable Energy Laboratory.",

   "comments": [
    "See answers above.",
    "Group work can land some people in tricky situations if they are not personally familiar with other people in the class - and can lead to forming groups with group members who do not carry their weight. The large amount of marks given for the group work can be a risk for students who perform well in other parts of the course but have a group which may perform not so well. Having a group project is nevertheless a great way to get more familiar with one or more aspects of the course",
    "Professor required that groups get set up early, which is excellent. Despite that, group work moved at a very slow pace.",
    "The group work is definitely a compromise!",
    "somehow too much freedom at choosing topics",
    "It was useful to work in a group so that no one member had as much of the work burden. However, there were some people who did not pull their weight as much, which was frustrating. Perhaps there could be a small component of the grade that is based on how others perceived you as a group member.",
    "I think this course, and F&ES in general, should spend more time teaching F&ES students about group work strategies and dynamics. There are many challenges inherent to group work which will be present for the rest of our time at Yale and in our professional careers. I think that teaching about how to manage groups and work with people is a gap in the education at F&ES.",
    "I learnt a lot from my group mates who had a lot more experience than me. I was lucky to also have a group mate that knew a lot about environmental economics. My discussions with the group, and especially with this individual, helped me to understand core concepts more deeply and see how they may be applicable in the real world.",
    "Adv: working in a collaborative environment Disadv: for individuals, the training might be not enough in group projects",
    "Group work is always challenging, and this course was no exception. Starting early on the group project is key.",
    "I learned to effectively negotiate with group members and get things done.",
    "Advantages - In depth analysis done on an energy related topic - Vast amount of knowledge and experience gathered from doing the group project Disadvantages - Workload for project is quite high (but necessary)",
    "We were able to debate the issues and accomplish a lot more as a group. I'm glad the final project was in a group format.",
    "The disadvantage is that my classmates that are actual economist knew how to do the analysis that we were supposed to learn in class while the rest was playing catching up",
    "I had a great group that met regularly, kept to deadlines, communicated clearly, and was good at making group decisions. For us, this was a great experience to benefit from each other's skillsets and dive into a topic that interested us.",
    "We could finish a project in limited time with cooperation between team members. While free riders do exist, and the uneven work is not recognized during evaluation.",
    "My group was very challenging to work with. It was a good learning experience though conducting group research.",
    "Yes, we have one large group project. My group was well-organized, and we worked really well together. It was my favorite group project of the semester. We met for an hour each week to make sure we stayed on top of data analysis and write-ups.",
    "Working in groups allows for diversity of thoughts which is quite useful when handling a project. The diversity however may also be a challenge when others do not appreciate the contributions of other team members. Working in a team also helped me appreciate different personalities and how they work. Their views and their personal preferences.",
    "The advantage was collaborating with others on a project. The challenge was trying to balance the workload as there were some in the group that did too little work and others that tried to do it all.",
    "Some members of the group were to intense in sharing their opinion; and their personal schedule create several conflicts within the group. The value of this is to learn to manage different expectations and priorities in the same project.",
    "It was a great way to dig deep into a topic, and I came out really feeling I understood deeply. However, it is extremely time consuming!!!",
    "I learned a lot from my classmates who had more background in energy than me. We also tried hard to distribute the work fairly among group members, with some people put in more time in the beginning and others at the end, which was essential for group harmony!"

    "Having a foundation in energy or economics is important, but the pre-requisites for the course may not be exactly required.",
    "It is a very good course. Be prepared to work a lot.",
    "Professor Gillingham is an excellent instructor. This course covers a lot and is critical for nearly all students studying energy and climate issues.",
    "A rewarding course.",
    "This class will be a lot of work, but at the end you'll be proud of all the work you've done and content with the learnings you've accumulated.",
    "This is a great class - a lot of work but great opportunity to learn.",
    "This class is a LOT of work. Think carefully beforehand.",
    "Take it.",
    "You should definitely take this course. But take the prerequisite and be prepared for some serious economics.",
    "This course offers a valuable overview of the various concepts that energy policy experts need to be cognizant of when working in the energy industry. Anyone studying energy issues at FES should definitely take this course. The paper and presentation are also useful opportunities for more in depth exploration of key topics, so consider that when you're picking a topic to work one, make sure it's one you want to know more about in the context of your career.",
    "Take this course if you want to understand why certain market incentives exist and what the underlying challenges to deploying renewables are from a policy perspective.",
    "It is an excellent course that requires open-mindedness. It is majorly a discussion based class and it would be best to read in advance.",
    "If you are interested in energy policy this class is absolutely essential. Yale is lucky to have a professor as knowledgeable, experienced, organized and talented as Professor Gillingham. The readings were fascinating and the class lectures were very well prepared. This was one of the best classes I have taken so far at FES!",
    "The readings are sometimes too theoretical. Be strategic in what to read and what to screen. The final project is a great opportunity to learn more about a given topic.",
    "Take the course!",
    "If you are interested in energy, this is a must-take class. Ken is a superb lecturer, you will love every single class. Also, try to do the readings, they are very useful and it's great that Ken assigns key articles\/chapters to us so we don't get overwhelmed and know what's most critical to read."
