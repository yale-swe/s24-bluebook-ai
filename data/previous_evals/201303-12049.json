    "I would absolutely recommend the class.",
    "It's a lot of work, but as with most things, it's doable if done little by little every day.",
    "Chem 116L is an introduction to lab techniques and skills. I would recommend this course to students intending to major in any type of science or intending to pursue a career in research. While the lab content was not as helpful, I definitely became more efficient and comfortable with handling tools and working independently in a lab setting.",
    "A fun way to spend a Friday afternoon (minimal sarcasm). But don't think I learned how to do lab reports.",
    "I would summarize it as an Intro to Chem lab, introducing students to the lab and lab procedures. Yes, it was a fun way to put what we were learning in class into action.",
    "I would only recommend chemistry 116L if you need to take the lab course for your intended major or pre-professional program.",
    "The course is not particularly enjoyable, but you will learn a lot about chemistry. I found that I was better able to understand chemistry concepts that I learned in lab than those that I learned in Chem 114. Lab reports are often tedious, but they do help you to better understand the material. The weekly quizzes are good motivators to ascertain that you are familiar with the experiment, which will make your experiments run much more smoothly. A lesson on how to do to do excel graphs at the beginning of the year would have been helpful. If you don't need to take it, I would not recommend it. However, you do get a large sense of satisfaction upon completion.",
    "116L like most labs it a little more work than it should be (mostly 'busy' work), but a straight forward introduction to the practical chemistry lab. Take it out of necessity.",
    "This lab was straightforward and necessary if you want to have a strong foundation for the practical uses of chemistry. However, if you're just taking Chem 112\/114 for a Sc credit and don't want to pursue the pre-med track, I wouldn't recommend taking this lab.",
    "I would not recommend Chem 116 to another student unless it were a requirement for him or her. It may only worth half a credit, but it was my hardest and most stressful class, and not worth the effort unless necessary.",
    "Chem lab is not very thrilling -- you take it because you have to. It also is not very hard because to do well in it you have to be a robot. Each step of the lab is described in the lab manual, as it how to write each lab report. You become good at using the equipment in the lab, but that's about all you learn, apart from how to write a Dr. G. style lab. The course could be improved by asking the students to think.",
    "Chem 116L teaches you all the lab basics you need. So if you plan on doing any future labs this class is a definite must. The first couple experiments are pretty basic and somewhat unnecessary, but after that it gets a lot better.",
    "Chemistry 116L 01 is an introductory lab course, which means that it teaches you basic techniques, but it is also tedious and time-consuming. I would recommend this to someone who plans to major in a science or needs a lab credit for a pre-professional track because it is a relatively easy way to fulfill the prerequisite. However, beware, it is not a fun course.",
    "Yes; especially if taking chem 114 (reinforces topics learned in class).",
    "If youre taking it, it means you have to take it anyways. Definitely a good basic lab course.",
    "It's a lot better than Chem 114 with some interesting experiments mixed into the mundane.",
    "Chem 116L is often taken as a requirement for a major but that doesn't mean it's not fun! Some of the labs were a little stressful but for the most part they were rewarding. It's fun to do something with your hands instead of just sitting in lecture.",
    "the labs are not bad the lab reports take a long time to complete.",
    "The lab was fun overall but I found the pre lab quizzes very difficult. It was not always clear what we would be tested on so make sure you know the experiment before hand.",
    "It's Chem lab, 4 hours of hard concentration. But you'll get through it. Just study for the quizzes the night before and make sure you're super careful on the final exam.",
    "I would say this course is a great way to get your lab requirement out of the way. I would recommend it because Dr. G is great, but labs are very long so I would not recommend it if you do not need to take it.",
    "Take it! Especially if you are taking 114 it helps you with the class and its fun. It is somewhat more difficult for the students in 112 because they go in a different order but it's a great course made me actually enjoy lab! Also realize it's four hours! which does suck but there is only like ten weeks overall and there are some classes where we get out an hour early!",
    "If you have to take a lab course, this is a fine one to take. The four hours can be long, and lab reports are somewhat tedious, but the lab isn't actually that hard.",
    "The instructors and T.A.s are wonderful, but lab itself is not. Doing lab for fun can be rewarding; doing lab because you are pre-med can be exhausting.",
    "CHEM 116 lab is a good intro to standard lab techniques. The grading can be very harsh but you get used to it after a few reports. The experiments are generally interesting and relatively understandable.",
    "CHEM 116L is a gen chem lab which teaches students a lot about lab procedure and about the equipment in lab. i would recommend CHEM 116L to another student who wishes to pursue the sciences or work in a lab.",
    "General, step-following introductory lab course. Manageable.",
    "A really time consuming class that can be quite tedious. It teaches you basic lab technique but focus on doing a thorough and neat job on data sheets or your grade will suffer. Don't sweat the quizzes as much as the lab reports.",
    "Okay course. Be prepared for work and don't take it on a Monday!",
    "This course requires a lot of time management skills and there is a lot of work that comes with the course in the form of lab reports. I would only recommend this course to someone who really enjoys lab work and has good time management skills.",
    "Chem 116L is a great introduction to laboratory work, no matter one's background in chemistry or research. Some of the lab reports take up a lot of time, however the work is generally very manageable. Dr. G is very clear and explains each lab before the beginning of the experiment. The teaching fellows are also generally very helpful.",
    "Chem 116L was a very good lab course. I felt that I learned a lot about practical techniques in the lab and I feel very well prepared for the next 117L Section.",
    "Never take with chem 112. Take chem 114.",
    "This course should really only be taken if absolutely necessary as a prereq. While it is not difficult to do well in the course, it is only worth a half credit and entails far more work than other full credit courses. I learned very little in this course and found the lab write ups extremely long and tedious.",
    "Chemistry 116L introduces you to the basic techniques used inside of a chemistry lab. I would recommend this class to anyone who wishes to learn more about the practical methods used in a chemistry lab.",
    "Definitely work and it sucks at times but not bad in the end, just do it.",
    "It was fun A lot of work but definitely worth it.",
    "Yes! Take it! Stressful, but easy to get a good grade if you put in the effort.",
    "I recommend this class only if it is necessary. It is very tedious and takes up quite a bit of time but if it is necessary for major I recommend taking it with the appropriate general chemistry class.",
    "Fun class, not difficult.",
    "Unfair lab if you are in Chem 112.",
    "Don't save labs for the last minute! Also, study for the prelab quizzes!",
    "Yes, I recommend the class. The labs were not too difficult and some of them were actually quite fun.",
    "It is useful especially if you have little to know prior lab experience. The grading can be harsh with respect to notation used in the lab write-ups.",
    "This is an okay lab course, especially considering that you are probably taking it for your major. There's a fair amount of work, with the weekly quizzes and the lab reports, plus the stress of doing the actual experiment. But it is doable, if not totally pleasant. A good intro to lab techniques and safety, and does reinforce some ideas learned in lecture.",
    "yes. it was a fair, fun and helpful class",
    "It takes a lot of time, some of it necessary, but a lot of it very basic. I would not recommend it to another student who has done lab work before.",
    "Chem 116L is an intro lab course, helpful for if you would like to go on and do more laboratory courses in the future.",
    "As long as you do the lab reports right you will be good.",
    "Necessary to learn the basics of lab technique. Also fun and engaging.",
    "The labs sometimes take a long time but they are not all that hard and its not that hard to get good results if you know the material.",
    "It is a good lab to take but very time consuming.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is taught well and is actually interesting.",
    "Take it if you have to. Dr. G is a stickler about the smallest things, and he'll take off points if your lab write-up doesn't meet his standards. Just make sure everything you turn in is well-polished and you'll be fine.",
    "A chore of a class. Presumably, though, you are not considering taking this class willingly, but because you are required to. Rest assured that the class is not overly challenging - just tedious and more work than a 0.5 class should merit. The instructors seem to be fairly good, the problem is simply that an intro chem lab is inherently mind-numbing.",
    "It is a good lab course to take. The techniques and processes of basic lab work is learned in this course. I would recommend it for a chemistry student.",
    "I would summarize Chemistry 116L asa very interesting and useful experience for anyone who wants to pursue a career in the sciences and needs to learn basic laboratory skills as well as some interesting experiments that enhance understanding of the material taught in general Chemistry courses.",
    "Highly recommended introductory chemistry lab course.",
    "Intro lab course that requires a lot of work in and out of the classroom.",
    "Chem 116 can be frustrating at times and the labs are boring but overall it's a very good course and I recommend it if you have to take chemistry lab. It's not hard and Dr. G is helpful and fair.",
    "Yes, it is a good way to get familiar with the lab equipment.",
    "This course was a great introduction to lab technique and equipment. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "The class wasn't too bad, but beware, the lab reports are tedious.",
    "Chem 116 Lab was the basics of lab work and chemistry. If you're pre med and pre vet, or any science really, you need to take this and i suggest you work hard from the start because youll gain valuable science lessons for the future. If you're not a science major, don't take it. The lab reports are not worth the \"interest\" of the class, although as a necessary lab it wasn't that bad.",
    "If you are looking to take basic gen level chemistry and learn about titration then this is the class for you.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to, but if you do have to it's not bad. The lab's are interesting and besides taking up a lot of your time, it's not that difficult.",
    "A good introductory lab. All the experiments worked, we usually had more than enough time, and nothing was too difficult. Not terribly interesting, but nothing you will resent having to take.",
    "It was a good intro lab class",
    "Chem 116 is a great introduction to the lab life, covering lots of the basics of lab work. It's not too much work if you don't put off the lab reports for the last minute. I would recommend it to those who are interested in science\/pre-med but without much prior experience.",
    "Chem 116L is a great way to get comfortable in the lab performing chemistry experiments. It is a good introduction to the most utilized lab equipment and techniques.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this lab especially as it complements CHEM 114 very well.",
    "I would recommended this lab as a pre requisite for hopefully more exciting experiments. The only problem is that the sessions are long, and some experiments very repetitive, but I realize this is important to introduce all techniques.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a great lab class. It helps reinforce key concepts that you learn in the class. The experiments are fun to perform. The TAs are extremely helpful sources of information. The lab may be a bit time consuming, but it is definitely worth it if you want to do well in the class.",
    "CHEM 116L was a pretty standard general chemistry lab. We didn't learn any particularly complicated technical lab strategies or do anything particularly complicated in general, but it was still fun and interesting and provided a solid foundation for work in a lab. Although, for only a half a credit, Chemistry 116L was a lot of time and work. The lab itself is four hours long, and the lab reports take a pretty significant amount of time and work as well.",
    "I would recommend the lab. The expectations are reasonable -- even for someone who conducted no lab experiments in high school. Prepare properly and you will succeed.",
    "It's fairly straightforward, but don't ever come to lab unprepared. It's all in the lab manual, so read it over before you arrive to lecture. Once you do that, expect the lecture to be incredibly illuminating, and the TA's demo even more so. The instructors are very adept at clarifying things.",
    "I would recommend Chem lab for a student who would like to do more labs in the future and wants a good, solid introduction to lab technique. The lab reports can be time consuming, but you learn a lot that will be useful in the future.",
    "The class is long and a lot of work, but nothing is too difficult. Study the procedure for the quizzes, start the reports early, and you will be fine. The class can be a little tedious, but it is not the worst class out there.",
    "Chem 116L is an introductory chemistry lab class. I would recommend it to other students. I found the class informative and enjoyable. I didn't really like the idea of having a 4 hour lab once a week, but during the lab, I didn't mind. I am a little kid at heart, so I like making pretty colors. I got to do that several times in this class. I enjoyed that.",
    "It was a good class to take alongside Chemistry 114, but I would definitely recommend taking with 114 and not after. If you get anything wrong on a quiz, make sure you understand it because I didn't always know what I got wrong on quizzes, which led to some confusion.",
    "Basic gen chem lab. You are taking it because you have to, so there is not much I could say. Eat before lab cause 4 hours is a long time, and review the labs beforehand so you know what you are doing when you get there. Also, don't save the reports for the last minute- they are easy, so just do them early in the week.",
    "CHEM 116L can fill a prereq for premed, so if you're thinking about premed, it's a good idea to do this lab. Also, if you have no lab experience, or very little, it's a great introduction. I would recommend it.",
    "Great course with relevant material. Would highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend Chemistry 116L 01 to any student looking for a good introductory level chemistry lab. The labs are well planned and the lab reports are simplified.",
    "This is a very basic lab course. It is a requirement, and is boring. However, it is useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chem 116L if a student is taking a general chemistry course even if their major\/ per-professional requirements don't include it. It really helps students to grasp concepts learned in the lecture courses and to also understand how to apply techniques in a research environment.",
    "The structure of this class is well planned, because we have a quiz at the beginning of every lab. It prepares us well for the labs and it helps us understand the matter and the purpose of the lab. Dr. G was extremely helpful and he gave good explanation about the lab. He takes his time to explain the lab and his marking is fair. If you do the work and are prepared for the lab, it might be an easy A.",
    "Metaphorically speaking, it's a course that guides you through dipping your feet into an ocean of work. The procedures and lab reports are all written out; all you need to do is read the procedure before lab, write a brief method outline, do the lab correctly, and fill out the lab reports. I had an evening (6-10pm) section, which isn't nearly as bad as it sounds because the lecturer, Dr. V, is just amazing. I'd recommend taking it concurrently with Chem 114, since it does explain and demonstrate topics taught in 114.",
    "As with many lab courses, 116L is a course that you should probably take only if it is required for your major. Though the class meets only once a week, having 4 hours of class straight is often tiring and can be problematic if you don't schedule your lab day well in relation to your other classes. That being said, the amount of work spent outside the lab (lab reports mostly) is not overbearing and changes from week to week depending on the lab being presented. The material taught is not too demanding, and Dr. G and the TAs are more than willing to help you no matter the question. Some of the experiments take the whole allotted time to complete so you must work with some pace, leading to a bit of stress if you don't have an understanding of the lab procedure before coming to lab. On the other hand, many of the experiments are interesting and cover a diverse number of topics.",
    "Take this lab even if you're just doing it for the credit. It's not too difficult if you do the prelab ahead of time. Also, Dr. G is nice if you try and follow instructions.",
    "Good first lab at Yale, good intro to working in a chemistry lab. I would recommend it as a lab or to get some experience in a lab.",
    "Chemistry 116L is a great lab course. It's truly an introductory course, in that one does not need any prior college-level chemistry preparation or any prior lab experience. I would recommend that the student keep in mind that the time required to complete lab reports can varywidely from week to week, so always leave plenty of time to do them. It is usually not the questions or the parts of the lab report that require analysis, but the tedious, data-entering parts of the reports that cause them to be so time-consuming, so be careful with that."
