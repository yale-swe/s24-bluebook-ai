    "An absolute must take for any math major, especially if Professor Minsky is teaching it!",
    "The material can be fairly interesting, though a bit slow at times. There was a take-home midterm and take-home final which I have mixed feelings about. They each provided some interesting problems and were in themselves more fun than an in-class test, but they also took up a lot (really all) of my time, which was somewhat annoying during reading period. Prof. Minsky was a great lecturer. He is enthusiastic and knows how to let students help in lecture by slowly guiding us.",
    "Very good math class, covering Lebesgue measure and integration, L1 and L2 spaces, Fourier analysis, and some additional topics (like the heat equation and Hausdorff dimension). The workload was fairly heavy, although Minsky is a good professor and the lectures tied in with the problem sets nicely.",
    "Definitely. Math 305 is a classic course in the math major, and all math majors should definitely take it at some point. The class is a nice mix of people so even if you're a senior and haven't taken it, you should! The material is extremely fundamental, interesting, and useful (Lebesgue measure\/integration, Fourier analysis, basic general\/abstract measure theory, etc). Lectures are extremely good and the homeworks are challenging but very interesting. Also there are takehomes mostly instead of exams. To do well in this class you need to have a strong foundation in basic analysis tools (sequences\/series\/convergence, point set toplogy; Math 300 or 301 are both good preparations for sure). If you work hard you can definitely do well in this class and learn a lot. Professor Minsky is wonderful- don't miss an opportunity to take a course with him!",
    "Yes, but only if he or she has strong enough intuition or at least good familiarity with the basic analysis machinery.",
    "It's a good overview of lebesgue measure and integration on the real line, with some Fourier series and applications. Minsky's a really good teacher, I'd definitely recommend taking it with him if he's teaching it.",
    "highly recommended!",
    "Math 305 is a great course. The material itself is really important, interesting, and beautiful. Although some people complain about Beals' book, I don't know why. The course follows a succession of some of the later chapters of the book, and I thought the structure and presentation of the material was spot-on. We covered a lot of information, and yet everything felt very well-connected, and I felt that we covered the material with a very satisfying depth. Professor Minsky is also a really excellent professor. Early on he made it clear that he had a commitment to us as students: for each class he posted questions to guide us in our readings from the textbook, and each week he offered to get lunch one day with us if we wanted. In class, Professor Minsky's lectures were clear and thorough in a way that was deeply satisfying. It never felt like we would go on and on about something for too long, yet we always spent enough time with each new theorem to be able to explore the statement's hypotheses and construct counterexamples when we neglected a hypothesis. Instead of simply giving the proof of a theorem in class, he would open up the discussion to the entire class, and together we would try to work out the proof. This made the class very engaging, and indeed a lot of fun. The homework assignments he assigned could be tough, but they were always interesting and fun to work through. To boot, they were integrated into the course nicely: I often found myself using a result from the homework on a midterm, or vice versa. In general, Professor Minsky's approach to doing mathematics is very engaging and satisfying. I would highly recommend taking any course with him, and I really hope that I will have the opportunity to study with him again.",
    "This was an excellent course, a must-take for Math (and Physics) majors! Professor Minsky is a clear, engaging lecturer and an extremely helpful and caring mentor. The material is fascinating and was put together very well by Professor Minsky. Problem sets were time-consuming but fun!"
