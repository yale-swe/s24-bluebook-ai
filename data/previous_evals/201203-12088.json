    "This course definitely has something for everyone, take it if you're even vaguely interested in urban planning, architecture, politics, sociology... it's an amazing intersection of a lot of ideas. The projects are fun and very hands on.",
    "If you have ever been interested in real estate, yes. Also, pretty good for people who just want experience running a business deal as the games are very good examples of the cost of money and other universal business ideas. However, if you already are bored at the thought of real estate deals or urban planning, this course is obviously not for you."
