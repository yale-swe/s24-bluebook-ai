    "Yup.",
    "this class provides a very interesting perspective on art, its philosophy and history, and evolution. it changed how I view and interact with art. take it if you like thinking hard about difficult, unresolvable questions, and if you like going to the art gallery or museum.",
    "Evolution of Beauty seemed to be enjoyable for the philosophers and perhaps the art historians, but for a biologist it was un-engaging and too hypothetical. For a student with high standards regarding seminar discussions it was painful. In the future, a different composition of students may change one or both of these things, but regardless the readings are scattered and there is no real progression to the course.",
    "Take it if it's taught again. Be prepared to be self-directed in terms of topics and especially the final paper. They'll try to scare you with the Schulman lectures, but it's really not that much work and the lectures were interesting on occasion. You'll get out only as much as you put in to this course.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The readings and professors are great. Must-take.",
    "If you're REALLY interested in the narrow field of aesthetics, then by all means. But short of that, you might get tired of the subject. You certainly won't get tired of the professors or the way class is conducted.",
    "As a philosophy major who loves aesthetics and biology, this was perfect for me. I think some of the science-oriented people probably didn't have enough of a background in philosophy to always find the discussion meaningful.",
    "Absolutely recommended! A wonderful class that is guaranteed to make you think in new ways about both science and art.",
    "Great class for a senior, perhaps would be frustrating for students in other years.",
    "Evolution of Beauty was one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale. The topic is something of particular interest to me, and I believe also to many other Yalies: what does evolutionary biology mean for our ideas of beauty, art, and aesthetics? Both professors are great for this class: Gilmore is an excellent philosopher of art who is very knowledgeable in evolutionary theory, and Prum is a genius evolutionary biologist who has read quite a bit about aesthetics (though he occasionally tries to push his own views on questions too strongly). Combined with thought-provoking readings, a chance to pursue a topic of interest through the final paper, and a number of intelligent people in the seminar, this class is a must-take. The Schulman lecture series and dinners with guests afterward only make it so much more exciting.",
    "I think this is a good class. Try to take it when a bunch of people who like to think critically and talk a lot are taking it. I think this particular class depends on a lot on the group of students who is taking it. Professors Gilmore and Prum are a great duo - very amusing to have together. Also, definitely attend the Shulman lecture dinners if that happens again with this course. It is really fun to drink wine and eat good food with your classmates and professors.",
    "The class was very good. I learned a lot and it made me think differently and challenge ideas I've held for a long time, all of which are clear indicators of a great class. The class is focused on the concept of what qualifies as 'art' and whether non-humans can create it (i.e. birdsong).I enjoyed most classes and it was good\/different\/interesting to have a class co-taught by these two amazing professors and see their ideas work together."
