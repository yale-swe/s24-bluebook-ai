    "intro to urban design principles",
    "Did not learn too much. Technically the class is supposed to be a complete survey of urban design, from the Greek Agora to the present, but the class was taught in a way where I definitely did not gain much. Lectures are extremely monotonous and long, and Professor Plattus, despite moving through history, somehow seems to be always showing the same pictures on his slides. I think it was an attempt to tie different threads of the course together, but it failed and left me confused in the end. It's a shame, because I think the knowledge this course is supposed to teach would be very useful for anyone interested in architecture\/planning\/design, but it just doesn't get the job done.",
    "How to critically analyse urban spaces. The assignments were fun to produce and you could really take them in any direction you wanted.",
    "Different elements of urban design, as well as trends in western urban design philosophy throughout history.",
    "I felt that I learned very little from the class itself, and more from the 100s of pages of reading each week.",
    "I learned how to analyze urban plans!"

   "comments": [
    "assignments could include a group design project",
    "Strengths: Projects\/essays have interesting prompts and were very fun to do. I feel like I learned the most from the various assignments in this class. Weaknesses: Ok, here we go. First of all, Professor Plattus is not engaging whatsoever. It was extremely difficult to pay attention for the duration of the 9:30-11:15 lecture. Secondly, the amount of reading assigned is frankly ridiculous. He assigns probably 300-400 pages of dense architectural theory every week (lots of which is exceedingly boring). As a result, section meetings for the first half of the semester was totally bland. Nobody could be fully engaged in all the readings, so lots of section was just spent in awkward silence. This changed after our TA realized that we should only focus on the best readings, and gave us an abridged list every week. Thirdly, for an \"introduction to urban design,\" the course almost exclusively looks at Western cities. I wish we could have had at least a guest lecture or two to solve this, if not a restructuring of the whole syllabus. Lastly, Professor Plattus fell so behind in lecture that by the end of the year, our readings for the week were about 80 years ahead of the lecture content, and nothing connected.",
    "The lectures were pretty much unrelated to the section, but section ends up being the far more important aspect of the course since . Could benefit from more hands on analysis and discussion around how to get the most out of the time between assignments, so the output isn't so rushed.",
    "The professor assumed that students knew things about urban planning, despite being an introductory course. It should be more introductory and inviting, and should not dwell on Rome and Greece (and western cities in general) for as long.",
    "Lectures are super dry. It would be really helpful if slides had captions and were distributed. A lot of the material is the same as covered In American Urbanism as well as the History of Architecture sequence, I wish we had covered more unusual material.",
    "It oftentimes felt that the lectures, sections, and assignments were all vastly different from one another. It would be great to somehow make them all link together more!"

   "comments": [
    "No, definitely not. It's too bad, because a lot of what this course aims to teach would be useful to know. But the course fails in teaching it. I'm not sure what I would take over this courseI think Yale just needs to find someone more engaging than Professor Plattus to teach it. The one good thing was the projectsthose were super fun to do\/write. But I would not say they are a saving grace.",
    "This course exists in two parts. One, lectures that people don't go to and two, sections that you kinda do have to go to. The two can exist entirely separately if you want. While I'm sure the contents of the readings are very interesting, they are also unrelated to the assignments. Basically do whatever topic you want and try to make sure the output isn't complete nonsense...",
    "The first two lectures were dry and difficult to follow. I didn't attend any subsequent lectures for this reason. However, with your grade based exclusively on three simple assignments and no exams, this class is a true gut and a great CR\/D. Section discussions were somewhat interesting.",
    "To gain most from the course, you definitely have to do the readings. Admittedly, sometimes I didn't have time. However, the readings I did do were all interesting and foundational to the field. There are three assignments, all of which you can pretty much choose your own topic. Once a week lecture is pretty nice.",
    "No. The lecture was not engaging at all and neither was section. The readings were extremely long and the connections to the lecture were unclear.",
    "Not really, sneaky amount of work and the lectures are a nightmare if you attend",
    "Yes! Mostly due to the fact that my TA Samantha was great."
