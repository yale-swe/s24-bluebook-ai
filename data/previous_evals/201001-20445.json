    "The course examined iconoclasm (interpreted broadly) in practice in America. Students were encouraged to pursue their own research interests in relation to this concept.Yes, if their interests already angled in the direction of controversy in visual culture.",
    "I woudl whole-heartedly recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend American Studies 823 to another student, partly for the reasons outlined above. I would summarize the course as concerned with the ways that religion (in a very broad sense) has influenced the creation, reception, and, most importantly, destruction and controversy over art in the United States, with \"art\" and \"United States\" also defined in a very broad sense. The course was an excellent mix of readings that acted as case studies and theoretical approaches to the themes, without one or the other of these predominating. Promey's course gave me a framework within which I could engage these ideas and apply them to my own work, and anyone interested in the contested status of visual culture not just ideologically or hypothetically but in situated, historical moments would benefit from this course."

    "This course, asI've said, gave me a broader framework within which to develop my sense of what visual culture means, what it does, what it says, and how audiences and spectators engage it across multiple fields of meaning. Though I do not have a background in Religious Studies, I benefitted enormously from the course materials engagement with \"religion,\" as I repeatedly find my own work coming up \"against\" religion and hope to develop a better understanding of religion in the U.S. as I continue working in visual culture studies. Promey's course significantly complicated my understanding of what it means to claim that something is or isn't \"religious,\" and further complicated the line that is so often drawn between the two. I appreciate so much how this line of \"claims\" about religion and visual culture broke down for me over the course of the semester, so much so that it wound up being something I primarily engaged in my final paper for the class. In other words, this course contributed to my work by allowing me to think critically about a dichotomous way of thinking that is too often ignored--that between \"religious\" and \"non-religious.\" As students we are expected to question binaries, and this course reminded me that the binary employed whenever religion is the subject tends to get ignored still."
