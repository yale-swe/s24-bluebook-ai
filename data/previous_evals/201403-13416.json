    "You learn to make molds and casts, troubleshoot technical issues, and consider the various points of and meanings behind such reproduction. I would definitely recommend the class; there are not so many classes in the art program that teach technical skills in such a straightforward manner, and the possibilities in moldmaking are many. In the class you learn a set of skills that any artist could benefit from."
