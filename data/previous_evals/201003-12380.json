    "Music 210 was a decent class. As a student taking lessons for credit, I was required to take the course, and being someone that is far more interested in performance than in theory or composition, this course was somewhat of astruggle. The coursework itself was very manageable; the textbook was reasonably comprehensible. However, as someone focused on performance, it was very hard to find relevance in the material being learned. The overwhelming lack of any sort of connection of theory to performance made the course ultimately feel quite unfulfilling. And while my instructor tried very hard and was quite competent in the material, the subject matter really was just too dry for the class to be terribly exciting. Even as a seminar-style course, student participation was minimal, and the course was sadly just very uninspired. That said, the model composition aspect of the class was definitely the highlight, and I feel my skill and confidence in my composition ability has improved significantly.",
    "Personally, I took this class to get credit for music lessons, but I would not recommend it to someone who doesn't need to take it for any requirement reasons.",
    "If you find it interesting or if you need it for lessons, you might as well.",
    "This class provides a compressive understanding of basic music theory topics and allows one to let out their creativity via music composition. I would recommend this class to any music enthusiast, especially to one that wants to dive deep into the nitty-gritty of music theory.",
    "I would recommend Music 210 as the relevant parts were extremely informative, for music theorists, performance musicians, and composers.",
    "I took this class because I'm taking lessons for credit. I would recommend it those who aren't just taking it to fulfill that requirement though because the subject matter is pretty enjoyable. Just make sure you choose a teacher who will be interesting enough.",
    "This course combines hard theory with interesting model composition applications. A good way to continue theory education past 205's foundations.",
    "This class is one that you will be required to take if you intend to major in music, but it is one that I would recommend to anyone seeking to gain a good, well-rounded musical grounding. There is a lot of work in this course, and it is debatable whether some of the lengthy homework assignments are overkill, but you will certainly leave the course with a firm grasp of a large swath of concepts, from basic partwriting to building sequences, as well as some classical forms. There is definitely a limit to how interesting some of this material can be, but it opens a gateway to thinking about music on a more sophisticated level, and understanding what is really going on. The model compositions are the best part of the class - aside from being very fun, they help demonstrate how the knowledge afforded by annoying partwriting exercises is actually useful in the 'real world' of music. Prof. Brody was very helpful, always on task, and knowledgeable. Take this class with him if you have a choice!Overall, this is a fast-paced class with a lot of work, but one that is rewarding. I would recommend that all people interested in gaining a deeper musical understanding take this class."
