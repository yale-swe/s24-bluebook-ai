   "comments": [
    "Math 120 is the type of class where you don't want to \"cram\" everything last minute. To master multivariable calculus, one needs to practice everyday.",
    "Necessary, but somewhat tedious class. Take it if you need it.",
    "Yes, provided the student is very comfortable with calculus and has a strong grasp of the basic principles of extending small pieces of a function over a range.",
    "MATH 120 is very much just a requirement. Don't use it as a distributional; there are many cooler options at this school that multivariable calculus. Only take it if you need it for your major or grad school requirements. If you do take it, and I can't stress this enough, TAKE THIS CLASS WITH MIRIAM. She is honestly the best STEM teacher I've had at Yale in the past 3 semesters. I'm honestly considering nominating her for a teaching award.",
    "A standard multi-variable calculus class. A pure math class that expands on single-variable calculus and that is interesting it you like pure math. I would recommend it if you are a math person and have not taken multi-variable (but have taken and done well in Calc BC), or if you are not a math person but can do math decently well and want to challenge yourself with interesting material at a decently fast pace.",
    "Good class if you get a good professor. The right teacher can make the material engaging and surprisingly interesting, even for non-math majors. Weekly problem sets and a fairly unrelenting pace for the material, but rewarding if you keep up.",
    "Math 120 is an in-depth multi class that moves very quickly and expects you to keep up. I took BC in junior year (and got a 5) and thought this was do-able but also pretty difficult (you also don't need that much previous calc to do well, as in most BC topics aren't used here). There is a lot of help available if you need it, too. Unfortunately, the grading is not generous at all. Miriam is a great professor, and I would definitely recommend her.",
    "Math 120 might seem scary at first and even during the class, but it's definitely manageable and interesting.",
    "A natural continuation of AP Calculus BC from high school. I would definitely recommend the course on the caveat of what instructor you get. The disparity in instructors is quite large and while taking the course with Professor Logan, for example, would be worthwhile, this does not hold true for all the instructors. While it might make sense to take certain courses even if Yale lets you skip them, do not take this course if you have already covered multi in high school. They do not cover any additional material and actually do not cover certain topics (LaGrange multipliers, creating Jacobians, components of acceleration, etc) that are normally covered in a multi course.",
    "The problem sets are long and difficult, so I highly recommend working with other people in the course. The nice thing about MATH 120 is that a TON of people take it, and the Psets are almost exactly the same between all the sections, so you should have no trouble finding a study buddy to compare answers with. It is entirely possible to get great grades on all the homework if you put in the time and effort, but unfortunately the Psets comprise only 10% of your term grade. The midterms and final are, for lack of a better word, intense. You should devote at least a week studying for each one, especially since they are not really curved. The grading on the exams has been quite harsh in my experience, with even minor mistakes (e.g. a missing negative sign) docking you 5-8 points (out of 150 points for the midterms, 300 for the final). In terms of study strategies, I found that the best way to study was to just do as many practice problems as possible. The textbook (which you should rent from Amazon, by the way) has plenty of problems to try, and solutions for the odd-numbered problems.",
    "To be honest, I think this class is hit or miss depending on your section. I'm a junior and I have shopped & dropped Math 120 twice before this year. TAKE IT WITH MIRIAM LOGAN IF YOU CAN. She is 100% the reason I stuck it out. If you love calculus maybe you will be fine regardless, but a good professor can make all the difference, and let me tell you, they don't come better than Professor Logan.",
    "Not an easy class, but worthwhile.",
    "This is a fast-paced math class. It may be difficult to catch on right away, but ask questions and think about the concepts. It isn't that different for BC.",
    "Even if you've always been good at math, you might find Math 120 to be unnecessarily difficult simply because it's an overall poorly-designed class. Nonetheless, Miriam is great! She is such a sweet person, always willing to help, and she'll stay in office hours for hours after she planned to just to make sure all of your questions are answered.",
    "Overall, I definitely recommend the course for its rigiour and essential concepts. My only side note would be that in the fall term the classes are very crowded. If you are an upperclassman, and can take the class in the spring, you might get more out of it that way.",
    "Difficult",
    "Fima really helped me out with coaching which I appreciated and I would only recommend the course if they are up for a challenge",
    "MATH 120 is a standard multivariable calculus course that follows the textbook (Calculus: Early Transcendentals by James Stewart) almost exactly. The few exceptions are explicitly noted in the syllabus and covered in supplemental worksheets, so attending lecture is completely optional aside from having to hand in your homework once a week. After all, with up to ten different instructors teaching to the same tests, the material has to be standardized. If getting a 5 on AP Calculus BC was easy for you, then it will be easy to get an A in this class as long as you study hard before each midterm and the final to memorize every concept in the relevant textbook chapters. Multivariable calculus is even less intuitive than regular calculus, and it all comes down to memorizing a bag of tricks. Miriam was a super nice teacher, and she really cared about her students. She also doesnt have an unintelligible accent, which is more than you can say about a lot of STEM professors. If shes teaching this class again, you cant go wrong with her section. A lot of people will claim that you need Miki Havlickovas section to gain a competitive advantage over other students because shes the one who writes the tests. This couldnt be further from the truth; every exam contained fair questions that covered material straight from the textbook. At any rate, Miki has a review session before every exam (usually 2 hours on a Sunday) where she covers what you need to know and what you dont, so you can just go to that if youre worried.",
    "Math 120 is a challenging course. Would recommend it to people who have taken the previous courses (112 and 115) or who have taken multi-variable calculus before, not as a starting course (especially for internationals who have taken calculus in different formats).",
    "I would certainly recommend Math 120 to a fellow student. Though many students take the course each year, the sections are small enough that the class feels personal and interactive. All of the material is well and thoroughly taught. I would especially recommend Math 120 10, as Professor Logan is truly an excellent combination of warmth and talent.",
    "Take MATH 120 if you need to. The course itself is rather harsh and class is often filled with people who have already taken Multivar Calc before. It is certainly easier to take this if you have Multivar Calc background - coming out of BC calculus, this course was rather difficult. It proceeds at lightning speed and it's difficult to grasp so much theory in such little time. Prof. Logan made this course the best it could be - she is amazing and really cares for her students. If you take this course, take it with Prof. Logan.",
    "Math 120 is a work intensive class that I would recommend to other students. It is a great, yet fast paced introduction to multivariable calculus. The problem sets are good practice for exams, but I believe they should be worth more percentage wise for the final grade. The course needs to be slowed down but is overall a good course."
