   "comments": [
    "If you are taking this class you probably have to take it. Know that it is not awful! Better than gen chem, WAY better than orgo. The exams are fair- you know exactly what to study. The class is not easy, but it is manageable. It is a time consuming class between all the review sessions and all the sections you will have to go to for the problem sets and weekly quizzes. Use the TAs and go to section\/ the review sessions- they will teach you way more than you will learn in lecture.",
    "Yes!",
    "A fun and fair biologically themed physics 180 with hard problem sets but fair tests, quizzes and a great policy with the final.",
    "yes. though the psets are hard, the quizzes and midterms balance it out. however it bothers me that so many people do well on the midterms",
    "Its a complex look at biological physics. I definitely recommend this course to a premed or biologically-inclined student.",
    "This was a good class for me because I'm not physics brilliant. I can't look at a question and know how to solve it... but Professor Mochrie's test questions are really designed to walk you through the problems so that was a total help.The subject areas are good for people who are interested in biology since a lot time is spent on random walks, diffusion, and fluids. Overall a decent class, but lecture is sort of boring sometimes. Professor Mochrie really tries though, and he's super nice.",
    "I would only take the class if you have to. The quizzes and exams are very straightforward and easy to prepare for. But in terms of understanding concepts, the lectures are very confusing and convoluted and the lecture notes do not help resolve this. There is no textbook to refer to for outside help. the problem sets are much more difficult than the tests but we have to do them ever week. The only way to get them done is to go to section.",
    "Yes, if you are a pre-med student who needs physics. Much more manageable than Physics 180",
    "Yes!! Take this course. It is difficult, do not fall under the trap that this is an easy course. It requires a significant amount of time (case in point: the problem sets are very very challenging). E.g. my Physics 260 friends couldn't even solve some of the problems in our psets. but overall i loved the bio applications",
    "do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. it was absolutely miserable.",
    "Horrible lectures - easy quizzes\/exams - moderately challenging final - long, tedious problem sets that are very difficult",
    "Pretty easy class and I've heard that 180 is much much harder so take this if you need the bio req but dont want to put your gpa in jeapardy.",
    "This is not a regular physics class. The learning is very tailored towards pre-meds. Mochrie tries to make so many connections to the medical world, which I think serves mostly as a distraction rather than motivation to learn physics. Not much thinking outside of the box for the exams, psets are so tough that you generally get all the answers from the TAs at weekly section. I would recommend this class to someone who wants to do well in physics, but if you're somebody who wants a challenge in physics, I'm afraid you won't find much of a challenge in PHYS 170.",
    "You probably have to take a physics course if you're looking at this course. This course doesn't teach to the MCAT, but rather teaches physics through applications to other courses you're taking: biology, chemistry, and just general medical applications. It's not too hard, although grading is especially annoying in a class of purely pre-meds (almost by definition of the course), but if you've never taken physics, you won't have too hard of a time learning the physics necessary to take this course.",
    "170 covers topics relevant to pre-meds (diffusion, fluid mechanics in a bit more detail) - I thought they were actually quite interesting, though I imagine 180 might be more straightforward, like AP physics. Supposedly 180 has easier psets but harder tests than 170 (but since you can work together on psets and not tests...)Psets are tough, but the TAs are very helpful (we had an especially good group of TAs) and over the course of the semester it becomes easier to figure out what you can do by yourself vs. what questions are just too vaguely worded\/out of the box to be able to figure out, and the TAs help with those. This isn't because we're all too lazy to actually try to do the homeworks - this is because Mochrie will ask a strange mixture of really straightforward questions and others that use random math concepts it would never have occurred to you to use. But onthe two tests and weekly quizzes he sticks to the straightforward questions. Don't underestimate the final - there was a little bit of \"random math,\" but there's not much you can do to prepare for that. Mochrie was very nice and really wanted to help his students succeed, so don't hesitate to ask questions (in or out of lecture).",
    "Yes, I think that this class would be good for those looking for a good intro to physics course.",
    "If you've taken AP Physics B, you will coast through the material covered in the first midterm. After that, it's not physics anymore. It's really, really interesting statistical mechanics (fluids, random walks and diffusion) with biological applications. But it's not physics. After the material covered in the first midterm, this class will NOT prepare you for the MCAT, which is all traditional physics (Phys 180). Overall, the material in this course is fascinating. Simon Mochrie is not exactly an inspired lecturer--he makes mistakes, rushes through material, tries to teach us the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in twenty seconds (...?)--but who needs to go to lecture? His notes are crystal, and he literally copies off them when he teaches. There is an incredible support network: TAs who divulge pset answers freely, quizzes so easy you feel reaffirmed in your admission to Yale, office hours upon student TAs upon study halls. None of it is really necessary. IT'S SUCH AN EASY CLASS (while still so interesting!). If you're confident in your math skills and that premeds are really not very smart, you don't need to do any work in the class, and you can make the final 100% of your grade. Taking this route is stressful when you learn from scratch a semester's worth of material over reading period, but it's very doable because this class is part dumbed-down traditional physics, part random biological applications.",
    "Introduction to physics through a biological lens, some calculus, interesting concepts.",
    "I found it fascinating--it's a bio-specialized lookat elementary physics. I imagine a premed would be tearing his\/her hair out in this class, though, over the rather obtuse problem sets. The exams seemed a bit more straightforward than the problem set questions.",
    "Pretty easy way to get that med-school requirement met. As long as you go to the lectures, discussion sections, do the problem sets (and sometimes the help sessions on Sunday), and all that jazz, you'll do okay. Not something to worry about.",
    "Good physics class if you don't really want to learn much physics... the key to doing well is practically a formula. Don't freak about the problem sets, they are 10x more difficult than anything you'll see on an exam. Literally relied on the TAs to give me the answers in section, otherwise I never could have done them. Exams are pretty easy, quizzes are easy, if you do the practice problems he posts you will probably see a question on an exam you've already done.",
    "PHYS 170 is good for students with little to moderate calculus background. PHYS180 requires more math, which is why I chose PHYS 170. In terms of connection to biology\/medicine, it's a bit of a stretch, but if you're premed you should definitely take this course and not the other one.",
    "This is a great class if you are taking physics because you want to go into biology\/medicine. The biological applications made the class a lot less boring than a normal physics course. Some of the subjects covered weren't the normal physics topics (probability, random walks), but I definitely felt like they gave me valuable tools for studying biology in the future. I found the professor engaging and the TFs very helpful.",
    "IF you are a pre-med take this physics! Don't try to take 180 unless you actually enjoy physics.",
    "Lots of work, but Prof. Mochrie really tries to help you succeed. He provides a lot of practice problems, and the TAs actually show you how to solve problems.",
    "This course is intended for pre-meds\/bio majors. The weekly problem sets are difficult, but discussion section helps. The weekly quizzes and midterms are fair. The final is a bit more difficult than the midterms. Overall, its good.",
    "It covers the topics of basic physics and also some that you might not expect. They try to make it applicable to biological and medical sciences, which I liked. Tests were generally speaking pretty fair.",
    "This class is a good way to get one semester of physics out of the way for pre-med, and is easier than PHYS 180. It's more work because weekly psets are gruelingly long and ridiculously difficult, but they are not at all representative of the quizzes (weekly) and midterms\/final, which were MUCH easier and more reasonable. This won't be the most interesting\/exciting class you take. But let's be honest, if you're taking it you probably have to, and the alternatives are much harder classes. So this is a good way to go.",
    "It's fine.",
    "Attend the Sunday review sessions and go to section every week to be successful. Problem sets are difficult, but doable given help in the discussion sections. Weekly quizzes are very helpful for solidifying material. Take them seriously and you'll stay caught up in the class, which makes studying for midterms and exam much easier. So many resources are available for this class: take advantage of them and you will succeed.",
    "Physics 170 is a normal physics class, and quite introductory. There are some topics that are more pre-med related, but I don't think this matters as much as I thought it would.",
    "I would recommend it if you need to take this class. Simon is very nice and really puts you in a position to succeed. The weekly quizzes help you keep up with the material. Sunday help sessions are very useful and the TAs are the best. The problem sets take forever and are usually pretty hard, but the TAs do go over answers in section. Midterms are extremely fair, while the final was challenging.",
    "This was a terrific general pre-med course. I mean that in the sense that I learned a lot, but I never felt like I was in cut-throat competition for grades with other students like I sometimesfelt in Orgo. The tests and quizzes were largely conceptual and checking for understanding (read: not really that complicated, as long as you know the concepts and have the equation sheet) but the problem sets were really difficult, meaning that we all learned how to do the difficult problems and stretch ourselves, but weren't expected to know things that we hadn't learned how to do on examinations. Be ready for the problem sets to be really hard though, there will be several questions on each homework that you won't be able to do without help from a TA, most likely. If you're swamped one week though, Simon doesn't mind if you miss a problem set and it won't count against your grade, just decrease your denominator at the end of the term (life saver, trust me). Simon focused the class around us actually learning the material rather than trying to trick us with grading or tests or make us jump through hoops, which made this a very worthwhile and enjoyable class. Also a terrific hidden gut if you know much about physics or math going into the course. More non-premed people will probably start taking this course as that word gets out, I'd expect",
    "I was skeptical about 170 at first and I mainly chose it over 180 because I didn't have the multivariable calculus background needed to take 181. Professor Mochrie has really turned me around. The first third of this class was pretty standard physics (mechanics, momentum), but the latter part of the semester really tied in to biological phenomena. Obviously, the models were over-simplifications of biological systems but they added another layer of understanding to concepts that I previously took as a given. The idea of diffusion as explained using probability is not something I would have ever thought of on my own. I doubt I would find that in a biology or biochemistry textbook either. I took biochemistry (MBB300) at the same time as 170 this semester and I was pleasantly surprised to see the Michaelis-Menten equation derived via different methods in both classes. It is wonderful to see the same ideas presented on a biological, chemical, and physical level.",
    "This class is a secret gut. Homeworks are too long and hard but you don't actually have to understand the tough problems, so just go to section and get the answers. I advise getting a group of people together and taking turns going to different sections. Quizzes and tests are SUPER easy. If you don't worry about the more complex stuff, it's actually kind of fun.",
    "This class, while pretty easy, was still the bane of my existence thanks to its painful psets. Fortunately the TAs explain the solutions to the psets in discussion section, but that still meant 2-4 hours of just sitting in section copying the answers every week. However, the quizzes, midterms, and finals were all fair and well done.Because I had never taken physics before, I do think I learned things from this class, but some of my friends who took physics in high school said that they learned nothing. The conceptual inventory at the end of the class really showed me that I still lacked a grasp of some the fundamental concepts in physics.",
    "Take it! It's the best possible way to learn about physics at Yale. Yes it is a huge class and we did have to moveclassrooms but there are many TAs which is really helpful. Also Professor Mochrie is really sincere and wants his students to learn and do well. You also don't need to buy a separate textbook which is great and plenty of practice problems are provided before exams. Definitely spend time on your PSETs and you should be prepared for them.",
    "It's a terribly taught course - the idea is good and some topics are interesting, but the implementation is awful. Take 180.",
    "Slightly unorthodox intro physics class which -- although scattered at times -- was overall interesting and taught by a professor who actually cares about his students.",
    "This is the best way to get the physics pre-med requirement out of the way.",
    "Phys 170 is your best bet for intro physics. It is fair, interesting, manageable (although the work load is heavy). Prof. Mochrie is a good lecturer. The notes are online so you can catch up if you feel behind. And frankly, this is just a perfect course for pre-meds who want to do physics with some clinical\/biological context",
    "If you do all the p-sets and attend at least most of the lectures, you will probably get a good grade. That said, I don't know how much you'll actually *learn* in this class when most of the useful equations that mathematically summarize many of the important concepts are given with each quiz and exam. Mochrie is one of the better science lecturers though that I have had (he also sounds more useful than the 180 professor from what I have heard).",
    "If you are a premed\/bio major and you want a low-stress, relatively easy physics class to get through your requirement, take PHYS 170 with Prof Mochrie. If you actually like physics and don't like talking about the biological applications of physics, take 180 instead.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to fellow students, especially if interested in Biology or Medicine. This class will allow you to familiarize yourself with the most fundamental physical concepts, while at the same time developing a good appreciation of concepts that are not usually presented in introductory physics courses, but which will prove themselves extremely useful \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if not more useful than the standard ones \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in future studies. While the psets are rather challenging, they are meant to be an additional learning experience and not a test, and you will be given plenty of resources to aid your understanding. The tests are extremely fair, and they aim as well to solidify your learning.",
    "You're probably an aspiring biologist or more likely pre-med if you're taking this class, so there's no need for a recommendation--you've got to take it! Get ready for a manageable, if more difficult than you'd expect, course. It's not unbearable but it's not terribly fun.Go figure.",
    "Interesting course, although I'm not quite sure how much legitimate physics I learned. When I prepared for tests, I felt more like I was preparing for Simon's specific questions, rather than fundamental physics material. That could be due to my lack of physics knowledge, though. I recommend it over physics 180 for you grade's sake. The grading is very generous. But if you're looking for a traditional physics introductory course, this is not it.",
    "Take the class but make sure you go to the help sessions by the TA's. Those are super helpful.",
    "Necessary evil. Just make sure you go to the sections\/Sunday help sessions. I made the mistake of avoiding those for abig chunk of time and ended up doing poorly on the exams, and only doing okay on the quizzes and psets. Lectures are boring and unhelpful, and all the professor does is bastardize really interesting stuff. The final exam was slightly more difficult that anticipated, so be careful of people from past years telling you the final was easy and they all got A's.",
    "Solid physics course overall, and learning biological concepts in terms of physics can be pretty cool. The midterms, final, and weekly quizzes were all very fair. Problem sets are tough so def go to section for help on them",
    "This class is an introduction to physics with emphasis on applications in medicine. I would recommend the class to a pre-med student with no physics background. The good thing about this class is that it starts off very basic for people with no physics background, and even though the material gets harder there are lots of opportunities for students to get help.",
    "Yes! If you need to take physics for premed requirements this is the way to go. Finally a well taught science class. Very refreshing.",
    "Great class. Very fair. Helpful professor. If you need physics there is no reason not to take this class.",
    "Take this course if you need to for pre-med or the biology major. The material is super easy which is a great break for science students who had to go through Orgo last year. As long as you go to section and Sunday quiz sections, you should be in good shape to do well on the quizzes and tests.",
    "If you appreciate bio applications to physics than take this class. You can learn a lot if you take the time to understand the connections he makes.",
    "You have to take it if you're pre-med. It's certainly a lot better than organic chemistry, and if you put in the work, you should do well. Mochrie gives a lot of opportunities for extra credit with various diagnostic surveys that he provides online. Also, the option to substitute your final exam grade for your entire course grade is alluring - but be careful that you don't rely too heavily on this because if you try to catch up at the very end, it will not work.",
    "You are probably taking this class because you have to. You might not like Physics, but this class at least relates to biology in some pretty interesting ways. There is a lot of support from help sessions, peer tutors, and TAs, who will help you get through the class. Start visiting TAs and peer tutors early and often to help get your psets done without wanting to pull your hair out.",
    "Really solid physics course if you're pre-med. Would recommend over what I heard about 180. The exams are very manageable and Professor Mochrie is fantastic.",
    "Strengths:Quizzes and midterms were straightforwardConcepts were fascinating from a biological perspectiveProfessor was enthusiastic.TAs were incredible, helpful, insightful, encouraging.Weaknesses:Problem sets were too difficult and too extensive. 3-5 of the Multi-part problem sets would have been more than enough.TA sessions were reduced to simply going over 1-2 problem set questions, rather than actually reviewing course concepts.Should not have to rely on Sunday sessions over TA discussion sections to review course lectures.",
    "I would recommend this class over 180. The lectures were at times confusing but once you get the hang of doing the types of problems given, it's pretty straightforward. The quizzes and exams were much easier than the problem sets. Plug and chug.",
    "I took physics in high school and HATED IT. My teacher was tyrannical, disorganized, and very poorly taught his physics course. I basically left the course not having learned anything, which scared me for physics in college, especially at Yale. Physics 170 was a FANTASTIC COURSE. It was challenging, however, if you put in the time and effort to learn the material you will excel. I would RECOMMEND THIS COURSE OVER 180. 170 is much, much better considering what I've heard from friends who took 180. Simon Mochrie is also a boss professor.The format is: weekly quizzes, 2 exams, finalWeekly quizzes: pretty basic - go over your notes from the past two lectures (no more than 7, 8 pages in your notebook) and DEFINITELY go to the Sunday review session. The TAs will review exactly what is on the quiz.Exams: first go through your notes so you understand the concepts; then study your quizzes; do the reasonable questions on your PSETs (you'll know what I mean by reasonable once you start the course); go over reasonable practice exam questions; exams are very straightforward, similar to the quizzes.Final: Depends really on your year. Simon gives you practice finals and you'll see some years they're easy, other years they're more difficult. The final is definitely more difficult than the quizzes and exams. I would say to effectively study for the final, go over the harder types of problems for each unit...Follow the above steps and you'll be golden!",
    "You probably have to take this class. Can't compare it to 180, but it's really not that difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class to any pre-med students who are not also looking to be physics majors. It teaches the essentials but not much more.",
    "PHYS 170 may be an introduction to physics, but it is NOT necessarily medically focused. Do yourself a favor and take Stats before taking this course as well, because for some reason this \"introduction\" contained a rather heavy load of statistics (and calculus, for that matter). I, like 90% of the class, am pre-med, and this course was not what I expected. I got a heavy dose of statistics, tedious problem sets, and little understanding of the reasoning behind the problem solving. Nevertheless, Professor Mochrie tried very hard to share his enthusiasm with us, and this alone probably saved the class for me. If you have to, take it. If not, spare yourself frustration.",
    "I would recommend the class if you want an easy A. The class is easy to get an A, and somewhat interesting. But, you don't end up learning any useful physics. You learn probability and specific physical concepts more than you learn the standard physics you should know for the MCAT. I would recommend 180 if you want to learn physics, and 170 if you want an easy A.",
    "This is a great course. I was very scared coming into the course because I had very limited previous experience with physics. But it really wasn't that bad. The tests and quizzes aremanageable if you do the numerous practice problems Professor Mochrie makes available. Use your TAs and go to section, thats where I did most of the learning.",
    "Solid physics course for premeds. Professor Mochrie is a decent professor and he makes a point to tie in biological applications which is really nice. Concepts not too tough and the workload is not too bad even if you didn't take AP in high school.",
    "go for it, mochrie makes the class quite achievable.",
    "I'd recommend this physics class, especially for bio\/pre-meds. Especially if Mochrie is teaching it again. He's a great science professor, there isn't too much work - the problem sets can seem ridiculous sometimes but they aren't that important, and the quizzes\/midterms\/final were all very reasonable and fairly graded. Plus the curve is great.",
    "This is a boring, badly run, badly taught class. Avoid if at all possible.",
    "This has been a very good class. Be prepared to spend time on the homework. Whether this means spending hours of your own time, going to all the sections, forming study groups, or all of the above, be ready to put in the effort. The class covers material that is much more interesting (to me, as a MBB major interested in biochemical research) than the other physics classes. If you are premed and are not interested in the very hard physics, take this FOR SURE. Also, stay awake in class and he explains things very well. His lecture notes are good, but when he explains all of the derivations in class things make much more sense.",
    "The class is kind of a pain but it's not hard at all to do well. The problem sets are impossible, so you have to go to section and get the answers. The tests are super easy though. The weekly quizzes are fine if you keep up with the material. But really I bombed half of the quizzes and didn't turn in some problem sets but still did well in the class because I did well on the final. If you go to the study sessions (which are more clear and to the point than the lecture) then you'll be fine.",
    "Very good way to learn physics. not heavy on memorization and math. it's more about learning how to think through a problem. there's was also lost of support outside of the lecture such as practice quizzes, sunday review sessions, great TAs, TA-led study halls, and student TAs.",
    "Take it if you have little to no interest in physics and are just taking the course to get bio\/pre-med requirements out of the way. It won't be hard and you can scrap a good grade with minimal work",
    "Definitely. Even though the psets are tricky, you can find help on them from TAs. The material is interesting because it gets related back to interesting bio concepts. I liked how the problems were broken down, step by step, into more digestible parts. The midterm problems are VERY reasonable (much easier than many of the pset problems), and the final was doable as well.",
    "Yeah, its one pre-med class that isn't designed to stress you out. The initial problem sets can be incredibly discouraging in terms of their difficulty, but as long as you go to section and find a reliable group to check sets with the night before, you'll be fine. And the tests are EASY as long as you do all the practice problems. Definitely recommend it; a lot of my friends in 180 and 200 were miserable because of the poor teaching styles of their professors.",
    "It's intro physics, but verystrongly geared toward teaching premeds. It's a ridiculous amount of work, I had to put much more time into this class than orgo or any advanced bio course I've taken.",
    "i would tell them that they should go to review sessions on sundays and sections, but that lecture isn't so helpful. overall the class is doable.",
    "Lecture twice a week, weekly problem sets, a weekly in-class quiz, two midterms, and a final. Plan on going to several discussion sections, also -- the problem sets are notoriously difficult to figure out, so going to section is a necessity. Also, the TAs go over skills you'll need for the weekly quizzes, which is especially helpful as sometimes the Professor won't have gone over those skills yet in lecture.",
    "So you probably have to take this either way. If you're deciding between 170 and 180 like I was, this is what I noticed: I shopped 180, and it seemed cool. The prof seemed entertaining, did a lot of demos. However, I heard the tests\/psets were harder because the prof only did demos and didn't really teach in lecture. In 170, Mochrie makes his own detailed notes sets (no textbook!!) and lecture basically consists of him going over EXACTLY what is on the notes. So you technically could just study the notes if you wanted to. However, there are quizzes every monday (really easy quizzes) so you have to go on Mondays. On Wednesdays, the psets are due, although later in the semester he moved the due date to Fridays sometimes. So you kind of have to go to class Mon and Wed. The sections are basically mandatory, in the sense that you need to go to them to do the psets. The psets are harder than any of the quizzes or tests (which were pretty easy usually). But what I realized is the sections are like an extension of the class, they're just problem-solving sessions. The TA goes over the problems and solves them for you, so if you go to enough sections, you'll get most to all of the answers on any given pset.You will discover which TAs you like better. The content is half normal physics half random bio-related physics. It was really annoying sometimes when Simon tried to make everything bio-related. We did subjects like probability in more depth than in 180 and every example problem was like DNA unzipping or proteins binding or light microscopy, etc. Also almost everyone is pre-med which is fine because you'll know more people in the class if you're premed too (more ppl to do psets with). TL;DR- easy class with some weird content. Go to section. Do psets with others. Easy test and quizzes.",
    "This class is amazing if you genuinely like biology. If you're a biology major because you're premed or whatever you might not like it as much, but if you really care about biology this class is great. Physics is the future of biology, and this class gives you a taste of all the cool ways we can use quantitative techniques to describe living systems. It definitely doesn't teach to the MCAT, go spend your summer savings on a Kaplan course if you want that. That doesn't exist at Yale and shouldn't.",
    "At times, this class is very hard. Weekly quizzes and problem sets get too be a lot at times, especially during the middle of the semester. Lectures cover a wide range of information andare difficult to follow at times. That being said, Professor Mochrie's examinations are very fair. I felt prepared for each one, and I believed they allowed me to show how well I understood the information we had been discussing in lecture.",
    "Take this if you're pre med and need a physics. The psets are actually so difficult but the tests are not bad at all, and the TAs are so helpful with the psets. Not too much work, not bad.",
    "Overall I'd recommend it if you need a phys req for premed or for a non-physics major. For a physics major or if you want to learn real hard physics, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "A lot of time is devoted to probability distributions and biological applications, which is great if you're interested, but probably very tedious if you are looking for just a basic physics class. I would definitely recommend it to people who want their physics knowledge to supplement their biology studies. Be warned: the problem sets are difficult and extremely time consuming. On the other hand, the tests are very fair and relatively easy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend Physics 170. The grade is based on 2 midterms, weekly quizzes, weekly psets, and the final. I had never taken any physics before and did pretty poorly throughout the course, but I aced the final and wound up with an A, thanks to their policy that \"if what you get on the final is better than your grade before that, the final is your grade.\" The psets are impossible but the TAs will give you the answers. The TAs were uniformly great. Mochrie is a funny little man and can be off-putting at times, but he's sort of sweet in a nerdy way if you get to know him. The material you learn isn't really physics (lots of probability and such) but it's not too terrible. A painless way to fulfill the physics requirement for pre-med. Read the notes before you go to lecture, that'll really help. The exams and midterms are easier than the psets. No calculus really required.",
    "If you are a biological science major, I would really recommend taking PHYS 170, unless you have a strong desire to stretch yourself and learn more hardcore physics. In PHYS 170 we learned a whole ton and yet the material was never as overwhelming as it seems in lecture or in lecture notes. Professor Mochrie really wants you to understand the basics and that's what we were usually tested on. Don't be turned away by the seemingly impossible psets. Get a group, go to all the TA sections and questions with the group and you will do well! Professor Mochrie really wants you to do the best you can!",
    "It's not bad. Psets are hard but quizzes and exams not so much.",
    "Physics taught for premeds. Weekly Monday quizzes, weekly problemsets, two midterms, one final. If you do well on the final, that will be the grade for the whole semester. I would recommend this class if you're premed and need to complete premed requirements.",
    "This class doesn't seem to teach physics that well and you'll learn more from section and help sessions than lecture.",
    "A good introduction to physics. Lots of derivations, but I felt that they helped you see the whole picture better.",
    "I would recommend physics 170 to any premedical student. If you plan to study physics beyond this course, this is not the class for you.",
    "It's a premed class and it's not particularly exciting. While there's WAY more work then there should be but the professor's reasonable and nothing's unexpected. I wouldn't take the class unless you need to fulfill a requirement."
