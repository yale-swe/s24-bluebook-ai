    "A pretty straightforward, no nonsense calc class. Not too bad if you need a math class.",
    "Take it if you have been introduced to calculus before but were never too confident about it. This will give you a great refresher and solidify your understanding of the basic concepts. It's not too challenging and a good way to knock out a QR if you're not a math\/science person.",
    "It is very important to have a background in calculus before taking this class. The tests were extremely difficult and were too hard to be that of the introductory calculus course at Yale.",
    "It's good if you have a good instructorIt's painful if you don't",
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend Calc 112 as a QR but would advise them to take the smaller, morning classes.",
    "yes, take Miriam Logan's class!!",
    "Review of high school calculus.",
    "Most people take it for a requirement. If you just need a QR, I probably wouldn't recommend taking Math 112, even if you took it in high school. The class is much more in depth than high school and is by no means a gut - find a more interesting QR. However, if you need it for a requirement for your major, don't be put off by the bad reputation of math at Yale. The workload and grading are fair, so if you put in the time and do the work you'll be fine. I'd also recommend shopping sections because your experience is really dependent on your professor. If you can, take it with Miriam Logan! She was great and always willing to meet outside of class."
