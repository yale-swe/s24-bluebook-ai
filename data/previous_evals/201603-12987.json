    "This was a very well-taught class and we learned so much over the course of the semester. The progression from MI to CBT and then ACT felt natural and meaningful and Mary expertly guided us through important discussions and role plays about each of these topics, in addition to giving us wonderful lectures each course. Since the class is long, I often felt like it might be nice to take a short (even 3 minute) break midway through so we could stretch or get water. The final assignment felt like a wonderful culmination of our learning but it came at a very busy time and it might have been nice to push this a little earlier in the semester (even by a week). In addition, it would have been nice just to spend a bit more time focusing on how to do this assignment before it was assigned. I feel very lucky to have such high quality clinical training and it is all thanks to Mary!"
