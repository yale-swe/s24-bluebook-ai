    "The course was a great survey of the literature on high-dimensional econometrics. I would appreciate it if there were some sort of assignment where students could assess their knowledge on the subject.",
    "This course was extremely well taught and I don't have much to offer in terms of improvement other than perhaps over time the posting of typed out lecture notes (perhaps retrieved from a student who took notes in TeX) to supplement the ones from the board. My one suggestion for improvement would be to have this course offered every year! The fact that this was a one-off course is unfortunate, as the topic is very pertinent to modern research in econometrics as well as other fields. Compressed sensing and related fields are cutting edge, and this course was a superb introduction to the last two decades of thought in high dimensional econometrics."

    "If you're interested in high-dimensional econometrics, that is the course you should take.",
    "In a heartbeat. If you have any interest in high dimensional econometrics, compressed sensing, or theory from a different standpoint than your typical asymptotic stuff, this is the class for you. I would discourage anyone with insufficient econometric or statistical background from taking this class: if you have not taken Metrics III or equivalent, this class is probably not appropriate."
