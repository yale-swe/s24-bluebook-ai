    "This class has definite plusses and minuses. Professor Gilmore is helpful at making sure that you get your act together on your research papers and actually do a good job. That being said, the format of the class is sometimes less than optimally conducive to conversation because of the presentation structure where one group of 2-3 presents each week and that takes up a lot of the time, meaning that it's often hard to contribute and participation can be a little bit of a struggle.",
    "This course, which should really be called \"Glenda Gilmore and her friends\" is a good time. Very little work except a big paper in the end (don't stress too much, plan, and write something you have archives for, and you'll be fine). The class itself requires a good skim of a book a week or a close reading of a few JSTOR book reviews. The discussions are good, except tend to be dominated by overeager sophomores who want GIlmore to love them. Nevertheless, take this class for Glenda Gilmore because she is the Yale History Department diva and a wonderful educator, and take if for some cool conversations about the South.",
    "The course was a fascinating look into a key part of American history, but also a rather confusingly organized and workload-heavy seminar. Professor Gilmore is a one-of-a-kind teacher (whose personal stories are incredible in themselves!) who made the class both laugh loudly and think deeply. The structure of the course is fairly similar to any other history seminara term paper and class discussion of readings--but the readings are very heavy and only ramp up as the semester goes on. The student-led discussions tried to be too many things at once, and assignments often got muddled. The seminar was worth taking for the professor and the topic, but could have used some retooling around the edges.",
    "Overally really great class! The structure is kind of strange with the student presentations--it makes the class feel kind of theatrical. And Glenda Gilmore is so smart that I wish she did more teaching herself in the beginning of class but that's a small complaint. Book choice is good and you will learn a lot! Good class, but not easy. A large book a week plus reading responses and a presentation and a paper that will be worth it, but the process is long and difficult. If you have to opportunity to do so, definitely take it!",
    "This seminar offers a broad (yet nevertheless in-depth) perspective on the history of the South from Reconstruction through about the end of the twentieth century. I enjoyed all of Professor Gilmore's book selections, and while each week has a heavy reading load, you'll get a lot out of the books. Most of your grade is based on a 20-page essay due at the end of the semester. Professor Gilmore makes sure you choose a topic early, and she requires periodic assignments (i.e. annotated bibliography, description of primary source(s)) throughout the semester that make sure you don't fall too far behind. Professor Gilmore is witty, charming, and extremely knowledgeable -- you'll learn a lot both from her and from class discussions. Highly recommended.",
    "This is a great course. Like any history course, particularly history seminars, you have to like the topic to like the course. Now, you may not know whether or not you like Southern History if you've never taken a course on it, as most of us have not, so this may be a hard metric. I think most students would find this stuff fascinating. Be prepared to talk a lot about race, which I loved, and not necessarily about white southerners oppressing and lynching black southerners, but really every side of that story, including white southerners who fought for civil rights, etc. Prof. Gilmore is a fantastic professor. She is both sweet and commanding. She really inspires your work hard in her class and her expertise is undeniably clear every day. Most importantly, she is willing to go above-and-beyond what any other professor will do to help you with your paper. My favorite part about this course was that Prof. Gilmore challenged everything we knew about Southern history and forced us into discussion, which I think came to as close to the truth about the South as it ever could in just thirteen classes. Particularly, she challenged the perceptions many of us non-Southern students inevitably have of the South and made us look at the culture in a new light. The only annoying thing about the course was the group presenter system which encouraged students to make a powerpoint on the day's topic and \"lead discussion\" which was a structure that seemed a bit unnecessary since our best discussions seemed to happen in a free-flowing manner. Other than that, this was really a fantastic course. I'd take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "Amazing course. Gilmore rocks.",
    "Good class, Professor Gilmore is so lively and brilliant. She provides a lot of support for the big 20 page paper. Sometimes it felt that the two hours lacked a bit of structure, but overall I would recommend it.",
    "You read books and discuss them in class. One point during the semester you do an in class presentation. At the end you turn b in a twenty page paper. Start the paper early.take the class though.",
    "Definitely take this class. You will be exposed to different elements of Southern history with an emphasis on Civil Rights. It is a social history based class, and it is extremely rewarding."
