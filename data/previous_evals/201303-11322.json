    "Yes! But you need to have experience doing long-form pieces and independent reporting. No one here is going to give you a checklist, or a rubric, or a formula.",
    "454 is a class on long-form, reported, storytelling. That is, we read and then implement practical methods to make stories unfold in interesting ways (the structure unit of the class) and to use voice to narrate those stories (the voice unit of the class). A diverse and cool set of readings. Two long pieces to be reported and written, with a revision for each (which I basically interpreted as a full rewrite, though I'm not sure if everyone did that). Lots of work, and stress, since reporting can be very stressful, especially when you're a student. A lot of work willbe done outside the class: finding stories, reporting them, thinking about them even when you're not in writing mode. Still, there is a lot to be learned from this class--from Strebeigh, from classmates, and through your own experiences",
    "Summary: The best class at Yale I've taken. Would I recommend this?: Hell yes.",
    "Yes! This is the best class I've taken at Yale. The best writing class offered.",
    "ENGL 454 is a hard class. If you have a light semester and want to take this course, please know that it is intensive and time-consuming. However, if you put in the time, you will become a much, much better writer and will really have strong skills in journalism that will take you far.",
    "Using recent non-acadmic\/non-fiction works and guest speakers as models, Engl 454 teaches writers how to analyze work for voice and structure and how use similar tools in their own writing. Students will leave the class knowing how to create a voice that lends authority to their position and how to structure content to optimize drama. I recommend this course to anyone serious about writing who wants to gain insight into how authors create drama and persona. Not for people with horrific time management and not a good \"fifth class\" add-on."
