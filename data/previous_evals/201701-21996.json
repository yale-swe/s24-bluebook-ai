    "VERY strong and well done course! I feel that this class epitomizes what the freshman seminar is supposed to be. I know Prof. Kankel has asked many of the same professors every year to come back and teach the modules, but I would really like a module about stress! I feel that it is a pervasive topic, especially on this campus, and I realized I don't understand stress (scientifically) in a way in which I would be able to engage in a dialogue.",
    "I enjoyed this seminar class a lot as it exposes you to a lot of material that you might not have taken a class in- definitely geared towards non-science majors.",
    "It is great that every three weeks there is a different professor and a different topic. It keeps the class engaging. It would have been better if all the assignments and quizzes did not pile up on the third week and were instead spread out over the three.",
    "Fascinating professors covering a wide range of key topics."

    "Yes!!! Great overview of many important topics, and a perfect class for someone interested in gaining a surface understanding of many important scientific issues."
