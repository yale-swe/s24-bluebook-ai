    "\"Art history has conventionally maintained a curious 'scale blindness'--a cultivated insensibility to the influence of scale on the operations of perception of the work of interpretation.\" I not only finished the semester believing this to be true, but I found that the ways we approached certain topics in class, when applied, could in fact open up the possibilities of art-historical research.",
    "I learned to think thematically and rigorously about scale and scaling across mediums, geographies, and times.",
    "I enjoyed that this course covered a breadth of material and the scope was global. I felt that this approach helped me develop the skills to thing about these concepts across broad time periods and locations. The course also demanded close reading which is always worth further developing."

    "Despite being a minor part of the class, I thought the weekly \"practicum\" was wonderful. It prompted engagement from students at the start of class and was a creative way to upend the traditional format of seminar courses--and at the start of each and every class! Also, from time to time, Joanna offered some very \"practical\" exercises: instructions on how to structure abstracts, what a paragraph in a larger body of writing actually does an so on. I find these little moments very informative and I hugely appreciate when instructors take the time to do this. Thank you! If this class is to be offered again I would consider reducing the amount of reading, but only slightly: from four to three primary readings. In part because at times four readings felt like a little too much--especially if you're hoping get to some of the recommended readings, but also because towards the end of the semester it felt like three of the four readings did a good job addressing the week's theme and related to one another while the fourth ended up feeling out of place. ...This isn't a comment about the number of pages we were asked to read, (which I found very reasonable), but rather about how the content in each reading was handled. I also thought that the first several weeks of themed readings were excellent all around, (actual size, miniatures, blow-ups, models, colossi and modularity). By the end, (drawing and drafting, mapping, telescoping and scaling) things began to feel a bit more disjointed. With some readings relating to the theme less than others, the specific \"issue\" about scale was less clear these weeks than ones earlier in the term.",
    "I thought that the first half of the course was particularly strong in readings related to art history and visual culture. The second half was marginally less engaging as it seemed more distanced from art objects, but this is simply personal preference. I would have also liked to return at later points to some of the texts we discussed at the outset of the course.",
    "I thought dividing the semester into scale & scaling operations was effective, although I feel like the first half had a clearer objective (e.g. set of guiding questions) than the latter half. The amount of reading was appropriate. I wonder if on some weeks we left out one or two authors, though, and if an approach with fewer sources and more length\/closer reading for each one would be more manageable? I also enjoyed the practicum\/presentation format, which worked really well for a small class.",
    "I thought that the variety of readings and subject matter addressed was of interest, though the sheer number of weekly readings felt too high to be reasonably attended to in a two-hour class meeting. While the weekly pages amount required felt typical of a grad seminar, five to six disparate readings were frequently difficult to connect thematically. While I understand the logic and appreciate the variety and attention to global art histories, I believe our class discussions would have been more fruitful had the readings been more specified. This also left the overarching goals (as reflected in the syllabus, which admittedly sought to cover a huge variety of scales) feeling broad and perhaps difficult to capture and articulate in the course of a semester."
