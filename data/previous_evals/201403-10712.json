    "Definitely take this! It's a really fun extra class - be warned, it doesn't count for credit. But you learn how to make pretty things out of glass (you're making colored marbles by day two!) as well as some really cool scientific things. The final project was a Hero's Engine (look up a youtube video). Unfortunately, mine exploded dramatically, but it was certainly entertaining! Also, Daryl is awesome and so are the other people who will be in the class with you. And I'm not particularly skilled at arts and crafts, but I was still able to do a good job on the projects, as was everyone else. Take it! You'll learn a cool new skill.",
    "TAKE IT! It is such a fun class...and when else will you get to do this?? Plus, you get access to the shop for the rest of your time at Yale. which basically means you can make lots and lots of presents. Also, Daryl is great, definitely worth taking the class just to get to know him."

    "I suppose glassblowing is relevant because I'm a chemistry major, so at some point in the future I might need to fix a broken piece of glassware in the lab. Also, it's a really cool skill to have and one that there is very seldom a chance to learn - how many school have full-time glassblowers offering classes? - so I jumped on it."
