   "comments": [
    "Would recommend this course to anyone as a survey of important works led by an intelligent and insightful professor.",
    "DS Literature provides a good overview of literature from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. We read novels, plays, and poetry. I would recommend DS Literature, and DS as a whole, to any student interested in learning the foundations of Western thought.",
    "Kronman's section is simply amazing. I would recommend it to every DS student who likes to think outside the box and who would appreciate engaging with literature in a primarily philosophical manner.",
    "I would summarize DS Lit in the spring semester as a broad survey of literature from later in the Western Canon. There is an emphasis on themes that apply to several different works and thus provide a basis for investigating how the works build upon each other over time. I would definitely recommend this course for anyone looking to read some of the world's greatest works of literature, though the time commitment required to read such books can be significant.",
    "Definitely do Directed Studies and get into this section if at all possible. I wasn't aware when I got placed into it how eye-opening it would be.",
    "would recommend",
    "Would recommend to a student interested in the subject matter. Workload is a serious consideration.",
    "This class surveyed a selection of highly influential and oft-referenced works of literature in the Western tradition. These are books that I felt like I was supposed to read, and this class allowed me to evaluate whether these books deserved such a title and to consider what subliminal cultural messaging generated such an impulse in the first place. The syllabus is an embarrassment of riches, and I can't recommend it enthusiastically enough. I was thrilled to encounter books like War and Peace that I revered so highly that I decided to read at my own pace rather than cramming before section because I wanted my first memory of such an exquisite book to be one of unadulterated joy.",
    "As you've noticed, DS depends heavily on the section leader's style and experience. Professor Kronman is a Sterling Professor, which guarantees the experience. He has a lecturing style, which keeps the class on topic and provides great models for interpreting a text. You still have chances to formulate your thoughts and ask questions. However, if you want to freely juggle thoughts just among students, Professor Kronman may have too strong a presence, and few of his opinions may appear strong."
