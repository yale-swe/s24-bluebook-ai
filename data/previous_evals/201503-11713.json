   "comments": [
    "Would not recommend the class if you are looking for fun, but would absolutely recommend if you are dedicated to improving you're language skills. The work is not thrilling but it is definitely worth it if you are intent about improving as a Chinese speaker, reader and writer.",
    "A nice third-year L5 Chinese course. It covers various aspects of Chinese culture and society, and Li Laoshi and Mu Laoshi are really nice. The pace of the course was very manageable, and the workload was not bad at all compared to what I hear about other Chinese courses. It does meet everyday, but then I got close to my classmates really quickly which is really awesome.",
    "Take it, it's work, but it's routinely, you can rely on the routine to make the work less heavy. The teachers are great, and you will learn a lot of new characters.",
    "Chinese 150 is not your typical advanced language class at Yale. Most people taking it have just come back from the light fellowship in China, and compared to the language programs over the summer it has similar amounts of work. The only difference is that you're not just studying Chinese like in the summer. It's not like other advanced language classes at Yale because it meets every day and the workload is much larger. There are two quizzes every week, essays every week, homework every week, it's just a lot to keep up with. You have to study everyday to keep up with what's going on. With that said, if you keep up with the studying and listen in class the material is not super hard. But if you did Light, expect a significant drop in your speaking ability, you barely have any speaking opportunity so you will lose some proficiency in that department. Otherwise if you like Chinese and want to something with it, then I'd recommend this class.",
    "This is an incredibly demanding course which requires a great deal of work. That being said, it improved my Chinese immensely and was very interesting. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who is serious about the Chinese language and is willing to put the work in to improve their abilities.",
    "Very time intensive, you learn a lot at a very fast pace. Each week expect listening hw, an essay\/ or recording due, 3 quizzes, and sometimes a test, oral presentation, or oral exam! 2 written tests, 2 oral exams, 2 oral presentations per semester!",
    "Absolutely take it if you love Chinese and want to get better at it. If not, then don't.",
    "CHNS 150 is definitely a lot of work, especially at first. It meets five days a week; there is a dictation every Monday; vocab quizzes every Tuesday and Wednesday; essay due every other week; recording of edited essay due every other week; and listening homework due every Monday. It is a lot of work, but the more you put into this class the more you will get out of it. The student who does all of the work will absolutely learn a ton of Chinese, and the interested student would definitely enjoy it and should absolutely take it."
