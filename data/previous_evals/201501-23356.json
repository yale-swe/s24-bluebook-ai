You'll also learn how to be self directed and self motivated."

    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Ms. O'Keefe is a great instructor of this course!! She was always very receptive with her students, giving us her feedback in regards to our journal entries every week, and answering any questions we had. When getting together as a group to discuss the ethics and importance of cultural sensitivity, she was a great instructor, and was very interested in what we were doing in our practicums and how we could apply this to our practicum.",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0Elaine was great in giving back feedback to the weekly journals. I also appreciate her passion for encouraging us to get into public health practical work which is so important to do, especially in urban areas where health disparities are so large.",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0very nice and very approachable",
    "Instructor: Elaine O'Keefe \u00a0excellent mentor and instructor. Extremely knowledgeable and experienced. Loved her",

    "You have to choose the place in which you are going to do your practicum, by yourself, before the fall term finishes. It was a little stressful to do this, because you had to find a place on your own, contact them, interview with them, etc. I had a great experience in my own practicum. I had to be on site 8 hours a week, and before starting you would get together with your preceptor and draft a work-plan of what you would be doing, and what MPH competencies you would be covering. I had a great experience, and I fully recommend taking this course, because it is a more practical course, in which you are seeing how it would be like to work as a public health professional.",
    "This course is beneficial to take I believe for people who would like to start working after their MPH. I got a lot of insight as to what life would be like after I graduate, even more so than my internship, for that I am very appreciative of the class.",
    "definitely recommend this course to anyone seeking practical experiences in public health.",
    "This course is wonderful 'cause you can tailor it, to suit your needs and work style. Like I said earlier, it's all up to you. Go easy or go hard! One last thing, don't get bogged down about finishing the project as I did. Just do what you have to, as long as you have a clear narrative at the end, about the organization and what you set out to achieve, you'll be fine!"
