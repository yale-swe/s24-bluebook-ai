   "comments": [
    "I fell that I am a stronger writer overall, and that I definitely have a better ability to craft fiction and conflict.",
    "I feel I really gained a solid grounding for creating drama and fiction. The structure and workings of a good story were laid out very clearly while not becoming formulaic. The readings and lectures were great and the assignments helped build towards a better understanding of how to go about creating work in each of the three units. Really loved this class.",
    "I learned how to edit my work, reduce the stresses of \"writer's block,\" react to other author's works, and appreciate the fine art of creative writing.",
    "Most valuable I think was specific input; while I knew a lot of concepts talked about in class, putting them into practice correctly was different.",
    "I had a fantastic time in this class. The teacher was so helpful and made me feel very comfortable and also willing to push the boundaries of what I could do even though I wasn't an English major. The biweekly meetings were really really helpful and I learned so much about something that I enjoyed doing and was finally able to do again since high school. This is definitely something special that I can only do at Yale and I am so grateful I took this class",
    "This course was an amazing exploration into the simpler components of creative writing in order to develop stronger creative writing skills. I personally found myself writing works in all the genres (short fiction, poetry, and drama) that were significantly above my writing level before the course. My comprehension of the mechanisms behind modern creative writing was also greatly increased.",
    "I gained an understanding of the structural elements of story-telling.",
    "One of the biggest things communicated in this course is that creative writing is something anyone can do - which is something not everyone believes. We discussed techniques and tools of the trade in ways that made them accessible and applicable to all levels of experience in the class. Skills in writing and crafting successful fiction as well as identifying, evaluating, and employing techniques in other works. Comfort in sharing one's writing and workshopping work of others, considering criticism, revising, and identifying conscious intention in one's own work. Skills related to closereading of one's own work for improvement -what is successful and what isn't - and of the works of others.",
    "You really get an opportunity to have your work critiqued in a positive and what feels like a professional environment. You can learn and hear from your peers, and Derek obviously loves what he does. You learn to also be critical of your own work, fiction or not.",
    "This class gave me a very comprehensive step-by-step process of writing. I found this incredibly valuable because while I have always been a writer, I never knew exactly how to construct stories, poems, or plays."

   "comments": [
    "Prof. Green has a lot of great insight when it comes to making interesting, shoe-leather-free fiction. He has some basic, go-to pieces of advice that are universally helpful. That being said, he tends to hit the same subjects over and over again. The course could use more depth, more progression, and less talking over the same subjects.",
    "It did a great job of laying out how to go about creating good fiction and drama, and the guests and readings were quite inspiring and eye-opening. However, many aspects of this subject can't really be taught, especially in poetry, so I sometimes still felt as though I didn't know what I could do to improve my work past a certain point. However, Professor Green really tried to give personal feedback on everything and reduce that feeling as much as possible. I think the grading could be a bit more clear; I was never quite sure how I was being evaluated and while I was given a rough idea, I was still not sure how I could bring my grade up and I sometimes felt that although I incorporated feedback as well as I could, there was a bit of a glass ceiling because of how hard it is teach creative writing past a certain point.",
    "I think this course was great for a beginners class. The assignments, reading, guest lecturers, and personalized feedback was wonderful. However, at times class felt slow while we built a good dynamic in class by reading each other's work, we often were lectured (with good information) and not given much time to work and create and think in class. This is fine, but for a 75 minute class twice a week it could be a bit much. I also think it was difficult to pull apart the readings for material to write with when, as a class, we very rarely discussed the \"great\" writers themes, and we rarely critiqued the work provided on the syllabus, which can often be important to learn how to construct characters without playing into stereotypes or without making trite messages\/themes come across.",
    "I wish there was more emphasis on sharing work with other students. Workshops were a bit rushed and each student only got one; perhaps we could give feedback online? Otherwise the course did everything it set out to do.",
    "This course was incredibly effective as introduction to each style of writing and in its central goal of creating a portfolio. My professor, Derek Green, was absolutely incredible at simplifying the mechanics of fiction writing and with his incredibly attentive feedback on my work. As far as the overall structure of the course, more exercises in fiction and poetry would have been helpful, simply as a method of making the writing assignments more continuous, rather than the inevitable large chunks of writing that ultimately occurred.",
    "I thought the course was fantastic overall. Professor Green was fantastic. The only thing that I think could be improved in the course is perhaps only doing fiction, or drama, or poetry. I felt a little short-changed in all three of those units because they felt so short. I would have preferred doing a single unit, but more in depth and with more opportunities for practice.",
    "This course is very individually focused, giving each student the constructive and targeted feedback he or she needs to improve. The focus on workshopping is a huge benefit, and this was largely due to proffessor Green willing to donate his time outside of class to individual meetings which were universally appreciated by students. It was a bit fast moving through genres which made it a little chaotic, but I think this was necessary because of time.",
    "The grading could be better. For people who aren't naturally talented in writing, it is kind of unclear of how to get the high grade. You do have the opportunity to identify what your strengths are in terms of genre of fiction writing, and also which genre is most interesting to you."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you want to be a better writer overall and get the basics down, take this course. If you want to dive in depth, take another one.",
    "Absolutely! Whether or not you have dabbled in creative writing before, this course provides so many perspectives and insights that you will probably come out with a better idea of how fiction, poetry, and drama work, or at least get the chance to write and experiment and get great feedback. If you've never tried one or more of the three modes, it's a great chance to explore and you also get to read some great works in each unit and listen to some incredible guests.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student",
    "Even if they aren't interested in creative writing as an active part of their life and career, I would recommend this course to any student with a vague interest in writing, reading, or even those who wish that they were interested in these subjects. Aside from improving my writing, this course made me appreciate others so much more, and increased my enjoyment when I read books and watch movies\/plays\/shows.",
    "Yes, take this class if you haven't taken other creative writing at Yale before.",
    "Yes! It was engaging and friendly to people who haven't written extensively before, so I would especially suggest it to people who want to write but are intimidated because they don't know how good they are.",
    "Absolutely, especially with this teacher",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. My professor, Derek Green, was an incredible resource, and the entire class was well-organized for both learning and fun. The readings were engaging and useful, and I learned an incredible amount about how to structure creative writing. Even if you aren't a creative writer, it's still an engaging class where you can learn about the mechanics of creative writing in a straight forward way and have fun creating your own portfolio.",
    "This course is fantastic. Professor Green is incredible. He goes out of his way to give feedback with individual bi-weekly meetings. I learned a ton and would recommend this to anybody who is interested in creative writing, even those who don't want to be a writer. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely! Amazing course both for those who have had experience writing fiction in the past and those who haven't. This course gives a broad survey into different types of fiction, focusing on conventions and techniques in each genre and providing targeted exercises to help students improve. You will improve your writing, and get the chance to be creative and explore your own writing style. Its a lot of fun and also proffessor Green is amazing.",
    "Would recommend. This class definitely involves work, so don't take if you think you can just pass by. The class is also more fun when you do the work, and it the materials we are exposed to are interesting in themselves.",
    "Yes, take this course! It is interesting, and you will learn a lot.",
    "Yes if you're looking for a taste of each genre."
