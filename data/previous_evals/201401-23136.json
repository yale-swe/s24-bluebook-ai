    "It's a class that's design to guide students through a year-long research project. We learn about the publication process from students and professors who have done it in the best journals. We also went deeply into each of our projects as a class, although each of us had an advisor. I would HIGHLY recommend this course to any graduate student in political science.",
    "This course is required.",
    "This is a required class but it's great fun.",
    "Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094though it's a required class so I'm not sure my recommendation counts for much. But it's a required class that I had been anxious about but actually ended up getting a lot out of (and sometimes even enjoyed)."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me immensely in learning how to do research on our own and in exploring literature that I'll be working on for my dissertation. In addition, the course was helpful in learning about the publication process from people who have gone through it and were willing to share their materials and engage in a genuine discussion.",
    "I hope that this first paper will be expanded to a dissertation.",
    "This class was extremely helpful in demystifying the paper-writing process. I also learned a lot about the discipline just by listening to others explain their projects and commenting on other students' proposals. It was a good experience in being part of a department with a wide range of scholarship and participating in discussions beyond your own specialized range of knowledge."
