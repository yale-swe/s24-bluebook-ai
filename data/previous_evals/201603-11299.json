   "comments": [
    "Although I took cell biology the semester before, biochemistry added to my knowledge, especially of metabolism. I cannot stress how much I know about metabolism now!",
    "This course provides a great intellectual framework to understand diverse topics in biochemistry.",
    "Pretty standard biochem, though Koelle goes out of his way to make it more mechanistic and explore the \"how and why\" along with the \"what\". Not entirely sure that changes the class that much, but pretty solid overall, if a bit philosophical as a result on the first midterm. You'll learn a lot, and the connections that Koelle points out between pathways are actually quite interesting.",
    "I learned a little more than what was covered in BIO101, but what I really learned is how savage premeds are. This completely stripped the enjoyment I had in taking the course because instead of pleasant learning the material, I was constantly worried that my grades - which would be perfectly acceptable in other STEM classes - would fall below the ridiculously high averages. The frustrating thing is that I love this material, but I wan't allowed to enjoy learning it because if I did that I'd have gotten a C. All I could do was worry and worry and worry about trying to get as close to the average as I could.",
    "This course taught me a survey of biochemistry, covering both basic principles and delving into specific pathways. I developed the ability to apply concepts to specific examples, and learned some interesting biochemistry facts that are relevant to human life and our world.",
    "MB&B 300 was a good introduction to biochemistry and I feel like I learned good concepts. I appreciated Dr. Koelle stressing the need to understand the underlying mechanisms of biochemistry, and not just memorizing pathways--which helped develop my interest in biochemistry.",
    "An enormous amount of information has passed through my brain in this course - we'll see if enough of it stuck around for the final. Biochem taught biological principles well, from a generic understanding of energy to an in-depth analysis of glycolysis and a few other metabolic pathways, from which more metabolic pathways can be easily understood. It at once serves as a reminder about how much information is out there in biology - and there's a lot to hold in your head at once - but also how similar some aspects can be, and how at a certain point, even a brand new system will probably have the same inner mechanics that you've already seen.",
    "I gained a strong and workable foundation of biochemistry through this class. I also learned that my original studying skills are terrible and that I had to change something in order to barely stay afloat in this course.",
    "This course is really cool if you are interested in understanding how the body works! Learning the chemistry behind biological processes and systems can be challenging but also extremely engaging.",
    "Complex biology and chemistry of biomolecules.",
    "I learned that it pays off to understand the content rather than memorize, although this class for sure makes you do both.",
    "I gained a better understanding of biochemistry concepts, specifically metabolic processes. Quite a lot of the material is stuff you approach in introductory biology, but don't necessarily explore deeply.",
    "A lot of them! I feel like I have increased my ability to problem-solve, think critically, connect ideas and (of course) memorize large amounts of information.",
    "This course taught me to think critically about the integration of various components of biological\/biochemical processes. As a senior who has taken lots of MCDB Electives, not many of the individual topics were new to me. However, I feel like I have a greater understanding of how the processes are evolutionarily related, coordinated, regulated, and combined to make up a whole living thing.",
    "Learned about experimental techniques\/design in biochemistry (NMR, cryo EM, Xray crystallography, column chromatography, FRAP, isotopic labeling, etc.--I think that this this is what I found the most valuable, helps with reading papers, thinking scientifically, etc.) Found learning about enzyme kinetics and cooperatively to be especially interesting. Also memorized many metabolic pathways, understood their regulation and integration, learned about membrane physiology, learned about proteins, etc. and developed a better understanding of the field of biochemistry.",
    "Most of the really new material I learned was related to how metabolism works. A lot of the earlier material I had already learned in cell bio\/intro bio courses.",
    "In MB&B 300 I gained a rigorous understanding of biochemistry and metabolism on both a conceptual and detail-oriented level.",
    "I definitely learned how to synthesize a lot of different concepts into a greater overall picture of how systems interacted and worked together.",
    "This class is exactly what you'd expect. It's a comprehensive overview of introductory biochem and metabolism. If you're into that, then even when the material seems a little dry, it'll all be worth it for those one or two \"aha!\" moments each class. I think that the exams in general did a very good job at testing both knowledge of facts from the course, and understanding and application of those facts. The class is also (IMO) a surprisingly low time commitment; if you don't do the reading (which is my recommendation; I didn't even buy the textbook) then other than exam studying, you'll spend about 30 minutes a week on the p-sets (really - they're that easy). Just don't fall behind, because the exams are no joke! Best of luck MB&B folks. You've got this.",
    "I learned the how and why of biochemistry that I missed from BIOL 101. This course delved deeply into the material, and it was really nice to be able to see these fascinating concepts and processes up close rather than just simply being told what happens.",
    "Am now comfortable with proteins, membranes, metabolism",
    "Insight into why and how certain processes in the body occur, as well as how various processes are connected and work together.",
    "The course was a very thorough overview of biochemistry, with a lot of emphasis placed on metabolism. I think it really primed my mind on how biomedical research is done and all of the very useful applications biochemistry has. It's definitely a lot of material (and its incredibly daunting when studying for the final) but I found the class to be really enlightening and I would recommend to anyone who really want to learn about biochemistry.",
    "I believe the most useful knowledge and skills taught in this course were related to laboratory methods taught in the first half of the course. I also believe the framework for understanding metabolism will be useful in the future.",
    "I learned a great deal about the intricacies of biochemistry and mechanisms that occur in our body every day. It was a really eye-opening experience to learn about all these different processes. I learned about how evolution acted to truly optimize the performance of our cells and bodies.",
    "The details stuck a lot. I think they'll be very useful for the MCAT. I think the details were a bit excessive otherwise for learning the concepts.",
    "I learned so much-lots of information that helped understand overarching themes in biochemistry",
    "You learn biochemistry! A good synthesis of organic chem and bio, and you'll develop an appreciation for things going on in your body that you didn't know were happening. Would recommend for all the premeds out there, and even if you aren't premed, it's got material worth listening to.",
    "MB&B 300 was in many ways much like the introductory bio sequence in its emphasis on larger concepts while also providing substantial detail but in many more respects. This is obviously a very salient point of a biological education since small details cannot and will not always be recalled while larger themes emerge time and again. The class was very helpful in synthesizing and sharpening this idea of concepts and showed how it could be applied very carefully to those relevant aspects of life.",
    "In this class, I learned to use my understanding of general principles in biochemistry to understand more detailed information. This class is an excellent MB&B course.",
    "General knowledge about biochemistry, very specifically its principles and various forms of metabolism in the human body",
    "Protein Structure and function, biochemical pathways",
    "It's a good background in Biochemistry with a rather large amount of overlap with the Intro Bio courses.",
    "You end up memorizing a lot of stuff that makes you sound like you know what you're doing. More importantly, you kind of learn generally how the main metabolic pathways work and kind of how and why they do what they do, plus other basic stuff like enzyme kinetics.",
    "Lots of mechanistic understanding of how biochemistry works.",
    "I gained intimate knowledge of metabolic pathways and the molecules involved in them.",
    "I developed my understanding of biomolecules, biology, and chemistry - building off a lot of what we learned in the intro biology courses.",
    "I developed better time management. Often times, this class would have an exam the day after an exam at 7pm for Physics, which meant somehow managing to study for both classes, and not getting much sleep. If you are taking both physics and biochemistry, you must learn to manage your time well. I also learned a lot about medicine in this class, and have a better understanding for how the human body works.",
    "Biochemistry.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of biochemistry such as membrane physiology and especially metabolism. I also learned about certain diseases and other aspects of medicine.",
    "This class taught me a lot about biochemistry and its applications to the study of metabolism. The course covers a lot of general biology and chemistry principles and then goes in to a much deeper analysis of metabolic pathways. I also think I developed a skill of analyzing metabolic pathways even without specific knowledge of each process involved.",
    "Understanding how to approach both memorization and concept application based questions",
    "I loved the metabolism section of the course because my outside research requires an understanding of these kind of principles. The integration of metabolic pathways was interesting.",
    "This course allowed me to develop an understanding of how the body works from the perspective of chemistry and physics. The mechanisms of metabolism were explained in molecular terms. In particular, this course developed my reasoning skills about the principles of biochemistry rather than straight memorization of metabolic pathways.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of some of fundamentals of biochemistry, and also learned a large number of facts about metabolism. While I anticipate remembering some of these, I would guess that the main things that I will really remember from this class are the more underlying principles (not the six principles of metabolism, because those are very straightforward and I already knew all of those, but on a deeper level).",
    "Learned a lot about perseverance and how to study properly. Actually enjoyed synthesizing all the material together at the end, although it was annoying that it often did involve a lot of straight memorization of little details even though they claimed that it wasn't going to be so much of that, but i could see the focus shifting more onto concepts, which I appreciated.",
    "I learnt more about the integration of various metabolic pathways, and how they all inter-relate to regulate bodily functions. I am also happy that I have memorised all 20 amino acids and (most of) glycolysis, citric acid cycle and FA metabolism, learnt more on different kinds of carriers\/channels.",
    "I learned how to relate biochemical themes and ideas to how my body works and how chemical processes are conducted.",
    "True to what this course claims, i did actually learn a lot from one semester in this course. The class is intense and each lecture is packed with a lot of information that can be difficult to digest at first. I feel that I did end up learning a lot from the lectures, however, and that they gave me a strong foundation in biochemistry. Although different parts of the course were taught by different instructors which made it feel disjointed at first, I think that what I learned felt coherent even if I wish it were a little better structured with regard to how different lectures relate to one another. This course also did a good job of teaching biochemistry research skills, which were incorporated both through explicit introduction of research methods and explanations of how important discoveries in biochemistry were made; I felt that this was an important set of skills I learned from this class.",
    "How to apply concepts to biochemical processes, instead of just memorizing mechanisms. It was really helpful!",
    "My knowledge of biochemical processes particularly increased during Koelle's lectures. His style of integrated teaching is very effective. I developed the skill of inference and induction, especially the way that the homework assignments and exams were structured.",
    "Takes a lot more memorization than they say to do well in this class. Don't be fooled.",
    "I developed insight on how our metabolism works on a molecular level. After taking this course, I feel like I'm now able to refute\/confirm what I've heard in old wives' tales or word-of-mouth sayings about the way our body processes the things we eat to convert them to energy. I think on some questions of the exams, I learned to better apply my knowledge of biochemistry to different situations.",
    "This course definitely highlighted the importance of focusing on learning common themes in biochemistry rather than fixating on memorizing small details. This mentality, as well as the specific principles, seems like it will be very important moving forward in my scientific experience.",
    "Principles that govern reactions Biophysics of membranes Understanding regulation and feedback Enzymes and catalysis and competition vs inhibition Memorization :(",
    "I developed a greater knowledge in some specific topics in biology to provide a more chemical composition. At the same time, I developed some problem solving skills to supplement the different areas such as metabolism that were explored.",
    "I felt I thoroughly learned the basics of biochemistry related to proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates, as well as specific details of some pathways in metabolism. I greatly appreciated the focus on learning concepts rather than memorizing details, an aspect of the course which had given me a more solid foundation in biochemistry."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths were definitely the two professors Matt Simon and Michael Koelle. They were excellent instructors and answered questions with perfect explanations. They truly cared about instructing the class. Another strength was that we were provided with lecture handouts- this really helped to learn the material in lecture where we could take notes. Sections were OK, not the best. I think the homework assignments were fairly good- a couple ones that were tricky and unclear, but piazza was a good forum to ask questions. Piazza was good, but sometimes overwhelming! Additionally, sometimes students answers could be confusing or overwhelming. It'd be nice if an instructor tried to check these answers, but I know that is a lot of time.",
    "It is a fascinating course that throughout connects to human disease and interesting topics. However, it is very difficult and requires a huge time commitment.",
    "Great slides, but reading could've been better chosen to reflect the material covered in class\/exams. Essentially, the readings became increasingly less relevant as time passed.",
    "This course has the potential to be one of the great courses of Yale. The material is presented fairly well and it's interesting, but the grading ruins it all. We want to learn and be encouraged to absorb and mull over the material so we do more than memorize everything and forget it after the final - in attempt to get a good grade. The learning atmosphere was incredibly hostile and I really didn't enjoy this course as a STEM major interested in the material. A shame!",
    "Good class, interesting material. Matt Simon's part of the class was by far the most interesting. Major criticism: Miranker really shouldn't be teaching it again. His part of the class was terrible - lectures were boring, pace was too slow, didn't teach much. He's a nice guy and seems to care about teaching, but seriously, I think the course suffered for it.",
    "Due to the highly competitive nature of the students taking course, I (and a lot of people that I've talked to) think that in addition to test performance, student improvement by the end of the semester should be taken into consideration. Some students dedicate all of their time into this class because they take classes over the summer as well and thus spread out their course load, but for those of us who cannot afford this luxury, it is really difficult to ask us to keep up to pace with those students while juggling a harder course load. Also, since it is true that once you get behind, it's hard to catch back up, instead of penalizing students for falling behind, could you create a way to make sure that material is learned and everyone is on the same page, step by step? For example, could you start instituting quizzes so that smaller chunks of information are tested? These are just thoughts, but I think it could make a huge difference on test performance if the class were structured this way.",
    "Extremely well-organized, well-presented and well-taught course. Clear, direct and consistent presentations. Great lecture series!",
    "Strengths: Overall, a good introduction to biochemistry. Weaknesses: Grading and wording of the questions on exams was quite ambiguous, where I seemed to score low on exams even if I understood the concepts. For a few questions on the exams, I had the correct answer but it was labelled differently than what they were expecting (although I even wrote the correct value right next to my answer)--I asked my TF for the possibility of a re-grade, and although they did not say no to the possibility, there was much hesitation and ambiguity in me being able to submit the exam for re-grade. One reason was that the TF who graded that page of the exam would not want to give points back (even though the answer was correct), which I thought was slightly unfair. I understand that the question was only worth a few points and would not change my placement in the grading quartiles, but small moments like these felt discouraging in my time during this course, where I felt like grading was taken to such a degree as to undermine student learning. I felt like the grading system of the exams did not reflect student learning very well, and this was very discouraging. However, other students may not feel this way, but I do want to bring this up for slight consideration.",
    "I think there could be a few fewer factual questions on exams and a few harder conceptual ones. The course emphasizes concepts well, and suggests that the facts that it makes you memorize are simply in service of either complete understanding of a principle, or are must-know facts for any aspiring biochemist. However, the amount of information that is given in lecture, and the amount of information that is new, due to limited undergraduate experience for most of this course's students, still is daunting and hard to fully wrap one's head around. There is little about the lectures that I would want changed, but the exams are scary not for the conceptual questions, which are fairly straightforward, generally, but for the points on each that rely on spouting specific words which were mentioned once. It's completely worthwhile, but keep up with the material and know the underlined words on each study guide by heart.",
    "Strengths are that lectures are always super organized, all material in the course is extremely useful, and the professors are very knowledgeable. I greatly appreciated being able to meet with the peer tutor weekly. I also appreciated the study guides and supplements. The greatest weakness of this course is that this class is so incredible stressful because it is practically entirely dependent on exam performance on the two midterms and one final. The curve of grades in this class is brutal, stress-inducing, and not conducive to student learning; it perpetuates the stereotype of pre-med classes being grade-focused and not content-driven. It's hard to recover if you do not do well on one test. Homework assignments are way too easy and do not facilitate the level of conceptual understanding required on exams. TAs are not invested in this course, while in the Physiological Systems course, the TAs were incredibly smart, prepared, and readily took extra time to meet with students outside of section. As an example, I originally went to the TA Q&A review session for the final, and left after 30 minutes because the TAs did little or no preparation for the session and in all honesty, one fellow student was answering more questions than the three TAs were. This course could be greatly improved by somehow reducing the emphasis on exam performance, making homework assignments harder to match exam questions, providing students with extra practice questions, changing the culture of TAs to be more invested in student learning, and providing real review sessions where we actually go over major biochemistry topics rather than just doing Q&A. I also see a lot of potential in having more peer tutors for this class, Christine was great.",
    "Prof. Koelle and my TA Nandan Pandit made this course worthwhile for me -- both are incredible teachers and conveyed complex information in the best possible way. Prof. Koelle's lectures and slides were very conducive to learning.",
    "I appreciated how the course built from core thermodynamic and physical principles and then climbed the ladder of complexity to macromolecular structure, metabolic pathways, and finally the integration of those pathways.",
    "Too much material, and hence requires a lot of memorization. Very little learning, those with the best memories win.",
    "The strengths are that most of the content is taught well. The weaknesses is that the test are very difficult and our psets do not prepare us.",
    "Strengths: professors are intelligent, lectures are relatively engaging, TAs are generally approachable. Weaknesses: the expectations for the midterms and final questions were unclear and the tests were graded seemingly inconsistently. I felt that even though I could explain the material to my peers, I still could not get points on the exam because I lacked the specific words that the answer key had. This greatly decreased my enjoyment of the course.",
    "*I do wish the lecture class was more interactive - the professor challenges the class questions during the second half of the semester helped keep me focused. I do much better with 50 minute classes than 75 min classes - on the off-chance that biochemistry could adopt this structure, I would be very happy. *I dislike the tests. The first was likely too simple, but at least it was clear. I was not always entirely clear what the test questions on the other exams were asking for, which was frustrating because there were clear cases where I knew the concept, but didn't explain it enough to satisfy the rubric. *I did like the printed lecture notes - they were very nice for people without tablets.",
    "I think this class is super well designed and executed. Very happy I took this version!",
    "The course is strong in the amount of information it covers and the degree to which it takes itself seriously. The section could have been more helpful, and I think the homework assignments were a little too easy. My biggest complaint is that it was vocalized often throughout the class that \"details don't matter\", and that was largely true for understanding lecture and doing homework, but was just not true of exams. I wish the homework assignments had included more detailed information about specific enzymes, reactions, etc. even it meant they were a little longer or more difficult.",
    "Make the tests harder. The front skewed curves are ridiculous.",
    "Strengths: breadth of material, lectures were good, homework and practice exams were very helpful in preparing for the final, I had a great TA (Nandan) Weaknesses: lots of memorization",
    "I think the strengths of the course is the clarity of the teaching and the accessibility of help via piazza, peer tutors, TAs, etc. I found this class sometimes very repetitive with earlier courses and thought that it could do a better job of making sure it wasn't beating a dead horse with some of the material we learned. I also think the tests were very memorization based and wished they were more creative in assessing student knowledge.",
    "Strengths: MB&B 300 was very well organized and well-taught. I appreciated that lectures were printed for us, could be found on Classes.v2, and came with accompanying study guides. I found my TA, the peer tutor, and professors all to be very accessible for questions and help. Piazza was available too, although I preferred to meet people in person for help. Weaknesses: The instructors of MB&B 300 want the course to be conceptually instructive and to help students gain a deeper understanding of biochemistry, but the course was still very memorization heavy. I understand that memorization is a prerequisite to understanding the concepts deeply, but I think there are ways to improve the course so that achieving that conceptual understanding is more feasible. I think the greatest improvement would be releasing a lot more practice problems to help students practice applying concepts. I think it would be helpful for exam preparation, but most importantly would work towards the instructors' goal of having students develop a deeper understanding.",
    "The course is very well taught for the most part. The lipids portion this semester was a bit weak and confusing at times and required supplement from the book but otherwise, the lectures are self contained. The metabolism section is very wel taught in a way that fosters real understanding and not just rote memorization.",
    "I think that more regular assessments would be beneficial. The quizzes only really required regurgitation of the lecture material and didn't require that much thought and effort. I think having more chances to test your knowledge of the material before the midterms would have been helpful so it would be easy to know what areas you were struggling with before the midterms came around.",
    "I really like the exams, other than the first page, which always has these random factoids. What's up with that?",
    "I enjoyed the lectures and found the end of the course (last few lectures) to be especially interesting. My only complaint is that it is a lot of memorization and it annoyed me slightly that the professor(s) kept trying to tell us that that wasn't the case. Conceptual understanding was definitely important, but you needed to memorize a large number of facts as well. I don't mind this, but a bit more honesty\/frankness from the professor(s) on that score would've been appreciated.",
    "Homework assignments were limited in scope and felt like \"blow-off\" work, never took more than 20ish mins. Not that I want more homework, but it didn't feel particularly helpful.",
    "Even though the class tried to emphasize the main ideas of biochemistry, there were still a lot of details that we were forced to memorize that don't seem to be useful. Overall though I think I learned a lot from this class because it was well organized.",
    "Strength: nice mix of detailed concepts\/theories with the practical application of those concepts to real life issues--e.g. steps of a metabolic pathway followed by discussion of diseases stemming from disfunction in that pathway Weakness: discontinuity in how the material was covered between the three professors teaching the class",
    "I think that I learned a lot of information and a lot of concepts but I don't think that came across in the exams. The exams themselves weren't that hard in difficult but they, for the most part, asked you to about a wide breadth of material with very little depth in any of them. Therefore I feel as though the people who did well in the course weren't the people who understood the principles of biochemistry the best, but those who just happened to memorize the facts that happened to be on the exam. This makes studying for future exams a little stressful, as your trying to look at every slide and memorize everything on it as opposed to fully engaging with the material (which is admittedly incredibly interesting). I think the way the class is taught is amazing but I think the assessments should be a little harder and focused more on a thorough understanding of the concepts as opposed to rote memorization.",
    "This course was weakened significantly by the sheer volume of memorization required to do well on the quizzes and midterms. I understand the need to memorize the amino acids because knowing their properties is important to understanding protein folding and other interactions. I cannot comprehend the logic of memorizing glycolysis or the names\/exact reaction catalyzed by various enzymes. I understand the point of the glycolysis quiz is to force conceptual understanding, but I don't see how learning the names of individual intermediates or enzymes facilitates this goal. The goals of that quiz would have been much more effectively met if the quiz had consisted of ten questions based on the following: \"Reaction X is pictured below (showing reactants and products). Explain what is happening in this step and how this reaction contributes to the overall goal of this metabolic pathway.\" There was also at least one instance in this course where tested material was outside the scope of the class. Midterm 1 included an interpretation of MS-MS results for one of the questions. Prof Simon specifically told us during lecture (and I wrote this down in my notes for that day) that we would never be asked to do this. The assignment of P-sets also really needs to better correlate with the lecture material. One of the early P-sets asked us about G-protein signalling and why covalent modification would be better than protein-protein interaction for signal amplification. We had learned nothing about signal amplification up to that point, and the only reference to G proteins was a single slide in one of Prof Miranker's lectures that referenced G-proteins as an example of a transmembrane protein without providing any detail of what their function was. Of course, this information was covered many weeks later in one of the last lectures of the course. Similarly, there was another specific question on the midterm 2 that I believe wasn't covered in class. (It's possible that I just missed it, but I attended all lectures and reviewed the lecture slides many times looking for this specific concept and could not find it). This concerns micelles and whether conical or cylindrical phospholipids would form a micelle more readily. I've searched that lecture up and down, and although we talked about the different shapes they make I could not find anything regarding that aspect of their formation. Finally, for a class that prides itself on teaching concepts I found that essentially all of my time was spent memorizing the names of enzymes and what reactions they catalyze rather than really understanding mechanisms. At the very end when it was time to learn integration of metabolism I finally felt like I was learning conceptual things like why insulin and glucagon regulate matabolism and the many pathways those hormones affect. However, many of the test questions asked were too specific to warrant a conceptual understanding. For example, a test question on midterm two asked about how oxaloacetate is replenished when it runs low, and wanted the specific name of the enzyme involved and what reaction it catalyzes. Why is the enzyme name important when the concept involved is that pyruvate from gylcolysis is used make more oxaloacetate when CAC intermediates are drained off for other pathways? Overall, I was disappointed by learning relatively few concepts and instead memorizing large amounts of factual information. Anecdotally, I also found my TA to be disorganized and unprepared to answer questions about the material. Obviously my experience may differ from those with other TAs.",
    "I really enjoyed the great deal of information we learned. I believe the coursework was thorough and a very good introduction to the foundations of biochemistry. However, one weakness of the course may be its emphasis on memorization. Although we did try to avoid this problem with lots of critical thinking\/application questions, there was still a lot of memorization I needed to conduct before each exam.",
    "Strength: Interesting material and taught well. Easy to access materials for study. Weakness: Marketed as details were only meant to illustrate concepts, but exams seemed to go far past that for required memorized details.",
    "Great teaching, great class structure. The information is presented in a way that is easy to interesting and not too difficult to understand. Everyone does well so the class is on a difficult curve and it has a reputation for being a GPA depresser.",
    "Material is all interesting, but the stress that students feel as a result of grading is palpable and probably hinders the experience of the class a little bit. Better partial credit would be helpful, but also it's part of the pre-med mentality.",
    "As a large lecture class, MB&B 300 was generally taught very effectively. The amount of information presented in this first semester of biochemistry was not overwhelming and was in fact just moderate enough to provide a cursory glimpse at the field without overwhelming students. The material was mostly engaging although some topics, I found, were not particularly easy to swallow (e.g., methods of protein manipulation). I must also say that Professor Michael Koelle gives some of the best lectures I have ever seen. His style of teaching and presenting the material in a clear and effective light made learning metabolism a motivating and enthusiastic experience. I came into the course with the highest expectations for metabolism (and almost forgot about topics besides that one) and Koelle exceeded my standards high and beyond. This is not to say that the first half of the semester with Professors Simon\/Miranker was lackluster either, simply that the second half was outstanding. With that being said, I also cannot neglect to say that I walk away from this course with somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth. Despite emphasizing the importance of learning concepts and themes over details, it feels as though oftentimes there was an expectation that such details be known at the drop of a dime and the failure of such would be penalized. It is stated that 50% of exams are fact-based detail questions with the other 50% concept questions. While I agree with this structure, I also feel that this does not wholly comport with the maxim that the instructors preach. Is it really so egregiously bad if I cannot recall, say, that the acetylcholine receptor has two alpha subunits or that a Schiff base provides an electron sink in an intermediate step for the hydrolysis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate by aldolase at a moment's notice? Despite putting in tremendous studying effort into preparing for exams and really learning the material in a way that is compliant with the greater philosophy of the course, I feel that I have been assessed too harshly for such blunders. A way to ameliorate the problem, I think, would be to incorporate cushion into exams by writing more questions that need to be answered and allowing for students to select those which they feel most confident about answering, both in detail questions and in concept questions. While some things should be known cold by everyone like the intermediate step in glycolysis with a high phosphoryl group transfer potential, other more arcane details could be given some lenience. The homeworks are also said to be from past exam questions, but I found that while I was often able to complete the assignment with relatively little difficulty, these did not reflect the same challenging level found on exams. I truly did learn a lot and really do appreciate what this course haven given me, but I would be remiss if I did not mention that I feel strongly that my performance in the course does not wholly represent my understandings and that I am somewhat disappointed by the outcome despite having a good overall semester.",
    "The material is interesting but very detailed. The professors are all fantastic but vary in their level of engagement.",
    "Strengths- content, teaching Weaknesses- assessments were sometimes written so that it wasn't clear how to get full cerdit for an answer- for example, you might lose a point for not mentioning a specific term even if the overall answer was correct.",
    "I think that the lectures honestly were really boring, especially in the second half (sorry Prof. Koelle!). I feel like most people in the class get the basic principles pretty quickly, so rather than beginning with that every lecture and taking the first and last quarter of every class reviewing them, we could spend more time on the material so the more difficult sections are paced a little better. Also, there is just too much to memorize - I don't think it should really matter if we remember the names of all of the major enzymes and stuff. That being said, it was always clear what we had to know for a test, and I do feel like I understand the basis of the most important biochemical pathways in the body.",
    "Professor Simon was amazing; Professor Miranker was very dull but a nice guy; Professor Koelle often acted fairly condescending when teaching about basic principles in my opinion.",
    "I thought most of the course was pretty effective in teaching the copious amounts material at a reasonable pace, although some professors were certainly better lecturers than others. Perhaps making sure all of the lecturers are of similar engagement level could help everyone maintain focus throughout the lecture series.",
    "Course is very well structured and organized, assignments are straightforward, exams are fair.",
    "Strengths of this class is that it is very engaging and applicable to life. Weaknesses are the difficulty and lack of help resources outside of discussion sections. There aren't really review sessions, aside from the 1 hour of help for each exam that the peer tutor gives.",
    "It's content-delivery, though the instructors did try to make overarching themes\/concepts apparent. I think it's just fine as it is.",
    "I do not like that it was taught by 3 different professors. The p-sets were too easy and the exams were too hard.",
    "The course covers a lot of interesting topics and most lectures were very good at explaining the key ideas. I think a big strength of the course comes from the metabolism unit, in which students are given a wholesome, comprehensive overview of a few metabolic pathways. Studying those lectures was very rewarding because it was possible to tell at the end of it that one had developed a deep understanding of the material. I think the biggest weakness of the course is its emphasis on memorization. The professors often stressed that conceptual understanding was the key to doing well, and it helped, but so much of the exams relied on students having memorized specific facts about tons of different concepts. I understand that some level of memorization is required for any class but this class felt especially reliant on it. If that could be reduced, possibly by rewriting questions to include any necessary facts, and then asking students to make conceptual links between those ideas, then the class would be greatly improved.",
    "I thought the professors were great and they tried to make the lectures as engaging as possible. Additionally, my section TA was very helpful, especially during the exam review sessions and when we did practice problems. Having practice exams was also helpful. One improvement could be the professors providing more practice material.",
    "Strengths--Professor Koelle made the material very manageable and approached metabolism in a very effective way Weaknesses--exams tested very minute details",
    "I liked the material covered and learned a lot. However, everyone was so bunched at the top of the grade distributions that it shouldn't have been graded on a percentile curve. If you did below the average on one midterm there was really no way to catch back up. Either the midterms should have been equally hard to make the distribution more even or they're should have been no curve. If they wanted to make it a less competitive class, they should have fixed the grading, not added the supplement. Also, I had a hard time paying attention to powerpoints when I had all the notes. Maybe if the printed notes had blanks to fill in, I would have paid more attention.",
    "It was emphasized by the instructors that details were not important but rather we should focus on the big picture. However, a lot of what was tested required that we know minute details. This is not necessarily a bad thing though - I think to learn biology in general, one needs to know facts before being able to apply bigger principles.",
    "This course was very well organized so that it was clear what was expected of students.",
    "It was a fairly interesting course but the format of just listening to a powerpoint made it hard to pay attention. I would have preferred more engaging lectures.",
    "The major strength of the class is in its clear organization around the central themes of biochemistry, which means that students have a clear picture of the material that they are expected to learn at all times. The class does a good job of outlining the facts and principles that one should understand, making the material easier to process as there is little confusion about whether something is covered on exams. In addition, both Professors Simon and Koelle are excellent lecturers that are very clear in teaching the material, with good supplementary material that covers the core concepts of each lecture.",
    "I thought that the material covered was extremely interesting and the course was generally designed in a logical and straightforward way that built on itself and facilitated learning. It was one thousand times better than the intro bio sequence, which I really appreciated. I did feel that there were occasionally random facts that we needed to memorize that didn't seem relevant; in general, I would shy away from making students memorize the details of examples, instead focusing on having students understand the biochemical logic of the examples and memorize the fundamental body of knowledge that the course is trying to impart. I might like to see a little more focus on the underlying chemistry (we did all take orgo!) or even some physics rather than memorization of names that don't mean anything to us. Also: photosynthesis? Please? You could probably fit it in if you cut out all of the times that Professor Koelle told us how hard a relatively easy lecture was going to be. Still, it was mostly a fun class!",
    "Taught by 3 diff profs - it's hard enough to get to know one prof really well over the course of just a semester, much less three. Also difficult bc I felt like I was constantly having to adjust to new teaching styles, which were all VERY different. Some profs were more confusing than others, some seemed to care a lot about us whereas some didn't care at all - I appreciate that there's likely a lot of difficulty in the behind-the-scenes work of planning out who will teach the course, but sometimes I felt like teacher quality was really getting sacrificed for the sake of I'm not really sure what. Also, my TA was AWFUL. Unsure if s\/he was just very nervous for the whole semester about teaching us, but s\/he always seemed very unprepared. I often wished that one of my peers would just get up and lead section instead. However, some good strengths - definitely liked (in the end, although it was hard at the time) synthesizing all of the metabolic pathways together at the end! Felt like I was really working my brain and thinking through things, also cool to pull together info that we'd been working on from weeks ago in the semester.",
    "The course covers a lot of material in a structured way. The study guides provided for each lecture was also very useful, and lecture slides are also printed for every student. However, I personally feel that some key concepts (especially regulation of metabolism) is organised in a convoluted manner. Also the professors were difficult to hear sometimes, especially since Sudler Hall has bad sound architecture.",
    "I didn't feel prepared for the testing, i think the course is interesting but there is so much going on and they don't help us prepare for it when testing comes around.",
    "This course gave a great overview of biochemistry and its strength was definitely in the engagement of its various professors. That they were all so knowledgable and accomplished in the field of biochemistry definitely gave this course a dimension that it would have otherwise lacked. They were very enthusiastic in introducing topics and relevant research in biochemistry, which was a huge strength of this course. However, the pace of the course made it so that it was sometimes hard to draw the connections between earlier lectures from Prof Simon to the later lectures by Prof Koelle. I wish underlying concepts and relationships between different things in biochemistry were better emphasized so that there was a more integrated sense between the various lectures\/lecturers.",
    "Homework should be more closely aligned with the lectures, and the lectures should be a bit more organized, but overall a solid course.",
    "The class was well organized with lecture outlines, summaries, and clear lecture notes. This aspect is appreciated as it is generally lacking in a lot of STEM courses. Given that the class was organized it became easy to feel that the material was manageable. However, the depth of information and specificity required on exams was not emphasized enough. This was a weakness either in the instruction or in the way exams were created. It was stated that general concepts would be tested but this did not seem to be the case based on how exams were graded.",
    "Strengths - Koelle is a fantastic teacher - The material is interesting, especially enhanced by supplements Weaknesses - There are not enough visual methods of learning. - The exams are extremely difficult but there is not enough of the inductive reasoning practiced during lecture to prepare for the exam.",
    "You learn a lot obut there is a ridiculous amount of content you are expected to know",
    "The strength of the course was just the amount of information covered. I think some weaknesses are that there isn't very much support for students that need a bit of extra help to process\/memorize this information. The peer tutor was helpful, as she told us how to think about learning and processing this information. I wish the TAs during section also would be able to do this. Sections were mainly just time to hear the lecture material again. I think a more productive section leader would have taken the lecture material and presented it in a different way to provide students with varied ways of thinking about the material. Additionally, I think the tests for the most part were fair. However, there were a few questions here and there that were rather ambiguous in their wording. Also, I think the beginning sections of the exams tested us on small minutiae that aren't \"important\" facts to know. In keeping with the spirit of the course (which is to focus less on the small details and develop a solid understanding\/methodology to understand biochemical concepts), I think testing students on the more important details would be more pertinent and would be a better metric of understanding for the course material.",
    "This course is very well organized and meticulously put together, which definitely helps in learning the material. I appreciate that the lecture slides are provided for us in class, which made following along with the professor and taking notes much easier. I thought that the material was well-selected and relatively interesting, though the pacing of the class sometimes alternated between being a tad fast and a tad slow. Overall, though, I liked this class and can see the clear effort put into it by all parties involved.",
    "Less memorization of random facts and exams made purposefully difficult\/confusing to increase the curve. I did not feel like this class was \"exammed\" like a concept class. The first exam Faster graded midterms, and better direction as to what is going to be exammed - practice tests often not telling. Especially for the second quiz - studied the wrong ideas for a week, then transitioned to memorizing glycolisis for 2 days. Better organized review sessions",
    "The strengths of this course relied on the concept of building up knowledge from previous biology courses. In that sense, one of its weaknesses were the continuous repetition of the same information. At the same time, the TAs did not really have too much knowledge or were able to aid as much in other courses. Since it was full of premed students, this was a very cutthroat class.",
    "This class requires a lot of memorization but the professors do a good job of reinforcing some fundamental principles that apply in more than one place.",
    "Overall, the course was excellent. The goals and expectations were clearly explained, and the professors were committed to the course. I especially appreciated the study guides to tie things together. The pre-metabolism lectures, from Prof. Miranker and Prof. Simon tended to get a bit jumbled at times, with lots of information on slides that were not uniformly formatted. Reformatting these slides might help with the flow of the course. Some exam questions also were confusing. If it is not already done, perhaps the TFs could take the exam beforehand to find any points needing clarification. I did feel that the TFs were not as strong as in other courses I have taken. They were very kind and cared about their students, but they didn't seem to have a full grasp of the material. I understand that they have probably not studied introductory biochemistry for a long time, but there were a few times at section that I felt the TF had not paid attention to the lecture or homeworks and could not answer questions covered in class effectively. The materials prepared by my TF were very helpful."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is a great course with great professors. Be prepared to put in the work but if you do, you should do well!",
    "Definitely - much better than the MCDB version",
    "Take it if you must. Koelle and co. are good and seem to care about students a lot. Class is well run, and there's quite little work outside of class. That said, exams are challenging and require substantial amounts of memorization (regardless of what Koelle says at the beginning). You have to memorize the slides to even have a chance of doing well, though of course the exams stress deeper understanding. It's just that deeper understanding is impossible if you don't know the facts and mechanisms cold. But hey, it's biochem. It was never going to be easy.",
    "Yes, although a lot of the material is similar to that covered in other biology courses.",
    "You only take it because you have to. It is the most hostile course at Yale so be prepared to suffer for a semester for a below average grade.",
    "Definitely a good class and I learned a lot. My only real criticism would be that 1) Miranker should not be teaching the class again and 2) it's really, really hard to do well in. The class is full of intense pre-meds and the curve is unforgiving\/non-existent. Would consider taking MCDB biochem over this if you're thinking about it.",
    "MB&B 300 is not a bad course, but odds are your'e taking it because you're premed or need it for your major. If that's not the case, well it's a pretty standard science class, with a couple of midterms, problem sets, and a final. If you think it's cool go for it.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in biochemistry this course covers many interesting topics. I also enjoyed the supplements at the end of every lecture.",
    "Definitely take this, if you're pre-med, MB&B, or MCDB. I might recommend not taking it during your sophomore fall, though. I took it as a junior, and had been exposed to some of the material before, and it made for a much smoother experience. The course is still hard and daunting - definitely make time to study for this, and pay attention in lecture - but having some familiarity with one or two of the concepts can't hurt. The class rushes through an enormous amount of material, and is extremely worthwhile.",
    "I would recommend it only if you have to take it for pre-med or your major. It is a tough class that has a stressful curve system, but you will learn a lot of useful stuff.",
    "Yes! Although it is very challenging, you learn an incredible amount of interesting and relevant information. It's a very rewarding course.",
    "All MB&B majors have to take this class anyway, so this review is mainly for pre-meds and MCDB majors who might not be super fired up about biochem. First, you can rest assured that this course will not make your life miserable, and in fact will probably exceed your expectations. Overall, it's very well taught (especially by Simon and Koelle), and the exams are fair, even if they cover a ton of material. Though I can't compare this directly to the MCDB version, MB&B 300 seems like a good bet, even for MCDB majors. One potential pitfall is that you don't cover nucleic acids until 301, so pre-meds might have to do some extra self-studying for the MCAT. Aside from that, it's a solid course that may make you like biochem more than you thought you would.",
    "No, take it if you need it for your major.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have to take Biochem. I really enjoyed it although it is very tough to do well.",
    "Take biochemistry if you need to take it. I am not opposed to challenging myself - I took physiology and cell biology for fun (both classes I recommend) and actually enjoyed the material in the class - but I knew based on my bio 101 experience that the teaching style of the class would not be a good fit for me.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone who may be interested in the subject matter or needs biochemistry for premed. By the end of this class, you'll have learned a lot and gained a much better appreciation of topics like metabolism. The curve in the class is pretty frustrating, as much of the class is filled with premeds who all want to get an A. However, if you're still willing to work hard and take the time to really learn the material, you'll get a lot out of the class.",
    "If you're taking it, you'll probably have to, but I think you'll really enjoy it. The curve can be a bit tough, but the material is interesting and the lectures are engaging. Well designed course, and well worth the hours you'll spend studying.",
    "I would recommend this class if you either 1) Don't care about biochemistry per se, but are good at memorizing lots of facts and details, and will hold yourself accountable for keeping up with information as the term goes on OR 2) Don't care about grades per se, but are interested in gaining a more fleshed out version of basic molecular biology\/biochemistry and how life works. Can I name all of the enzymes in the citric acid cycle? Absolutely not. But do I have an intuitive understanding of what happens in my body right after eat, when I'm hungry, etc. and why that makes sense? Yes.",
    "Only if you are premed. If not, then prepare to battle with cut-throat premeds for the coveted A.",
    "Yes! Lots of (very interesting!) information, good teaching, fair workload. Learning about enzyme kinetics and cooperatively was especially interesting!",
    "I would recommend MB&B 300 to students who are ready to memorize and learn a lot of material, but gain a deeper understanding of biochemistry.",
    "I would definitely reccomend this course to other students. Likely if you're taking this course, it's because you are required to, and honestly it's a pretty interesting class. I learned a lot although it is very memorization heavy. You will have to know all of the material from all of the lectures down cold. If you put in the time, you can do very well in the class.",
    "I think the lectures themselves were interesting and the professors were very inspiring and excited to teach this course. That being said, other than the lectures there wasn't much else to foster a sense of interest in the material. Sections were extremely dull and the homework assignments were very monotonous.",
    "You're probably reading this because you have to take the course. Don't worry too much - you'll be okay. As a matter of fact, I learned a lot from this class. Unfortunately, my test performance wasn't reflective of the amount I felt I learned. This wasn't true of the whole class though, so people have different experiences. Overall would recommend.",
    "Yes!",
    "Way better than BIOL 101\/2. Like, WAY better.",
    "I would only recommend this course to another student who has to take it for their major unless they are very interested in the subject.",
    "The course was challenging due to the large content volume. However, for someone interested in the basis of various diseases and workings of the body from a biochemical standpoint, the course was super fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class but i would for sure say make sure that you don't have a hectic schedule so that you can devote the time that this class deserves. i took this with 4 other classes and, while it was doable, I definitely would've performed better had I not been spread as thin.",
    "Yeah, I enjoyed it.",
    "I would absolutely not recommend this course unless your major requires it. I did well in the class but only because I memorized huge quantities of information. You will be told that concepts, not facts, are the important takeaway from this course. That is completely untrue, you will be tested on some concepts but the majority of questions will focus on a huge array of factual information. Be prepared to memorize a lot of enzyme names\/mechanisms. There will also be times where an instructor will tell you that you won't be tested on certain material (like interpreting an MS-MS spectrum) and then that exact question will be present on the next midterm. If you have an excellent memory and are willing to learn every detail of every lecture slide then you will do well. If not, I would absolutely avoid this class.",
    "This course was very well-taught and an amazing introduction to biochem (whether you need to do it for your major or just for FUN). If you are at all interested in the intersect between organic chemistry and biological processes, this is the class for you!",
    "Yes I recommend it! The information is so interesting, although there is so much of it that it does take some effort to keep up with the material. It is definitely not a class that you can cram before an exam for. The professors are really engaging and the lectures aren't dry. But if you're vaguely interested in biology you should take this class!",
    "Anyone who is taking the course most probably needs to take the course. The only question is how many semesters and which of the two biochemistry courses in the MB&B or MCDB departments to take. This is a much larger lecture course with a heavy emphasis on the chemical aspects of the subject, as should be evident from the course designation. It is also believed to be taught better, particularly in the topics on metabolism. MB&B majors do not have the option to take the MCDB course, but I would recommend taking this course over the MCDB course simply because of the content (although I have not attended enough lectures in the other course to provide insight into the exact differences between the two).",
    "I would recommend this class to any student interested in the subject or who is pre-med!",
    "I think if you're looking at biochem, this would be the better course than the MCDB version. That being said, this course is plagued with an emphasis on nuanced detail as opposed to the principles it teaches. Grading is placed on the kind 20%A, A-, B+, and B scale, but because so many students do well, this led to a negative curve on the first test. The only way this is combatted is by the TAs using a grading rubric that relies heavily on using specific terms to describe biochemical ideas, and even if you understand these ideas but fail to remember the terms, it will hurt your grade. Otherwise, this course proves that biochemistry is an integral part of the advancement of medical and scientific knowledge about how organisms function. So if you can discover this passion for yourself over the semester, you should feel motivated to study for the quizzes and tests because not only is it useful for the MCAT but it is useful for a life in scientific discovery.",
    "Yes! the class was a lot of material but well taught and interesting",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "Take it if you have to, it's interesting. Be prepared to greatly increase your flash card budget, though - there's a crazy amount of stuff to memorize.",
    "If you gotta take it, you gotta take it. Definitely would recommend over the 1 semester biochem class - they cram too much info in too little time.",
    "If you want to learn metabolic pathways in depth in a pretty clear manner, this is definitely a good class to take. If you need to learn it for pre-med, this class is significantly better than the MCDB biochem class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was well-taught, and challenging but not ridiculously so. I felt that most things I learned will be useful later in my life.",
    "I would only recommend taking this course if it was required for you to take a biochemistry course. This one is definitely better than the other biochemistry course. MBB 300 is the way to go, but only if you're required to take it or have a profound interest in biochemistry.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you're not a pre-med or MB&B major.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless they need to take it as a major or pre-med requirement.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. I think it is very well-taught and aside from minor flaws, like the dependence on memorization, I think that it does a good job of highlighting some major principles of biochemistry. I definitely enjoyed the course material.",
    "I would definitely recommend MB&B Biochem for anyone who needs it as a requirement\/premeds. The workload throughout the course is reasonable, however, it is very important to try and stay of the material presented in lecture. If you do not, it will be very hard to catch up before exams.",
    "You will have to take biochem for premed---material was very engaging but the exams tested minor details and the curve was very steep.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in more advanced science. Material was interesting and well-taught.",
    "Take it if you're pre-med and you have to.",
    "I would recommend this class to another person that is interested in biochemistry as the course is well organized, and does a good job of teaching the important major principles rather than getting lost in a sea of details that will immediately be forgotten following an exam. The course has a reasonable workload with small homework assignments, but there is a significant amount of material that one is expected to cover and understand when it comes time to take the exams. The class can be overwhelming at times in terms of the sheer amount of material, but the class does a good job easing this burden, and if one needs to take a biochemistry class for requirements then this class is a good way to learn the material.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys biochemistry. Probably most of the people taking this class are doing it for a requirement, but I found the material consistently very interesting, and it was presented at a very reasonable level. There was very little work (the weekly problem sets usually took well under an hour), and generally it was not particularly conceptually difficult, but there was a considerable amount of memorization, so I would recommend starting studying early for the exams. The lecturers were mostly fine (Simon was great, but Koelle often felt pedantic), but the material itself is the main draw of this class - assuming that you're into that kind of thing.",
    "My guess is that you'll have to take this course bc you're either premed or it's required by your major. My advice is to study and stay on top of the material, otherwise it will absolutely come back to bite you in the end.",
    "It is a good introduction to biochemistry, and I must say that I came out of the class with a much better understanding of various metabolic processes. However, it also has very high workload, as you need to spend a lot of time memorizing tiny details (e.g. the size of a HeLa cell is 2pL, H-bond is 2-3A etc). The class is curved, which made tests very stressful. Definitely put in consistent effort, and spend a lot of time going through your notes after each class. It will also help if you are good at self-studying, because some of the concepts were not very clear on the slides.",
    "The course was interesting, but if you are going to take it, get consistent outside help.",
    "This is a very challenging course that will ultimately give you a great foundation in biochemistry. Though the average workload (i.e. psets) is not tremendous, the exams warrant a lot of studying given that they involve a lot of memorization, and are difficult not just because of the material but because the curve tends to be so high. That being said, I do think this class is worthwhile to take, and not just because it's required for the MB&B major I often found myself learning things that I thought were simply incredible and fascinating, and that definitely made the course worth it despite its difficulty.",
    "Yes, it's a solid course. You'll actually learn about biochemistry, not just memorize pathways.",
    "I would recommend taking this course alongside Physiological Systems, even if both courses are difficult with heavy workloads. They will both seem more interesting in the long run if taken together! Koelle's lectures on metabolism, the second half of the course, are the best and most logically structured. The other lectures aren't as enjoyable. Take MBB 300 over the MCDB version if you have a choice. I recommend watching YouTube videos related to the material or else it is easy for all of it to get jumbled. Armando Hasudungan's Biochemistry videos are particularly helpful. I never read the textbook but it would have been extremely beneficial in hindsight. Sometimes you just don't have that kind of time, so reviewing study guides posted by the instructors is useful.",
    "Only take if you need to.",
    "Take this course for a very solid, jam-packed introduction to biochemistry. Be prepared to work hard for this course, as it feeds you a lot of information to process in a short amount of time. In the end, it can be very rewarding to begin to understand our body's biological reactions on a chemical level.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. In many ways, MB&B 300 resembles and improves on the best aspects of the intro biology classes. The lecture notes and study guides here are clear and precise, and the lectures and discussion sections effectively teach the material. The focus on overarching themes rather than specific details is a welcome change and will surely serve to improve ones ability to effectively learn and recall the knowledge that will prove useful in the future.",
    "All in all good, keep up with the material, a good class, well taught concepts. Beware the memorization, especially next to 100s of premeds. Grading seems to be fair, but if curve is too high, the exams are going to get trickier to bring it down.",
    "I would recommend this course along with physio because a lot of the topics overlap, and you learn some things in this class that you don't in the other and vise versa. There is a lot a lot a lot of memorization but you also are taught things that help you understand the fundamental principles.",
    "This is a great way to learn biochemistry with a few caveats. Because almost everyone taking the course does so for the pre-med requirements or for their major, it becomes quite difficult to do well. Because so much material is covered, it is hard to gauge how well one has prepared for the exams. However, if you follow the professors' advice for studying and keep on track, then it should work out fine. The homeworks are extremely easy, taking less than a half hour each week. This leaves lots of time to study material after lectures, but also leaves the temptation of doing nothing until the exam.",
    "The course definitely throws a lot of information at you so it's imperative to keep up. Once you get behind, it's hard to catch up, especially since a lot of the topics build on each other. It's a hard course and requires a lot of time spent investing in studying, but the information is very interesting and ties various concepts together so that it can be applied to relevant situations. This course is also very helpful if you're planning on taking the MCAT."
