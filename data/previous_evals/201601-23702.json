    "A great class for someone who wants to learn more about projections and maybe even get to fiddle around with them a bit. Would definitely recommend regardless of interest. Projections can really be used in all disciplines!",
    "This course is a really interesting introduction to projections. Erich acknowledges that everyone is coming from different levels of experience, but he really does make sure that beginners aren't lost and people who are more proficient also are engaged. I definitely would recommend this is you're looking for something a little different than the standard Yale class!",

    "Great class!! Take it take it. Erich is amazing and brilliant and you have the opportunity to learn SO much, and workload is beyond manageable. Do it!"
