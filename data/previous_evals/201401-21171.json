    "Yes.",
    "Take it!But be prepared. A lot of work.",
    "YES! TAKE THIS COURSE! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, KRONMAN IS AMAZING AND DS WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE.",
    "You read philosophy works from Descartes to Korsgaard. Most of the emphasis is on metaphysics and ethics, and it is incredibly interesting how each philosopher carries forward or disputes other philosopher's ideas. The course can be tough but is very rewarding.",
    "Yes\u2014a challenge that will make you grow as a thinker.",
    "It's DS so it's a lot of work and grappling with hard texts but the challenge is 100% worth it.",
    "A reading of modern philosophy from Descartes through Korsgaard. I would absolutely recommend the class: it will truly change the way you look at the world, especially if you have Professor Kronman.",
    "My favorite of the Spring DS courses. The reading is relatively light for a DS course and yet extremely profound. Highly recommended.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Kronman may be the best professor at Yale. He is tough. If you have any qualms about a paper, he will tear it apart. But that's what a professor is supposed to do and there is no one you would rather learn from! Trust me!",
    "DS philosophy is a solid introduction to western philosophy. It grants you a surface understanding that might pique your interest. I would recommend the class.",
    "The Spring semester of DS philosophy takes students through modern philosophies, beginning with Descartes and ending with Nietzsche and the still living Korsgaard. The class will recall many of the ancient philosophers that you will have studied in the Fall semester and at times asks you to consider how what is changing in the world has affected philosophy. I would recommend this course to others if they were interested in DS in general."
