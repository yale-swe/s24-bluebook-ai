    "It's a great workshop to focus on the craft of writing.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend this course to the aspiring essay writer. Because you have free rein over your topics, it's a great opportunity to find what you're interested in which might not be what you thought you'd be writing about in the first place, so prepare yourself for potential surprises. You write five essays and do one dramatic revision of an earlier essay (cutting or expanding). The reading is light, but do it, as you'll be cold-called on."
