   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's a great way to hone grammar and pronunciation through the study of a variety of types of Italian literature and flims",
    "Yes. If you're looking to continue Italian, then take this course (especially with Prof.ssa Sodi). You'll get to practice all the skills, and it won't be incredibly work-intensive or tedious. It's a lot of fun, and you definitely won't regret it. Prof.ssa Sodi is fantastic, although a later section is definitely preferable since the other students will be awake and more eager to talk, which makes it a lot more fun.",
    "It is a course in which a students writes weekly compositions, then prepares what i like to call \"mini-assignments\" on different aspects of culture throughout the week- things such as music throughout the decades, italian mystery novel, and current italian films. Much of the time spent in class is spent simply in conversation.",
    "A great class on a day to day basis, always a pleasure and I ENJOYED doing my homework!",
    "I would recommend this course for students who want to continue to improve their Italian. It is not very labor intensive, especially since there are not tests and there is no final.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian 150 to anyone interested in Italian. Prof.ssa Sodi is a fantastic teacher. You do have to write weekly page-and-a-half essays, but overall the workload is pretty spread-out; you have to read a couple short books and some passages from the course packet, and you have to go to CIS on your own time to watch a handful of movies.",
    "I would recommend it to another student who feels very unsure about his\/her conversation skills. It's definitely a good way to improve speaking. If you're already at an advanced speaking level, though, it's probably not the class for you.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is interesting in practicing their Italian, learning more about the culture, and doesn't mind writing a composition every week."
