   "comments": [
    "I took this class on a bit of a whim, loving Professor Barraclough's \"Race, Class, Gender in American Cities\". I am SO happy I took U.S. Urban History with Professor Klein. This course included a wonderful range of case studies of different urban phenomena (from suburbanization to Hurricane Katrina). I also had the opportunity to write a number of papers related to material that interested me from archives and my own personal research.",
    "I gained a lot more knowledge about trends in US History (both specifically urban history and American history more broadly). Also honed my skills in writing a long research paper.",
    "a great syllabus with lots of wonderful readings",
    "Professor Klein taught us about the critical interconnectedness of race, gender, and labor history. I also learned about how to prepare for a senior essay before I actually have to write it! Yay!",
    "I learned a lot about the lenses through which to look at history in a variety of American cities dating back to the late 1800s. I also learned to appreciate the ways in which historically marginalized people have been empowered to become powerful political agents and advocates for themselves and their communities.",
    "We learned about a number of in depth case studies of urban centers throughout american history. The course explored urban politics, geography, and specifics of many individual cities. The course also teaches the process of historiographic writing quite well and the final paper is built into learning about the process of tracing history.",
    "This was the first history seminar experience, so I think I grew a lot in terms of being willing to speak up in class and learning how to participate in a seminar discussion. I also learned an incredible amount about each of the cities we covered."

   "comments": [
    "Overall, fantastic learning experienceone of my favorite (if not my absolute favorite) at Yale. Useful assignments, absolutely fantastic readings, and masterful discussion leading by Professor Klein. My recommendation: cut the podcast assignment (not a particularly valuable research assignment). Also, consider eliminating the discussion questions that guide in-class conversation; I feel like we would have hit all the points of conversation (especially with Professor Klein's skillful teaching) without referring to sheets of questions.",
    "I think this course could be improved if Professor Klein's questions for the class were sent out ahead of time. Also, if prompts were a little more comprehensive that would be appreciated. Other than that, I really enjoyed this course and found the readings and discussions to be fruitful.",
    "The course has a very well crafted syllabus. It demonstrates both change over time and a variety of issues. The course assignments were also well geared towards ensuring that students have the necessary skills to complete the final paper.",
    "The readings are fantastic and Professor Klein runs great seminar discussions. Professor Klein is also very helpful in the final paper process. Professor Klein gives great feedback on assignments. Weaknesses: Some of the assignments to prepare for the final paper (especially the Precis) come too early in the semester in my opinion, making them not as useful as they could be. Professor Klein generally gives great feedback on assignments, but for the final outline that was due for the final research paper, we never got comments back. This made it harder to write the paper and also made this assignment less useful than it could have been.",
    "A great syllabus, but lots of useful assignments (many outlines, little projects, etc).",
    "Our discussions were great, and I found the graded assignments to be very reasonable. However, we had what seemed to be an number of unnecessary steps in advance of our research paper. I wouldve liked some more guidance on what these pieces were for or perhaps a draft for a final step rather than a second outline. I also didnt really like how specific the readings were. Rather than getting a strong overview of urban history at large, I gathered an understanding of very particular case studies that Im not sure I can use to generalize a set of knowledge on the subject.",
    "Overall great class - awesome reading materials, amazing professor, interesting subject matter. I really liked the amount of support we got with the final paper, which made it much less daunting in the end. The only thing I was not quite sure about was the podcast project. It seemed like a kind of unnecessary afterthought. An improvement would be to either give it more structure or time for students to prepare (assigning it right before finals along with the paper made it much more hectic), or change it to something that can be completed earlier on in the semester.",
    "Although I enjoyed everything we read for class, I felt that they were a lot at times. I would have also liked to have had more guidance on how to research, prepare, and write the 20 page final paper. I have never written a paper that long before. I did, however, really like having outlines due before the final paper due date. They really helped me keep in check. Overall, I think this was a great course. I was definitely challenged and had a lot of work to complete, but appreciate having more assignments that carry less weight than less assignments that are worth large portions of my final grade.",
    "The course was really interesting, the material was new, and the discussions were fantastic. It is a lot of reading and a good amount of work. Be ready for it, but totally worth it.",
    "I really though the syllabus was well constructed- very diverse and Professor Klein is an incredible facilitator.",
    "Strengths: Well taught, great readings, thoughtful discussions Weakness: A heavy course load, could provide more description\/background about certain assignments"

    "Nothing short of fantastic: Professor Klein is a genius (and a musician, activist, and hardcore rebel), and the readings she assigns are the best I've done for any class. Klein's instruction coupled with the syllabus guarantee that students remain invested in the material and engaged with urban history. Reviews caution that this course is a significant amount of workand although it is, the work is not unmanageable. Writing assignments are straight-forward, and Professor Klein makes explicit what she wants for each one. In other words, the seminar is worth the work that you invest in it. This course changed my understanding of urban historyarguably the most fundamental kind of American historyand the forces that shape it. I would highly recommend it to History majors, students of urban studies, and Yalies looking to radically rethink their understanding of the United States' cities and their occupants.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend taking the course. Its lessons are particularly valuable today.",
    "Yes! Take this class. After Professor Barraclough's \"Race, Class, Gender in American Cities\". I am SO happy I took U.S. Urban History with Professor Klein.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Professor Klein is great and the course material is great. The course is a lot of work but if you are willing to put the time in to do the readings and show up to discussion prepared you will get a lot out of the class.",
    "A wonderful class with lots of assignments. Take if you're interested in labor, US history, etc. I learned a lot of new information in this course even as an upperclassman.",
    "If youre willing to complete the heavy workload, urban history was an incredible history seminar. Professor Klein also cares a lot about her students, which I really appreciated.",
    "An amazing class with an amazing professor. Jennifer Klein is such a smart woman and will by no means go easy on you, but you will love her and the class for it anyway.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course! You will be challenged to think critically about the readings every week and Professor Klein will ensure that you speak every class, but it is definitely worth it. I learned so much in a short period of time and appreciate every conversation I had with Professor Klein (both inside and outside class).",
    "Great class! TAKE IT for sure. (just be prepared to do a good amount of work)",
    "I would highly recommend this for a student who wants rigorous conversation about very interesting texts regrading the urban come up in America. Professor Klein does a brilliant job facilitating, is incredibly accessible, plus the syllabus is wildly diverse (in all the best ways)!",
    "Absolutely. The course has a heavy workload, but the readings were fantastic and Professor Klein is incredibly knowledgeable on all the topics that we covered. This course is really what you put into it. If you're interested in urban history and aren't afraid to work hard, you can get a lot out of this class."
