    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. The class covered a variety of subjects in path, CFA and SEM analyses, including model specification, identification, estimation and hypothesis testing. In addition to learning the basic concepts of SEM, this class also explored some advanced topics, such as multi-group comparisons, boot-strapping, and latent-growth models. This class will give a student the necessary knowledge and skills to understand the concepts of SEM, as well as to apply them in practice and be able to expand the knowledge and skill sets to more advanced topics.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it covers an interesting methodology not taught extensively in other departments."

   "comments": [
    "Prior to the class, I was not well-versed in path, CFA and SEM analyses. I had a limited experience and only understood the general concepts and could follow a prescribed analytical approach for these; but after the class, I was able to better understand why a certain approach was used. I prefer to first understand the concepts on which a certain analytical approach is based, and then jump into the mathematics and estimation - and this class followed that idea.",
    "This course provided me with the knowledge and skills to analyze data with this new method."
