    "This course is great in that it functions as a sort of poetry appreciation group. Class time is spent in Harold's living room reading through poems and discussing one at a time. It is an immersive experience and a unique opportunity to listen to and talk with the living authority on many of the works. Also, Harold is very understanding and operates organically with regards to assignments. He expects all reading to be completed, but he does not like students to stay up late working on papers. I recommend getting a list of poets from Harold at the beginning of the semester so you can be sure you have all the necessary texts. It is never quite clear which poems will be discussed specifically in class. Also, because he is so knowledgable, discussions suffer at times because students are reluctant to speak and sometimes the questions asked to incite conversation can seem obscure."

    "Take this. Read great poetry with a great mind.",
    "I would recommend this class. Sitting in Bloom's living room and talking about the poems that he is so passionate about is an experience if nothing else. You will walk out having learned to appreciate poetry a little bit more and having developed your ability to read it.",
    "Professor Bloom has a very distinct view on literature and it's remarkable to sit with him and hear the thoughts of someone who has devoted himself to literature for 63 years of teaching. He has a cyclopaedic knowledge of literature and it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to experience that.",
    "Absolutely. This course is a singular learning opportunity, and if you are a serious student of poetry, this class is about as good as it gets. Bloom is incredibly kind and so clearly cares a great deal about all of his students; his mentorship is transformative."
