    "I would definitely recommend this class to a psychology major",
    "Good way to fulfill your requirement for the psych major",
    "A qualified yes. This course has one weakness: You never write up a research project of your own. If you'd like to do so, try Research Methods in Psychology.Otherwise: There's not too much work, the readings are optional but interesting, Kazdin has an excellent sense of humor (the sharp British kind, not the reference-to-popular-TV kind), there's no section, the exams are fair and you get more than enough time, you can get feedback on research ideas, you'll hear cool stories from a life spent dealing with troubled kids... really, given that Yale forces you to take an RM course, this went about as well as I could have hoped for.",
    "Professor Kazdin is one of the best professors I've had. While the material is dry at times, he manages to keep lecture entertaining.",
    "The class is interesting if you're interested in the material. The focus is more on definitions of research terms than their actual clinical application. Professor Kazdin's work is fascinating, but you ultimately don't get to hear too much about it, so if that's what you're looking for, then I wouldn't recommend this class. However, to learn about research methods, its' a good class.",
    "Not a particularly interesting subject, but Professor Kazdin is a great teacher. He challenges you and makes the class rewarding.",
    "For a research methods class this one is great. 2 short lectures a week (always got out early). 2 papers and 2 midterms. Every manageable work load. Material is dry but Prof. Kazdin makes lecture enjoyable.",
    "If you have to take research methods, take this one! Al Kazdin is a wonderful professor! So funny and personable. He kept lectures lively and interesting. The material itself is dry, but he seriously made me interested in it because I clearly saw his passion and interest in it. One of my favorite professors!",
    "At first, this class seemed intimidating, but it was really very enjoyable. The papers are not short, but they were fun to write and actually helped in learning the material. Professor Kazdin is a very good teacher, with a sense of humor and many anecdotes that always make class interesting. Since you need a research methods class, take this one!",
    "YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TAKE THIS RESEARCH METHODS COURSE. It's great, the workload is sooooooooooo manageable. Dr. Kazdin is hilarious and this is one of the most useful psychology courses at Yale where you will actually learn things that will help you read and understand research.",
    "Not bad for research methods if you put the work in.",
    "This is a very comprehensive review of the intricacies of research methods and psychology methodology. The class was boring at times- it can be pretty dry material. But having Professor Kazdin as a teacher definitely makes up for that. He is an absolute expert in his field and any psych major should give themselves the chance to have him.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're a psych major. Kazdin is amazing, and the classes themselves are always very interesting (and funny). I loved his teaching style. I also really found the material interesting. I went into the class expecting to find the material a little dry and then go shop other psych classes, but after shopping the first class I was sold on it. The work is conceptually difficult, but not substantially more than other classes in terms of workload. I highly recommend this class. Definitely my favorite psych class at Yale.",
    "Take this class! Especially if you need to fill the research methods req for the psych major. Professor Kazdin is a great lecturer with a kind of dry, corny sense of humor that makes lectures enjoyable. The workload isn't too bad - just 2 tests and 2 10-15 page papers (and he gives really clear guidelines for what to include in them). The grading is also pretty fair. You'll learn a lot about research \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the examples he uses to explain concepts are from clinical psych, but a lot of the concepts can be applied to other areas of research. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Research Methods in Clinical Psychology is a great course to take to fulfill the methodology requirement of the psychology major. Professor Kazdin's lectures are always enjoyable and he has a wonderful sense of humor. The material itself isn't incredibly interesting, but it's important to understand methodology if one is going into a career in psychology -- and Professor Kazdin makes that clear. The workload is very manageable, 2 papers and 2 exams. You do have to do the reading, but the textbook is helpful. The exams aren't incredibly difficult, you just have to understand and synthesize the material. Professor Kazdin is not a lenient grader, he expects you to be thorough but not superfluous on papers and tests, but he is fair and helpful."
