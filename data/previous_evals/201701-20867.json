   "comments": [
    "By taking this class, one learns how to do mathematical proofs and how to think critically about complex problems. Moreover, one learns to question everything and not to make false assumptions.",
    "math skills",
    "Due to the precision of Casson's grading, my proof writing greatly increased throughout this course.",
    "This was my first proof based class and it was very challenging but I learned how it approach problems like this.",
    "Proof-based introduction to sequences of real numbers, and sequences of functions of real numbers. It covers proofs for continuity, convergence, and completeness. Intersects with topics like calculus, integral equations, differential equations, and metric spaces.",
    "Learnt about interesting topics like the real numbers, sequences of real constants, and sequences of functions. The course provides a great opportunity to improve proof writing skills.",
    "By taking this course I feel like I was able to get a well rounded grasp on many important theorems. My abilities to prove math problems as well as think critically also seemed to improve over the expanse of this course. Overall, I feel like I have a better handle on math and analysis concepts than before taking this class.",
    "Really great intro to real analysis. Goes through all the standard topics.",
    "I learned how to write basic analysis proofs.",
    "I improved a lot in thinking rigorously about mathematical proofs.",
    "This course was so helpful in helping me understand how to prove things. The only way it makes sense is with practice and there was a lot of practice in this course.",
    "I learn how to write proofs in math.",
    "overview of basic ideas\/theorems in mathematical analysis, proof-writing skills\/practice, deeper understanding of some mathematical fields (calculus, differential equations, integral equations)",
    "Math 300 is all about rigorously proving the theorems and formulas you were given in first-year calculus. If you've never written proofs before, this will be a good introduction as Casson does a nice job going over proof techniques and explaining things clearly. For some reason Math 250 is supposed to be a prereq for this class - I honestly have no idea why and think Math 300 should instead be the prereq for 250. I found the homework problems MUCH more confusing in 250 and harder to understand than in 300. While everything in 300 is in one-dimension, 250 generalizes everything to n-dimensions, which makes things much more complicated.",
    "We rigorously defined and derived topics like limits, the derivative, the Riemann integral, and ideas of convergence. didn't learn a ton of material, but I actually enjoyed this relatively show pace (compared to, say, MATH 350) which provided enough time to digest all the material.",
    "I learned how to better write proofs and think rigorously",
    "Learnt new mathemtical techniques to write proofs.",
    "Quite a kind, but thorough introduction to mathematical analysis and analytical tools. Frankly, the single most valuable thing I got from the class was a much more intuitive feel for epsilon-delta, which, granted, is core to proving many of the important homework problems\/theorems in the class.",
    "Solid introduction to techniques in analysis."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The professor just copied the textbook onto the board, so I didn't see much reason to attend lecture.",
    "Overall, this class is very good as it is. I really enjoyed the material, and thought the tests, pace of the course, and what was asked of students was very reasonable.",
    "maybe attach solutions and answers to homework and exams",
    "It's very challenging and each problem set takes a while especially if you're new to proofs. However, the problem sets are worth only 10% so it's a bit frustrating.",
    "The course is well-taught and engaging. I do feel like we could have covered more chapters in the book. One weakness is that the homework grading was slow. Sometimes I felt like the grader did not care, and that I had no way of verifying if my proofs were actually correct.",
    "The course had some very interesting material. Professor Casson is a great professor with an amazing teaching style. The classes are very well structured and organised.",
    "The material we covered was useful, but often times, we's spend entire classes proving theorems which in no way helped us do homework or tests. The theorems themselves were useful, but the proofs did not aid to my understanding of the course and material.",
    "I think the problems for the problem sets were generally well chosen, but sometimes questions in class were answered without complete clarity.",
    "It is a hard course, but very fair.",
    "The greatest strength of this course is its consistency. Professor Casson plugs through the material at a steady and comprehensible pace. I know exactly what he is trying to cover in each lecture, and I can solidify my understanding at home because all the material is in the textbook (which has not been the case in all math classes I've taken). Also, the tests are fair.",
    "Could be improved with more practice test problems and homework answer keys and test answer keys",
    "This course was very structured and on the whole, very organized. Professor Casson was highly accessible, and the peer tutoring hours helped to make up for any possible gaps in knowledge.",
    "strengths: TA sessions were very helpful Casson is a great teacher (imo) course starts slow and with basic ideas clear feedback on homework assignments good textbook three lectures a week allows us to cover a reasonable amount in each period weaknesses: full-length problem during exam weeks are unreasonable. many of us have extracurricular commitments and are taking 5 or more credit semesters. it takes me ten or more hours to complete a problem set, and it takes me at least twelve hours of studying\/practice to feel adequately prepared for an exam. i understand that Casson would like to cover a lot of material, but i have not taken a single class at Yale that has assigned full-length problem sets during the week of an exam. no answers are given to problem sets or exams after they are turned in. it would have been incredibly helpful for my preparation for exams to have correct answers available to problem sets. no practice midterms\/finals are given. it is incredibly difficult to figure out how to properly prepare for the first midterm. without knowing the format of the questions on the test, i spent way too much time studying irrelevant information and not enough time solidifying the fundamental ideas. i also had no idea how difficult it would be for me to complete four proofs in two hours.",
    "This class is relatively slow paced, which I think is one of its strengths. The p-sets were manageable and unlike many other math classes I could actually learn the material by doing the p-set, as opposed to drowning in excessively long proofs that don't illuminate the matieral (cf. MATH 350). Also, Casson is a very clear lecturer.",
    "I was actually enrolled in the graduate school so making office hours was difficult because they were all held in the undergraduate colleges, which graduate students have no access to.",
    "More class interaction required.",
    "Overall great course with no significant weaknesses. Lecture was great: great explanations, good blackboard notes (in the sense that you could study for the class from just those notes). Homeworks covered quite a bit of ground in a not-frustrating number of problems; they were often quite difficult to do alone, so working in a group or asking the professor\/peer tutor for hints really makes life easier.",
    "I would have loved some resources in addition to the textbook and office hours. Ideally there would be a recommended series of YouTube videos or alternative textbook or something."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "absolutely not",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in an introduction to proof based mathematics. It's challenging but very doable, and you really get a good understanding of basic fundamentals of calculus, and more generally, mathematics we often take for granted. This class is also easier than Math 250!",
    "very useful for graduate study",
    "I would say only take this course if you have to. It was useful but there are more interesting math classes at Yale.",
    "The course does a good job of tying together concepts from calculus and differential equations in a proof-based intro to analysis. Casson is a clear lecturer and conveys the material really well. 10\/10 would recommend",
    "Yes. The material is very interesting and Professor Casson is a very good teacher.",
    "I would take this class if it is necessary. If there are other topics that interest you more than analysis, I would focus on those since this course can be rather dry.",
    "It is a hard course, but very fair. If you're thinking about taking this it's probably required for your major, in which case all I can say is that Casson knows his stuff but the exams can be very difficult.",
    "I would recommend MATH 300 to any student who enjoys math and is interested in developing a deeper understanding of the many \"Why?\" questions that were skated over in earlier math courses. In this course, you begin from the axioms of the real numbers and proceed to prove a number of important results related to sequences, series, differential\/integral calculus, and analysis. The workload for this course was somewhat less than that for its pre-requisite, MATH 250, though overall, the two courses require similar skills.",
    "Math 300 is a great, well organized course! If you've already seen advanced mathematics, you'll probably find it goes a bit slowly, but if you haven't, it is the perfect introduction to proof based math. I'm a junior, but this is the course I needed freshman year, as I'd never heard of a proof coming into college. Don't worry about prereqs, the course is self contained, and there is even a section on proofing techniques in the textbook. Professor Casson is a solid lecturer. Again he goes slowly, which is boring at times, but as a result I understand each lecture fully, and didn't have to do very much reading outside of class.",
    "If you need to learn proofs, you'll need plenty of practice, and this course is certainly one way to get that practice.",
    "take it if you need it. there is a lot of material covered, the tests are difficult, and there is a full-length pset every week, even during midterm weeks. Casson is a good teacher (imo), and the material is pretty interesting. make sure you go to TA sections if you're struggling on the problem sets.",
    "If you're taking this course it's probably because you're required to for your major. Otherwise, I'd give this course a pass. You probably know most of the fundamental results from this class already from Calculus, and if you really want to practice writing proofs there are much more interesting courses in the Math department.",
    "Yes. I know that many math majors are pushed to take 301, but I would really recommend taking Casson's 300 as it is nice and slow-paced and you will learn the material well. Not every math class needs to be a deluge of work.",
    "This really would depend on the students goals. I think it is a good foundation for rigorous mathematical thinking but that depends on the students background and career goals.",
    "I would recommend the course as it was quite rigorous and will help build a good foundation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who has little exposure to or isn't confident about mathematical analysis. Also, I'd also say anyone who hasn't taken MATH 250 should not be afraid of considering this course, especially if one could not take MATH 250 in the fall, as I've taken both and can verify that while both courses use some of the same tools (really only near the beginning of each course), MATH 300 is self-sufficient and goes in a different direction than MATH 250. I'd also recommend that one make sure Casson, or a similarly good lecturer is teaching the course. I can imagine this course turning into a nightmare if taught badly, and basic analysis is not a good place to get traumatized.",
    "Yes, this was a good introduction to analysis. Proved every theorem we used, either for homework or in class, starting from the basic axioms of real numbers and working up to integration and metric spaces. Two midterms and a final. Problem sets would have been impossible without the FANTASTIC undergraduate peer tutor and the study group that always came to his office hours.",
    "Topics with Casson is a pretty standard analysis course, but I liked it a lot. The course occasionally felt slow and the proofs often overly concerned with minutiae, but given how easy it is for your intuition to mislead you in a subject like analysis. This is especially true if you've never seen the wacky counterexamples before. My favorites: a function continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere, a function defined everywhere but only continuous at a single point, and a function differentiable everywhere whose derivative has discontinuities (the last one messed me up on the final). The class isn't terribly difficult and psets are usually pretty doable, although talking to the peer tutor on some of the hard questions was pretty helpful. I don't think the material is particularly useful unless you plan on doing more advanced math in the future, but I do feel like I'm better at proving things now than when I started. Also s\/o to Andre the peer tutor; he was awesome."
