   "comments": [
    "It's a good chance to think about how policy actually works in practice. You don't get in the weeds of what policy is best, but it's a huge lesson in the importance of process in politics. DeStefano's war stories are a lot of fun, particularly if you have been involved in New Haven political scenes. If you care about the actual practice of politics or want to know more about New Haven, I'd recommend it. Don't expect rigorous policy work though.",
    "To learn about new haven and theories of local governance, sign up for this class. Destefano is a funny, engaging, and confident seminar leader, and is also super accessible outside of class. The workload is highly managwable, readings generally interesting (and not too taxing), and the class is fun. Take it if you're uninterested in local governance!",
    "I would recommend this class, you learn so much about New Haven, and the readings and discussions feel important and relevant to understanding this city and urban spaces across the country as well.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings for this class and thought the syllabus was very well-structured. Professor DeStefano is always willing to help students connect with first-person sources in New Haven, and as long as you put in the effort, he'll put you in touch with people you can learn a lot from. The workload isn't bad (especially because the readings are actually really interesting), and he gives you a lot of guidance on the papers if you meet with him. There's really no one better to learn from about New Haven than the person who ran the city for 20 years, and he has a lot of really interesting insights.",
    "This course ended up being a positive, but it may be an acquired taste. On the one hand, Professor DeStefano knows everything and everyone in New Haven, and theres really no better course at Yale to learn about our new home city. The tour of Grand Avenue one week instead of class may have been one the best classes in my time at Yale. On the other hand, seminar barely ever touched on the readings and would always devolve into a lecture from the mayor, which you either loved or hated. DeStefanos a fun professor, but beware that this class isnt very political-science-y. Also a surprising amount of writing.",
    "I imagine the general point being \"pick an issue that challenges the people of New Haven, imagine you're in City Hall and use national research to find your solution and implement it.\" You're given a guided history of urban planning and community action from the mid-20th century onwards, using that and thematic issue areas to understand the future of cities in the context of American society. I would absolutely recommend the course, even just to learn from DeStefano. He's a living legend in New Haven and has so much to teach about the culture of the communities that both surround and overlap with Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in city politics and New Haven.",
    "Professor DeStefano is an insightful and caring professor. He knows A LOT about New Haven (which makes sense of course), but he structures class such that his insight is present but that students also have considerable input. He is very approachable and will guide students through each paper. The material is fascinating and applies to both New Haven and to the US in general. I have since became much more involved in city life and can thank Professor DeStefano. Occasionally, the conversation runs a bit off topic and we dwell on little issues. Given a little more time, I think this class will be even better.",
    "A class that looks at the process of making public policy in cities, specifically New Haven. Very cool to learn from a practitioner- especially someone who had as much of an impact on New Haven that DeStefano had with his 20 year tenure as mayor."
