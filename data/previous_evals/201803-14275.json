    "Ancient Northwest Semitic history, culture, and language. Also collaboration in translation assignments.",
    "How to read, transcribe and translate Ugaritic cuneiform.",
    "Before this course I did not know what Ugaritic was, and now I can translate cuneiform (with the help of notes and vocab and such). I learned a whole language in a semester, and I'm excited to get better."

    "Vocab and Garmmar Quizzes would be nice.",
    "This was a really interesting course, and I think the setup was perfect. The smaller class size was I think integral for how this worked so well - I can't imagine it would have been so engaging with 20 or more students. I can't think of any ways it could be improved.",
    "I was very pleased with the course. There was a lot more information to absorb in the latter half of the semester compared to the first half, but I assume that is natural for any language.",
    "This course is a pretty intense language, and could be more useful to learn in smaller sections over more class sessions. Sometimes it was a lot of material to digest at once. Also, more equal homework assignments would spread out the workload and help build on skills in a more structured fashion. It was great to have a take home final though because this language is like solving a puzzle, and it aids learning rather than memorization to have more time with material and do it carefully and thoughtfully."

    "Yes. It is a very necessary course for students of the Hebrew Bible like myself, so I would recommend it to anyone in my concentration.",
    "Yes because the language is important to my discipline and Jimmy is a fantastic instructor.",
    "If you are pursuing study in Hebrew Bible, then yes.",
    "Yes! Ugaritic is a cool language. Jimmy is fantastic at what she does."
