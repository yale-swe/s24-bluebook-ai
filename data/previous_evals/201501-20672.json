    "Astro 610 is the class you take that suddenly illuminates 30% of the talks and all of the galaxy lunch discussions. Your education is incomplete if you do not take this class.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students, if he or she has enough background knowledge.",
    "A very useful course for anyone interested in galaxy research.",
    "Even though I don't plan currently on working in theory, I think this was an important class for anyone working in the area of galaxies to take if nothing else for a general overview of the subject and its theoretical underpinnings. I would however, recommend it most highly to those considering theory.",
    "This is an indispensable course for any student wanting to pursue research in galaxy formation\/evolution.",
    "Yes. But make sure you have taken cosmology and perhaps another galaxy class before.",
    "Summarize: Go through Frank's book. I will recommend it because working through the psets and reading all those papers and writing a term paper and presenting and oral exams were all very good exercise.",
    "This class is foundational for anyone who would like to work in any aspect of galaxies, dark matter, or even cosmology. I would absolutely recommend it to any graduate student with even a passing interest in these fields."

    "While I'm not sure if it will contribute to my planned thesis research directly, I think the general knowledge of galaxies covered in this course will definitely help.",
    "I would like to continue on this field, and this course has a good introduction to what I should be focusing on.",
    "This class has been extremely helpful in terms of understanding the broader context of my own research and engaging with colloquium speakers on any topics."
