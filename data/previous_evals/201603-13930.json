   "comments": [
    "Foundational knowledge in concepts of medical anthropology and global health policy as well as insight into different models of intervention to combat health disparities and inequity in a variety of settings",
    "You learn the difference between health equality and equity and why it matters! You learn how to think critically about framing issues regarding health equity and writing concisely about it.",
    "I really felt as if I learned both a lot of factual information and also how to think critically about complex issues. This class made me a better arguer and a better learner because I realized I too quickly generalize in my arguments and that the world is not nearly that simple.",
    "I learned to explore public and global health issues through the lens equity and inequity, effectively turning health into a social justice issue in a meaningful way.",
    "I came away from the course with a very clear and concise toolkit for understanding health disparity. This toolkit comes at the issue of health equity from the lens of politics, MDGs, moral experience, race, and frameworks of public health. I will always remember key phrases\/ research highlights as well as a few metaphors, and I think this is what CPB wanted us to take away. I also developed critical thinking skills to be able to critique even published works. This skills was developed through the critical analyses, which required us to synthesize and connect messages from multiple texts and still offer our own reflections.",
    "My writing skills and critical thinking skills improved immensely.",
    "This class was a wonderful exercise for discussing what we're talking about and what we mean exactly by the term health equity. I think I learned a lot about how to important it is to frame something, the power of conceptual figures, and also how to develop research highlights.",
    "This course encouraged thoughtful discussion of a wide range of public health issues. A good course to get to know class mates and get exposed to anthropology.",
    "I feel that I have a firm foundational understanding of different frameworks of approaching health equity.",
    "Health is complicated, and resolving health disparity is even more so. Research highlights were a very good exercise in punchy and meaningful writing.",
    "I developed frameworks for considering public health from an anthropological, sociological, and political perspective. I learned the importance difference between equity and equality in health and how to consider the unintended consequences of all interventions. I also learned how to consider health as a result of the existing web of socioeconomic, cultural, and political disparities."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Panter-Brick is an engaging discussion leader and challenges the class to think critically about issues regarding health equity. She created a class environment that was comfortable and conducive to learning!",
    "Literally all of it was a strength. Professor Panter-Brick was amazing, my fellow students pushed me into thinking in new ways, and there were even snacks every week! My only criticism is that the class could get a little unstructured at times and I wish we had more opportunity to engage in debate with our classmates.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because it centered justice at the heart of its discussions. It was self aware of critiques that global health is neoimperialist and often less effective than is commonly understood, which other health courses I've taken have not acknowledged. I was disappointed that we did not have a week dedicated to race or gender -- I would have expected both of these issues to be centered in an intentional way, getting at least a week, if not several, of coverage. Race and gender came up in passing in relation to other themes being discussed, but they must be better prioritized as issues in their own right moving forward.",
    "Strengths - CPB is an absolutely amazing professor, mentor and just human being. - The material covers a wide range of topics in health equity with a global perspective. - Every seminar felt new, refreshing and engaging. - The assignments were purposeful and targeted. - The reading guides given each week are very helpful for framing the readings. Weaknesses - Some students may not thrive in a relatively unstructured environment, but I definitely did.",
    "Great course!",
    "The strengths were that classes were very interesting and the readings were great. I think seminars could have been focused more on the readings, it sometimes felt as though we would start talking about nothing in particular and just making conjectures, but maybe centering the topic on the readings would have helped.",
    "This class was AMAZING, definitely one of the best I've taken at Yale. Change nothing!!",
    "This course is very interesting and is very useful in terms of attempting to engage with global health critically and take a perspective that focuses on \"people.\" However, the course could be improved if Professor Panter-Brick offered clearer instructions. Often times, there was confusion surrounding assignments or exercises that were too frequently left up to student interpretation. Many times, students would message each other in an attempt to clarify instructions or the purpose of an assignment.",
    "Class discussions were amazing. Would love to have had more time to hear about other students' final papers!",
    "There was no overarching arc of the course, because it was planned week by week. Each week felt like we were rehashing the same information over again. There weren't good or engaging conversations.",
    "Strengths: the variety of activities. Research highlights. Writing improved. Weaknesses: classroom discussions were not very valuable, the readings were often repetitive within a given week and too long. Also found the course to be repetitive near the end. Wished there were more variety and breadth of topics covered.",
    "The class really pushed me to consider public health from a different perspective and to improve my writing. I honestly don't know how it could improve much more."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student",
    "Yes! Definitely try to take this course -- the readings are engaging and seminar is engaging. If you want to better understand determinants of health equity -- this course is for you.",
    "Yes! Everyone should take this class (or another Anthro class). I felt like I really improved as a student in Professor Panter-Brick's class.",
    "If you can get in, I definitely recommend this course. CPB is delightful and brilliant, and the course provides a refreshing emphasis on equity and \"fairness,\" rather than just disease at a regional level. The class structure is manageable -- three (or more) reflections throughout the course of the semester, weekly readings (choose your own from a list CPB provides you each week), and a final paper. Push for greater inclusion of discussions of race, gender, and sexuality, which this course is perfectly set up to discuss at length but did not the semester I took it.",
    "Absolutely 1000% would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in public health, global health, medicine, determinants of health inequity, international development, anthropology, or policy. The professor, CPB, is one of the best mentors I have ever had. Above all, she is a fantastic human being, and this shows clearly in her approach to the class and to her students. The workload isn't too bad and in fact, the writing assignments really do help you develop critical thinking and synthesis skills! No doubt, if you can get into the course, I would take it without a question! I think only juniors and seniors have a chance of getting in though.",
    "Fantastic course!",
    "This class was AMAZING, definitely one of the best I've taken at Yale. Hardish to get into, but if you get a spot then TAKE IT seriously. Super informative and well-taught; will challenge your preconceptions and teach you tons about conceptualizing inequity (not inequality!) plus strategies to create lasting change.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Panter-Brick is a rockstar of a professor and is amazing at leading thoughtful discussions. She is extremely knowledgable about the field but listens to students with respect and never makes you feel like she knows more than you. The workload is manageable and Professor Panter-Brick allows you to be flexible with assignments. Take the class if you can!!",
    "Theoretically, I would recommend the course, because it addresses important arguments in global health, but I think the structure of the course undermines its potential to help students grow.",
    "Yes",
    "If you engage with the material you will learn a lot. Make sure to read the provided readings.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I did not learn much beyond the idea that health is complicated and health equity is hard to achieve. Class discussions are fairly repetitive since we talk about very similar topics each week. Panter-Brick and the people in the class all tend to be like-minded as well, which didn't make for very invigorating or bipartisan discussion. Each class ended up being more of a \"yes\" chorus. But if you have a controversial take on health and are up to the challenge of questioning your peers, by all means take this class. Also my class was 90% female.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in global health. It was an engaging course with readings and discussions that gave me a new perspective on how to think about public health. Professor Panter-Brick really cares about her students and challenged us all to do the best we could. This is by far one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale."
