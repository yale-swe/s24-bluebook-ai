   "comments": [
    "A strength of the course was the structure that worksheets provided. I always left class feeling like I learned something new.",
    "It was a very small class which both contributed and took away from it. There was a lot of professor attention, but then it was a morning class with very few students, so sometimes it was slow-moving if not everyone was awake. I think the class could be improved by having more readings that used the grammar, so we could get see more examples of sophisticated sentences."

    "Professor Lee-Smith is the reason why learning Korean is so easily facilitated and enjoyable. She creates a comfortable class environment and has incredibly strong relationships to her students through class and through home-cooking at language table every week."
