    "Class not as cohesive as it could have been. Too much focus on characterization methods. Equations introduced with explanation. Prof. Cha made a great effort and she is very kind and sweet but overall the course could have been more organized. Fair psets, somewhat knitty gritty exam, problem sets over midterm week were over the top. A good breadth exposure, but what you get out of the class is what you put in.",
    "Yes, it was a really good class, especially for engineering.",
    "weekly psets, final project, final paper, and midterm. overall not a bad workload, but also not as easy as previous semesters made it out to be. you end up learning a lot of material useful for research. the final project and paper are especially fun and insightful if you put in the effort. i would recommend this if you are a nano-oriented materials scientist or an experimental condensed matter physicist.",
    "A wonderful primer to the humongously varied world of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. We covered a lot of material, and focused on the big picture of synthesis and characterization and the overall methods for both. The final presentation and project let us really learn in depth about a specific area of interest. Because of the large amount of material, it was (especially for the midterm) a little confusing what we were supposed to memorize or just get the gist of. The class didn't do as well as Professor Cha had expected. Homeworks were generally fairly easy, just making simple applications of the equations and procedures talked about it lecture. Some homeworks had us find a journal article on a given subject and write a summary of it. This was great to really understand what the current state of research is.",
    "I would summarize this course as an interesting survey of relevant topics in the field of nanotechnology and would recommend it to anyone who has some experience in materials science and or quantum chemistry and is interested in application at the nano scale.",
    "MENG 403 is an introduction to nanomaterials and imaging techniques. While this class was not particularly inspiring, I think I enjoyed it more than I would have enjoyed other electives. Professor Cha is a decent lecturer and wants students to engage with the material. Grading is based on problem sets, a midterm, a presentation and a final paper. The problem sets were difficult and sometimes on material not covered in class; I spent more time on them than I would have just because I had to do extra research in order to solve the problems. The midterm was extremely difficult, but I think it will be more fair in the future. The final presentation and paper are fine, but I would recommend choosing a topic you are very interested in, or else the research process will be excruciating. I would only recommend this class if you are very interested in nanomaterials; it's a solid class, but without any interest in the material it would be very boring.",
    "This is an interesting course which will give you an introduction to nanomaterials and nanotechnology. In its current state the focus is much less on applications than expected and more on the classification and the theory than the actual applications. I would suggest this course if you are really interested in the subject matter and have some background in material sciences.",
    "This course was not quite what I expected. It was a lot more work than previous versions of the course have been and also the midterm was more about memorizing 500 slides than actually knowing the concepts of the class. That being said, the course offers a lot of freedom to study what you want and was very rewarding."
