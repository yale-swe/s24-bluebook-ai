   "comments": [
    "The course is a survey of modern biophysical techniques used to study biological macromolecules. It is team taught, which can be disadvantageous because you must adapt to multiple teaching styles. The material is difficult, but is taught in an accessible way overall.",
    "Ideally, the material in this class may be split into two semesters to ease the grade pressure, but the material presented is relevant, interesting, and delivered in an authoritative manner. I would recommend it to a fellow student.",
    "I wouldn't tell them not to take it, but I would tell them to expect to get angry every once in awhile.",
    "Be prepared to work extremely hard to fully understand the material and expect the exams to press your knowledge past the boundaries of the lectures. This course gave a good introduction to common methods used in biophysics labs.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student as it was a good survey class for understanding basic principles and techniques. However, I would alert the student that it was a lot of work and a rather difficult class.",
    "MB&B 720 is a good class for students to learn about biophysical methods that can be really helpful in the future for many of us in the biophysical sciences. It is a fairly involved course with challenging exams and problem sets, but I would recommend this course nonetheless because of the lecture content.",
    "A comprehensive course in biochemistry and biophysics that encompasses all structural methods. I would recommend it to any MB&B graduate student as it is very likely that this material will surface in future research.",
    "This course is extremely insightful in providing an in-depth overview of many important methods in molecular biophysics. The course is very high pace and requires previous background information in some of the topic to follow some of the lectures. I definitely recommend the course because you learn a lot of information just in a very little time.",
    "This class is a really good survey course for students interested in exploring what biophysics has to offer as a scientific discipline, but it's important to realize that as a survey course, it does cover a wide range of material. I would still recommend the course, but prospective students need to know that it will require a lot of work and will result in many frustrating moments inherently due to the structure of the course.",
    "I would summarize MB&B 720 01 for a fellow student as a course where you are exposed to a lot of different techniques and what they can do, but that is where the understanding really ends. This is because the finer details of the course are never clearly explained by the professors. I would not recommend MB&B 720 01 to another student because you put so much effort and work into the course only to get a basic understanding of different techniques and not an advanced level of understanding the material as you would expect.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student due to the rigors of the class material and preparation for future research.",
    "Definitely! Because it is a broad introduction, but give you a certain depth to understand aspects in biophysics and structural biology.",
    "This course is an informative survey of methods of protein structure determination. However, it goes extremely fast, to the point of compromising the ability of students to learn the material, while maintaining high - and possibly unreasonable - expectations of what students should learn. While this class was a helpful overview of a wide variety of experimental methods, I found it to be poorly structured and would have appreciated a slower pace.I also think that more attention should have been paid in this course to how to understand protein structures systematically. I think that this is an underappreciated portion of the protein structure field, where most structures are analyzed phenomenologically. Work by Rama Raganathan on protein sectors, for example, might have been of interest.",
    "It is a good thorough introduction to a lot of topics, presenting a detailed explanation of many different biophysical techniques and important topics in the structure and functions of biomolecules. It is pretty hard but well worth the effort to gain an understanding of a wide variety of topics, and I would certainly recommend the course.",
    "It's a great overview for different biophysical techniques. I would recommend it if it were a little better organized.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student only as long as that person has enough background to be able to follow everything effectively.",
    "It is a challenging course but covers a wide range of material that is necessary for students in biophysics to understand. I would recommend it if the student was entering a lab that required use of NMR, CD, cryo EM, etc.",
    "It's kind of like being in jail. You do your time, and life is happier once its over. While there, you bond with your other inmates and come out stronger.",
    "Very difficult to do well. *Must* work together with others to have the homework make sense, since homework questions were usually too vague and it's easy to have different interpretations of meaning. The material itself can be understood, but the problem is the quantity of material, and it's tested just once (unless it sometimes showed up on the homework). I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone, since I assume you'll get more out of an in-depth modular course; it doesn't seem like this class should be both introductory and rigorous.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow biophysics student. The class requires a tremendous amount of effort, but the information that you learn is essential to a career in biophysics."

   "comments": [
    "It helped a lot because I didn't have much knowledge on any of the techniques beforehand. I don't think that there was too much more depth that I could have taken from this class.",
    "Well, its obviously very related to the things I want to do in lab.",
    "It gave me a broad overview of structural biology techniques that will be relevant to my thesis work.",
    "Although I did not enjoy the class per se, I learned a ton about extremely important techniques for research. I feel like I would have a good basis of understanding to go off of, should I eventually need to use those methods in the laboratory.",
    "As I have no yet joined a lab, I cannot exactly say how this class was helpful. However, coming into the class techniques like X-ray crystallography and cryo-em were thing I had only heard of. It was good to better understand these techniques, even if I do not use them myself, for understanding other research.",
    "I learned much about NMR, especially multidimensional NMR, along with nucleic acids. These were topics that I was least familiar with before taking the course, and now I feel more comfortable with them and should help me in the future.",
    "I will be able to answer this a number of years later, but it was a great introduction to research in the field.",
    "I learned a lot about methods in molecular biophysics that I have never been exposed to, and has helped me converse with people about the subject with more ease as well as to turn to some of these methods when I think about my rotation projects.",
    "It allowed for a survey of many different techniques I could need, which was somewhat helpful.",
    "This course gave me a good overview of some of the most important methods and concepts in biophysics and served as a useful stepping stone to other courses dealing with more advanced treatments of some of the concepts we covered. This sort of exposure was essential for helping me move forward in determining potential research interests.",
    "This course was essential to my understanding of biophysical techniques, and has interested me in areas research that I did not previously consider. I did not have the opportunity to take biophysics courses at my undergraduate institution, so as a survey class this was very useful.",
    "This course expanded my knowledge of my discipline. I mean that I have a broader sense of the different techniques that are available and what they can do, not a deep understanding of the different techniques and how they exactly work. This course only contributed to what techniques I can use to answer a particular question along with their advantages and disadvantages.",
    "An understanding of the material covered in the course is essential for completing dissertation research.",
    "A perfect introduction!",
    "It exposed me to an understanding of many biophysical and structural methods. I feel like I have the knowledge now to approach these techniques in research or reading literature, though I don't necessarily have a practical understanding to actually use the techniques.",
    "It gave me further insight into the biophysical techniques available to me that will help me with my research.",
    "This course gives you good exposure to different techniques and methods that can be useful when trying to approach a question from an structural and molecular point of view. Personally, It also expanded the way I conceive biological problems, allowing me to look at things with an additional more detailed dimension",
    "I learned a lot in this course, but thought it was very difficult. I think it will turn out to be one of the most important classes I took when I get more into my research.",
    "This course highlighted the things that were important for me to learn on my own. Its usefulness for quals was stated many times."
