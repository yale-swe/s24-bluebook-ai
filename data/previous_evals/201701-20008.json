   "comments": [
    "Katie is an amazing Practicum Instructor! She offered invaluable insights which allowed me to flourish at my internship site. She also encouraged me to reflect on my internship experience, so that and to pay special attention to how I'm being formed in ministry. I am blessed to know her.",
    "Kyle is wonderful! Excellent practicum instructor.",
    "Shepard was fabulous. He struck a perfect balance between leading our practicum in the discussions designed for us and also allowing the discussion to go where it needed to go depending upon the week. It was clear he cared about his students and their experiences in supervised ministry, and he was able to give personal, helpful, and wise advice and feedback. I greatly appreciate working with Shepard this year.",
    "Kyle is very supportive of class discussion. We had an unusual practicum section with one member who dominated, both in the classroom and in, for some of us, numerous other classes, sections, and other group experiences. Kyle supported the need for the group itself to give feedback to this group member, which I understand is correct procedurally and support in principle. However, I was uncomfortable providing that kind of feedback to a greater extent than the small comments I made, which were rebuffed and unsuccessful.",
    "Bill was a great practicum leader. He brings wisdom from his own experience, as well as a passion for God, openness, and an affirming spirit. He helped open up space for us to talk, share, and get to know each other. Our environment was very supportive, and I appreciated my group immensely.",
    "always welcoming, warm, funny, compassionate, and understanding. will miss our time together the most this semester.",
    "Daphne was a wonderful, enthusiastic, and sensitive leader. I felt our group was a bit weird due to wide differences in what people wanted to get out of Practicum.",
    "see comments above.",
    "His facilitation of the spiritual moment in the beginning of class. As well as facilitating conversation.",
    "I loved our practicum session. We talked about all sorts of practical ministry issues, and also had a good time. I learned a lot.",
    "Alison was a terrific practicum instructor. She used the time well and gave us the space we needed to reflect on our individual situations.",
    "Caring, and she allowed us to develop as a group.",
    "Great facilitator of conversation, really supportive, and fun to be in class with. He was awesome.",
    "Alison is so understanding, comforting, insightful and made our experience being with each other and in our sites just so much more than having an extra responsibility. She always listened, and always cared for us in moments when we needed some extra generosity (i.e. during finals) and also provided us with great insight to our work on a variety of spiritual and professional levels.",
    "Daphne was a very engaged and engaging \"center\" for a practicum group that formed a particularly strong bond. She modeled \"servant leadership\" and was available and inspiring with stories about her own learnings in the craft of ministry.",
    "Alison did well to keep the practicum space a safe, comfortable space for us to just talk about ministry and its highs and lows.",
    "I believe that Prof. Donyelle was a very warm, supportive, and constructively critical instructor, and I appreciated her thoughtful feedback on my assignments - she is very attentive to detail, and she brings up many important points in a caring and professional matter. That said, the \"preaching to the choir\" thing irked me, and the choice of Nouwen Chapel as a preaching venue was utterly unrealistic for practicing our vocal techniques. The number one complaint that I hear from parishioners again and again is \"we can't hear what the preacher is saying,\" and, having been taught to \"preach to the back row\" in projecting my voice, the number one compliment that I hope to get is, \"I can hear you!\" Good diction and projection should not be construed at a political statement.",
    "Katie was an excellent practicum supervisor. She deeply cares about her students and constantly strives to support our growth as ministers and people. She has an impressive ability to balance fun, light-hearted topics with serious conversations. It was incredibly valuable to hear Katie's insightful reflections regarding her experience confronting challenging or awkward situations in ministry, as they emerged in discussion of our own experiences. Overall, my experience was greatly enriched with Katie as our practicum leader!",
    "Bill consistently enabled us to be engaged in class discussions where we could share diverse experiences from different walks of ministry. Also, Bill was kind enough to understand our situations, and he was always accessible to us!",
    "Strong advocate for students in the group. Helpful in facilitating discussion. Effective in encouraging conversation and sharing of knowledge between students.",
    "Bill was a wonderful practicum leader. I especially appreciated how organically, warmly, and lovingly he led our group, giving us the space and time that we needed to work through whatever it was. He challenged us to engage in and apply each devotional offered by a group member. He was a model of openness, care, and responsibility. He took every opportunity to point out learning moments, tools for ministry, and aspects of our pastoral identities. He helped us to identify God at work in our lives. I am so grateful for Bill's leadership and care.",
    "Strengths: Shepherd invested in letting the group \"form\" before asking us to do too much as group. This allowed for trust and relationship to develop naturally and this approach helped us to develop a meaningful relationship in the long-run. While practicum was a challenge for me due to its timing, I benefited from the group. I can also see the parallel with how having a clergy professional group will be helpful in my future ministry. Weaknesses: Sometimes Shepherd was not as clear as needed when giving directions. This made for lots of Q+A to clarify expectations. Overall, practicum was a positive experience within a very busy year and I appreciate all that Shepherd did to make that time meaningful for us.",
    "Shepherd was caring and thoughtful in leading our practicum. He helped to create a sense of fellowship and community. He was generous with advice from his own life and experiences. I think that, perhaps, Shepherd could have been more clear about a couple of the assignments, such as the case study. But this is a small area of growth amid a very strong practicum instructor whose genuine enthusiasm was contagious.",
    "I appreciated Shep's interest in the activities of each of our internship sites. The recounting of what had occurred in the week before was helpful because it brought out many issues that we might otherwise have not discussed. I also appreciated the case study discussions this semester, and I think I would have appreciated them in both semesters rather than some of the other activities assigned for the fall semester. I think that the case studies encouraged us to more directly reflect on our respective ministries as well as broader issues surrounding our actions. I also appreciated Shep's sometimes provocative questions also helped me to think about some of the broader issues going on in our world.",
    "Kind engaged compassionate and aware of our situation as students full of practical spiritual wisdom supportive relaxed empowering",
    "Tracy was great. This is not mere flattery. I think the parameters given for practicum can allow within their boundaries a great deal of flexibility, depending on the needs and personalities of the group. Our practicum provided space for quiet reflection when that was needed, unguarded speech when that was needed, and the kind of honest and open exchange that I think is always needed. This environment was maintained throughout, as we worked through the various demands of the syllabus, and that was absolutely vital."
