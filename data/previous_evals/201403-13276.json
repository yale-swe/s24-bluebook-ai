    "Highly recommend! A great continuation of Yale's amazing Japanese program.",
    "Really great course. Much more relaxed than L1 and L2, and I preferred the environment. Seto-sensei and maruyama-sensei are really friendly and fun to talk to. The new texbook was better than JSL, but you don't start using it until the end of the course. Lots more kanji to learn.",
    "I would recommend it. Like all the Japanese classes, the teachers are great. The workload is high, but it is to be expected when you must master so much content.",
    "An important note: I took JAPN 110 as a freshman, and JAPN 130 as a sophomore. Although JAPN 130 is a little more stiff than JAPN 110, it was still one of my favorite classes this semester. The class asks that you learn a lot of material very quickly, but the exams are much easier, though they weigh more for your final grade. The class features many interesting facts about Japanese culture to keep you entertained, like watching Japanese idols or silly advertisements. Moreover, the teachers are very likable and tend to look out for you. Also, following JAPN 130, I feel that I'm at the point that I can say I understand Japanese pretty well. Considering that it's only an L3 class, that's quite an improvement. It's not the easiest ride to get there, but it was worth it!"
