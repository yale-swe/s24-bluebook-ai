    "One of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and Henk is one of the best professors I have had at Yale. He is supportive yet really pushes students to go beyond their comfort zone and do their best work. His comments are critical but always constructive, and I feel that I have grown a lot as a designer thanks to his teaching. This class definitely is a lot of work, but you will be so rewarded by the body of work you have at the end of it.",
    "I would not recommend this course because I feel like it does not teach enough about graphic design and has too few assignments (with too many large assignments) to help the students improve over the semester. I would recommend a student who is interested in introductory graphic design take a course that focuses more on teaching practical adobe program skills, as they help immensely with design in general, as you are able to work out ideas quickly.",
    "An excellent introduction to graphic design. I would say, however, that teaching modern graphic design software (such as Adobe Illustrator) would be invaluable to students. I know from personal experience applying to Google, Uber, etc. for Product Design positions that Illustrator is a skill they look for, as well as a developed portfolio. If we taught these skills in class, it would be a major help for a certain portion of the student body without a doubt.",
    "would recommend for someone who is wiling to do the work",
    "Yes! Take it! Be prepared to work but it's definitely worth it."
