    "Necessary introductory course.Of course, it's a good way to know better about the department.",
    "PLSC 510 can be as enjoyable or as dreary as one wishes to be. While this is to a point true of all courses, there really is no burden on the student apart from what s\/he places on himself or herself. It's a wonderful opportunity to learn about the great work being done by the faculty--an opportunity that shouldn't be missed!Since the course is mandatory for all first-year graduate students, the second part of the question doesn't apply."

    "Introduced me to areas of political science I wouldn't have considered relevant to my research, exposing me to ideas that will make it much richer.Discussions with the junior faculty added a glimpse at the realities of preparing for the job market -- reason alone to make it a first semester requirement.Discussions with the senior faculty were great opportunities to hear what leaders in the field think political science is and what it should be.",
    "It is not a challenging course, but it might help first year students to get to know the department.",
    "This class allowed me to hear from a good number of professors I might not have spoken with so early in my academic career. The class was a nice start to the week and a chance to get to know my cohort. Additionally, my final paper will hopefully serve as a basis for the introduction to my dissertation.",
    "We received a lot of great advice from many sources, including anecdotes about dissertation research and writing. I think these shall definitely help in times to come. As for preparatory materials about research, there were plenty of ideas that we could act on."
