    "Challenging.",
    "An amazing course overall. While it starts off fairly math-intensive, by the end you really gain an appreciation for quantum mechanics and the mathematical concepts from the beginning manifest themselves as orbitals and other recognizable chemical entities. As far as actual material, you start out broadly by reviewing the 'breakdown' of classical mechanics- ie the discoveries that lead to the rejection of classical mechanics (ultraviolet catastrophe, crystalline heat capacities, the photoelectric effect etc.) before learning about wave mechanics and operators. Most of the rest of the semester is spent solving the Schrodinger Equation (the F=ma of quantum mechanics) for increasingly complex systems- free particle, particle-in-a-box, particle-in-a-cube, particle-on-a-ring, and particle-on-a-sphere. The results of these equations are then applied to hydrogenic atoms and multi-electron systems. Harmonic oscillators, LCAO-MO, Variational Theorem, and Perturbation Theory and also examined.",
    "YES. Not gonna lie, this course is a lot of work, and I would definitely recommend getting a group of friends to check psets with. Still, Professor Vaccaro is an AMAZING professor. If you're struggling, don't hesitate to email him or ask him questions--I've been guilty of emailing him at midnight before the problem set was due. I am by far no where near a math\/physics person, but most of the course made sense simply because Professor Vaccaro is so good at teaching. The material really explains concepts first covered in gen chem (where do orbitals come from?) and can be quite fascinating. Basically, the course is hard but the professor makes it worth it.",
    "This is the hardest science class I've ever taken, but I did enjoy it, and it was incredibly interesting. I have much better understanding of how the world works now.",
    "Whoa buddy it's p-chem 2 time, eh? You're in for an adventure. Be prepared for the longest p-sets since diffEQ. Professor Vaccaro is excellent--definitely get in his class if he teaches it again. There's a love\/hate complex with this class: it's a lot of work (much more than p-chem 1), but a lot of it is fascinating (like learning what the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle really means).Oh, did I mention the midterms? No? Whoops...THEY ARE LITERALLY FOUR HOURS (unlimited time, starting at 7 pm...one guy stayed til 1:30 am)",
    "Great! You learn so much. I found the material really interesting, and Vaccaro is an amazing teacher. If you are chemistry- and math-minded, you will love it. Lectures are clear, you learn cool stuff, problem sets and exams are long and challenging but mostly doable. Take it!",
    "If it's Professor Vaccaro, DROP EVERYTHING AND TAKE IT. Yes, it's at 9:25 on Science Hill. That's okay. You'll make it up there to get your mind blown about how crazy quantum physics really is. Professor Vaccaro's psets and exams are beautifully put together and do a really great job of tying up everything you know. (One possible exception is the final which was just incredibly difficult.) Psets took about 10 to 15 hours, which is reasonable. Also, it is kind of math-y, so you should have multivariable calc down for sure, and LinAl and DiffEq would also come in handy.",
    "This is a very well taught class. If you are taking it for Chemical Engineering, you probably won't be as interested in the material as the Chemistry majors are because it isn't really that closely tied to engineering. However, you will come to really appreciate Vaccaro's organization and the amount of effort he puts into the class, and will find that it motivates you to put in more work than your other classes and actually to learn a lot.",
    "What does physical reality fundamentally consist of? Where do the orbitals of chemistry come from? Answering these questions in Physical Chemistry II requires persistence and all the math you've ever learned but is ultimately worthwhile. The study of quantum mechanics in Physical Chemistry II is essential for tracing the sequence of causes from fundamental truths to everyday natural phenomena. The math was so dense that I only achieved glimmers of understanding, but these glimmers were profound. I should have liked to study quantum mechanics for a year longer, though I suspect that even then, my understanding would be unsatisfactory. Professor Vaccaro is organized and fair, if dry. The world is stranger than we realize.",
    "Wonderful class! Yes, it's a lot of work, but you will learn a lot. Vaccaro is an exceptional professor.",
    "The second semester of PhysicalChemistry is such a wonderful course! It is perhaps the second greatest lecture course that I have taken at Yale, and it is certainly one of the great undergraduate science courses of our institution. Second semester is very different from first semester, which focuses more on the bulk properties of matter, and this year it was so, so much better. You learn the experimental and theoretical basis of quantum mechanics, at an accessible level. You go through all the basic derivations up to the hydrogen atom. Then you learn about the effects of electron spin and various approximation techniques to deal with multi-body systems such as diatomic and polyatomic molecules. It is satisfying to know that we can calculate the first ionization energy of atomic hydrogen pretty much on the basis that all matter has wave properties. Who would have known that you can actually calculate the energy, even approximately, of the molecules that make up our world and give us life? I am an MB&B major using this course as a substitute for biophysics, and I am immensely grateful that I did so. I learned so much!",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale",
    "This is the best science class (and, probably, best class of any subject) I have ever taken at Yale, and Vaccaro is the best teacher I have ever had. Vaccaro's lectures, handouts, and homework assignments were all unfailingly enlightening and worthwhile. He somehow makes quantum mechanics not only fairly straightforward but also fun to learn! And I'm not being facetious; this is one of the only classes in my Yale career where I never fell asleep during class and never missed a class (even though it's MWF 9:25-10:15AM), even though I am extremely prone to doing so. And it was because the subject was so interesting and so well-taught. Every second is worth your attention.Since I don't plan on being a mathematician or a physicist, I really like the way this class covered quantum mechanics. Rather than getting bogged down in proofs and extremely complicated examples, we were often given the derivations, or sometimes just shown the equations (who wants to derive the solution to the Hermite equation, anyway?), but we always covered them enough to get a good grasp of how they worked. This allowed us to cover material very quickly, so that by the end of the semester we had graduated from single electron atoms and were covering molecular orbitals.Anyway, take this class. Even if you're not Chemistry, ChemE, or MBB. If you have a solid background in math and chemistry this class will be more than worth your time (especially if it's with Vaccaro).",
    "This is a great course--both subject-wise and in terms of the teaching. It is difficult and a lot of work but very rewarding for anyone with an interest in chemistry. I would recommend this course to those with a serious interest in chemistry as well as those that could be able to do the work required without needing extra help, for instance math and physics majors.",
    "Very hard but worth it. I would recommend taking it. It is a rite of passage.",
    "Professor Vaccaro is so great. His handouts are worth organizing to study, there will be a ton of them. Problem sets are LONG. If Gennady is your TA, he's so great - go to him for help all the time. The quantum mechanics material itself is interesting - very mathy, but was definitely my favorite class.",
    "If you like the theoretical basis of chemistry, take this class. It's very interesting and very well taught. The final exam is very long though.",
    "Take it even if you don't have to. A great way to fully understand what you learned in gen chem. Gives you a deep appreciation of chemistry.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction to quantum mechanics and how it applies to spectroscopy and atomic and molecular structure. This class was also extremely difficult for me. If you have a strong math background, and are interested in the subject material, I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Vaccaro has the most amazingly organized notes I have ever seen, and the material is very interesting. If you are unsure about the class, and it is not required for your major, this may not be the class for you. Be prepared to spend A LOT of time trying to understand concepts that make no intuitive sense.",
    "Chemistry 333 is quantum mechanics. That being said, you know it will be difficult. Even though it is difficult it is the best taught course I've had at Yale with professor Vaccaro. He's extremely clear, very approachable and knows what he is talking about. The work is difficult but you come out of this class with a strong foundation in quantum mechanics. This was a fantastic course.",
    "Difficult class with good amount of time commitment. Depends on the instructor how the class is structured. Highly recommend taking with Vacarro.",
    "This course is AMAZING! One of the most challenging courses I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken intellectually, but also one of the best. Prof. Vaccaro is amazing, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t imagine having taken this course without him, since the material is so challenging. The problem sets are appropriate for the material and really help you learn, lecture is so helpful and interesting, the exams are certainly challenging but fair, and there is a good balance of mathematical basis, historical context, and conceptualization.Prof. Vaccaro is absolutely phenomenal. One of the best if not the best professor I have had at Yale. His lectures are incredibly clear and really interesting, he is brilliant but explains things very logically and clearly, he is always approachable, he puts so much work into the course and makes himself available and is really responsive, he provides original resources that seem to me to be better than anything else on quantum mechanics available.Read his lecture notes that are on reserve in the library. They are so useful. Also don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t skip lecture, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s so helpful. Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hesitate to email him for anything, he responded really thoroughly to questions even at 11 pm the day before the problem set was due. If you have Gennady as a TA, go to him for help or just to talk about quantum mechanics. I got into a few really interesting discussions with him on QM. This is really such a cool, special and important subject. This course is mind-boggling. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll leave with a completely different take on the world, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also so challenging, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the nature of the material. Also make sure you go over your problem sets with other people. Take the time to think through problems on your own first because you learn a lot from the psets, but there are a lot of tricky things that are good for group discussion."
