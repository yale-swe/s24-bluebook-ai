    "This class was an interesting introduction to a very specific arena for sustainability at the municipal level. With the growing importance of cities as a unit for action, it was a timely exploration into their potential.",
    "General comment: This class was co-taught with a professor from UBC (Murali) who was very kind and helpful, but sometimes the directions for projects or assignments were not always clear. Also, feedback was limited and slow to come back after assignments were submitted. Question 14- Individual aspects of this course were great, but when pulling it all together, things became hard to follow. Getting our group assignments so late was challenging and the direction we were given was somewhat limited. I also think that knowing when you were going to be assigned which project (i.e. a paper or in class presentation) ahead of time would be very helpful. That assignment seemed to be made the week before something was due. I would suggest all due dates be stated clearly on the syllabus at the beginning of the semester so students can more easily plan. Also, if members from the groups from other schools are going to travel to places with limited email access, that should be stated at the beginning of the semester so the final project (when you need to meet with your group the most) isn't a scramble to get finished.",
    "Brad and Murali were an excellent team. Brad had a way of provoking thought and giving feedback that was very helpful for learning and expanding the dialogue of the class."

   "comments": [
    "I appreciated the opportunity to discuss and work on real-life problems.",
    "Students were able to work with real world problems and apply the tools from class to the final project, which involved working directly with a CRO in a city involved in the 100RC Program. This is very rare for a class and provides very useful experiences. Students must be self driven to engage and follow along, but there is great potential for those who do. You also are exposed to a variety of cities and urban planning challenges.",
    "Learning about real case studies and interacting with CROs working on these challenges.",
    "Working with real cases and getting to know their strategies and governance structures.",
    "It was great getting to network\/interact with students from around the world and having speakers call in to discuss their work.",
    "The direct interaction with 100RC was extremely helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed the case studies, the final projects, and the opportunities for discussion. I loved the format of group projects because 1) the case studies were real 2) we got immediate feedback from professors and CROs 3) we got to learn from our group-mates 4) we got to see the thought processes of other groups which were often different from our own group's approach. I appreciated that the CROs were so accessible and willing to share their real challenges and successes, and that they appreciated the work that we did too!",

   "comments": [
    "The class was pretty slow in the beginning- there were too many sessions on the resiliency framework and the 100 RC. I think we could have launched in faster into the dimensions. That being said, I'm not sure that the dimensions are the best way to structure the course. They seemed a little nebulous, and could be made more concrete by being paired with a CRO case that is dealing with that issue. The asset management topic\/lecture\/homework was very confusing and difficult to understand- I don't feel like anyone every really explained what it is. I also struggled with how we as outsiders to a city can realistically offer ideas or solutions around asset management.",
    "The final project was a little vague. It was up to the CRO to provide instruction or feedback, which was a bit unclear at times. Required students to problem solve, which is useful.",
    "Would be great to break out into smaller groups to tackle a more specific question or do an exercise - keeps students more engaged as its easy to become distracted during online classes. Would be great to get more structured interaction with the CRO to learn more about their challenges and capacity, helping shape our recommendations.",
    "Students from different schools had different levels of buy-in to the course. Some students were not present at all for group projects. This provided an interesting management challenge, but it was one that was also frustrating for groups that only had one active participant.",
    "I would have liked to mix up the teams a bit. I felt like I carried most of my team and would have appreciated the opportunity to work in different groups on different projects.",
    "Communication and at times organization. In addition, it was extremely difficult to work with groups in different time zones and try to present and write in English which some of the group members were clearly not comfortable doing.",
    "How do we engage more of the class for additional dialogue? There were people who contributed more than average and some who contributed less than average. How do we encourage those who stayed in the shadows to give their insight in an online format? How do we hear more from students in general in this format? Secondly, how do we make the group work more fair? There were some members of the group who dropped out or didn't do very much work at all. Yes, this is typical to group work, and to group projects in life, however, I think it is easier for people to disappear when the class is an on-line and international format than it is in person, given challenges such as time difference, commitment level differences, and tech challenges.",
    "Instructors should require cameras to be on. I think there would be a much higher level of engagement from students if they were less able to multitask during class time."

    "Some of our team freeloaded on the others, probably because of varying levels of motivation? It was also difficult to work with team members from China because of their inability to access document sharing platforms like Google Drive or Box. We spent additional time doing version control and struggling to work \"live\" on a document. There needs to be an element of grading your teammates to make sure that all people are working more-or-less equally on the assignments and group project.",
    "I worked with students from other countries. This can be hard to coordinate and sometimes track students down who aren't as quick to respond to emails. Verbal communication was also challenging at times, but that is all part of the process I guess.",
    "Practice in leading and managing the group process and communicating with other group members, especially when the time difference is so vast. Practicing active listening skills.",
    "Again, the differing levels of commitment to the course. It is tough to work with someone who is not interested in participating, especially when they are half the world over.",
    "The varying caliber of student work from other universities made it difficult to truly collaborate.",
    "The group work was really difficult due to everyone being in different places and speaking different languages. It became very frustrating and certain team members had to pick up the \"slack\" in order to complete assignments in a timely and appropriate manner.",
    "Advantages- I thought my group was very passionate and engaged in the subject material. We were willing to discuss our thoughts and ideas and put those into various presentations. Disadvantages- Scheduling was a challenge. Coming to meetings with the same level of preparation was a challenge - some group mates had read the material and knew the expectations or had done their component of the research, while others showed up and had to catch up on the fly. Other group mates dropped out during the class or disappeared off the radar at key moments (when there was a deliverable due!) This was frustrating. Also, a group dynamic arose where one person was steering the ship unilaterally and everyone else was just riding along. For another presentation, two people designed the whole project and heavily edited everything anyone else did. How do we prepare for and navigate these inevitable group challenges and power dynamics given the format of this class? The introduction was helpful. Perhaps there could be a group assignment on this so that a group MOU or agreement is in place from the get go. Having designated check ins along the way (a formal way of doing this) could be useful as well.",

Overall, there is a lot to be learned and one benefits from exposure to the course content. You won't find many other classes at Yale that facilitate real world application of concepts learned in class.",
    "Pretty broad framework for urban resilience - learn about examples that apply to this framework early on instead of trying to figure out what it means and how the 100 RC uses it. Can be useful if you're thinking about going into climate change resilience, climate change adaptation, sustainability at the urban scale, or a variety of other kinds of work.",
    "You will get out of it what you give to it. Group work will most likely be frustrating (many other classmates had similar or worse issues as our group did). However, the challenges posed in the course are useful to explore and learn from. Take advantage of working with the professors. They are accessible and provide a wealth of knowledge.",
    "This course is best if you supplement it with in-person learning activities which allow you to apply the classwork principles to real situations.",
    "I would suggest students look ahead at the schedule for the class- I had no idea that this class didn't follow the FES calendar until we were a few weeks in. That was a big disadvantage and something I wish I knew ahead of time. I also think that group work was over emphasized in this class and brought about more challenges than lessons. If you are someone with a hectic schedule, this class probably isn't for you.",
    "Take advantage of the resources given, from the readings to the CROs. Make sure all group mates feel engaged and valued for what they uniquely bring to the group. Check in with your group about how things are going- make sure this time is allotted for."
