    "Necessary to continue from 120 and 130 if you'd like to retain speaking ease and steady vocab progress.",
    "CHNS 140 really focuses on improving students' speaking proficiency (fluency and accuracy), as well as technical and cultural knowledge, and I think that this is an immensely important part of the language development of any student wishing to push themselves in their study of the Chinese language.",
    "I would definitely recommend that students continue Chinese after taking L1\/L2.",
    "I recommend this course if you're looking to improve your Chinese. The teachers put a lot of effort in making this course solidly structured and very effective.",
    "If you want to continue learning Chinese, definitely keep taking it. Even though it is tedious at times, this is the only way to learn the language (and the characters especially) without going to China to learn. However, be prepared --> you will feel just exhausted and burned out near the end of the class, because of the repetitious routine, but just know that it's all for the best down the road."
