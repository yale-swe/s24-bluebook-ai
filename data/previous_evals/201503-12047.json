    "Take it. Try to get Mme Koizim's section",
    "One of my favorite courses. Genuinely enjoyed all the readings and films, complemented the grammar work nicely. More important than lists of rules or vocab learned, I think this was the first course where I could really feel myself getting more comfortable with the language, where it started to feel so much more natural. And honestly, the whole thing was so much fun. I have a feeling that your professor makes or breaks this course, but I think I lucked out. Ruth is incredible, as a teacher and a human.",
    "Great class, you learn lots of French. Take it with Mme Koizim if possible!",
    "Take it with Koizim if you can!",
    "It is a good course for those that want a comprehensive understanding of the language, and I would definitely recommend it to those interested in becoming more fluent in French.",
    "Professor Koizim is a goddess. She made me fall in love with French and reaffirmed my passion for language studies. She is the most dedicated teacher I have met in my life and goes out of her way to see her students make progress and succeed. I recommend it 100%!!",
    "I would summarize French 130 as a course that improves one's ability to speak, read, and write in french. We read texts that are the foundation for in class discussions that move into learning french vocabulary and grammar. I would recommend this course to any student who would like to see their french improve from basic, conversational french to something more sophisticated. If you can take French 130 with Madame Kozim, I would highly recommend it.",
    "It was a class that covered upper level french grammar.",
    "There is a lot of conjugating in this course! The books we read increase exponentially in complexity but are not difficult to follow if you use the audio programs appropriately.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 130. You will read several French novels, like Petit Nicolas and l'tranger, all of which are challenging, but certainly accessible. You will have five test, the lowest of which you can drop. The homework is nowhere near as much as Fren110 or Fren120, but is still a sizable amount every night. It is a different kind of work though, different from most other classes. While there is still grammar activity, I believe that it was all helpful, though it can feel tedious at times. A fun class from which you will gain an immense amount of confidence in French skills."
