    "Definitely recommend it! take it take it take it!",
    "FILM321 is a very good \"cultural literacy\" class which makes students more critical viewers of films. I was particularly impressed by the way in which the different components of the class (lectures, screenings, readings, assignments) come together seamlessly. At times, the readings could be excessive, and perhaps repetitive, but I appreciate that this was part of a \"spiral\" strategy to progressively familiarize students with the material.",
    "Absolutely! This class is super interesting and will change the way you approach films and digital media in general. Plus lectures and class are fun! You get to watch blockbusters in screenings!",
    "Great fifth credit. You literally watch movies and talk about them. Just take it already!",
    "Take this class for the love of movies. I think it would have been an amazing class to take Credit\/D.",
    "I highly recommend this class to other students. It's engaging and a lot of fun. There is a moderate amount of work and everything is manageable.",
    "A solid film class. Not life-changing, but low-workload and fun. Definitely go to the screenings. Seeing the films on a big screen with lots of people is very worthwhile.",
    "sure take it",
    "I 100% recommend this class. It is fun, interesting, and not too much work.",
    "You get to watch movies you'd probably watch on your own time, and then get to know behind-the-scenes stuff about them and get an analytical breakdown from Professor Gregg.",
    "YES 100% take it!",
    "Yes, it was a fun class, but take it senior year!",
    "take it! you'll learn a lot about recent hollywood blockbusters. the movie list is really great and pretty diverse. Prof gregg works hard to make the class relevant and interesting. the workload isn't too bad - 2 5-7 page papers, in class midterm, and final. Also a great Cred\/D option!",
    "Very interesting class and very enjoyable to attend",
    "Easy course with little work and interesting course material. Make sure to actually watch the movies, they are why you are taking the course and are what make it interesting.",
    "Easy gut class to take for fun and easy to pass.",
    "10\/10 would recommend.",
    "I would say that it is a course that surveys films in the context of Hollywood as a brand and the formula of blockbusters. I would recommend it to another student because the lectures are interesting and all of the movies were really fun or interesting to watch and talk about. The exams were fair and with a good TA you can really get a lot out of the class.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "The course was great. It was very accessible to non-film majors while still teaching a lot of information. I watched a lot of movies I would have never watched on my own and genuinely appreciated them. Great class for senior spring :)",
    "Definitely try to get into this class during your time at Yale!",
    "Interesting and fun. Entertaining readings and screenings. Gregg gives lectures that are mostly interesting, although he doesn't particularly try to engage with the students during lecture. Lecture can sometimes be a bit stiff. Andrey Tolstoy as a TA is engaging and smart. He pushes students to consider creative and unconventional aspects of the screenings. He is also open to discussing ideas for individual papers. Great TA overall.",
    "Take it!",
    "This course explains and breaks down the current cinematic and business trends of Hollywood blockbuster films in the 21st century. Definitely take this course if you want to have a fun class in your schedule (especially if you have never taken a film class before). Not too much work; definitely attend the film screenings because not only do you get to see these films on the big screen, but you also get to meet some of the directors and actors involved in the films. One of my more enjoyable and fun courses!",
    "A very interesting, not overly challenging introduction to film class.",
    "You should take this class. You'll learn about economic structures of what influences what's in a Hollywood film and acquire new lenses through which to watch movies with. Screenings were a welcome break from schoolwork every week. I'm not someone who watches a lot of movies so hadn't seen most of what was on the syllabus and found it to be both entertaining and rewarding. Ron Gregg is an awesome lecturer.",
    "An overrated class. Do *NOT* take this if you want to learn anything relevant or interesting about film theory. This is a gut. It will not be more than a gut. It''s not a *good* gut. Don't be fooled by the flashy name.",
    "Interesting and fairly easy class",
    "This class is pretty good. Know that it is more about the production of film than about analyzing film itself. Ron is a great professor but barely uses his slides, so if you're a visual learner, you may have trouble with this class. That said, the exams rarely test your ability to recall a specific detail from lecture; instead, they were mostly essay-based, so you got to pick and choose what you included. The readings are not at all essential and you don't really have to do them.",
    "I would definitely recommend FILM 321 to another student, especially students interested in both Hollywood films and Hollywood as a powerhouse. Overall the course was a very good introduction into understanding 21st century (and late 20th century) Hollywood. In terms of its strengths, the course did a good job of being accessible to everyone, even those without prior film background, and of highlighting both the economic and sociocultural factors present in Hollywood. In terms of weaknesses: the course was a little more repetitive thematically by the end--it would have been interesting to listen to more close analysis of the selected films and to incorporate a little more film theory at the end of the course.",
    "Hollywood in the 21st Century has an awesome syllabus. That's why I took the class. The lectures, readings, and screenings looked so good on paper. The screenings did not disappoint, but the lectures and readings seemed a little repetitive, like you could do one or the other and get the same amount of info.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! I am a senior and can easily say that this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Gregg is just awing in how much he cares about his students and how knowledgeable he is. Yale needs more professors like him. This class also gets you caught up on and exposed to a lot of pop-culture, which can be very helpful.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in a not too stressful, contemporary and exciting class that ties highbrow film theorizing with lowbrow blockbusters and things in between, it was a perfect mix, there were two papers and two exams, I didn't make it always to the lectures but always wanted to, save for heavy workload otherwise, take this class why not; everyone likes watching movies!",
    "10\/10 would recommend to anyone looking for an interesting and really easy class.",
    "Awesome class. Take this if you want to learn more about current movies. So interesting and fun. I didn't miss a lecture (and I don't have a stellar record in most of my classes).",
    "Eh.",
    "A pretty average Yale lecture. It definitely made me appreciate what goes into making a blockbuster movie. I would recommend this as a solid and manageable 5th class or if you need the distributional requirement. Otherwise look to other classes.",
    "Great class that will broaden the way you see film and Hollywood. Next time you watch a film, you'll have a deeper appreciation for the technologies that made it possible, as well as for the considerations that went into determining whether the film was made, how it was made, and how it was made to generate revenue for studios.",
    "You'll talk about post-9\/11 cinema, then you'll talk about post-9\/11 cinema some more. This class is really about blockbusters, though there are a couple weeks dedicated to indie. Lectures are a bit repetitive, but the screenings are great. No work to turn in besides two papers midterm and final. If you're really into film, this class might annoy you at times.",
    "Yes, take this class if you need a laid-back 5th credit & you want to learn more about movies. Although it doesn't really get into enough detail for you to feel like an insider at the end, combining a variety of academic and journal\/tabloid readings, you'll still come away at least knowing a bit more about the history of films and how genres are defined today.",
    "Excellent excellent course - take if you have the chance",
    "Would definitely recommend. Ron is an amazing lecturer and the subject is already interesting on its own. Learned to look at film\/Hollywood in a different way than I would've thought. Workload is completely doable, a midterm, final, and two papers.",
    "Large lecture class that covers trends in recent Hollywood blockbusters. Watch a lot of great movies and changes the way you look at modern cinema.",
    "A great fun wonderful class",
    "Yes! This was a super fun and surprisingly interesting class. And the workload was entirely reasonable!",
    "Take it!!!",
    "This class is great! It definitely is a class that you must take in your time at Yale. The material was engaging and the weekly movie screenings were really enjoyable because they were almost all movies I had seen and loved or movies I really wanted to see. Through this class I got to meet Abigail Breslin and see Shawn Levy while they were presenting their movies, which is pretty nice. There's a lot of reading but there's absolutely no need to it all, the papers are challenging but they're also really interesting because writing an academic essay about movies is so different than writing any other type of academic essay. Overall the class was challenging but really fun, I am really glad I took it so I definitely recommend taking it!",
    "AMST 351 is an engaging and easy-going 5th class. There's a ton of reading--after the 3rd week I only did the abstracts and was just fine. Take it!",
    "I would recommend the class",
    "Really interesting class, great topic and course material. Got to watch some great movies at the screenings.",
    "This is a fantastic class that will offer completely new ways of thinking about some of the most popular movies. The lectures are engaging and professor Gregg is a charismatic, entertaining lecturer. Further, the workload is manageable and the readings are often interesting. The sections focus on discussing other famous movie clips in the context of themes presented in class. If you are at all interested in watching and talking about movies, you should take this class. It's awesome.",
    "Great course if you want more background in movies and to watch great movies from the 21st century.",
    "Overall, this class was super cool. It wasn't much of a gut because there was a lot of reading and a lot of materials to cover for the exams. But the material was super fun! And the movies were SO GOOD!!",
    "Take this course!! Its really fun material and different from the usual class you take at yale. It also so applies to some many things in you everyday life.",
    "Hollywood in the 21st Century was an amazing course! I learned a lot about the film industry and the cultural environment surrounding the production of films. I thought that the first half of the course had more structure and clear argument, but I learned a lot throughout the entire semester. Professor Gregg is one of the best professors I've taken a class with.",
    "It was a wonderful course!!! I enjoyed it a lot and learned so much about film. It made me wish that I had taken more survey arts courses. I also had Professor Ronald Gregg as my TA and it truly amplified my sentiment that a lecture class can really be affectd by the discussion section as this was by far the best discussion section experience I have ever had.",
    "Hollywood in the 21st century is an interesting look at how mainstream Hollywood blockbusters are conceived and why they are made the way they are. I would probably recommend the course to another student, though I would warn them that it is not so much a film course as it is a course about the industry.",
    "Definitely recommend especially for people who haven't taken a film class before. Great introduction to studying film!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was the first film class I've ever taken and I loved it!",
    "It's a fun class to take. The movie screenings make it a bit of a time commitment. Overall, it is very interesting to analyze mainstream movies in an academic light. The class is also very informative about the way the movie industry works.",
    "Light workload, great class, interesting readings",
    "Really awesome class. Professor Gregg is very approachable and knowledgable, and always makes super interesting lectures. Not too much work, just two papers, midterm and final, and the screenings are always excellent, modern, fun movies. DEFINITELY take this.",
    "Take this class!!! Not much work, very interesting, and fun to learn about!! Would recommend it to anyone. Prof Gregg is great, too!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a really fun lecture course that discussed blockbuster movies--what more can you ask for? The work load is totally manageable and it is not very difficult to do well (but it is also a fun class to take credit\/d because then it almost no work). Take it!",
    "Definitely take this course! It is relaxing to have watching a movie be your homework...It serves as a nice break from your busy Yale lives. There are readings to compliment the movies, but if you go to lecture Professor Gregg gives you the big themes from the readings. Also, Professor Gregg is awesome!!!!!!!!!!",
    "Hollywood in the 21st Century gives the groundwork for a broad understanding of the constructs of the Hollywood blockbuster, but views them multiple field and looks at the broader context of the constructs. I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it is not only fun and enjoyable but is not restricted to any particular major.",
    "Cool class.",
    "Take the class.",
    "I really enjoyed \"Hollywood in the 21st Century,\" but I am a total film junkie who wants to actually work in Hollywood in the 21st Century. The class is probably a good pick for a student like me who actually really enjoys the material in general, but it is not a gut class, and anyone looking to watch Marvel movies and completely ignore work for the entire semester will be out of luck in this class. Professor Gregg is a good teacher, but do not expect exceptionally charismatic or entertaining lectures. You will, if you take this course, learn a great deal about a relatively narrow sliver of film history. The 21st Century is, after all, and as my teaching fellow (who was great in some ways but was a law student - have fair warning that the course will likely have too many students for all the teaching fellows to be actual film studies graduate students) repeatedly griped about, only (at the time of this teaching) sixteen years old. Be prepared, if the course retains a similar structure, for a lot of discussion of the influence of the September 11th Attacks on 21st Century action films, and a fair amount of discussion about the effect of globalization on the modern blockbuster. Additionally, \"Hollywood in the 21st Century\" is a somewhat misleading title because while the first half of the course focuses largely on American-made studio films, the same cannot be at all said for the class's second half. I found this broader focus to be a feature and not a bug, but the same cannot likely be said for all of the course's students. Overall, this class is likely both more interesting and more difficult than one might think heading into it. Take the class if you actually enjoy the material, and not just the idea of a course with this course's title (if that makes any sense). If you're someone looking for a gutty humanities credit, I would opt for a different class, but if you want to actually learn a lot about this topic, which is extremely interesting and receives a great deal of scorn in the world of traditional academia, then \"Hollywood in the 21st Century\" is a great pick.",
    "I would recommend Hollywood in the 21st Century to another student regardless of major. It is accessible without great knowledge of industry technicalness. Ron updates the last 3rd of the course every two years as the films change. It's a fun class where I could watch movies I liked or wanted to see anyway and think about broader themes that I wouldn't have noticed. Manageable workload with weekly readings, a weekly screening, 2 papers, a midterm (early on before most others) and a final.",
    "A pretty good course to take if you are interested in modern film and Hollywood films (which almost everybody is to some extent). It's not a complete gut as there are two papers + a midterm\/final but it is a relatively straightforward class that isn't too stressful. Professor Gregg is very enthusiastic and generally gives interesting lectures although he occasionally uses rather dense film vocabulary that I'm not entirely certain actually has any meaning. The films selected for the class are also fairly diverse and great to watch, and a few special guests came during the semester as well which made the screenings particularly interesting (director of Night at the Museum, actress in Little Miss Sunshine, etc.). Overall I don't think it was a must-take class (it was in the good, not great category for me) but if you like the idea of watching Hollywood films and writing about them I'd definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "If you get in, TAKE IT AND NEVER LOOK BACK.",
    "The course studies the modern blockbuster and the global film industry as a whole. I would definitely recommend the course, as it is fun, engaging, and provides valuable perspective.",
    "As a fifth class yes, or if you truly love Hollywood movies.",
    "Definitely recommend! Fun class, good lectures, the movies are awesome. How many other classes give you lectures on 'Mad Max'? I mean, come on--how could you turn this one down?",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, it's not as much of a gut as people think. There are still two papers and a midterm and final that take studying. Lecture is not essential to attend but definitely very interesting. Section is fun and interactive. Don't skip out on movie showings, catching up on all of the movies before exams is not fun. Prioritize watching movies over doing the readings, the readings are more supplementary than essential.",
    "Take the class, but be aware that it is a really big class, so there can be some breakdown in the way that it works. The information is useful in learning to analyze Hollywood blockbuster in recent years. One might even say that the information in this course is in many ways reflective of today's global culture.",
    "AMST 351 is one of the best classes you can take at Yale, but it can feel extremely crowded during the first few weeks. The weekly viewings are extremely entertaining. You will never be bored in lectures. Definitely take this if it is offered again.",
    "It's an interesting class and you get to watch movies which means homework is easy. There are readings but you can get by just by going to lecture. Section is pretty useless, but depends on the TA. My TA just made us watch clips and discuss them; other TAs actually talked about the readings. A lot of people take the class credit\/d so the exams are easy to get a good grade on. Essays are graded easily.",
    "An overview of the modern film industry.",
    "This is a great introduction to the Hollywood film industry and the trends that you see in movies nowadays. Though the lectures can be disjointed and the material is sometimes dense, it's definitely worth checking out, especially since Professor Gregg is so insanely intelligent.",
    "I would describe this class as a fun, casual introduction to modern movies and Hollywood. I would recommend this class to anyone remotely interested in the subject.",
    "If you want a fun class that allows you to throw out a few fun terms at cocktail parties, and also lets you take a more critique view at blockbusters, then this is for you. So this is for everyone.",
    "Good easygoing course. Nothing earth-shattering but not a super boring gut either. The course is more about hollywood as a whole rather than a thorough exploration of each film's contents, viewing trends and meta-patterns instead, which is different (for me at least) from many previous courses"
