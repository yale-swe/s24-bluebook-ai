    "I enjoyed this class. It was a very good background in ecology and its relationship to infectious diseases. This is the only class like it at YSPH, so I think it is very valuable because it is such a huge part of infectious disease research.",
    "Great course at the intersection of ecology and epi. We read great papers and had a few really great speakers. The student-led discussions were not that great and were a low point of the course.",
    "The course is relevant for those interested in disease ecology. The instructor is very knowledgeable and experience in the field of ecoepidemiology.",
    "Very interesting material. Great for students who have an ecology background and also those who do not. Small lecture size is comfortable and encourages discussion and questions. Lab components are an excellent addition to lecture and discussion.At times the lectures seemed drawn out. I think better organization of the lectures would make them more engaging.",
    "The guidelines for the assignments and grading were unclear at seemed arbitrary at times. The information covered in the course was excellent but the organization at an administration level was poor.",
    "The course was poorly organized. Many of the students had overlapping classes due to scheduling conflicts. There was little notice before assignments were expected to be turned in. The course is very informative and the content is extremely valuable but the course could be better organized and structured. Pre-planning for the midterm and the final project needs to be fleshed out in order to give students adequate preparation time. Midterm question examples, a sample exam, or homework assignments outside of the regular reading might be helpful to students considering the level of depth covered in the class. The discussions were provocative and detailed the importance of eco-epidemiological studies in the lab and in the field. Great class overall...just in need of more organization.",
    "This course was disorganized, which made the midterm exam extremely difficult. It was unclear what the professor wanted us to focus on and since there was so much information and so many possible equations that the exam could have focused on, studying was an overwhelming task and thus the midterm felt unfair. Furthermore, I wish that the syllabus would have clearly stated what was expected for the entire semester. I felt like things were added to the syllabus as the course progressed rather than things being laid out in a coherent fashion in the beginning.",
    "Very interesting course, but the breadth of information could be improved."

    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Dr. Diuk-Wasser is a good teacher. She is challenging, but approachable and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Maria is a wonderful teacher. She communicates her love for her subject and has put together a great introductory syllabus to this subject. She is very caring and accessible and obviously wants all of her students to be passionate about the subject and succeed.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0The instructor is kind and helpful with students. As previously mentioned, she is very passionate and knowledgeable about ecoepidemiology. However, I felt that some of the lecture material was often rushed or not covered well enough. Overall, it was a fine elective course for students interested in infectious disease.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0A great asset to the course. Maria is very knowledgeable and passionate about this subject.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Maria is extraordinarily knowledgable in the field of ecology. Given her level of expertise, she is well suited to instruct the class. Her instruction would have been helpful during the midterm review and more formal (in class) instruction would have been helpful for the final project.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0The professor was clearly knowledgeable about the subject matter and had many interesting things to say past what was presented through powerpoint. However, I felt like the professor was a little disorganized at times which made it difficult to grasp concepts and very difficult to succeed on the midterm. I wish more time was spent on the equations because often the class moved way too fast for students to grasp what was being taught.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Extremely invested and passionate about the course, but did not go into greater detail for the more complex subjects."

    "Kathryn Hacker was a good TA. She is very knowledgable and helpful.",
    "Kate is a fabulous TA. She is accessible by email and very encouraging of all of us. She was very organized and willing to help if anyone needed it. She was great leading the lab sessions as well.",
    "Kate Hacker was helpful and timely with her response to students' questions and comments. Overall, she was kind and supportive in and outside the classroom.",
    "Kathryn Hacker - Excellent",
    "TA: Kate HackerKate is a great addition to the course. Willing to answer questions and help students at all times. Kate was absolutely necessary to make our labs run smoothly. She is a very patient and helpful instructor!",
    "Kathryn Hacker led the lab exercises. She is very knowledgeable but the exercises had a lot of glitches in them which was a little bit frustrating. It seemed like they could have been corrected if she had gone through the exercises beforehand to clear up any issues. The lab exercises also didn't really explain why we were doing what we were doing, so they weren't really all that educational.",
    "The TA was very helpful through most of the labs, however she was expected to lead a review session for the midterm exam when it was clear that she did not have sufficient time to dedicate to the students, which resulted in a very frustrating review session where students were possibly more confused than before.",
    "Kate was a great TA."

    "Must be interested in vector-borne diseases and ecology.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in vector borne or zoonotic disease, and disease dynamics that occur before it reaches humans.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone trying to put epi in anecological context. Great introduction to the field and some of the important debates like the impact of climate change and urbanization on infectious disease are discussed. A few great outside speakers too. Not too much work.",
    "The course is tailored specifically to students interested in biology ofdisease vectors and its related ecology. I would recommend it to students interested in infectious disease field work.",
    "I would recommend this to anotherEMD student who is interested in ecology. Very interesting to learn about study methods, GIS, remote sensing.",
    "This course covers unique information, connecting two disciplines. The information covered in this class may be difficult to get in any other course at Yale. However, I'm not sure I would recommend this class because of how frustrating the midterm was and how there was little to no guidance on how to prepare for it. That being said, I do think that the midterm grades are curved in the end and that the overall grading for the course is pretty lenient.",
    "With the improvement of paying more attention to the more difficult themes and improving the organization and structure of the course, I would definitely recommend the course."
