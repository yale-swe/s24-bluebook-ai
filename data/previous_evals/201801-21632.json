    "-jazz voice leadings -Logic Pro -honed my compositional intuition -learned about composition as a career -exposed to a wide variety of perspectives and artistry",

   "comments": [
    "Having a personal TF who knows a lot about composition and can honestly tell you what does and doesn't work about your music is invaluable. Their flexibility in jumping from classical to jazz to hip hop makes them great resources. The freeform, project-based nature of the class also gives you a lot of control over what you want to learn. The guest lectures were cool sometimes, but they could also feel tedious.",
    "I liked the people brought in for our joint seminars.",
    "-due to the timing I never really got to eat lunch on Thursdays -otherwise very good",
    "I think this course does a fabulous job at accomplishing what it sets out to be, but also becoming much more to each of the students who take it on a very unique and personal level."

    "Absolutely, anyone interested in writing music of any form should take Comp Seminar with Konrad especially, who is a pretty out of the box composer himself!"
