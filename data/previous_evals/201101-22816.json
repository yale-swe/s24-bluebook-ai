   "comments": [
    "Pretty much like 170 but with E&M. A lot of math and derivations that you don't need to know. He posts some notes online but doesn't post others, so you should go to class. Study the way you studied for 170 and you'll be fine. If you have questions, GO TO OFFICE HOURS \u0097\u00a0Mochrie explains way better 1 on 1 than in lecture.",
    "Don't take this class if you don't want to waste your time. Going to lecture was pointless and you need to do the problem sets with the TAs who have a hard time sometimes with Prof. Mochrie's made-up problems. The only good thing about this class is that the midterms were fairly easy. But during this whole semester I did not learn any physics.",
    "Hated it even more than 170. If they bring back 150\/151, take those. 171 will likely not help with the MCAT at all.",
    "It's a good class, but prepare to attend countless help sessions (not too painful, just a lot of time) to get the work done.",
    "I can't compare it to 151, but this wasn't that bad. The way the subject manner is presented is sometimes inpenetrable, but the professor and TAs were helpful and the grading is easy easy easy. So, not that bad of an experience. How much physics did I learn? Enough.",
    "If you are pre-med, definitely take this physics class to satisfy your requirement.",
    "Exercise caution before choosing. While it is interesting and very good on the old GPA, you may not really come out knowing much physics, unless the format of the course is changed. It's very frustrating to kind of bungle through everything with a minimal understanding. HW is very difficult, tests are very easy. Visit some other classes before making your decision.",
    "I mean, looking back, I feel like I would have taken 151 instead. I hear 181 is SUPER hard. Well, 171 is not all that hard, but it's just so POINTLESS. As in, I may get an A in this class, but trust me, at t = 1 week I will NOT remember any of it.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are a pre-med looking for the most non-physics physics class you can possibly take. That said, if you're interested in actually learning physics, I would stay far away from the class.",
    "Yes!! If you need to take an introductory physics course, I would most certainly recommend PHYS 171. Professor Mochrie is incredibly fair, even though some of the exams may seem out of this world. Make sure to keep up with material and GO TO LECTURE AND SECTION!!! You will learn a lot, and it's really applicable to research settings that you will encounter in the future. Although I don't necessarily care for the biological applications (even though I am a bio major), they are really interesting to see and understand. Moreover, Professor Mochrie is an awesome professor in that he cares about his students and really wants you to learn. He also really isn't that bad of a lecturer--much better than last semester.",
    "This second semester physics course focused heavily on the integration of physics concepts with applications in science and medicine. This was only sometimes successful. If you're a premed, this course is pretty good. If you love physics though, definitely take Physics 180 or higher. Professor Mochrie tried really hard given that this was a completely new course, but stumbled considerably towards the end of the semester. Weekly problem sets are very difficult, but TAs give you all the answers. The weekly quizzes, midterms and final are all much easier and fair.",
    "I mean, I honestly wouldn't have taken it if it weren't required for med school but for a required course it wasn't that bad. Professor Mochrie tries to make everything a little more relevant than another physics class might and it's usually pretty interesting.",
    "Physics171 is supposed to integrate biology, which it does to some level, but not significantly enough to be considered a separate course from normal Physics(151). The weekly quizzes are helpful for making sure you stay on top of information, but the problem sets are a bit too time-consuming and not representative of exam material.",
    "Take it only if you have to. If you're some sort of bio major, chances are, you have to, and for that, I am so sorry. 171 is difficult--you cover electrostatics and EM waves and waves in general and optics. Much more difficult than PHYS170. Simon Mochrie is pretty awesome as a person, but he's not the best lecturer.",
    "Really really nice guy - Simon Mochrie is a boss. Class is difficult because the problem sets take a ton of time but the tests are pretty reasonable as are the weekly quizzes. I did learn a lot about physics, and though I don't feel like I know it all that well, it's good to get a broad understanding of the concepts in biological terms. Take this class if you have to take a Physics class, as by the end, everyone sort of knows each other. He really cares about his students, even if he may not be THAT great of a lecturer. Nothing but praise for this man. Just take it, it may feel like you've made the wrong choice, but trust me, it works out in the end.",
    "I think my headache is starting to go away, but thirteen weeks is a long time for a continuous headache. Oh, and physics 171 is a terrible class in which only a few will learn and most will just memorize some solutions for the tests.",
    "Professor Mochrie really cared about this class and his students. Though sometimes he did a lot of long derivations or math that was difficult to follow, he tried very hard to make things understandable. For students interested in Biology or other biological sciences I would recommend this course. It combines Physics with biological concepts and it made Physics more interesting to me.",
    "I really wished concepts were taught better. From the way they were taught in class, it seemed like it was assumed that everybody knew how lenses work, what electromagnetic waves are, inductance means, the concepts and strategies necessary for working with circuits so on so forth. Concepts were simply introduced in class, not thoroughly explained using simple examples. Difficult-to-grasp examples were presented in class, making the notes and lectures sometimes useless and impossible to comprehend. The teacher teaches the class as he would teach it to a more advanced physics student who already has a grounding in physics concepts. What this class needs is a reality check and a greater understanding of the physics backgrounds and abilities of the students taking it.",
    "Physics 171 is a great intro course. It covers a lot of material, but by the end you really feel you have learned a lot of physics and that you start to understand what is happening in the world around you. Prof. Mochrie is fantastic at making the material interesting and easy to understand, so I highly recommend taking this course. It's not that much work either.",
    "This physics course isn't that bad for the premed (you can actually study and do well) as opposed to physics classes where you either get it or you don't. Professor Mochrie is extremely generous. Lectures are sometimes a little disorganized. Probably better than other physics courses though.",
    "It's a good physics class if you are pre-med and want to take a class that's not too difficult and has some interesting applications. But if you want to actually learn physics - with lots of problem solving - I would not recommend this class.",
    "Physics 171 is not the best class to take for pre-meds. It has almost no overlap with the MCAT so you must spend additional time teaching yourself the physics you actually need to know for the MCAT. The problem sets are pretty difficult and most of time in class is spent doing derivations instead of actually applying concepts. The grading is fair, but the class itself is a struggle to stay engaged in.",
    "I really enjoyed PHYS 171. We learned a lot of things that regular intro physics classes don't learn, and it was definitely more challenging than first semester, but all in all very manageable. The tests did get more challenging toward the end (especially the final exam), but once I finished the course and looked back, I realized that I definitely learned a lot and I feel pretty good for the upcoming MCAT.",
    "I would only recommend it to people who have to take it. Of the three physics fundamental courses however, I would strongly recommend this one just because Prof Mochrie really designs it to make it easy on students. There is no cut-throat curve as in 151, for Prof Mochrie sets the avg at B+\/A-; and there is no lack of understanding or overwhelmed feeling as in 181. In some way, there is always some resource to help you understand the material and I think that is the best part. I would definitely take it with a bunch of friends that can help you through the overall physics struggle, because it makes it happier, bearable, etc, but not a bad class at all.",
    "The problem sets and in-class derivations can be really confusing, but the exams and some problem set problems are manageable and fairly interesting. I feel like I am coming away from this course witha firm grasp of basic concepts in physics. The biology applications are sometimes a little weak or confusing, but, at times, it was neat to see physics connect to the field of medicine or biology.",
    "Very hard to understand lectures. Book doesn't really follow lectures, so you're left on your own. Problem sets are way too difficult, so I ended up not doing any of them and just cramming for the final at the end. Try 180\/181 and see how you like it before committing to this class.",
    "I recommend this class for Pre-Med students looking to take a Physics course. The coursework is manageable and the material focuses on the applications of Physics within the medical field.",
    "I am a senior, and this was undoubtedly the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. Take this total failure off the course listing. Despite my best efforts, I learned next to nothing.",
    "Not an easy class...While Prof. Mochrie is a really nice person, he is not the best of professors. I was lost the entire semester and ended up teaching myself the material, which took up huge chunks of my time. Problem sets can and do take up an entire day (unless you go to section and just have the TAs solve the problems for you, but then you still have to find a way to understand the solutions). That said, the TAs are pretty good, especially Ross. So if you're stuck, go seek help from them! Because chances are you will be super lost in class. If you want to do well and haven't taken physics before, be prepared to set aside as much time as possible for this class.",
    "Probably the best choice of all of the intro physics classes you can take. The problem sets are hard, but the TAs go over them in section (so you really do need to go to section). There are weekly quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final. The curve is pretty good.",
    "It is a course about biological sciences. AKA random physics principles applied to science masquerading as a physics course. I wish I knew this so I could have taken a course that would have helped me out with the MCAT more.",
    "the most ridiculous, fantastical, puzzling and best physics class at yale hands down",
    "Yes!This is definitely a great way of understanding how two disciplines fit together.",
    "If you must take physics, try taking 151 but if that is not available (as was the case for me) then phys 171 is your best bet.",
    "It's physics with some bio stuff thrown in. Not incredibly difficult but not easy either. Definitely have to put some time in if you really wanna know what's going on.",
    "Yes. Easier than Phys 180. Also if you don't actually want to know Physics then this class is good because you don't go in depth.",
    "It's pretty easy. Don't let the lectures or p-sets fool you, and you don't need to work as hard as the premeds do...",
    "Terrible. I dropped down from 181 in the hope of learning some physics and not just memorizing stuff for the exam. Instead, I learned absolutely no physics (other than that which I read in an AP Physics study guide) and memorized useless, bizarre calculus-based problems. Problem sets sucked. You have to commit at least 2-3 hours a week to go to the sections run by TAs.I am so gladphysics is done. I would definitely consider seriously taking 181 if you have the math. 171 is not a good alternative.",
    "171 really wasn't too bad, especially for a new class... it will only get better as Professor Mochrie continues teaching it. As a pre-med who doesn't enjoy physics and just needed to get through it, I'm happy with my decision to take 171 over 181 or 201. The material is more straight-forward than the higher level classes, and the topics covered are generally more relevant to the life sciences. That being said, electromagnetism was the weakest point of this course, and I struggled to understand it. The p-sets are kind of obnoxious, but if you go to the Sunday night help sessions, the TAs go over every problem. Also, the weekly quizzes may sound annoying, but they are generally easy and help you stay on top of the information.",
    "Hard problem sets, really boring, take only if you have to.",
    "You don't learn physics in this class. The lecture is pretty much all mathematical derivations, mostly of really random examples. I hear physics 180-181 is death because it's poorly taught and difficult. But I've also heard that at least you have a textbook and can work through things yourself. Physics 170-171 is death because it feels like you're in the dark the whole time. You don't know what to study, and how in depth. Most people I know just gave up trying to understand everything in class and on the psets, just because it was not possible, and because we knew we didnt need it on the test. Why not make things more worthwhile and focus on teaching actual physics?",
    "Good physics class to take if you're a premed!",
    "I don't know that much about physics 150 or 180 but the 170\/171 sequence was pretty good. You need to put in a lot of work outside of class but the curve is very generous and if you show up a lot it's not hard to do well.",
    "Take this class if you are premed\/ have to. While I found it wonderful, physics at the end of the day is not for the weak of heart. This is head and shoulders above the 150\/151 course and Simon is very fair with the grading. B+\/A- curve. As long as you study you will get an A\/A-. Also Professor Mochrie is great! Really funny and kind person.",
    "Do Not Take It. It is terrible. If you do, go to section. That is the only way your problem sets will ever get finished.",
    "This is a great introductory physics class - Professor Mochrie gives engaging lectures and you understand both the mathematical basis for physics as well as the relevant medical applications.",
    "Still so bad. Go elsewhere even if you love biology more than anything.",
    "The professor wants you to succeed. That, in and of itself, is refreshing. The exams test what you've learned. There are tons of sections and tons of TAs if you need extra help. It is a fair class, meaning, it doesn't try to trick you. I like the concept of the class, but it still needs some work. No, it is not a physics for the MCAT course. No, it is not a physics for the premed course. It is a physics course with applications to biology; Ithink a more apt title would be Physics with Biological Applications. Usually, everyone was as lost as I was, so I felt like the class was a better fit for me than PHYS180\/181. I took a poorly taught Physics AP course in hs and did not take the actual test, and I did fine in this course.",
    "An awful course. I don't feel like I've actually learned any physics. Lectures were confusing- I could never keep up for more than 20 minutes; after that I was just copying down convoluted derivations that were largely unhelpful in pset and midterm problems. Prior to taking the course, I was excited about taking a course on biologically relevant physics, but that's not what I feel like I got out of the course. To do well, you didn't have to understand what you were doing, but rather just know what the typical method of answering his problems were. I'd show my problemsets to friends in physics 200 and 260- which are supposed to be significantly more difficult courses- and they thought the problems were ridiculously hard. Overall disappointing. The only good thing I can say about the course was that it generally had a very good curve.",
    "Sure",
    "It's really difficult to say whether I recommend taking this PHYS 171 over another physics class because I haven't taken any other college-level physics classes. My main complaint about this class was that I felt that I didn't really learn physics, but instead learned how to do the problems (but maybe that would happen in any physics class). If you don't have to take physics for your major or for pre-med, I would recommend taking a different class. Oh, and try to create a study group, if possible. It will probably save a lot of time working on problem sets together.",
    "Unfortunately there aren't so many good intro physics options (though there are certainly a lot of them). This might be one of the less painful ones. Professor Mochrie is genuinely a nice guy and wants you to learn physics. There are some very interesting biologically relevant examples, but in the end it's still physics. His tests are fairly easy and he'll tell you what's going to be on them ahead of time. The weekly quizzes really aren't that big a deal. The problem sets can be a major pain (expect to spend three hours every Sunday night in section) and at times lectures can ramble on (though you're not generally tested on the most complex subjects). Grading is very generous. In the end I don't feel like I learned as much physics as I could have, but I didn't feel like the professor was a sadistic overlord, either.",
    "Good class, I would recommend it if you need to take physics. Probably more interesting than 180\/181 equivalent"
