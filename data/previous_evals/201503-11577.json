   "comments": [
    "Take this class! You'll learn a lot about graphic design, how to develop your vision, how to articulate (graphically) other people's vision through a mock-client poster assignment, and you'll definitely engage with deeper\/more philosophical questions about design itself and what the act of designing means\/why it matters. Things to consider, though: (1) it can be expensive. Materials fee does not cover printing. (2) If you want a class that always starts and ends exactly on time, may not be for you. (3) Developing a graphic design sense is time consuming. Be ready to revise your work many times.",
    "For anyone interested in design or willing to try something new, I highly encourage them to take this class. It might transform the way you think about aesthetics and design.",
    "An awesome class for designers of all levels. Yeju makes it even better. You will learn a ton. But don't underestimate the amount of time it takes up, both in and out of class. The time commitment is significant, and it's not just a fun, easy 5th class - unless of course you are taking it credit\/D and don't commit to the class 100%. But that being said, it is also definitely a class where you will only get out as much as you put in to it, so having sufficient time to dedicate to the class is important.",
    "In this course, you will have to work extremely hard and think about abstract issues that you never have had to before (especially if this is your first art class). How do you communicate the idea of \"organic\" simply by using horizontal and vertical black lines on a white poster square? The assignments are tough but interesting and you will get to revise each project several times until you (and your professor) are satisfied with it. Beware: this class went over its allotted time every single day when I took it, so don't schedule anything afterwards that doesn't have a flexible start time. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in graphic design that has never taken an art class before!",
    "ART132 is a really subjective class. You come each class period and hang up whatever project was assigned the class before and the whole class reviews it, offering critiques, suggestions, and praise for the work you brought in. This class is really for students who want to learns about how to construct a meaningful and successful message rather than to learn how to use computer software. It forces you to use abstract thinking and creativity to solve the issues you encounter. The entire feel of the class is casual and welcoming. You really get to know your classmates after seeing the kind of art they create.",
    "Overall, I think this was a pretty good class. It was a nice change from my other classes, and I developed a lot of useful skills. However, the work load should not be underestimated. It was probably my most time consuming class. But for anybody interested in design and visual communication, I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Make a product (by hand, then on the computer later in the semester) in response to a prompt. Come to class and review everyone's products. Repeat.",
    "Intro graphic design is a great course, and is something that I would encourage all non-art majors to take. It is a great way to challenge the way you think about the design of the world around you and it has made me way more conscious of design everywhere I go. That being said, not all aspects of the course are great. Some of the projects are pretty tedious. You will spend a lot of time feeling limited by your ability to physically make a design, whether it is physical or digital, and you will often be frustrated by your inability to construct the design you can imagine. Do not expect to become a master of digital graphic design. You will learn next to nothing about Photoshop or Illustrator. You work some with Indesign, but are expected to figure it out on your own, not taught in class. Most of the class is dedicated to making designs physically using Exacto knives and construction paper.",
    "100% recommend. Everyone should take this, if only to understand and appreciate the world around them more, because design is truly everywhere. But in reality, everyone will probably find themselves designing *something* at some point in the future, whether that be a professional website or a personal blog, a company logo or a birthday card. Learning how to communicate a simple message in a clear but creative way is a necessary skill, and that's what you get out of graphic design."
