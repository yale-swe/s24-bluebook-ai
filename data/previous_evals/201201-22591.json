    "YES. The class is a lot of fun, and not that much work (compared to L1-L4 Japanese, I hear). Hiroe-sensei is knowledgeable of a variety of topics and is very funny. His teaching style also makes it easy to befriend your (3 or 4) classmates.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in sharpening his Japanese linguistic skills and learn about Japanese lifestyle and culture! It is indeed a great class.",
    "This course is a great class if you want to continue your advanced study of Japanese language. Even after having taken a number of advanced Japanese language courses I still learned a lot from this course, and itis worth it just to have the opportunity to take one of Hiroe Sensei's classes."
