    "This is one of the best classes offered at Yale. I am quite happy that I was able to take it this semester. My only complaint was that it was too short! Our 75 minutes zipped by each class, and I wished that we could keep on going. I also loved it when the faculty would get into a debate among themselves, because that gave me a front-row seat to some fascinating discussions between the top researchers in the field. Keep it up!"
