   "comments": [
    "Yes, but make sure to evaluate the people in the class first. It was filled with YPU kids and was thus pretty miserable. Then again, listening to them argue over esoteric details of political events I didn't know anything about, was a very effective (albeit painful and annoying) way of learning very quickly.",
    "This is a pretty good seminar. The class isn't fully about fiscal politics but rather a survey of current issues in the American political system, some of which touch upon fiscal ideas. Nevertheless, it was still very interesting. It also isn't too much work - 6 reading responses and 2 seven page papers. Professor Rader is great and is clearly very intelligent! I'd definitely recommend this class, especially to someone who wants to learn more about the current problems in politics.",
    "Recommended. This was the first time US Fiscal Politics was offered, and though it showed in some of the readings, it was still a good course - and now that we've been the guinea pigs, it'll only be better next time around! Less technical than I'd anticipated (in terms of actual content; the methodology of the political science we actually pretty seriously engaged with) but still entertaining and enlightening.",
    "Yes! It's a great class that covers many important topics on the subject such as the Tea Party and public opinion.",
    "Great start to a seminar. While this is her first year teaching this course, Professor Rader is super knowledgeable about the material and knows how to lead a discussion. The readings were for the most part engaging and really interesting. Professor Rader has a reputation for having statistics heavy readings, but I think she had a good mix throughout the course. She explained the statistical methods and ideas well, and I never felt like it was superfluous information. The reading responses never felt like unnecessary burdens, and I felt like the first paper (didn't get the second back yet) was graded very fairly. Professor Rader let us switch the class discussion from modern day applications to critiquing theories readily, and I loved that she didn't feel the need to stifle interesting discussions because they felt tangential. Take this if you're even marginally interested in fiscal politics (emphasis on politics, not policy).",
    "I would not. I think there are other courses at Yale the study the intersection of politics and economics in a more interesting and intelligible way. I also think there are professors at the university who could better convey the information and better assess it as well."
