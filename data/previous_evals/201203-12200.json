   "comments": [
    "If you want to take Intro Microeconomics, then take it with Tolga Koker, that's it. Keep in mind that only 30% of students get an A, though.",
    "Tolga is a crazy dude, for better and for worse.",
    "This course is very organised, interesting, and with a manageable amount of work. You don't need great mathematical skills, but rather use common sense and try to understand the concepts in class. I definitely recommend this course.",
    "Econ 110 is a challenging but rewarding course. I would recommend it to another student. It teaches the basics of Micro Econ in an interesting way. Many of the topics you learn about in the course are applicable in many aspects of your life.",
    "Strong beginning class in microeconomics. Good introduction to more mathematical side of economics. I would recommend it to someone who has econ background since the curve is very difficult. Talking to my friends in the lecture class, they are learning relatively the same material so it all depends on how much you want to challenge yourself. I didn't get to know Tolga too well, but he was still a very entertaining teacher.",
    "By and large, I feel that ECON 110 isn't similar to ECON 115 although both courses are intro microeconomics. ECON 110 covers some additional topics and the pace can be quite fast. But overall, it is no doubt an excellent class. If you can get in ECON 110, you should take it!",
    "The class seemed geared towards individuals interested in pursuing a major relating to economics or political science so I would advise only those with a strong interest in economics to take the course.",
    "Very solid course. I also shopped the lecture, and I think 110s quality of instruction and level of interaction were far superior. Tolga is a great guy, and makes the class interesting. If you want to take intro micro, this is the way to go.",
    "Econ 110 is a really fast-paced introduction to Microecon, but should only be taken by those who have a really strong math background and who are willing to put in a serious commitment to the course. Students who are considering this course should really want to take this course.",
    "I thought that Econ 110 was a great course. Speaking as a student who shopped both 110 and 115 (the lecture and seminar versions of this course) I would definitely recommend that any student that gets into the seminar should take it. I thought that it was far easier to pay attention and learn the material in the lively atmosphere in Tolga's class. He kept things interesting. It was a great class.",
    "Econ 110 is not a class I would recommend. I didn't enjoy it on the whole. However, I have heard that it was better than the other micro options, so perhaps the field of micro is just boring. Tolga is definitely an interesting character who has a funny teaching style.",
    "I would recommend this for those who are taking micro econ for sure. The concepts are not always super interesting, but it's just one of those \"must-takes\" at Yale. Definitely try to get into Tolga's class over Simons or Udry.",
    "Take this class with Tolga Koker, if possible, instead of the lecture. He is equal parts helpful and hilarious, segmenting his class into digestible chunks with short stories (often related to econ, though occasionally not) and very easy-to-understand examples. The two exams were relatively difficult, though they certainly drew directly from the material - Tolga does a great job of preparing you. If you take this, be sure to go to office hours.",
    "Great course. TAKE IT!!",
    "Tolga is an entertaining teacher. Although his handwriting is hard to read and his accent is hard to adjust to at first, he gives funny and memorable examples from his life and stuff that is easily relatable for young people. I had never taken an Econ class in high school so I HIGHLY recommend to anyone jumping into the more intensive version (the lecture is easier) to get a tutor from the get-go.",
    "If one wants to pursue economics, take this course. Otherwise, do not. It is a very math based economics course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as one can acquire a lot of new skills and knowledge."
