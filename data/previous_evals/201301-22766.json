    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The material is fascinating, and puts all of the math you know from high school and beyond into perspective. As for the HW, it's one p-set a week and the tests are not bad if you study for them. And most importantly, Professor Kontorovich is one of the top three professors I've ever had at Yale. His lectures are great, and he will slow down if people are confused, until everyone is on the same page. Also, he has a wonderful sense of humor! Definitely take this course!",
    "Fantastic, fantastic class. Wouldn't change anything about it. As a humanities major who hadn't looked at math since BC calc in high school, this class was a perfect QR credit and fifth class--never stressful but always fun, rekindling my love of math, and challenging me to think differently. Professor Kontorovich is not only a talented mathematician but a superb teacher. Take any intro class that he offers--I can't praise him (or this class) highly enough.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS, especially if you have never taken math at Yale. It rekindled my love of math. Also, it is taught by one of the best professors I've ever had at Yale. TAKE IT. You won't regret it.",
    "This is basically a course on Greek geometry with a little bit of number theory thrown in. The mathematical concepts aren't really that exciting, but learning about the later history of math is interesting, especially from Archimedes onwards. I wish we had done more of \"current issues in math\" topics, because those conversations we had were interesting, but I suppose the concepts are too advanced to really simplify.",
    "This was beyond a doubt the worst class I've ever taken. SO HARD--don't be fooled by the name. I would absolutely recommend against taking this class. It's also mind-numbingly dull.",
    "Context: I was a senior math major taking this course, and so I was one of the people in the \"M\" section. I'm guessing that most of the other reviews for this class will be incredibly positive, and in many ways, this class was probably the best I've ever taken at Yale. But I'm a little hesitant suggesting it to \"math people.\" Prof. Kontorovich had the very nice goal to make sure that everybody in the class understood the material, and made sure that people feltcomfortable to ask questions if they didn't understand things. It's very nice, but the flipside of this is that he often got bogged down in even some simple derivations, having to do things like explain why if you multiply a fraction on the top and bottom by the same thing, you get the same fraction. By being in the \"M\" section, you won't kill the curve for those in the \"H\" section. But the nature of the class is that even the \"M\" section can't be very difficult, and it can't require much math prerequisites, and it can't grade too harshly (it's a 109 class, after all); in the end, I felt guilty taking the class, even in the \"M\" section. But you will learn, for sure. Prof. Kontorovich is an amazing teacher, and goes through historical theorems that you are unlikely to have seen in other classes (Euclid's \"windmill\" proof of the Pythagorean theorem, Euclid's proof of the infinitude of primes, Heron's formula for the area of a triangle, Euler's proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the squares is pi^2\/6...). But when it gets to the actual math, the class goes a bit slowly. If you want to get a great look into the history of math, without feeling guilty taking a class that isn't really intended for you, it's probably a good idea to read \"Journey through Genius,\" the book that we mainly followed for the class, on your own.",
    "This class goes through the history of math from a math, proof-based perspective. I would recommend this class to someone who really enjoyed pure math in high school and needs to fulfill their QR credit. It was difficult, but definitely enjoyable.",
    "If you're looking for a QR credit that isn't too heavy on the math, don't take this class. You will do real math. But I can say as someone who is very much a humanities major, it was so nice to take a QR that was actually a math class - math is a language and requires a muscle I hadn't stretched in a long time - and it's also a fascinating history of ideas class. Learning how math developed throughout history provided a really interesting insight into the development of human thought - that was ultimately what drew me to the class and I think it really lived up to my expectations. I do recommend this class.",
    "Take this class! If you're a quantitative type, it's a relaxed, fun credit that will put a lot of mathematical topics in historical context in a cool way, give you a sense of how hard various results actually were to come up with given the tools of the day, and make connections between things you might have thought were unrelated. And if you're not, you'll have a gentle reintroduction to math by an incredibly excited, engaging, and patient professor who will genuinely make you care about this stuff and the people behind it.And, at least this semester, he graded mathy folks on a different curve from humanitiesy types, based on a self-classification system that as far as I can tell actually worked fairly well. Overall, he did a really good job of teaching this class to the incredibly broad audience that showed up for it. I really can't recommend Prof. Kontorovich enough to anybody. Try to get a meal with him sometime during the semester, too!",
    "Yes! Relatively easy QR. Just make sure you already like math a little bit.",
    "I'd take it if you need a QR credit, although expect to work somewhat hard. I'd also take it if you are very interested in math and what a context\/historical background to examine mathematicians and their contributions. Wouldn't really suggest taking the course if you are neither really excited about math or if you don't need a QR credit.",
    "This is a great QR for those who want to be exposed to what a real math class looks like. You'll learn awesome things about the history of math. That said, if you have heavy quantitative background, as I did, I'd recommend against taking it, as the pace is quite slow.",
    "This is essentially a \"greatest hits\" tour through several thousands of years of math. You should not take this course if you don't know how to prove propositions. You should also not take this course if you don't have at least 10-15 hours a week available to dedicate to it.",
    "Do not take this credit expecting a history course! It is essentially just a pre-calc survey taught in the order in which these concepts were historically developed. For humanities students, be aware that there are no papers or exam questions on the history; it is essentially all math. That being said, it is an engaging and manageable introduction to math if you are not a math person.",
    "Good class. Great for senior senior year!",
    "Professor Kontorovich is without a doubt one of the finest instructors I have EVER had in my four years at Yale and certainly the best Mathematics professor I've ever had. His energy and enthusiasm for the subject is infectious, he is well-spoken and clear, is well-prepared for lecture but is equally capable going off the cuff, and his ability to present cocepts in an interesting way for Mathematics students as well as those without significant preparation is unparalleled. HE IS AWESOME!!!!!If you like logic puzzles and have even a rudimentary enthusiasm for mathematics and problem solving, you will love this course!!!",
    "I would recommend it as a pretty easy and interesting QR class. The material was interesting, great mathematics is timeless and I'm glad I know more about some of the great theorems of math. But it was difficult to study for the final because the class covered many things that were not releated to each other, instead of a cumulative progression like a calculus class.Professor Kontorovich is an excellent professor, funny and helpful and fair. He made a pretty big lecture class seem a lot smaller than it really was by making an effort to know everyone's name. I liked how he talked about more advanced mathematics that was not covered in the class and his overall enthusiasm for teaching.",
    "Yes! I think that the people who took the history section because they were not strong in math enjoyed the class and as a math person I enjoyed both the history and mathematical parts",
    "This course is absolutely amazing and I would recommend this to anyone. It is both accessible and interesting to students of all backgrounds, whether they're senior math majors or haven't had math since high school. This course is a survey of major mathematical advances. If you have any interest in the beauty of math or interesting historical anecdotes, this is the class for you! Also, Professor Kontorovich is the best teacher in the math department at Yale, a phenomenallecturer and extremely accessible to students. And the workload is very manageable. Definitely take this class!",
    "do yourself a favor and take this class if kontorovich is teaching. best class at yale hands down",
    "Think of this as the DS for Mathematics: it is a summary of the most important figures in mathematical history through a look at their major theorems. The class is absolutely excellent: fair tests, great teaching...Take it. Trust me, just take it.",
    "Dont take this course. It's hard. You dont retain any material because its not presented well.",
    "Kind of a silly course. It's a fine QR if you like math.",
    "It's a fascinating review of the great theorems of mathematics, and I would recommend it to anyone. However, don't expect it to be easy.",
    "When Prof. Kontorovich taught MATH 310: Intro to Complex Analysis in the Fall of 2011, one of the student evaluators wrote a series of Chuck Norris jokes describing the transcendental qualities of Prof. Kontorovich and his lecturing ability (go, read them! for real!). I am proud today to offer my personal endorsement and verification of these comparisons. Prof. Kontorovich is truly in a league of his own -- a first-rate lecturer, a brilliant public speaker with impeccable comedic timing and stage presence, one of the most patient mathematicians on the face of the planet, and a genuinely great guy. This class is simply awesome -- you'll actually learn about the history of math, and the development of thought in many different fields of mathematics (admittedly, there's a slight analysis\/number-theory-focused bias, but that's where so many of the interesting stories are anyway!). I especially encourage students from STEM majors to take this course. It will not be particularly challenging (modulo assigned historical reading, you might finish problem sets in less than 15 minutes per week if you're focused), but I guarantee that you will learn a lot and really enjoy the course -- and, take it from a senior, that's a really rare sort of class. Seriously, this sort of class is special -- in a traditional undergraduate mathematics curriculum, math is presented as a very sanitized subject. The logical progression of theorems and proofs is immaculate, andit would seem to the unsuspecting student that the entire body of math was developed by a small class of elite and infallible geniuses. Don't miss out on this chance to really develop your understanding of the much-less-than-perfect origin story of so much mathematical thought. But, don't take this evaluation's word at face value! -- if you have any questions, ask the author! Get in touch with me at jerry.wang@aya.yale.edu, and I'd be happy to tell you why this class is great. Also if you're a Math\/Physics major; a Mechanical Engineering major; an engineering tour guide; or a member of the Yale Record, the Society of Physics Students, the Yale Undergraduate Math Society, or Tau Beta Pi; or live in Davenport C32, C21, or B41; or play Davenport intramurals religiously -- if you're reading this, get in touch with me! I'd love to hear more about how any of these loves of my life are doing in the future! Also recognizing that these evaluations will probably be lost after three years pass, I kindly ask of the blue-booking generations of the future that some generous somebody repost at least the gist of my message in his or her evaluation. Yale has really been special and wonderful and altogether indescribable, and classes like this are a big part of the reason. Boola boola, Yalie of the future.",
    "Recommended for: students who are really interested in the background behind the major theorems of math (for basically all of them, read Journey Through Genius, the book around which the course is based)NOT recommended for: people looking for an easy QR",
    "This is a great introduction to how mathematics has developed, from the concepts of counting and finding area for taxation purposes to the abstract math of pseudo-random number generators. I highly recommend it for humanities students who would appreciate the context this gives many of the major math discoveries.",
    "This is a really fun class. Prof. Kontorovich is an entertaining lecturer and a very effective teacher. There are some weird features of the class, however, if it's run the same way it was this year. It was advertised as appropriate for all math levels, including upper level STEM majors, since no other class covers this material. In practice, this meant that the class was roughly 20% STEM people who knew that Kontorovich was a good prof to have, and 80% people who struggled with basic algebra and needed a QR. (In fact we self-selected into \"humanities\" and \"math\" types, had different psets and tests, etc). This made it really hard for the instructor to teach it the way he envisioned, I imagine, because he often had to slow way down in lecture to explain really basic things. Not that there should be any pre-reqs for a MATH109 course, but it was kind of a bummer for those of us with a lot more math ability, because there was obviously a lot of cool material that he skipped or didn't get to because of the students who were less confident mathematically. I think it would be a lot more effective to separate this into two courses. Also, there was a distinct number theory bias once we got to the end of the semester and started talking about more recent mathematical advances -- makes sense since K is a number theorist, but some algebra and other stuff would be cool too! Anyway, all of that said, I would recommend the course. If you haven't done math since 10th grade it's a way more fun way to earn a QR than first order logic or calc 1, and if you're a STEM type it's an easy and fun 5th credit.",
    "History of Math is a chronological look at how math developed over time. It is a math course more than a history course, in that you are actually learning the math and the proofs, not just who came up with them, etc. As a math nerd in high school who had sort of lost track of her math roots, I absolutely loved the class. I found it a fun, easy, enjoyable class. It is also one of the few accessible math classes that is taught by a really awesome and impressive professor. I know people will take this class because they need the QR, but I would encourage others to take it as well - especially if you are one of those people who just finds math really cool.",
    "Are you kidding? Stop what you're doing and sign up for this class. Literally. There is no better QR for non-math folk. The material is really cool. And I will forever sing the praises of Prof. Kontorovich. I'm not going to write it all here. Know that, first and foremost, he is a great great teacher. Now google him."
