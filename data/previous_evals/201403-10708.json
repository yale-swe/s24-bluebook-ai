   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend CHEM 457\/557 to another student. The course is not easy but very helpful for understanding fundamentals of coordination chemistry. Professor Holland does a great job teaching the course and provides a great overview of topics significant to the field.",
    "Group theory, MO diagrams, properties of inorganic complexes (ligands and metals), as well as techniques used to explore structures and reactions. The final project is a proposal for future practice. A very good introduction for anyone interested in research in an inorganic\/organometallic lab.",
    "I would recommend it. You learn a lot about techniques which will be applicable in research. Also, the structure is set up that you get to take exams and test your knowledge. However, my favorite assignment was the proposal. Although stressful, it was EXCEPTIONAL practice for necessary future endeavors in the graduate program",
    "I think I'd recommend it if you know for sure you want to do inorganic research. Otherwise, it was a little frustrating, especially the proposal assignment, which was a ton of work and hard to get started on.",
    "I would summarize it as an advanced inorganic chemistry course that is challenging but interesting. I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in chemistry and I would highly recommend Prof. Holland as an instructor, or any class he taught.",
    "\"It covers inorganic chemistry in a more practical way.\" I'd recommend it with the stipulation that it is not a course to get a little behind in. Ever. And being able to mentally picture 3D structures helps a lot."

   "comments": [
    "This course was particularly helpful to me as a graduate student because of the proposal assignment that we completed. This allowed me a first insight into the area of proposal and grant writing which I will need to use in my second year qualifying exams.",
    "The proposal was so helpful. It gave me an idea of how I will need to improve. All topics covered were also relevant.",
    "Tests and assignments undoubtedly helped me a stronger candidate for my PhD. Information is applicable and presented in a manner I can comprehend. Proposal also helped me increase my confidence in writing interesting research proposals.",
    "Yes, it was a very valuable course for future research in the field of inorganic chemistry.",
    "This course helped me understand the reasons behind different metals complexes reactivity. I also appreciated the distinction drawn between thermodynamic and kinetic processes, a distinction I had not seen applied in such detail before. Since I have not yet selected an adviser, the application to my research is still unclear."
