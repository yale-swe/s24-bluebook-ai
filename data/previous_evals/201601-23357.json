    "This was a great course, and it provided a lot of practical knowledge and experience, which is not always available to us here at FES. It's a lot of work, and I sometimes struggled to complete readings while staying on top of my clinic project, but each class topic was relevant, and I very much enjoyed the speakers.",
    "This is a great class with great speakers, forums and engagement with the professor and the TA.",
    "Great course. Clinical projects the best part. In the future, creating a workshop around community based management approaches and building support from the base would be extremely helpful.",
    "There's no TA reflection question? TA was incredible as well: responsive, encouraging, insightful.",
    "Question 8: This class is primarily taught by guest lecturers, and Professor Gentry does a tremendous job of providing context that links all the guest lecturers together. Oftentimes in guest lecture-based classes things can seem disjointed, but Professor Gentry ensures the same core concepts are circulated through all the classes and he does a great job drawing connections. It also helps that he selects the guest lecturers carefully and knows all of them, so there are no surprises."

    "We covered a lot of information with specialists in the field, great readings and great independent projects.",
    "great intro to land conservation. For most part, speakers were all fantastic. and the dinners\/lunch are great opportunity.",
    "Speakers were outstanding and readings although numerous are great resources for now and if you end up working in the land trust community in the future.",
    "Class structure. Reading responses were actually incorporated into class, by the students. Reflections on previous class were voiced thoroughly to enhance understanding. Projects were tailored to student interests. Professor kept all speakers on track, making sure their messages were applicable to classwork.",
    "The lectures, clinic project, and workshop\/\"field trips\" were all excellent (so, really the whole class). I thought each of those three elements was integral to the class and helped me learn a lot. From the lectures I got to hear explanations and straight-from-the-field examples from experienced practitioners; from the clinic project I got to learn from more on-the-ground practitioners, drill down into one specific area, and get an inside look at a conservation organization; and from the workshops I learned more specific skills related to appraisals and land transactions.",

    "Sometimes the discussions felt a little stunted...wish there was a way to increase engagement from the whole class. But it was good to get some experience in leading discussions and understand what goes into leading a discussion (hint: it's not just asking questions!).",
    "None",
    "sync readings with speakers better the lunches are awkward because you don't know what they are going to talk about during class, so it's like this dance of wanting to ask what you're interested in, but not knowing if you're stealing their thunder later. dinners are great because you can ask follow-up questions.",
    "I thought the readings and the topics covered by the speakers were often not the same. Maybe having the speakers key in more on the topic would be helpful. Also, I would call this course Private Land Conservation since that is the focus. I also felt the discussions by the end of the semester were getting a little bit redundant and throughout the semester they all focused on the speakers from the previous week and not the readings which wasn't really the same thing. There were aspects of the reading that I would have like to discuss in class.",
    "Nothing comes to mind.",
    "Would have been nice to have an alternative homework type besides the reading\/speaker responses. Got a little tedious towards the end. Also need to organize it so that people get to lead the discussions on the subject they signed up for. Because the discussions addressed the topics from the previous class, we didn't end up leading what we had signed up for."

Most students came in knowing one or two parts of private land conservation well, and were able to A) fill in knowledge gaps and B) share information with peers.",

I got much more out of it than that: defining what counts as conservation, evaluating moral complexities of transactions, introduction to some very foreign-to-me financial concepts. I also took it to work with an organization I wanted to learn about on a project I care about. I was able to contribute meaningful, real work to them while getting a fantastic excuse to talk to anyone and everyone about the project. Learned so much about the area and partner organizations that I don't want to stop. This will now likely be a long-term, even life-long, volunteer project for me.",

My project for the class was different from what was offered, but the professor and TA were enthusiastic about helping me make it work. I realize that my full experience was perhaps different as well, but I wouldn't (necessarily) be heading in the (exact) direction I am now without this course. Extremely grateful that FES offers this, that the professor and TA taught it, and that all the speakers made a real effort to connect with students. Thanks for a life-changing class.",

    "find some readings or something on the state of land trusts as a whole before the class. Make sure you understand TPL, TNC, Land Trust Alliance, and how they all fit together. go to as many dinners as you can read up as much as you can before the speakers come, because really great opportunity to ask specific questions from leaders in the field",

Do whatever you need to during the 5 minute break so you can pay 100% full attention to speakers. Speak up if there's something you want to discuss more. There are a lot of meaningful discussions to be had in this class; take part.",
