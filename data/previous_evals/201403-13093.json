   "comments": [
    "This course really helped me bring my writing up to the college level and to polish my already-developed writing skills. There is a lot of reading about the global economy and the 2008 financial crisis in particular. The class discussions can be a little dry at times, but overall, the material we covered really helped me to better understand our globalized economy.",
    "The course was probably the best course I have taken this semester. Both the material and the writing component were rigorous but through that I was able to learn and apply so much of what I was currently learning. One of the biggest strengths of this course is the fact that there is a revision process. All of your papers for this course will be viewed by at least two pairs of eyes, one of them being your professor. There are many strengths to this course and I would highly recommend it for anybody interested in writing about topics that affect us all.",
    "To summarize English 114, I would say that it is a great introductory writing course to get you familiar with writing at Yale. English 114 is different in each section, where different sections read selections on different topics (ours was Capitalism and Democracy) and write about the same. I would recommend English 114 to a fellow student as a good way to get used to Yale-level writing. Students' satisfaction varies by topic and by teacher. Although there can be large amounts of reading at times, I felt that the coursework was manageable. We had three essays (approximately 5 pgs) and one longer research paper, which really helped introduce us to the library system and the many resources Yale has for student research.",
    "Global Capitalism & Future Democracy has taught me how to structure and approach writing. I have learned the importance of researching, outlining and having a clear idea of what my claim, motive and argument are going to be. After writing four essays, I have also understood the importance of writing a first draft and reviewing. I have learned how to review my own writing and understand what needs work and what needs to be cut out. Comprehensively, I feel like I have created a writing system that makes me feel confident and secure. In addition to developing writing skills, I have discovered Yales research facilities, know how to look for articles and have learned how to integrate sources into my essays. The course is extremely interesting, but it requires a lot of writing work. Be ready to be writing all semester. But it definitely worth it if you want to improve your writing skills!",
    "A great course to learn about an interesting topic and improve one's writing. I would recommend it.",
    "It's a great course for getting familiar with college academic writing style--especially helpful for who has not done so much writing in high school. The reading materials are super interesting and help you think a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you haven't taken another writing course at Yale. It is a lot of writing and you will feel it during the semester but given how much writing one must do at Yale anyway, it will behoove you to work on that skill in a class specifically designed to help you do that.",
    "A class that teaches you economics and politics while helping to improve your writing.",
    "English 114 is a great way to improve your writing skills and learn how to write a college level essay, while also having an interesting topic to write about, instead of a general English class. I would strongly recommend this class, particularly to freshman looking to develop their writing skills. Because the classes are so small, you get a lot of personalized attention in how to improve your writing, and there are very interesting discussions in class."
