   "comments": [
    "Sure I would recommend. It is one of the best courses available. All the teachers are experts in the field.",
    "It's a great introductory course to new graduate students! I would recommend it to all first-years.",
    "The class provides insight into some of the research areas that professors are looking into while emphasizing critical and relevant papers within the field. I would definitely recommend this to any student interested in microbial pathogenesis.",
    "Each lecturer is talking on an area of expertise, so it is very informative. On the other hand, you don't get a broad sense of the field as much as you learn about some more specific areas of inquiry. Presentations don't do much to facilitate discussion.",
    "Microbiology 685 is a course that touches on many of the important points involving Microbiology. It is a team taught course that enables several of the professors in the microbiology department to give a lecture on their field of study. Beyond exposing the student to the research going on at Yale and basic principles of microbiology, the course also makes more of the professors in the department approachable. Because of all of these reasons, I would highly recommend this course to another student."

   "comments": [
    "I think I got a lot of training from the presentations and paper reading.",
    "While some lectures pertained more to my interests within microbial pathogenesis, overall the class presented valuable information about immunology, virology, and bacteriology that could potentially benefit my understanding and contributions in research.",
    "It gave me an understanding of some important mechanisms that apply to various microbial systems.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of the professor because I got to learn about the research going on within my chosen department of study at Yale. It was great because the lectures provided information not only about the important concepts and fields of microbiology, but also because it was directly related to research that is going on at Yale. Information learned in the course will definitely be helpful in future research."
