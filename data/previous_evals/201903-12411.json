   "comments": [
    "Oddly enough, this course taught me how to feel, how to understand these feelings, and how to turn them into writing. With each assignment, we were told to start with a feeling, latch onto it, and see where it takes us. This was such a beautiful revelation that I will carry with me beyond the confines of this course or even writing about others or myself no matter what we do, we should put our whole selves into it and let our passion, our joy, our feelings guide us. Oh, this course also helped me develop my writing (primarily poetry), for which I am eternally grateful.",
    "I became a better reader after having taken this course. The readings each week were light in quantity, so I was able to spend time each week in analyzing them and working out how the author was conveying certain messages or emotions. My writing skills improved a little, mainly developing a keener eye for removing unnecessary words.",
    "I learned how to write consistently and use the reading we did to inspire my writing and make it better. I think I grew in what I think writing is and how I approach it.",
    "I had never before taken a writing class at Yale, and I am so happy I took this course. Professor Barkin is an incredible professor and really cares about his students. Not only did we have the chance to read important, thought-provoking and beautiful pieces of poetry, but we had the chance to engage in deep and meaningful discourse about ourselves and our lives.",
    "I learned that the best part of writing is living. All of the work we read centralized how necessary it is to be a full-time, fully engaged member of life to produce these works, and to be honest about when we're not doing that. This class is a life lesson more than anything.",
    "Professor Barkin entirely transformed my writing. His thoughtful edits and comments pushed my writing in ways I didn't know it could even go. His remarks are brilliant. I developped a much stronger passion of writing. I've also learned how to sift the soil of my own perspective into the portrait of others.",
    "writing about people -- strangers, acquaintances, people I know well -- and places."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this class is the professor. Don is truly such a wonderful, caring, honest, and simply delightful man. His passion for both writing and teaching radiates throughout the course, making it a true delight. He simply cares so much. Sometimes Don tends to meander too long with his words or insights, which can seemingly detract from the class, but the truth is that these monologues are part of the beauty of the class. Drop the haste to discuss the readings or share your insights listen to what he has to say, hold onto the gems and wisdom, and you will get so much more out of this course than listening to yourself or your peers talk.",
    "I wish the course had focused more on the writing process, with explicit lessons on different writing topics or techniques. I would have liked the course to include more workshopping of our writing. Instead, 85% of each class was spend discussing the readings, and the last 15% (often less) was people reading their work. Sometimes the discussions were engaging, other times not. I didn't feel like I was learning new information or developing more skills. Instead, I was exposed to authors I otherwise wouldn't have read.",
    "The course is well facilitated for self learning and taking initiative, I think I would have enjoyed more peer workshopping or criticism.",
    "The strength of this course is definitely in Professor Barkin -- he made the course so fun and engaging, and stressed learning over grades. The course is great, and I have no complaints.",
    "Amazing dialogue, amazing professor, amazing readings, amazing prompts.",
    "I would've liked more structured revisions of pieces.",
    "The strengths are the way it is taught. The syllabus is extremely well organized and thoughtful. The class discussions sparked from each assignment are amongst the best discussions I've had a tYale.",
    "strengths: great syllabus with interesting works, instructor offers detailed feedback and holds frequent office hours to talk about work progress, small seminar structure allows for a lot of student discussion\/debate, sharing and hearing students' works is great weaknesses: rarely get through all the works on the agenda because we're always short on time"

    "Absolutely. This is such a beautiful, exhilarating, and rewarding course. Don is truly a delight, and your writing will improve greatly over the semester. Even if you aren't seeking to improve your writing, but rather to develop your writing, this is also an ideal class. I had a lovely foray into poetry. I struggled, grew, and learned throughout the semester, and it was such a rewarding experience. You learn how to not only observe your surroundings but observe yourself. Having an assignment due every week can be a bit tough, but some of my best writing manifested during late-night, half-delirious sessions. My advice: lean into the demands of the assignments, let yourself stay up late and struggle, latch onto whatever you feel when writing, try something new and fail, and keep trying.",
    "If you want a class where you want to learn how to write portraits of people and places, developing tangible skills and workshopping pieces, this is not the class for you. If you want to be exposed to a wide variety of authors and study how those authors constructed their portraits, this class is better suited for you. Barkin does provide thorough feedback on the writing pieces each week, but there is little to no in-class discussion or workshopping of the weekly writing.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Prof. Barkin is incredibly smart and really wants his students to enjoy the learning and the writing. It can be a very different pace\/experience from other classes at Yale but I really enjoyed that.",
    "Definitely take this course if you have the chance!! It was one of my favorites at Yale and will 100% change the way you view yourself and your journey at Yale so far. Especially take this course if you have not had the chance to write creatively at Yale, and want the opportunity to express yourself in a non-stressful and encouraging environment.",
    "YES. Professor Barkin is so wise, and that's what makes the class worthwhile. Everything else is great too, hands down, but he extends our writing lessons into just general life lessons (without even trying). Every time we left class, we felt more enriched.",
    "It's a fun extra course, if your schedules decently full.",
    "I 100% would. This class is not just a seminar at Yale, it is a class that will make you think about your life and education - one that will be hard to ever forget. I was truly so sad when the class was over.",
    "yes -- if you're interested in reading prose\/poetry and writing it on a weekly basis. writing comes easy because you can write about whoever you want and the instructor offers constructive + affirmative feedback. go to office hours, prof barkin is very laid back and cares about students beyond their intellectual capacities."
