   "comments": [
    "would take if i were looking to improve my spanish",
    "If you place into L4, fight it and try to get into L5. It is daily grammar drudgery and nightly busywork that will make you want to scream.",
    "Good class, really improves your speaking skills, and not difficult at all.",
    "After L4 Spanish I feel like I can actually speak Spanish. I've never been very good at foreign languages and have been \"learning\" Spanish for years without feeling like I was making much progress. By the time we had our oral exam at the end of the semester, I realized I could just talk in Spanish confidently and with very few mistakes.I'm finally done with my language requirement, but now I'm considering taking an L5 class because of how rewarding it was to finally feel confident in my speaking, reading, listening, etc. This isn't the most exciting class you'll ever take, but the workload isn't too bad (though you'll really earn that extra half credit in the last couple weeks) The last 1\/3 of the semester is reading a short novel, which was an interesting change from the textbook. I definitely recommend taking itwith Cividanes, she'll help you learn rather than just correcting your mistakes.",
    "helps build a strong foundation in Spanish and improve all aspects of mastery; take it as a rigorous way to appreciate and learn more about the language and the culture",
    "It's pretty good. I understand a bit more Spanish now than when I started. You drill the same grammar as always for the first bit and then finally get around a film and short story- both of which are good\/enjoyable. It's a pretty typical Spanish class though. Watch out for the oral exam at the end: 3 sets of 3 prompts, choose 2 sets and prepare ten minutes for each of the 6 prompts with a partner (usually over many hours in Bass), perform two prompts chosen randomly.",
    "Great class. Less work than L2 and L3, but harder assessments (quizzes\/tests) than them. Take it with Ame Cividanes if you get the chance! You will love the class with her. She is also very understanding, fair, and an incredible instructor. Would highly recommend.",
    "If you want to get a handle on more advanced grammar and really push the level of control you have over your speaking, take this course. It's obviously a lot of busy work (that's just part of learning a language), but it's definitely bearable. If you do take it, though, Professor Cividanes is the one to take it with. She is just such a lovely person and teacher, and you WILL improve.",
    "The class wasn't particularly hard. The hardest things were the oral presentations, but the rest of the work was fairly easy (even though it met every day)",
    "I would say that it is definitely a lot of work, with a few homeworkassignments per night and at least a test, quiz, presentation, or composition per week, but you definitely improve your Spanish. Sra. Cividanes is a great professor, and I would recommend her for Span 140.",
    "If you need to fulfill your language requirement, this class is good for that, and Prof. Cividanes is really nice and a great teacher. I felt that my spanish got better but once you get to a certain point you need to be immersed in a spanish speaking country to really improve, but this class provides excellent foundation in learning to hone grammatical speaking skills.",
    "I feel like my Spanish really improved in this course, especially my speaking, because there is a lot of conversation practice, two oral presentations, and an oral exam. Overall this course is a good mix of grammar, speaking, writing, and reading. At the end of the semester you read a short novela which is a nice break from textbook work. I would recommend his class; your Spanish will improve."
