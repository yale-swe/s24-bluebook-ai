   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want to learn more about film and watch films if you want to be exposed to more films from around the world.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed it. I would recommend clearly differences between the WR and non-WR parts of the class. I sometimes worried about being graded harder because i was in a WR section, while not taking the class WR.",
    "It is worth taking and you will know the world in a different way through great images.",
    "An important distinction you discover in this course is that there's \"world cinema\" and \"cinema of the world.\" The latter is cinema popular in various countries. The former is films that are festival darlings from around the world that people back home may have little access to. This class is, accordingly, \"world cinema.\" You'll watch profound, beautiful films, but you'll come to realize that the roster is what the elite intellectual community considers great cinema (every film has won awards at Cannes, Venice, or Berlin). And generally they're right, and you'll see cool films that you wouldn't otherwise. But you start to realize that the other course might be just as interesting, if not even more exciting. The lectures sort of cover cinema history... they're just a rather roundabout way of covering it. It's all in there, just a bit unclear at times. Section immediately following the screenings can be kind of rough, especially after the more draining films (and there are many, considering those big festival types). The nights get long. And the textbook isn't particularly engaging. But it's still an interesting experience, if you're looking for a national cinema course and have a tolerance for \"artsy\" movies and well-intentioned elitism.",
    "An eye opening experience of foreign film cultures. Some of the films are amazing, while others aren't that compelling. Informative lectures.",
    "Do not take this class if Dudley Andrew is teaching it (or \"team-teaching\" it which is a joke because John MacKay barely got a word in) -- his lectures lack direction and his love of European cinema makes him come off as severely elitist when talking about film in formerly colonized nations. The films are interesting and section is great (they have section right after the screening which makes for some great conversation), but the lectures are often pointless and confusing.",
    "This is a really great idea for a course, and definitely shop it to see if you enjoy the lecture. Dudley Andrew isn't a great lecturer, but sometimes the high quality of VERY interesting films would make up for it... though sometimes not.",
    "FILM 240 01 is a great intro course to world cinema. It is better to take intro to film studies before taking this class because you need some basic film analysis skills for this class. However, it doesn't matter if you haven't taken the intro to film class. Professors and TAs in this class are extremely helpful and can answer your questions according to essay construction and film analysis. If you are planning to major in film, definitely take this class. Many students in our class major in literature and take this class for their film studies requirement.",
    "This is a survey course of films from different nations around the world. It seeks to present nations' individual cinematic histories, to combine them, and also to complicate the definitions of \"national\" and \"world\" cinema. Class has many cool, interesting parts--great lectures, AMAZING section discussions, weekly screenings, textbook readings--although these parts don't always seem to fit together. It's a privilege to learn from Professor Andrew and Professor MacKay, and it's clear how excited everyone is to be here. So basically, it's a great introduction to the film department and to films beyond Hollywood, although the course itself (excluding the wonderful section discussions) could feel disorganized."
