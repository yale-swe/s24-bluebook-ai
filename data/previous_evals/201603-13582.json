   "comments": [
    "This course was a very thorough overview of the more complex aspects of grammar in the Spanish language. I learned how to read, speak, and write in any tense; I learned very subtle nuances between different different verbal moods\/other forms, and I improved my speaking ability thanks to both in-class discussion and Skyping sessions with a student from Ecuador.",
    "I had the chance to greatly improve my Spanish writing and speaking skills.",
    "I improved my Spanish grammar skills and my Spanish writing abilities.",
    "Before taking this class, I thought that I had a strong grasp on Spanish grammar. But my skills improved so rapidly because the class is so well taught and so comprehensive. I am a better reader, writer and listener now.",
    "I became better with Spanish grammar.",
    "I improved my Spanish grammar immensely and learned many nuances of the Spanish language which I would not have otherwise known.",
    "This class was a good refresher of all important aspects of Spanish grammar. We went over verb tenses, vocab, sentence structure, etc.",
    "By taking this course, I gained an in-depth understanding of advanced Spanish grammar. The material of this course has helped me not only develop my formal Spanish writing skills into a more mature style, but it has also helped me improve my idiomatic spoken Spanish as well."

   "comments": [
    "The teacher was excellent and the Skyping sessions were incredibly helpful. However, there was so much busy work. Holy cow.",
    "A weakness is the course material because it is dull. A strength is the companeros de conversacion program.",
    "A strength of this course is the extensive opportunities I had to practice each concept in all of its complexity and the amount of writing opportunities I had. A weakness is that because of a lack of conversational activities in class, I don't feel able to necessarily apply the new grammar I've learned to my spoken spanish.",
    "It's incredibly boring.",
    "There was a lot of busywork in the class but besides that, the course was enjoyable and the teacher was very knowledgeable.",
    "Overall I think it is a well organized and structured class. The material is not always the most interesting or engaging, but we do watch movies and read stories for homework. The homework exercises often felt like they took a long time and were tedious, but that's not necessarily a weakness of the course.",
    "The strengths of this course are: the sheer amount of grammar exercises that contributed to a good grasp of material; the small class size and level of interaction among students and the instructor; grading system that allows room for growth. A major weakness of this course is that the material itself is very detailed; the grammar rules are very particular. Personally, examples of correct and incorrect grammar were very useful in understanding the picky differences between grammar structures, and those could be used more in the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they are looking for a challenging yet rewarding class that will almost certainly improve their skills in Spanish.",
    "This class did not work for me. I found the course material boring, and the homework unproductive (mostly just copying sentences and busy work). It functioned much like a high school Spanish class. Professor Seymour was nice and a fair number of students participated in class, yet I found myself extremely unmotivated to go to class three times a week.",
    "Yes, the professor really cares about students and the material. You'll greatly improve your speaking and writing abilities.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who really wants to improve their minute command of Spanish grammar.",
    "This course is a fantastic one to take if you want to improve your Spanish grammar skills. After taking the AP sequence in high school, I had forgotten many grammatical concepts. But with this class, I was able to polish my old skills and develop new strengths. It is a great class and Profesora Seymour is awesome!",
    "Never. It was awfully boring and tedious.",
    "I recommend the class to someone who has the time to do a lot of busywork and is looking to improve their Spanish. The material isn't necessarily difficult, but the professor assigns about 1-2 hours of homework a night, so the class can get annoying at points.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students looking for an L5 Spanish option, especially for non-native speakers. While the workload is pretty heavy, the class' focus on writing and grammar is an easier transition for most non-native speakers than say, Ancient Spanish Lit or Spanish cinema.",
    "Yes, it is what it says it is. I think it's a good first L5 class, but I would not say it's easy. It wasn't super exciting, but I got what I wanted out of the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students who aim to improve writing and reading in Spanish in particular. This course was more focused on writing and reading than on speaking and listening."
