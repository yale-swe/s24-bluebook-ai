   "comments": [
    "The first half of the class was boring and destroyed my grade, but the second half was very enjoyable. I would recommend this class to a math-and-science person, but not a non-math person like myself unless there are no other easy QRs.",
    "Be prepared to like this stuff, or you're in for a long bore.",
    "If you want a broad base in simple statistics, this a good class. The focus on practical application of statistics makes it an especially good choice for less math-oriented students, like myself.",
    "If you are interested in how Statistics works, this would be the class to take.",
    "Statistics should be part of anyone's liberal arts education. Although the pace of this course is pretty fast, students get out of the course with solid grasp of statistics. The problem sets were pertinent, the assessments were fair, and the lectures (both by JDRS and Dowling) were well-delivered. The main weakness of the course is how grading works. Although the instructors adjust students' grades at the end, a few students were getting super high grades on problem sets, whereas others were losing many points for small mistakes. So it was hard to know how you are doing in comparison to others. Yet I totally recommend this course.",
    "If you're reading this, you're probably going to take statistics regardless of what the evals say, but here's the confirmation -- statistics is a good thing for an adult to learn, if you haven't had any in high school. What can you expect? A fairly standard class of 1 pset a week, two midterms, a final. Some people take to JDRS' teaching, and others don't -- but his lectures are generally very clear, if very weirdly, manically delivered. He often comes off as a deranged game show host, with flashes of depressing lucidity when he recognizes the overwhelming indifference of the students. This class is very much taught in the awkward in-between of teaching the subject well, and teaching it exactly as much as students want to learn it (minimally, enough to do well on the exam, etc.).The second half of the course, taught by Connor Dowling this year, is pretty interesting but somewhat repetitive\/intuitive -- which is what stats is, at the end of the day. Buy a textbook (Stats: Data and Models is the best) and follow along in it if you have difficulty paying attention in lecture. The TAs were pretty poorly chosen, and most of them won't be terribly helpful during office hours.",
    "I mean you probably have to take stats, and if you're going to take stats, take this one. The one with JRS the whole time (social sciences) is ridiculously hard. This polisci stats is pretty darn easy once you get out of JRS's lecture.",
    "It's intro stats. The first half is more actual statistics, and is significantly harder than the second half which is more interpretation. The curve is not nice. Overall, I would recommend it, just make sure not to fall behind and remember that it gets better after the second midterm",
    "Don't take it if you can avoid it, but if you need it for your major do the political science section for sure because the second half includes a lot of material you'll see in academic literature.",
    "This is a great introductory statistics class that will give you everything you need to know to, for example, answer \"what is a margin of error in polls.\" The class meets together with all the other sections for the first few weeks, before splitting off into the polisci section, which is a good introduction followed by more in-depth polisci-related statistics.",
    "It's an introductory statistics class. I personally found the JDRS weeks terrible, and the section with Conor Dowling for the Poly Sci section was fantastic.",
    "It's your basic stat class--pretty much what you'd expect. JDRS is hilarious and makes stat as fun as it could be. Poli Sci section is MUCH easier than the first part of the course, so it's a slightly less hectic end-of-semester.Exams are fair, problem sets are pretty straightforward.I wouldn't just take this for fun, but if you have any need to take stat at some point, this is a fine option--not too painful, and at times even a little enjoyable.",
    "I think Statistics is an extremely important subject to have a general knowledge about. It is extremely useful in many aspects, so I highly recommend taking the class. Both professors did a great job at teaching the subject material.",
    "The first half of the semester is significantly harder than the second and the first half covers so much material it's a bit stressful at times. However, the second half of the semester was when we broke into sections was at a much better pace and very interesting. If you think you're interested in statistics I would take the course.",
    "Very dull, would not recommend unless you have an actual reason for taking it. I took 102 because it had the best reviews but it still turned out to be very repetitive.",
    "Good intro to Stats. I took AP Stats in high school, and this class didn't go much beyond it -- only in the last few weeks, with multiple regression -- but was still a good refresher. Probably could have jumped into a higher level class though.",
    "The first half of the course provides you with an overview of basic statistics. Thesecond half allows you to focus on one particular area. There are two midterms, eight homework assignments, and a final exam. The tests are all very fair. I would recommend Statistics 102 to a fellow student, but I might consider taking the social science section instead of political science section.",
    "This class was just mediocre. The stuff you learn is very useful but it's boring to just go through it all. In the poli sci section of the class, you learn how to do multivariate regression which is pretty cool.",
    "Probably one of the most useful classes I've taken at Yale to be perfectly honest. If you're a Political Science major this class should be practically mandatory. I mean, what a shame if you go through four years of political science classes and you never see the tables in the articles you read as more than \"oh I can skip this page!\" because you actually have NO ideas what the numbers mean. Also it's great if you need a QR - the first 2\/3 of the semester with JRS can sometimes be hard if you're not naturally math-inclined but it is COMPLETELY doable as long as you go to office hours and work hard to understand the material. I'm not sure if Conor Dowling will be teaching next year, but the political science part of the class was easier conceptually and more applied stuff (also very practical). Overall, if you're a political science major in need of a QR TAKE THIS CLASS - you will fulfill your requirements and learn stuff that is actually incredibly important.",
    "Pretty straightforward quantitative course. Don't get behind on the problem sets. The exams were relatively easy, but hard to keep up to with problem sets that were graded kind of hard.",
    "I would recommend the second half of stat 102. It was very much a introductory course with big lectures and very little connection to the professors and material.",
    "I liked the last 5 weeks, so if you can make it through the first 7 and dont mind the big lecture then you will enjoy the class.",
    "An easy QR for political science majors that will definitely enable to look more closer at polls, studies, poli sci experiments, etc. Prof. Dowling is very relaxed, dry sense of humor, and very accessible.Would definitely recommend.",
    "Take STATS 100 if you need to or if for some reason you like stats. I think that this is one of the best sections you can choose for this class! Advice: go to office hours",
    "I personally enjoyed the second part of the class much more than the first one. Take the class if you need to for a prereq, or for a not-too-hard QR req.",
    "I would definitely recommend STAT 102 to a fellow student. In my opinion, it's one of the better classes to use for a QR credit. Statistics, especially statistics in political science is quite straightforward and allows for people to obtain a knowledge of how many things work. After taking STAT 102, I began to realize that statistics were everywhere and that is an experience I would like for others to have.",
    "It is a good introduction to stats. The work load is fairly light, but you have to really focus on your answers if you want an A. I would recommend this class to another student, but with caution. I would also recommend that they buy a textbook.",
    "This is a good introductory class. It is not the class that is going to motivate you to get out of bed in the morning, but it is worth taking if your academic or professional pursuits demand that you have a working knowledge of statistics.",
    "Yes if you have to.",
    "This a good introduction to basic methods of statistical analysis. The first ten weeks -- with Reuning-Scherer in lecture -- are fast-paced and quite interesting. Problem sets can be a bit tricky, but lecture notes are extremely detailed and very clear. Pay attention and you'll pick up a lot. The final weeks of the term -- in poli-sci-specific section -- move much more slowly; each lecture focuses on one (very simple) concept. Problem sets are much shorter and more straightforward. After Reuning-Scherer, an unusually good and highly animated lecturer, Dowling was a bit of a disappointment, quiet and nervous and rather difficult to pay attention to. The material was fascinating, however, and Dowling clearly knows it well. Take the course: it's a fine QR that will give you a good sense of basic statistical methodology.",
    "A useful course in many ways (QR, quantitative analyses in political science etc.) that was worth it. Not the most engaging course around, but still manageable. Workload is fine with about 1 P-Set\/week, 2 mid-terms and 1 final. Final was based mostly on the material in the Political Science section which was nice.",
    "If you're looking to take an intro class about statistics, this is a great class to take. Professor Reuning-Scherer is great; his lectures are entertaining and he is very thorough in the way he covers all of the topics. If you are interested in learning more about opinion polling, take the political science section. The lectures weren't as good in the second half, but the material is interesting.",
    "It's a useful QR for non-mathy, social science types. Understanding and being able to think critically about statistics will help you in the other things you do. However don't expect any level of expertise from taking this class.",
    "Take it if you need the QR or want to learn more about stats in polisic.",
    "If you need a QR credit that will actually teach you something useful to your life, this class definitely is a pretty good choice. If you know how to read a graph or do basic algebra, you'll be fine with whatever math is thrown at you. It can be especially useful if your major is included in one of the specific tracks. I got a poli sci credit along with a QR which doesn't happen too often. Weekly PSets can be hard so you might as well sign up for a tutor ASAP because that's the best way to get it done quickly and correctly.",
    "The class is a good overview of statistics. JDR's humor livens up the material and makes class engaging; however, make sure you keep up with the material covered in class, especially if you haven't previously taken statistics. JDR moves quickly and it can be easy to get lost. Also, keep the requirements of your major or possible major in mind when picking your specific section of intro stats.",
    "The course is a wonderful introduction to statistical analysis and how statistics can be used in the political science field. The professors are entertaining which makes learning the material much easier. However, having no set course book can make things hard to follow.",
    "Personally, I felt that this was the most challenging course of my semester. The problem sets took a good chunk out of the day to complete. Toward the second half of the semester the workload became more manageable though. Stick with this course if you want to learn about stats. It will be very useful toward your major if it recommends it. Otherwise, take another QR because this course was definitely challenging."
