    "I would recommend this class for bio people interested in learning what systems biology is like: what kinds of questions it can answer and what kinds of methods you would need to learn if you wanted to seriously pursue it. The biological questions it looks at are fairly simple, but it can be really satisfying to understand on a mathematical level why certain protein properties, for example, can produce desired behaviors. I would recommend shopping the first few courses and looking at the textbook first to get a sense of what the field \/material is actually like. I wouldn't recommend this to people with a general interest in bio: you learn less about biological processes, more about a field that you could pursue further.",
    "Yes, I would recommend",
    "I really liked this class. It is motivated by real-life problems and examples, rather than abstract ideas. Acar and Miller-Jensen are both very excellent lecturers and very knowledgable about their respective fields. Light workload for undergrads, and a low stress class overall.",
    "Systems Modeling in Biology is a rough overview, through selected topics, of the analysis of biological systems using both experimental and computational tools. Contrary to past years, we did virtually no mathematical modeling by computer simulation ourselves. However, I do think a lot of biological insight was covered during the course. Some of the topics we covered were the structure and dynamics of transcription networks (mostly at the level of simple network motifs), bistability, ultrsensitivity, phosphorylation cycles in cell-signaling, simple protein-DNA systems, oscillations in biological systems, noise in gene expression, stochastic modeling of gene expression, and statistical analysis of large biological data sets. Through selected papers, both in discussion sessions and in class, we were exposed to many experimental techniques that underlie our actual understanding of how real biological systems work, though we were never accountable for experimental details. I will be starting bioinformatics research this summer, and while this is not a broad bioinformatics course but rather a sampling of topics from a different perspective of biology, I did find some things we learned will be very helpful for me moving forward. For undergrads in the course, the workload this year was totally manageable, and I recommend it."
