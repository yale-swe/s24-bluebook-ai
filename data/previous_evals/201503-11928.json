   "comments": [
    "Prof. Brisman is a great teacher, and he leads a good class discussion. I enjoyed class and felt like I learned a lot about not just the Bible, but also literature in general (then again, I'm a computer science major, so that may not be saying much). Purely practically, this class was useful as well. I didn't know that much about the Bible before this class, but I came out of it feeling a lot more comfortable--a lot more cultural allusions make sense to me now.",
    "I took this course Credit\/D and would recommend doing the same; I learned a lot (especially when writing my papers), but it took the stress of participation and consistently doing the readings off.",
    "A really great way to understand the bible from a literary perspective. Great for students familiar with the stories or who have never read them before. Not much time spent talking about history or theology, but a good way to understand authorship and structure of the bible as well as to strengthen one's abilities at literary analysis. Brisman is a really incredible teacher, and you're writing will improve immensely from his feedback. He is very invested in his students and willing to meet with them outside of class. I highly recommend the course.",
    "I would summarize the course as a very in-depth examination of what the Bible is as a literature. An analysis of the book via the lens of multivocality and within the context of the time periods in which the various books were written. I would recommend the course to others.",
    "I imagine it's one of the best classes on the Bible you can take in America. It's a great way to familiarize yourself with the Bible, or to deepen your understanding if you are already well versed. That said, it's not a breeze, and no easy A.",
    "Take this class if you are especially interested in learning about the Bible. It probably works best for people who have some prior knowledge. The readings were long and relatively dry, and my sense was that very few people did them. It was basically fine not to, because in class we'd look at very narrow passages, so you'd benefit from being prepared but it wasn't essential. Professor Brisman guides discussion pretty firmly, so only take the class if you're into that. Class got pretty boring pretty quickly. Overall, meh. I feel like I came away with a few fascinating nuggets of knowledge about the Bible but not a broad or comprehensive understanding by any means. The absolute worst part was that he runs 10-15 minutes late every single class.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in engaging with the Bible in a different, more theoretical way as the name implies, as a literature. This course differed from other courses I've taken in the English department in that it invited more conjecture and speculation about the texts and its origins than I am accustomed to, and that made me feel slightly less confident in speaking up and participating, but if that is something that interests you, this is the class for you. Professor Brisman is not an easy grader and he is not always the most engaging in class, but he is brilliant. Buy coffee before class and you'll be wowed by what he knows.",
    "If you've never engaged with the Bible before, take this class. If you come from a Christian background, it might not be especially enlightening but rather serve as a refresher of old material.",
    "I would consider Bible as Literature quite a good class. The seminar made me think critically about biblical writings in a way I had not before. Brisman emphasizes the \"multi-vocality\" of the text--that is, the effect and presence of different authors who wrote and re-wrote the passages we have before us today. He has a deep appreciation for the text and its idiosyncrasies. Do not take this if you want a Bible study class, however. Also, keep in mind that Brisman is an extremely hard grader, so you may want to take this class Credit\/D\/Fail. In retrospect, I would only recommend taking this class as Credit\/D.",
    "I highly recommend this class. The material is exciting and the discussions are deep.",
    "I'm a senior and this was definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Would highly recommend for those who are interested in the Bible. Prof. Brisman is an amazing professor. He's one of the kindest professors I've had and very knowledgeable and engaging. I thought his insights were really valuable, particularly those regarding the Hebrew Bible. Prof. Brisman also works really hard to offer multiple perspectives and is very respectful of different opinions. After taking the class, I have a better understanding of the Bible and have many interesting things to think about.",
    "Take this class! Professor Brisman is the best. Discussion is interesting, challenging, and delightful under his direction. He's hilarious and very smart. I took this course Credit\/D and was able to enjoy discussion without worrying about his grading (which is notoriously tough)."
