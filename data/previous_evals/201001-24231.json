    "BENG 356L is just like BENG 355L in which you write a short form after every lab. Each lab takes two weeks and at the end there is a final. It really isn't so bad and will be one of the more chill classes you take as a BME major.",
    "BME lab, if you're a BME major you have to take it. If you're not, don't take it",
    "I would recommend this class only if it is a required course.",
    "Recommended, especially since there are no long form labs (although it is probably required for you)",
    "Well you have to take it if you are BME",
    "this is an honest review from a student to another....It was extremely distracting and the format needs a lot of adjustment. In terms of experiences, I found one of the tas very unhelpful. Half the time he had very little knowledge in terms of experemtal procedures. Nicha was by far the more experienced, and she actually did care about your understanding. She would grade our reports and at least indicate the correct answers for our own benefit, mike was never this encouraging.Take this lab if u have to, but you should approach nicha or staib instea of mike.Good luck!",
    "You probably must take it, and I don't think you will regret it. You learn a lot about important topics from ultrasound to NMR to microscopy to image processing. The work is less than that of an introductory lab. The short forms aren't bad at all, though some are longer than others."
