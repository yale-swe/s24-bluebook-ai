   "comments": [
    "A far cry better than taking a bio lab course, especially if you've done research before. Make sure you choose a lab that interests you, works with your schedule, and fosters a positive learning environment. Work closely with your project supervisors on the written assignments (a proposal due a couple of weeks into the semester and a final paper due at the end of reading period) and the presentation (due before the start of reading period).",
    "Working in a lab was great, since you learn a ton. But, chose a lab wisely--the people you work with can make or break the experience.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a 4 page, single-spaced research proposal, an end-of-semester presentation, and a 12-15 page, double-spaced research paper. It's a great way to complete the MBB major requirements, but the amount of stress and lab work involved also depends heavily on who your PI and mentor are.",
    "Take this class, especially if you haven't taken research for credit before (or just once). After the first two semesters of research for credit, you have to take it pass\/fail which is unfortunate. I still think even that is a solid idea as long as you like the lab your work in. I really enjoyed my lab, but I know some people who did not. As long as you find a lab, PI and mentor you like, this class is great. The 10 hour a week minimum is flexible, but you will probably spend more than 10 hours per week in the lab on average. Some weeks may be less or more but overall it will probably be more.",
    "Good way to motivate yourself to do research over the semester. Ten hours every week is a lot, though. Scheduling my time around research was rather annoying, since my department is on science hill. I'm glad I was able to get credit for my research, though.",
    "Yep, research and working independently is a great way to learn science.",
    "A basic research for credit for MBB. The only work that's due is a proposal about a month into the semester, which is a couple pages and then a final paper of 12-15 pages at the end of the semester. You're also supposed to do a presentation to your own lab. I imagine the grading is easy as your PI controls much of your grade. If you find a good lab this is a great option. You do 10 hours of work which is kind of a lot, but no stress and you don't need to do work outside of lab.",
    "Great way to get credit for research that I wanted to do and to practice scientific presentations and writing! The work definitely gets heavy towards the end of the semester so plan ahead and make sure all of your classes don't have big final assignments.",
    "yes! they're capping it at two credits of research for grade per person, so otherwise it becomes essentially Credit\/D.",
    "A great way to formalize your research in the lab! Not much instructional support, but you definitely get experience presenting to your lab and writing a 12-15 page report at the close of the semester.",
    "If you're doing research, it's basically just what you do normally (except for the proposal and end-of-semester report). It's a nice way to get credit for what you're doing anyways.",
    "If you have a research project that you are hoping to spend time on, this is a great way to get credit for it. I think the overall best advice I could give to someone taking this would be to sit down and really make sure you and your PI\/instructor(s) know what is expected of you, what you hope to accomplish within the semester, etc.",
    "It is a large time commitment but worth it--invaluable experience."
