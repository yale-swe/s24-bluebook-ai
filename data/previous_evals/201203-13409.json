    "As with any ENGL114 course, be sure to choose a section with a topic you're interested in. In my section, our first essay was the analytical paper (ours analyzed two supreme court cases). It was quite difficult, and I remember feeling very worried after turning in my draft, but the course improves from there. Don't be scared away!",
    "Everyone should take ENGL 114 except DS students.",
    "A good class to take with interesting readings. At times they are a bit dry or long, but overall if your section is up for it, it will make for an interesting discussion. Professor Robinson will help improve your writing.",
    "If you like writing you will definitely like this class. Although some of the reading may be a little hard to keep up with, it is a good introduction for college level writing for freshmen.",
    "Interesting stuff regarding censorship.",
    "English 114 04 is a great opportunity to sharpen your English skills, no matter your level of proficiency. It will also help you develop argumentative skills. You will see the improvement when you write essays for other classes.",
    "This class was a look at \"censorship and the law\". One thing I really enjoyed about this class was how often we were able to pick the specific topic of our papers. Professor Robinson gave us a bit of a vague topic for each paper and we were all allowed to narrow that down and choose something that most interested us. I would recommend this class to someone who has an interest in censorship, literature, or anything else like that. Papers ranged from movie censorship to the censorship of specific books and everything in between. Professor Robinson was very encouraging to every subject."
