    "its like an AP high school Science class",
    "The Technological World is a class that teaches you how pretty much EVERYTHING works. In the modern age, pretty much all electronics run on the same basic principles and nearly all information is transmitted using the same clusters of ones and zeroes. This class teaches you the concepts behind all of that \"stuff,\" and I would consider it one of the most useful classes I have EVER taken. The knowledge I gained through this course will remain with me well past college, which is something I can't say for most of my Yale courses. If you're lucky enough to get in (there's a lottery at the beginning where he takes 80 from a pool of around 300), TAKE IT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE.One caveat: a student will benefit HEAVILY from a strong background in physics. I took AP Physics C in high school, which allowed me to focus more on the qualitative (and fascinating) aspects of the material, rather than struggle to understand the physics (which isn't always so simple). I know somepeople who had weak physics backgrounds didn't enjoy the class--or learn--quite as much...",
    "Take it if you're decent with math and science, if you want a more interesting science credit.",
    "This is a class for non-science people. Absolutely take it if you need a science credit. It's not difficult and pretty fun.",
    "This class basically teaches you the basic workings of almost every technology we take for granted, from cell phones to LCD screens. I would definitely recommend this course. It was very interesting, well-taught, and fun to go to, without having much work to go along with it.",
    "Probably harder than some other Sc\/QRs, but I'd say a decent choice. Two midterm exams, one cumulative final, and weekly problem sets (first one is by far the hardest). You're allowed to bring in one or two pages of notes for the tests, which is good but also makes the problems harder - it's important to know both problems but also concepts of how things work. I think I probably did okay in the course, and some of it was pretty interesting, but in general I found it very boring subject matter.",
    "If you need a QR take this class. no other reason to take it, but it IS actually interesting and it isnt hard at all.",
    "Only if you plan to go to every class. Try doing the problem sets by yourself. It'll make you keep up with the material. It's not a gut in terms of the material, but if you do the work, you will get a good grade.",
    "I would recommend this class as a way to get your QR\/SCI done but I warn that it is not a gut and requires a real amount of preparation. The lectures are enjoyable and he is really approachable, caring, and attentive.",
    "It was a fun course to learn how technology works. Pretty much everyone takes it to fill a Sc\/QR, but be warned, it is not a gut in the way you might expect. You definitely have to go to class and study. But if you do that you'll be fine and it's a fun class!",
    "It was an interesting way to fulfill a science credit but again not a gut.",
    "Tech World is a good class for non-science majors who still want a class where they will learn real science and actually have to do some work. It was a good class, I learned a ton of neat stuff, and it was not too strenuous or difficult. Class was not always the most engaging though, but I overall recommend it.",
    "The Technological World is a very interesting class that I would highly recommend to non-science majors of nearly any science background. I haven't had chemistry\/physics since early high school, and so I had to do a bit of catching up on some of the more advanced math\/science covered in the course, but it is definitely within your ability if you are willing to take on a non-gut Sc credit. Henrich is very helpful and will go out of his way to make sure that you have the resources you need, but in return you should expect to put in the time to go to lecture and the voluntary review sessions, which help a lot.",
    "Yes, but one needs to be regular and pay attention in class in order to figure out the problem sets, which can be slightly confusing at times.",
    "a great class to take for a QR or Sc credit. You learn a ton but you are not stressed out, and as long as you go to class, it's not too difficult.",
    "I would recommend it to a certain type of student. First, the student must be willing to spend time on the material and learn some gritty details. He\/she must not be afraid to work. As science classes go, everything is certainly manageable, but it requires the discipline to take good notes and review them in your own time.",
    "There are easier ways to deal with a Sc requirement and probably a QR requirement, but this course is very interesting and the lectures aren't boring at all. The beginning is kind of hard, but the second two-thirds get progressively easier. You get notes for the tests, which is nice, but this is in no way a gut.You feel like a baller being able to explain LCD screens and DVDs, trust me.",
    "Organized course. Taught well, though, quickly. It could be improved by making it more fun, adding more experiments and more real life applications, in order to make it more appealing for non-science, non-QR people.Take it, but only if you've got a background in EM waves.",
    "Yes",
    "Very good. It's a fascinating introduction to how modern technology works. The work is totally reasonable, and Prof. Henrich is always engaging. Accesible to anyone with any sort of background.",
    "BEWARE. Everyone will likely tell you this class is easy, but unless you have a solid foundation (and I mean SOLID) in electromagnetism, you'd be better off avoiding TechWorld. My best guess is that like 75% of this class thought this was the greatest thing ever, and the other 25%, myself included, cursed the day that we somehow thought this would be a good idea. I remember looking at evaluations from years past, and they were starkly mixed, but I was like \"Oh, it's okay, I took advanced physics for two years in high school.\"It wasn't okay. The problem sets are practically impossible to do on your own. This course made me feel incredibly stupid, because the majority of the kids in the class WILL get it, but keep in mind that at least a quarter of the class will be hopelessly lost for most of the semester, despite coming to class every day and attempting to meet with the TAs. I thought I wouldn't be in that unhappy quarter, but I was. Don't let it happen to you.If you're willing to beat yourself to death with electromagnetism all semester, do it. Professor Henrich is a nice guy and his lectures are fairly interesting, especially when he has really cool demonstrations. He also looks sort of like an awesome wizard, so I liked to convince myself I was going to class at Hogwarts, which distracted me from how confused I was.",
    "I would recommend but with reservations. Be prepared to study a lot for tests, go to class, and be actively engaged.",
    "Take it for the easy QR, learn how 3d glasses and stealth bombers work along the way. One pset a week, not too bad, except the first one's really hard.",
    "It is a science course that tries to be friendly to non-science students. However, in trying to be friendly it shies away from probing deeply into more complicated science and approaching the science in an organized and clear manner. Sometimes it is better to take a hard science course that teaches rigorously and expects equally rigorous answers than a course that teaches somewhat vaguely and incompletely that asks easy questions. Even if they are easy questions, arriving at an answer that hits all the key information is difficult if the science behind it was taught in broad strokes.",
    "It's a really interesting class, though there you only learn a little bit about a lot of different topics. Also, don't expect it to be as easy as it seems. If you haven't taken some high school physics, I wouldn't recommend taking the class.",
    "The class was good pretty easy for a science credit as long as you put forward some effort and did the problem sets with someone else. Also somewhat interesting for a science. Recommend it.",
    "If you want an easy science credit, this is not it. Expect to work hard, expect to learn something.",
    "Tech World is a pretty good class. I was worried that, as someone with a lot of science background, it might be way too easy. This wasn't really the case. I was wishing that we would go faster, but there were many different concepts and themes, as well as specific technologies, that I had never covered before - I had been more of a chem \/ bio \/ enviro kind of guy, so the physics things were new, even if I had had some experience with them.I do wish the course were better documented. It is very important to come to lectures and takes notes, just because there isn't really a textbook or anything. I think that that is OK - textbooks usually suck and are expensive - but I wish the things we talked about were written down a bit better, just for review etc. So, personally, I do wish the class moved faster, though I understand why it did not. This class is a good fit if you want to review some material and learn some new things, though you may have a happier time if you are newer to the material.",
    "Definitely.",
    "A fantastic overview of very applicable material. Great demos, great instruction, fascinating technology made understanding. I would highly recommend this course. The science is not difficult, though by the final exam the sheer number of techonologies covered makes it necessary to dedicate a good number of hours to studying.Whether or not you need the science credit, take this course.",
    "If you took a lot of physics and chemistry in high school, and if you typically go to class, this is a fantastic course\u0097you won't need to do a lot of studying, there's no reading, and the concepts are interesting and approachable.If you skip lectures, you'll run into problems. So go to class.If you don't have a strong science background, a lot of the material can be more difficult. But I still thought it was really interesting and I enjoyed going to class.",
    "I would definitely recommend to any student looking for a QR or a science credit. if you pay attention in class it makes the problem sets and exam very easy.",
    "problem sets are difficult",
    "Definitely NOT a gut. You really MUST attend every class, since the lectures are the only way you're really going to learn most of the material. And the work only feels easy if you're really interested in it, so if you're not genuinely interested in the subject matter, please don't take this class, so someone who is interested can get in!",
    "I would if the low challenge level were appropriate for them",
    "I would definitely recommend the class for non-science majors who need a science credit or even science majors looking for an interesting but not too intimidating class. The key to doing well is actually going to every lecture because there isn't really a formal textbook. As long as you actually go to class and take good notes, you should do well.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EASY QR\/SC CREDIT! IT IS SO HARD!",
    "Very interesting class with a manageable workload. Tae it for a reasonable science or math credit and you'll be surprised at how much you learn.",
    "I learned a lot, but the class was definitely not a gut. If you don't have a good physics background, don't expect to coast through the course.",
    "Great course. Really goes into detail about how a lot of modern technology works, most of which is really interesting. It's definitely not a gut course, but if you go to class its not bad. Great QR.",
    "This is a hard course, dont' be fooled. Not a gut.",
    "This is a really awesome and interesting course to take, especially if it's just for kicks. The technical sciencey part of it can be boring or confusing, but it's necessary to understand the basics of how things work. you have to go to class everyday since it's ONLY notes (he offers pages in textbook to study from, but there's not actually reading). The videos help (NOT NAP TIME, sadly) and the in-class demonstrations are always fun and amusing. Make sure you study EVERYTHING he said in class for the exams though. He's a really awesome professor.",
    "Tech World is the fourth and last course that I have taken for a QR or Sc requirement (I\u0092m an English major). It is DEFINITELY the best of those four, and I wish every science-or-math-course-for-humanities-majors could be like this. You get to learn about how technology that you use all the time works, which is really cool, and the workload is really light. You just have to show up to lecture, pay attention, take good notes, do your problem set well each week, and study a reasonable amount for the two tests and final. I really recommend going to a help session with one of the TF\u0092s every week. It makes the problem sets a lot less opaque, and you will be very confident that you understand every problem set answer by the time you get around to studying for the tests. If you\u0092re willing to put in effort with this course, you will be glad you took it.",
    "Tech World is a wonderful class -- lots of material is covered. I just wish i could have more time with the professor to get my questions answered because the TA's try to be helpful but really aren't.Get a study buddy for the problem sets and go to a review session each week.",
    "Definitely reccommend it if you can get in. Shopping period is pretty representative of the class. Incredibly practical information- I impress my friends with the information I learned in this class all the time.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You need to go to class, but it was thoroughly enjoyable. I learned a lot of useful things. I didn\u0092t even need the QR or Sc credit, but it took it because it was that much fun.",
    "So good. Take it.",
    "I really liked it! I thought some of the stuff was a little useless, but overall an interesting course.The beginning is A LOT harder than the rest of the course. The first pset was really bad, but the rest is decent. I spent 2-4 hours a week on the problem sets and a few days studying for the tests and did decently.Keep all your notes for the tests! If you write small enough you can keep bringing in the same sheet which helps A LOT for the final!",
    "Excellent survey course in the science behind different technologies. Every single lecture was interesting which is very rare for a science class. Professor Henrich was very well organized and it was obvious that he spent a lot of time preparing every lecture.",
    "Tech World is a solid course that's genuinely interesting. The difference between this course and a normal physics course is that this one is learning about how things work, through the lens of physics, not vice versa. If you've ever read the book \"How things work\" this class is for you.It's also mostly Electricity and Magnetism physics, so it helps if you have some acquaintance with what an electron is, but even knowing nothing, he explains everything well!"
