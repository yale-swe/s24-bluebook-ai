   "comments": [
    "PHIL 218 is a wonderful bridge between introductory philosophy courses and more advanced study. I'd definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Very interesting class. Might be a little dry for a non-philosophy major, but if you're into Plato, Aristotle, Hellenistic philosophy, or epistemology in general, you'll enjoy PHIL 218.",
    "I took this course because I was trying to figure out whether I liked philosophy enough to major in it. I realized that I personally don't enjoy ancient philosophy, but the class itself was very well taught, and is a good introduction to the basic thought of Plato and Aristotle particularly.",
    "I would recommend Ancient Epistemology to anyone serious about philosophy. The issues involved are subtle and not necessarily of broad appeal, so the course caters to a specific audience, but that should be obvious from the course title alone (who takes a class called \"Ancient Epistemology\" without some philosophical interest?). But anyone who's invested enough in the material will find the course well worth it.",
    "The class is literally an overview of ancient epistemology: Plato, Aristotle, Skeptics, Stoics. Although it is an overview there are a lot of details to keep up with and a substantial background of the thinkers and texts will make the class easier and more productive."
