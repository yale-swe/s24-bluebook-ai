   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Accessibility of professor and TA outside of class for office hours. Weaknesses: Very general lessons taught in class but vastly different specific problems asked on problem sets The amount of work is unmanageable When asked to explain a concept it is explained using more numbers and variables rather than words which adds to the confusion It is difficult to grade our own problem sets when we're not sure what your process to solving the problem is Long answers to the problem sets should include every step so we can understand how to actually do the problem Professor and TA teach different ways to approach\/answer the same problem so when grading the problem sets we aren't sure if we actually got the problem right or wrong. Disappointing lack of communication, preparation and attention to detail Does not post grades in a timely or understandable manner Does not give feedback",
    "There were no weaknesses, this was an excellent course.",
    "Eli is an amazing professor, amazing at explaining complicated topics in a simple manner, and is really empathetic towards those who are not naturally good at math. The only suggestion I'd have for the course is if it could somehow be filmed or recorded. These are really hard concepts with assignments that are very challenging and take a ton of time. There were many times throughout the semester where I wished I could have been able to rewatch, pause, and rewind a lecture to help me review my notes and reason through the problem sets.",
    "Strengths: - structure of the problem sets was conducive to through learning of material - TA and professor were extremely accessible and supportive Weaknesses: - the way the coding material is presented currently causes more stress than benefits. If coding will be involved in the future, it would be helpful if there was more instruction provided.",
    "everything is great."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you want to do research or understand research. This class will assist you in being able identity common mistakes that occur in peer reviewed literature and ensure that you and others on your team don't make the same.",
    "Really be prepared to work hard in this class. In order to do well, you need to dedicate a lot of time to this course. It will be miserable a good amount of the time, but if you go to office hours and take problem set corrections seriously, you will learn so much and it is such a helpful foundation for my other courses.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone who anticipates working with data or data professionals. It has changed my view on the use and applications of calculus and its role in data analysis.",
    "Nothing. Be prepared to love math."
