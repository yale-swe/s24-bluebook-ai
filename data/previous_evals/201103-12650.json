    "If the intention is simply to learn to read music at a basic level (rhythms, scales, intervals...) I'd recommend auditing the class. Otherwise, if there is a real interest in music theory, I recommend the class in full.",
    "Lots of music theory, then lots of reading that is supposedly for people without musical backgrounds, but still makes no sense.",
    "You will be expected to do all the readings (especially from the textbook) beforehand in order to understand anything in class.",
    "I would only recommend the class to a student who has some background in music, or to a student who is exceptionally interested in learning the basics of music. The class is more difficult than most students anticipated. For example, we learned to read music, and were expected to be \"fluent\" in less than a week.",
    "This class is not easy for someone who has never had any musical experience, though it is doable. There is a lot of emphasis on aural skills that the professors just sort of expect you to acquire in the first couple weeks of school.You'll learn a lot, though, by taking it if you haven't otherwise had much exposure.",
    "Take this class. It's a fun introduction to music!"
