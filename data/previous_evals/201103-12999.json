    "This is a great Spanish class for those who took advanced Spanish in high school but are rusty for some reason or another. I took this class after having taken AP Spanish junior year of high school. I thought at first I should be placed higher, but this class turned out to be a great combination of review and high intensity since it is taught entirely in Spanish. You'll probably be familiar with all the grammar if you were placed into this class, but speaking, writing, and listening all improve immensely. Take it with Savo, she is fun, interesting, knowledgeable, and relates well to the students.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I think it is very helpful in developing both speaking and writing skills in Spanish.",
    "Spanish 130 is a typical language class in that it requires daily work in class and practice (through homework) every night. It is obviously time consuming (which is why it is 1.5 credits), but if you want to learn a language, it will get the job done.",
    "Level 3 spanish",
    "definitely. it was a great class",
    "I mean, it's not a difficult class and you probably need it for a language requirement, so yeah I'd recommend it. There are far worse languages to take.",
    "Spanish 130 is just an intermediate level Spanish class. The class is conducted in Spanish but the teacher and other students talk at a slow enough pace for everyone to understand. The workbook sections focus on grammar and vocal and the class overall helps to improve one's Spanish. I would recommend the class for someone looking to fulfill their language requirement who has a background in the language."
