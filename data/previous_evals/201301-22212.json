   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if you are really intrigued by this period of history or you need a rest of the world distributional requirement.",
    "This is really a great course. I don't know why the reviews are so mixed. It's not a lot of work--two interesting papers, well timed in the semester so that they're not ever during the crunch time of midterms or reading week. And the midterm and final are managable.The history is fascinating, and the Professor has a strong thesis that is provable and debatable. You feel like you are part of a historical dialogue, in that there is a lot of historiography embedded in the course. We hear the traditional western opinion, and then revisionist versions of stories, and so there's a depth and breadth of scholarship that we are exposed to. The reading is also fascinating--primary sources paired with great textbook-like works that are clear and interesting to read.",
    "This was a so-so class. The first half was good and clear, but the second half became much less intelligible, partly because the history gets more complicated, but also because the lectures became less clear, which was disconcerting. The subject matter is extremely interesting and worth knowing. If you are a history major looking for a Rest of World credit, this is not the easiest one, but I am glad that I took it.",
    "Great course! I actually think that the seminar component should be deleted, and that there should be more lecture time, because Professor Perdue is just such a great lecturer and there's so much material! It was a delightful, engaging course, and I'd recommend it to any Yale student, but especially anyone with an interest in China or Chinese :-)Perdue is clearly some sort of genius, and I sincerely wish I could spend weeks just listening to his lectures. He always keeps you interested with some song, video clip or quote, and he clearly knows his stuff. Probably my favorite lecturer so far at Yale!!",
    "You learn a lot and its almost mandatory to know something about China, so sure. But Credit\/D it as you won't get an A.",
    "It's an interesting overview of Chinese history from basically the fall of the Ming to current day China. It's useful if you want to hold an intelligent conversation about China and how it is the way it is.",
    "Definitely take this class if you want to understand anything about China.",
    "Pretty good course - definitely learned a lot, though lectures were sometimes scattered. Readings were good.",
    "This class is pretty disappointing. Perdue is a dry lecture. Even as someone who is extremely interested in China, I was still barely able to pay attention during the lectures. The readings are better, especially some of the primary sources. The exams were fair, but the papers were graded harshly.There are so many other China classes to choose from...shop it, but beware.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. I was taking it to get a rest-of-the-world credit, and I feel as though there must be better options. The lectures were really not good and were difficult to follow. The presentation of material was at times disorganized and at times shallow -- a coherent narrative of history barely emerged from lecture-to-lecture. Granted, the assignments in this course were not very hard, but you want to take a class that you at least enjoy going to day-to-day. If you're really interested in China maybe this class would be worth taking, but if you're looking for a rest-of-the-world credit I'd strongly recommend looking elsewhere.",
    "It was a great class and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in Asian history or just the history of world connections and interactions.",
    "The subject seemed very important to me, so I'm glad that I took this course. I came into it with very little understanding of China's past and feel like I'm leaving with a decent grip on it. The course itself, however, is nothing special for the history department. Professor Perdue's lectures can be a bit confusing and not the most well organized.",
    "If you're interested in Chinese History at all, take it. There are a lot of readings, but you don't have to do them all to get a decent grade. Also, pay attention to images in the PPTs and the video clips shown in class.",
    "Great class if you're interested in Modern Chinese History. Professor Perdue's lectures incorporate lots of fun elements like music and movie clips, and the workload is pretty light though there can be a lot of reading at times. Even more enjoyable if you take it Credit\/D like I did.",
    "I would recommend it if you want a comprehensive overview of the time period. I wouldn't say it's the most thrilling lecture course I've taken, but it definitely teaches you a lot if you go to lecture and do the readings. Basically take it if you're interested in the content, not the professor or teaching style.",
    "I would recommend it for a history major looking for an Asian class. Information was interesting and useful to the understanding of contemporary China.",
    "The class is a good class for History majors needing to fulfill distributional requirements and it's a good survey class. If you're expecting something amazing, this course isn't it, but the midterm and papers are easy, and the final isn't very difficult either (only 30%). There are a lot of readings on the syllabus but they're really not necessary to do well in the class (most of them are pretty interesting though so read them if you have the time). I'd recommend it to people who are interested in China, but if you already know a lot about it, you probably won't learn much more.",
    "Good survey class on modern Chinese history. Definitely a lot of reading though and it's a fast paced class.",
    "The class material itself is interesting, but it is taught really poorly. Perdue has quite literally taught us wrong information before. He went on for a significant part of a lecture about a dynasty which google was convinced was named something else, and has gotten particulars of events entirely wrong. He is also just a bad lecturer, not engaging at all, and will spend entire lectures talking about nothing. His lectures are very disorganized, and I get the strong feeling that he does not care one bit about this class. It's a real pity because the history is so important, I just wish they would get a better professor.",
    "An interesting look at modern Chinese history. Personally, I learned a lot in thiscourse and have a much better appreciation of China for having taken it. Professor Perdue is a bit idiosyncratic, but a very knowledgable guy with a This isn't very much homework beyond the readings, either.",
    "This is an amazing course if you are at all interested in Chinese History. The reading and material was very thought-provoking and relevant. The work load is ok, but the weekly reading responses were slightly tedious.",
    "I would take HIST 316 if you are interested in Chinese history at all- you will learn a lot about a very important subject. There is a lot of reading, but you don't have to do all of it, and much of it is interesting. Thoroughly prepare for the exams.",
    "Interesting survey of Chinese history, but tries to cover so much time that most subjects just get glossed over. Professor Perdue's lectures were interesting and the readings were generally good individually, but sometimes it was unclear how lectures connected to each other. The papers and the tests were all fair. Definitely learned a lot of interesting history, and eager to study various parts more in depth.",
    "The post-Ming history of China is one of the most fascinating and engaging topics of study related to history, and is also deeply relevant for a more complete understanding of modern China. This course offers excellent insight into important trends, events, and figures. The professor also helps students connect with a broad range of audio, visual, video, and written primary source material which helps to provide a richer level of engagement with Chinese history, people, and culture. The work is very manageable and the class provides fantastic insight. Take it if you have any interest in China and it's place in the world.",
    "Professor Perdue is clearly passionate about Chinese history, but he was a pretty boring and lackluster lecturer. His lectures felt kind of uneven and all over the place. Would not recommend, even if you Credit\/D like I did.",
    "A nice lecture, good readings, so so section.A solid lecture - not an inspiring one, but there's a great deal of quality information. I really came out of it feeling like I had a strong sense of what the class promised to teach, Chinese History. How often does that happen?No Civil War or Cold War or awe inspiring lecture voice, but the reading was really the ideal amount and a lot of it was truly quality. I was happy to take this course if not awed."
