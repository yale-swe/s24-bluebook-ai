    "Italian 120 brightened my every morning. I highly recommend taking this course and getting involved in the Italian department.",
    "You learn to speak Italian. Fast. Take it. It's so fun.",

    "I would definitely recommend it. Italian is a really fun language to learn, and you have the option of going to Italy, which is one of the most beautiful countries in the world!",
    "If you take italiano, you have to take this section! He is a fabulous teacher and will make italian a really enjoyable experience.",
    "YES. Favorite class of the semester! Wonderful--I loved it!",
    "Yes, Italian with Francesco is so much fun!"
