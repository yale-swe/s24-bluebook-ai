   "comments": [
    "The course is a definite recommend but, as I stated before, it is a course best taken during a year when he or she has a light courseload.My recommendation for this class also would be to any student who has sat through an algorithms course and has wondered why no numerical algorithms are ever discussed. The common response is, \"that subject is only taught in a numerical algorithms course.\" Well take the opportunity to study it.",
    "I would strongly recommend it, because it would give us an overall sight of numerical methods, and also the details of different methods.",
    "Yes I'll certainly recommend it to other students.The class contains lots of useful stuff.",
    "Yes. It has been recommended to my by everybody in my lab and I would do the same!!!",
    "This course covers several main topics that are essential for developing a foundation of knowledge in applied numerical methods. There are many topics that consist of large amounts of information covered throughout the course of the semester, which is often reflected in the required amount of work for weekly homework assignments. Nonetheless, the professor is great and the course is well done, therefore I would recommend the course.",
    "The course is a lot of work, but the instructor will always work with you if you have a busy week or two and need to hand in an assignment late."

    "This course has little to do with my research. I am interested in the subject matter.",
    "It gave me an overall sight of numerical methods, and also the details of different methods.",
    "This course greatly contributes to my own research because I need to write models or some similar staff that needs a lot of numerical computing.",
    "This course helped with an understanding of fundamental numerical methods algorithms as well as assumptions and conditions that must be satisfied to employ such methods. This will help with data analysis and computer programming necessary for my dissertation research."
