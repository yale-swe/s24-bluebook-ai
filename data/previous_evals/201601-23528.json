    "I wanted to work at DSS. I didn't get much face to face time but I was able to work on the policy projects I wanted to.",
    "Great opportunity to get hands on experience in the health policy realm. I didn't often meet with my preceptor, which was a mistake. However, he also was very busy with his work and did not have much time to interact with our practicum team. I don't mind independent work, but I felt slightly askew from the office for which we were working.",
    "A necessary component of any health policy student's education at YSPH. My placement was perfect and couldn't have requested anything further from Professor Geballe, or my preceptor.",
    "Getting hands on experience is always an amazing addition to a curriculum. The practicum was the perfect way to expand on our classroom learning and hone our policy skills.",
    "This is one of the most challenging experiences I have ever engaged in. It is also one of the best learning experiences I have had. It showed me how little I know and, also, that it is not impossible to learn something completely new. At the end of the practicum, I developed a confidence to tackle new fields.",
    "Very helpful course both for the student and the preceptor. I would imagine varying experiences due to different projects worked on but was overall a helpful and enlightening experience.",
    "The practicum was a good opportunity to apply skills I had gained through formal coursework to a real problem being faced by other public health professionals in action."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley does a great job of placing you with a preceptor on a project that aligns with your academic and professional interests. She is a great resource for any issues or concerns that arise during the experience.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0An unparalleled asset to YSPH and all who have the fortune of sharing even a moment with her. Ultimately, Professor Geballe is the reason why much of my cohort are glad they attended Yale.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is always amazing and helpful to everyone she has as a student. Her guidance in finding practicum sites and keeping updated with our work was endless and always useful.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0She's great! She provides timely feedback and cares about our professional and personal growth. She is not just a professor, she is a mentor and a wonderful confidante. I look forward to interacting more with her and staying in touch after YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe, as always was amazing. Her knowledge and passion for our experience and the work we were involved in was invaluable.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley was great and always available for questions, clarifications, or advice in the trajectory of the practicum project. It was great to have her on hand as a mentor."

    "Yes, take advantage of the connections that are available at Yale and get out there to do great work.",
    "It's the perfect opportunity to do a semester long internship, gain work experience, and do meaningful work!",
    "The term long practicum allows students to work with real world companies on exciting projects. I would definitely recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this experience for other students, but you should know going in that you have to be willing to take the initiative to connect with your preceptor (and perhaps guide the direction of your project if they're not as easily accessible) and take full responsibility for the timeline and course of your assignment."
