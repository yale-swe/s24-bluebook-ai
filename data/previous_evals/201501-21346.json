    "Great course that I would recommend.",
    "The course moves through the history of Buddhist traditions of mind and meditation, from the earliest suttas through Mahayana developments to the deepest philosophical traditions to contemporary practices from a wide range of schools. It also considers appropriations of Buddhist ideas and practices that can be dangerous for practitioners and which are in some cases proliferating in the western world. It is an excellent, fascinating, and comprehensive course. I would frankly recommend this course to any student from any academic field or professional school at Yale. These conceptions of mind and meditative practice are becoming increasingly important in work and personal spaces, and the emphasis on discursive justifications for interdependence and compassion are very much needed in today's globalized world."

   "comments": [
    "Reading Buddhist primary texts which I surprisingly had not done a substantial amount of thus far. Connection of primary texts to specific Buddhist meditation practice. Engaging in the larger conversation about Buddhism and its encounter with modernity.",
    "This course happens to be squarely within my discipline, and it provided invaluable background, perspectives, and studies of important texts in the field. But I noticed that students i peripheral fields were very interested and constantly applying the ideas to their own fields of study, which also helped to broaden my understanding of the subject matter. All in all the course was very helpful for my studies and in preparation for PhD work."
