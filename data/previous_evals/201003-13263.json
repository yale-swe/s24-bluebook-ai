    "While I learned a lot in this course, I think the readings were often a little too myopic and not wrapped into national trends or made relevant in the way that I would've hoped. I do feel that I have a deeper understanding of China today. But I also feel that a brief overview of history before contemporary times would've been useful to contextualize the rest of the course. This course is very heavy on the sociology so if that's not your thing, probably not the best course for you.",
    "East 186 offers a broad survey of modern China. Professor Davis is brilliant, and learning about her ideas and experiences alone make taking the class worth it. The readings are generally quite excellent, but unfortunately because most people didn't do the reading, discussions suffered. The workload is not particularly heavy (three 5-page research pieces, and a final), but organization was tough - because new readings were added to syllabus, at times I walked in unsure of what was due for a given day. All things considered, I recommend the class, but only if you are genuinely interested in modern China.",
    "Sociology 136 doesn't really teach you anything relevant about Contemporary Chinese Society. Don't take it.",
    "Not unless the course undergoes some much-needed reorganization, or if you're inherently interested in the material. And if you're a Chinese international, just don't-- you'd be way underplacing.",
    "This class is fairly interesting. There aren't a lot of assignments but there are a lot of readings. Professor is good. Take it if interested in the material.",
    "Yes--but only if they are interested in sociological aspects of contemporary China.",
    "If you're looking to understand Modern Chinese Society, take a Modern Chinese history course.",
    "Chinese Contemporary Society is a class that will provide one with an excellent overview of the past six decades of Chinese development. One will gain a solid understanding of a broad range of topics concerning China. Professor Davis was very enjoyable to speak with and her depth of knowledge concerning China was very inspiring.",
    "Take it if you're ready for a course that's more drudgery than excitement. The readings teach you a great deal - the lectures, not so much. Professor Davis tries very hard, though, and would probably be much better with a truly interested class. Make sure that the others in your group have something to say, or this class will just drag on with you unsure whether to pity yourself or Davis more.",
    "It was a pretty interesting \/ encompassing class about China. It's somewhat difficult to go into without any prior knowledge though.",
    "Yes I would. Know you're in for a lot of discussions (which you wouldn't expect from an intro course). Prof Davis is great though",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are really really interested in Chinese history after the 1950's.",
    "Yes and no; it's a good class, but you have to be interested in Chinese contemporary history. Oh, and do the readings for the class to get the most out of it.",
    "Take this course if you really want to understand China and current issues there better, but be prepared to do a lot of reading. It is impossible to do well in this course without doing all of the reading, and doing it carefully. If you're willing to put in the thought, though, it's a really worthwhile course."
