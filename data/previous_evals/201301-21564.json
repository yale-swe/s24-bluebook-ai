   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in learning Chinese. I ended up liking Chinese more than I expected, it's beautiful in its way and the characters (Hanzi) are unique and complex, which makes Chinese so interesting.",
    "If you are in Chinese L2, then you will have already taken L1 at Yale and don't need this recommendation. L2 is exactly the same, but even better since you have greater freedom of expression and don't have to memorize as many characters.",
    "This class is incredibly well taught, but be warned that it is a lot of work. There is homework every night, quizzes every day, and a lot of straight memorization. That being said, all of it is important and beneficial. There are no assignments that serve no purpose, which means there are also no assignments that you can afford to skip. While the curriculum is rigorous, the teachers are incredible and it really is worth the time if you are interested in the language.",
    "The class is great if you want to continue learning Chinese. The teachers are nice and you learn a lot. However, it is a lot of work.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only to people willing to make a large time commitment. Homework assignments are relatively short, but the time required to do well on the daily quizzes can really add up\/.",
    "You have no choice but to take it - it's a lot more advanced than L1. More work, grammar becomes difficult.",
    "It's great! Very similar to L1\/L2, but more challenging because you start to get into more complex grammatical structures. The material is designed to be relevant to a student hoping to travel to China, so it's really practical and helpful. There are units on food, weather, asking for directions, travel, airports, etc.",
    "A strong course. Heavy workload but consistent and thorough; never too much at once. A great course if you want to strengthen your chinese skills.",
    "Definitely, definitely, definitely take this! With some practice and hard work, you'll find yourself impressed with how much you've learned!",
    "The Chinese department at Yale is absolutely awesome. If you want to learn Chinese, this is the best place to start.",
    "This course is really well-organized and well-taught. Basically, it is a continuation of Chinese 110 (L1). Second semester, remembering characters and having daily quizzes become easier than first semester (also there are fewer new characters to remember). However, grammar gets a little bit harder. Course is structured the same way (5 tests, 2 orals, 1 presentation\/chapter).You will learn a ton of Chinese and most of the classes are really fun as well.",
    "Yes, take it.",
    "Absolutely. Best taught language at yale",
    "If you're looking into taking CHNS 120, chances are you've already taken CHNS 110 and have to take L2 to get credit for L1. The second semester is a bit more work than L1--the grammar you learn gets a bit more complex, and the memorized narrative presentations are longer--however, having already taken CHNS 110, it is much easier to get a feel for the \"system\" of how this class works and how much of a time commitment it requires."
