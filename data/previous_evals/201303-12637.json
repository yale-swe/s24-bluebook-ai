   "comments": [
    "Pretty elementary introduction to learning how to write essays. You get better at writing because you do a lot of it, but you do learn a lot about the topic.",
    "English 114 is a fairy standard, introductory English course. I highly enjoyed my section's topic and the people in the class and looked forward to going to class each day. It teaches you so much about how to write a good paper which will help in all courses in the future.",
    "Don't try to get around the writing requirement by taking non-english writing credits, take a legitimate english writing course to prepare you for writing at Yale.",
    "Take this course. Michael Gibbons is a fantastic professor who is willing to work with you to improve your writing. A good section of 114.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to a fellow student while warning them that it will be tough with a lot of work but it truly pays off.",
    "English 114 will essentially help you learn how to write papers and make claims, which will be very helpful in your career as a student.",
    "It was not what i expected. If you want to do a lot of papers on popular sports topics there isn't much opportunity for that until the 3rd paper. A lot of the assignments are very constricting."
