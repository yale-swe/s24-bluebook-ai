    "I had only taken bridge Latin classes up to this course, and so the workload of this class initially surprised me, but I wound up improving both my translating ability and my ability to think critically about the texts.",
    "This course improved my Latin reading abilities, due to the broad array of authors which were tackled. The theme of Didactic was a fascinating lens through which to view the texts."

   "comments": [
    "So many strengths Freudenburg is an incredible professor (some of the best classes consisted of him just talking and showing us pictures of plants, which was relevant, I promise), the sheer number of authors we read was impressive and interesting, assignments were difficult at times but doable. Main critique is that I wish time was spent in class discussing the supplemental (but nominally assigned) readings.",

    "Take this class!! Great for language requirement or just for fun. The real treat is listening to others' perspectives, since there were first years and grad students alike enrolled.",
    "I would recommend this course to students of Latin looking to read from a broad selection of authors over the course of a semester."
