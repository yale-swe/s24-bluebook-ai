   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend this course. Great discussions! Enjoyed the readings and the two smaller projects. Thought the use of woodblock prints in the course was great. Learned a lot about the visual culture.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in daily life in early Japan.",
    "I totally recommend this class if you like AWESOME SAMURAI TIMES. Because Tokugawa Japan is full of samurai.I do not recommend this class if you are a stickler for reading every word of the reading and having a super thorough, in-depth, scholarly discussion about every single one.I also do not recommend this class if you are a whiny little biatch who doesn't want to do ANY reading.",
    "Definitely recommend. If you don't know much about Japanese history, make sure to do some background reading.",
    "This is a great course. It basically consists of interesting readings every week, and each class is just a discussion of those readings. The main assignments are one biography or travelogue of a figure in 19th century Japan, a presentation on a piece of artwork from 19th century Japan, and a final paper. Totally manageable workload, and the material is really interesting. i would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar. Professor Drixler knows a lot about the subject, but he's also good at encouraging discussion and willing to sit back and let students work things out ourselves. The material is fascinating; I'm not usually a social history person, but the classes, which came in such thematic chunks as literacy, marriage and family, and travel, were well designed to offer multiple ways of looking at the material. The short paper and art source analysis were both fun projects, and Professor Drixler gets you thinking about the final paper early enough that it's fun rather than painful. Overall, a wonderful class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Great subject matter with a very good professor.",
    "This course focuses on life in Japan during the 19th century, during the end of the Tokugawa period and the start of the Meiji era. It concentrates on how everyday people lived and reacted to daily concerns. This is a great class to take if you want to learn about a society very different from our own, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about Japan. All the readings were very interesting and weren't too dense at all. I learned a lot both from the discussions and readings, and a trip to the Beinecke as well as the individual projects showed me all the great resources on Japan Yale has to offer. One doesn't need to know Japanese in order to take the class, so anyone interested should look into taking it. It quickly became one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale, and I would greatly recommend it.",
    "Definitely--if you're interested in the subject, this is a really great class. It was very well-organized--the syllabus was arranged following a lifecycle, which provided clear themes for each week and a clear trajectory for the course."
