    "The class was great. I was able to further develop my understanding of storytelling. The class is great in its current format.",
    "Its an enigma this class. Very cutting edge, and yet, very cryptic. The answer is there, but its not there. Perhaps there is no answer. Perhaps there was one but I missed it. We had so many different people come in talking about different things. I liked some, and perhaps less so for others. But its just personal preference, and its great exposure regardless. But I know this. You need very little to tell a story. You can tell stories visually in many many, many ways.",
    "I found this class to be thoroughly enjoyable as well as vital to increasing my visual acuity as a theological thinker in light of the iconoclasm and the post reformation\/enlightenment visual depravation. This class will serve me greatly in my work of reconciling art and theology.",
    "very interesting.",
    "My favorite guests this semester were John Conklin on opera in popular culture and the younger guy who came in to talk about cameras and photography (I failed to write his name down but also he would have been a great sub for Projection design). Possible ideas for future topics; fabric design (print design), architecture, puppetry, pigment and ink... how do we get paint and color, tapestry & weaving, art restoration... Some days were hit or miss but I take that to be the nature of the class. I think everyone connected to some lectures more than others. I love that Yale provides a class that is just about art as a whole.",
    "Wonderful Class"
