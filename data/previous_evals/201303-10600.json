    "Pretty straightforward review of grammar done in an organized way. I definitely feel more comfortable in my French now. Some units dragged on a bit but on a whole I felt the class was well structured. Professor Schlosser was great, both helpful and laidback. Overall a pretty solid continuation of French.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Though it was a lot of work, I really felt that I gained a lot from it. I enjoyed the pieces of literature we read, especially L'Etranger. If you are willing to work on French everyday, it won't be too bad. I was lucky to have such a fabulous instructor, but even those with other instructors also seemed to enjoy this course.",
    "I would recommend this course if a student wants to become better at french. It is a lot of work at times but is very manageable.",
    "I would advise everyone to take French 130. As my first French class at Yale I thought it was a wonderful introduction to French at Yale--I'm excited for French 140 in the spring!",
    "French 130 is an indepth review of French 120, for those of us who forgot most of it over the summer. There's a lot more reading, but they ease you into it and it is very doable."
