   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Great sequence\/ordering of topics and incredible resources Weaknesses - Moved very fast (especially around midterm season)",
    "Sudesh is the major strength of this course. Years of almost unanimously glowing course reviews do not lie. That said, the course does move pretty quickly, since it covers a lot of material, but it's not unmanageably fast.",
    "I think one of the greatest strengths of the course was the workbook that my section had. It made it so that students didn't have to waste time writing down theorems and problems and instead could focus on the actual content. While the course was very challenging, I don't think there were very many weaknesses. This is most definitely due to the fact that I was in Sudesh's section!",
    "Strengths - Sudesh is literally a godsend Weaknesses - As a non-math kid, it was hard to compete with the kids pursuing math\/physics, or kids who had already taken multi in high school",
    "The seminar style structure was good. The lecture packets handed out by my professor were very helpful and I found following along straight forward. Some concepts are tough but nothing that can't be learned through extra practice and office hours.",
    "It just moves very fast, and doesn't touch at all on applications of the information, which was a little discouraging.",
    "Math 120 is a really good class (with Sudesh), and honestly there were no weaknesses. It is super well organized, and the lecture notes are very helpful. Sudesh makes this class amazing and absolutely lives up to the hype.",
    "I think this course is great. Sudesh's workbooks and Ximera problems were extremely helpful and his teaching overall was amazing. I can't think of any improvements to the course.",
    "I authentically enjoyed this class. With Sudesh, it built on BC calc and itself so naturally. The concepts are interesting and kinda beautiful. The class itself is fair and well-structured, with the tests mirroring what youve seen in class and on psets. Ximera more than prepares you for the tests as well.",
    "Sudesh is amazing. His lecture notes are a huge help and very thorough. Ximera is also an incredible resource with tons of helpful videos and practice problems. That being said, there wasn't really any reason to go to class because of these amazing resources. I actually think this class could be taught as a recorded video lecture by Sudesh and then have an optional section to work on practice problems in groups.",
    "The only significant weakness is the lack of practical applications to the content, which makes the content sometimes too theoretical and dry.",
    "I think certain aspects of assessment are not ideal, namely true and false. Assessing students on their complete understanding shouldnt be left to a single true false statement, some explanation and thus partial credit should be warranted if a students intuition is demonstrated. Strengths are the course administrator, Sudesh - amazing teacher - and the breadth of material covered.",
    "Sudesh was an excellent teacher and always kept us engaged. The only thing I would change is the number of true\/false questions on exams.",
    "Strength: if you take it with Sudesh, material is presented very clearly, tons of resources\/ways to get help. Sudesh is just a god. Weaknesses: grading on tests can be tough at times, true\/false is annoying",
    "I think homework could be worth a little more, since the high percentage of the grade placed on testing could be anxiety inducing and affect performance.",
    "I think this course was extremely well taught by Sudesh Kalyanswamy. I especially enjoyed the interactive workbooks and feel that every section would benefit from having them.",
    "The strengths include the teaching. Sudesh is extremely good at making us grab the concepts and answering our queries. Furthermore the course packet is very useful since we do not lose time taking notes and hence can focus on the material correctly. Personally the course is well designed and I feel that even though for the final the amount of material to practice is huge, it was doable.",
    "The course covers a lot, and very quickly, this is both a strength and weakness.",
    "I thought that the workbooks made it much easier to keep the concepts grounded within one another, as I was able to flip to a previous lecture whenever I needed a reminder of prior knowledge to grasp a new concept. One weakness was the class attitude, particularly with group work. The room often felt hostile, and I think a discourse about underrepresented groups in STEM at the start of the course would have alleviated some of this.",
    "Strengths: material Weaknesses: Moves quickly, lots of variation between the instructors in terms of teaching quality.",
    "The course content may be a little dry at times, it really depends on the instructor to keep you engaged.",
    "Really well taught class overall!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Completely would recommend, especially with my professor Sudesh.",
    "Yes! I almost didn't take it, given all the horror stories about 120, but it honestly wasn't that bad. I didn't find it significantly more difficult than any other math class I'd taken. For background, I took AP Calc BC my junior year of high school and did multi as an \"independent study\" course my senior year, but I barely made it through a quarter of the material and definitely retained none of it, so I essentially went into 120 with only BC knowledge. Everyone says that you have to have taken multivariable to do well in this course, but I didn't feel like it assumed any background in multi. I'd even venture so far as to say that I actually enjoyed it more than most of my other classes. Basically, don't be afraid of 120 if you haven't taken multi. As long as you're willing to show up to class, put actual time into the psets (none of which took me more than 4 hours), and review the material before tests, you should be fine. Definitely take the class with Sudesh if you get the opportunity, however; I can only speak for his section, and I've heard that teaching quality varies considerably depending on which professor you get, so tread carefully on that front.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students who either need to take it for their major or who are really interested in learning higher level math. I would not take this course if you are just trying to get a QR credit. Do everything you can to get in Sudesh's section - he is an incredible professor!",
    "Exams are hard. If that is a deterrent, then so be it. You learn a lot and Sudesh is the best.",
    "If you want to learn multivariable calculus this is a solid course. Mileage does vary by professor. I was very happy with who I had.",
    "I would, it is a good next step in learning math, and the stuff you learn can be applied in any STEM field. Although the course goes fast and you don't really cover the applications at all, the knowledge is good to have, and the course is well organized.",
    "Please please take this class if you were lucky enough to get Sudesh in the lottery! I feel he has made me actually understand multivariable calculus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more math.",
    "If you have to take Math 120 (or even if you dont), take it with Sudesh. He is the most incredible teacher. He does so much to support his students, from the beautiful guided notes to the Ximera review videos to office hours to the extra practice problems and review sessions. Even if you dont do anything outside of showing up to lecture, you will succeed in the class hes that good of a teacher. (But would also recommend Ximera because Sudesh puts so much time into it and it really does prepare you for the exams exceedingly well.) Sudesh does a phenomenal job of tying MV concepts to BC calc concepts and also tying everything together at the end of the course. I feel like I have a really strong conceptual understanding of MV (and even an interest in MV) that I never thought Id have.",
    "I am a math person, so I had no trouble with this class. I do believe that it is objectively pretty difficult due to its pace and the level of the concepts. I don't really think anyone would take this unless it is required for a major or to advance to higher level math. If you need multi for your major I believe there are other options (Math 118 and an ENAS class), so don't stress about sticking with it if you shop and find this class to be difficult.",
    "Yes, I believe it is important to any student who considers doing something Math related.",
    "I would, its a hard course for sure but its extremely useful for higher level STEM down the line. Its all about the professor, if you get the right ones youre set. Look at course table for the go to names.",
    "Definitely would reccomend!",
    "Absolutely. This class has somewhat of a bad reputation, but if you can take it with Sudesh, the class isnt bad at all and you can learn a lot.",
    "Yes! It is fast paced, but extremely rewarding.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I learned so much!",
    "Yes since it gives one the skill of 3D visualisations and it deepens the knowledge on some calculus tools you can apply to subjects like physics.",
    "Yes - I came to this course with an interest in mathematics and without an intention of pursuing a STEM major. This was one of my favorite courses this semester, because the workload and pace were manageable and the content was engaging.",
    "Yes, if you're taking it with Sudesh. He goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material. Analogies, workbook, etc.",
    "Absolutely. I had an awesome teacher who really helped me understand multivariable calculus."
