    "yes. good continuation from the previous year if you are truly interested in japanese and japan as a language and culture.",
    "The top level of Japanese language study offered at Yale. The class involves more student led discussion than previous levels (presenting a news article or a self-written speech each week) and then long reading assignments (one short story at the beginning, and a lot of pieces about the nature of language and translation). It suddenly involves much less kanji testing than previous levels, which may be a relief to some people but was something I felt was missing to improve my reading level.",
    "Take it! Hiroe-sensei is the best: he's super-chill, funny and kind, though that doesn't mean you won't do anything in this class. Some assignments require research in Japanese and are thus pretty tough, though he'll help you with any questions you have. He's also flexible about turning in assignments, he understands how busy everyone is. Hiroe-sensei is knowledgeable about linguistics, history, literature, cooking, and tons of other things, which makes class discussions very engaging, and gives students leeway to pursue their interests through assignments."
