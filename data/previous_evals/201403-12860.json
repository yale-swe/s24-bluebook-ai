    "FREN 219 is a fascinating introduction into French literature of the 17th century. In addition to reading important texts of the time, you get to learn a great deal about the intellectual and religious movements of that time. The readings are manageable but the course can be pretty hefty at times (3 papers + 1 midterm + 1 presentation + 1 final paper). That being said, I am very glad I took the course. Readings, assignments, and discussion were all in French.",
    "The title says it all. A pretty good sampler of the good stuff - a play apiece by Moliere, Corneille, Racine; the maxims of Rochefoucauld; La Fontaine; Princesse de Cleves. Like most French classes, your experience is going to depend a lot on the language of everyone else in the class. The reading list is hard to beat.",
    "It's great. It's hard and not what you would expect but definitely a different type of french literature. This course provides an excellent base to understanding and analyzing a lot of french literature."
