    "Yes, I would recommend the course to improve your writing skills.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wants to receive a worthwhile writing credit and is willing to make a time commitment to developing their writing skills.",
    "Definitely take this class. Your writing will improve a lot, and the essays you read are so interesting. You'll learn to love writing.",
    "Without doubt, English 120 09 has been one of the most enriching experiences I've had at Yale. Within a week of the course, your creative writing ability will increase exponentially; you'll look back on older pieces with amusement. The alternating weekly rough and final drafts will make you curse Thursday nights; by the end of the semester, I gave up the possibility of more than three hours of sleep. Yet it's definitely worth it, especially with effective time management. Advice: go to weekly office hours. My best pieces came into being largely thanks to brainstorming sessions with Dr. Stuart. Also, go to the visiting writer events for English 120. The writers are fascinating and you'll even get a day's extension! The pieces you read are also fascinating and although seminar discussions can get a bit dull at times, they're usually engaging. Taking English 120 is a definite must at some point in your Yale experience.",
    "Yes! Great course if you want to improve your writing and not have a lot of reading.",
    "English 120 lives up to the hype. Absolutely. If you love writing, want to read and study pieces by some great authors (assigned reading is low in quantity, high in quality) improve significantly over the course of the semester and get a good idea of how your writing can improve even further, definitely take 120. Just probably not at the same time as 2 or more other writing courses.",
    "Take it, but it may be one of your harder courses for the semester (ie work-intensive).",
    "I would highly recommend taking English 120. This is a fantastic class and your writing will absolutely improve. If you can take it with Professor Stuart. The readings she chose were very interesting and I definitely feel that my writing has improved as a result of her instruction.",
    "Definitely take it!! It's a lot of work but worth it!"
