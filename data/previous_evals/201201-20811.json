    "This is a very useful course. It mainly covers Internet infrastructure design.",
    "Recommend. I think this is a cool course. Network is attractive.",
    "I would recommend it to students interested in computer networks, and who has adequate time.",
    "It covers all layers of network, focusing on the design with helpful and engaging assignments. Recommended for all CS majors!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in networking, or who thought they might need to know the fundamentals of internet protocols like UDP, TCP, IP, BGP, etc. I would caution that the professor is hard to understand sometimes, and to pay close attention so you don't miss anything.",
    "Yes, I will recommend it. CPSC 533 is a very good choice for students who want to learn something about network, can they will really learn something if they choose it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because it is taught very well and the assignments help you learn a lot about how the Internet functions and helps you think about how you would implement your own protocol ideas.",
    "Take this class. This is the material that you want to learn.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in computer networks. However you need to be comfortable with coding as there are programming assignments."

    "This is a class that is extremely helpful in terms of filling a knowledge gap most cs students have. This is the class that helps you get a job at Google or microsoft .",
