    "Yes. It's a great way to learn the language without that much work.",
    "Good class. Worth taking if you need to finish your distribution.",
    "Expectations are obviously higher than L1\/L2, but still the same laid-back environment with an emphasis on conversation. Seema and Swapna really want to see you do well and learn Hindi.",
    "This class wasn't as good as L1 or L2 but it was manageable and it was nice to continue to practice Hindi in an academic setting.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class!",
    "A beautiful language but a disorganized course where I feel like I've learned nothing.",
    "The quizzes are much harder than those from L1 and L2, but still a fun and enjoyable class.",
    "I would recommend Hindi 130 to a fellow student if the student is interested in learning to speak Hindi. The teachers really careabout the class although it is a little disorganized.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody that took the first two semesters of Hindi and enjoyed it enough to contemplate a third."
