   "comments": [
    "I would recommend any course by Don Kagan to anyone ever. This class will show anyone why the humanities matter in life.",
    "Kagan is wonderful and engaging and smart. The subject isn't the most riveting one in the world, but he makes it matter. His retirement is a great loss for the University, and I was honored to be in his last class. As a man, a scholar, and a professor, he is unbeatable.",
    "I would highly highly recommend it. It is such a pity it has to come to an end.",
    "The best class that I have taken at Yale. Learning directly from Professor Kagan was an experience that I will never forget. The subject matter was also incredibly interesting, and I wish I could've taken more of his Greek history seminars.",
    "really, the best class at Yale. The most effectively taught class at Yale; the nicest professor at Yale; the best historian at Yale. I'm sorry there're no more opportunities to take a course from him.",
    "I apologize to all who read this evaluation but no longer have the privilege to study with Donald Kagan. Thucydides and the Peloponnesian War was the greatest seminar I ever took in my life, better than every seminar the History Department offers. Professor Kagan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s insight, warmth and humor are unmatched among faculty. He is a \u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00b9\u00ce\u00bb\u00cf\u008c\u00cf\u0083\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0086\u00ce\u00bf\u00cf\u0082 in the truest sense of the word: Only his love of students, Yale, and football compare to his love of wisdom.As he concluded our course and his decades-long career, \u00e2\u0080\u009cVivat Yale.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
    "What an experience to have been part of Prof. Kagan's last course! Almost as good as an amphibious landing.Gender balance could have been better; wish there had been more engagement with contemporary methods of Thucydides scholarship.",
    "I would recommend the class especially if you are a history major. The material is really interesting.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend the course to another student. It is sad (but very understandable) that it won't be taught again. The course is a thorough review of the Peloponnesian War using ancient texts (primarily Thucydides). It is seminar style."
