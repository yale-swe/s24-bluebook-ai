    "7c. The TA's were amazing. They held discussions, office hours, and answered emails quickly and thoroughly. Just awesome.",
    "Everyone should take this course. This information is extremely valuable to anyone interested in working with environmental issues.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. I would even consider making it mandatory for FES students. Esty is an excellent communicator of the material. The TA's were both phenomenal - they deserve a tremendous amount of credit.The only recommendation I would make - for the exam, consider making the policy questions \"take-home\", with word limits. Then, give more time in the exam for the issue spotter. The time constraints made it difficult to really think about how the law could be applied in the issue spotter in innovative ways.Great course though - delighted I took it.",
    "TAs are wonderful, they are the best!",
    "excellent class, every FES student should be required to take this class or some version of it. honestly one of the very best! material very useful, presented well, structured well. Prof Esty gives great lectures, very engaging.",
    "This course is important for everyone at FES and recommend it highly. The instructor is exceptional and insightful while the TA are very helpful.",
    "There is no way one can do any environmental work without knowing the legal framework, dos and don't, and the lawyer's lingua. Just take the class and the TAs are GREAT",
    "The TA helped us a lot!!!!!!!! I couldn't learn so much without their help.",
    "Margaret and Nate rock! They learned everyone's name in the class (about 70 people) and really knew their stuff!",
    "Excellent course. One of the best i've taken. The TAs were crucial to success of the course. The midterm, although useful, its too long for the time that we are given.",
    "If you want to know environmental law in the US, you've got to take this class. Period, end of story. The amount of reading is very heavy but that's because you're not just reading outlines of the statutes and cases, you're reading the actual documents. And you cover just about every environmental statute as well as the caselaw and legal foundations for environmental law. The pace of the class is fast and exams are very stressful because you realize how hard it is to commit all this stuff to memory. Dan is reasonably responsive to questions and suggestions, and a very good (no powerpoint!) lecturer.",
    "Qu 4: Too much information to memorize for only 2 opportunities to demonstrate what we have learned.",
    "I wanted to say that the sessions with Nate Freeman were great. He really helped to cut through the material and present it in a very meaningful way. I was lucky to have Nate as my TA.",
    "The professor did not seem very accessible. Also, the professor did not cover most of the reading material in class. Although readings were extensive in breath and depth, class time could have been more productive.",
    "Nate was the best TA I've ever had, and I've had great TAs.",
    "I have to say that this has been one of my favorite classes so far at Yale!",
    "7.Nate was great.Margart was good, but at times, she was hard to understand.",

If you are going to be an environmental and natural resource practitioner, it is an essential component to your academic preparation.Dan is a well-informed, well-prepared professor with incredible public speaking skills!Students can truly enjoy this course...one can tie the knowledge gained throughout the course to a number of environmental issues one presently reads or hears in the news."

He lays everything out in a very textbook-y way which is super valuable for those just getting started in environmental law and policy related work.We learned an incredible amount over the course of the semester - sometimes felt like drinking from the firehose but, damn, I got a lot out of it. I",
    "Everyone should have to take this class, in my opinion. It's directly useful to SO many environmental jobs, and it seems ridiculous to go through a master's program at an environment school without learning the basics of your country's environmental laws.",
    "Learning the current state of US environmental law, particularly the statutory considerations that state, local, and federal governments as well as private entities have to make.",
    "This was an excellent course. The professor and TAs did a great job.",
    "The content.The teacher is very knowledgeable on the subject, has taught the class many times before and does a great job (if a bit on automatic pilot at times).",

    "comprehensive introduction about US envl law",
    "-professor - level of teaching very high quality, much better than many other profs. Prof Esty presented material really well - interesting and relevant to both fes and law students...gave his own spin and made us think about improving current laws, not just learning the details.",

    "Esty is a great lecturer--amazing clarity and presentation of the material. I also think this is a course that should be required of all Forestry students--it's essential to understand the material presented in this class, and I learned so much.Also, Margaret and Nate are among the best TAs I have ever had--as an undergrad at Yale and now as a masters student. Their committment to the course and to us was inspiring and appreciated. I can't speak highly enough about these two. They were available any time we needed them through weekly discussion sections, following up on questions, and answering emails.",

    "Lectures often jumped around so it could be hard to lay out my notes in a way that flowed logically. The course includes both facts\/legal structures and concepts and background info which could sometimes be hard to integrate.",
    "Moves really fast. He assigns so much reading that it's hard to get done! Especially for non-law students that have a hard time understanding legal jargon.",
    "The course is great. It's really hard, but that's not really an area of improvement.. haha. Tough learning curve, learning to read cases and law material when you're not used to it, and there is a LOT of reading.",
    "I would prefer more of a focus on statutory and agency workings, and case law - how things get done - do philosophizing on the nature of environmental law and policy. Which is not to say that there should be no grander thinking, but rather that it became repetitive.",
    "Outlines for the casebook. we should distribute one to go with the 2009 Percival.",
    "The textbook is dense for someone not familiar with the language, the style and someone who does not know what to look for and skim through the less important paragraphs. Nothing anyone can do anything about.The TA's did great in preparing the Forestry students on how to study for a law exam but even more of that would have helped.",
    "The pace was too fast and the content was so condensed.There was too much reading!",
    "workload is pretty heavy",
    "-honestly, NONE!",
    "I think, the course is a little more demanding and covers a lot in one semester.I would say, it should taught in two semesters.",
    "For international student like me it was a struggle for a bit. The mid-terms came as a shock for me and its very different from the exams i was used to. The international TA sessions were extremely helpful. However, the pace of the class and readings are bit too much to catch up.",
    "Testing - timing of tests doesn't need to be so rushed, or perhaps should be scheduled take-home. If mainly testing policy creativity and issue-spotting, no need for it to be in-class, closed-book, really. Less stress and more focus on the true learning otherwise.",
    "The amount of material that is presented in a semester. I almost believe that the course should be taught over two semester. This would allow for familiarization with the material, as well the development of higher thinking with the new material (as is required on the exams for the policy section).",
    "It would be good to have discussion about policy improvements. Not simply lectures and the time that we are given during exams. If we are really expected to think about how policies should be improved then this should be a part of the class or at least the discussion sections. This would give a chance to students to think through the materials and also their ideas.",
    "It would be great to allow notes on exams--apparently lots of other law school classes do, and cramming all the details of case names and statute sections into my brain left much less space for thinking about policy problems.",
    "Distilling the information. Discussion sections should not be used to squeeze in additional infromation not covered in class.",
    "I would have liked the course to have fewer students just to have a bit more discussion in lecture, but I would not want to deprive anyone of the opportunity to take this course.",
    "Class discussions need to be structured in a more useful way.",
    "We had mid-term evaluations and I thought what was most needed was more of a discussion in section, which the TAs worked to incorporate.I also really appreciate the non-powerpoint lectures of Esty--don't ever change!",
    "- Early morning schedule (8:30 am...I would recommend changing it to 9:00 am)- Order of taught laws and policies in class schedule (I would recommend moving from the most simple (NEPA, etc.) to the most complicated (RCRA and CERCLA)"

In his review sections, he really strived to have a dialogue about the subject matter in a meaningful and helpful way. Very respectful of all ideas. Always a prompt response to emails. This course would have been poorer without him.",

This was a hugely valuable course for me because it laid out the fundamentals of environmental law and policy in one semester. I can't imagine a better foundational course forpeople with my interests. I had no idea what the current structure was like, how laws were enacted, who decided what, what precedents had been set and why, how certain tools could be used to battle climate change and why others couldn't etc. All hugely helpful and I'll bet I'll be referring to my notes and the book for some time.",
