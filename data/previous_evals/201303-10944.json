   "comments": [
    "This is a great introductory exposure to early Russian history, which is a subject that is not taught often enough! Professor Bushkovitch's lectures are very informative and interesting; however, be warned that he cannot find TFs who are familiar with the subject matter. So instead of having discussion section, he has 75 minute class periods and tries to have discussion about the reading during the last 25 minutes of class (which is occasionally a bit painful). However, the lectures themselves are great, and while the reading load can be heavy at times, there are almost no actual assignments- simply a midterm, book review, and final exam!",
    "By far my favorite course of the semester - and I'm not a history major, nor am I planning on taking many more history classes. The area of history is fascinating because nobody really learns that much Russian history besides the revolution period. Prof Bushkovitch is the man. He is one of the leading scholars in the field, making his lectures amazing, in addition to the fact he has a very funny sense of humor. The fact that this course is less popular means that he makes it almost seminar style by sitting around a round-table with you and taking questions and discussing readings. Fair amount of reading, but I didn't really keep up and I wasn't really at a disadvantage.",
    "Its a history class that covers a long period of time so it is mainly an overview and not too in depth. Its a very interesting class that gives a history normally not talked about, despite the importance of Russia.",
    "The class is very interesting and is a very thorough overview of pre-Modern Russia. Keep up with the reading as Prof. Bushkovitch likes to discuss the reading at the end of the class. The assessment is relatively easy and this is a very low stress class. Bushkovitch is a great instructor.",
    "The lectures give you breadth (you cover a lot of history in a semester) and the readings give you depth. Took it credit\/D which I think was a good call. Readings got dense. Lectures were useful and lacked BS. All in all I'm happy with the class. Professor Bushkovitch is a great speaker and has a dark sense of humor which fits the history quite well.",
    "Yes. It is a pretty easy history credit, but definitely keep up on the reading.",
    "This course got great reviews last year. I'm not entirely sure why- lectures (and readings) get a bit dry. Take it if you have a pre-existing interest in Russia.",
    "Definitely take this course",
    "Do not take this class. Boring, hard, and a ton of work.",
    "Absolutely. A ton of material but extremely rewarding to understand such a swath of history from such an interesting country. You need to be able to take copious notes and pay attention every lecture, but Bushkovitch covers the material in very comprehensible packets and clear themes emerge. The exams test your knowledge, but if you're reading and paying attention, it's easy to demonstrate your grasp of the material.",
    "I would highly recommend a course in Russian history, as it is somewhat of a forgotten region, caught between Asia and Europe. Through this course, you learn about the history of other nations and races as well: the Byzantine Empire, the Mongols, the ethnic groups in the Caucasus, and the European Enlightenment. I realized once I was taking the class how little I knew about the evolution of the country. The course begins with Kievan Rus and continues through the reign of Catherine the Great. The reading of many primary texts, beyond textbooks, led to an enhanced understanding of the Russian people. I was originally daunted by the quantity of information covered, but Professor Bushkovitch is a fair grader with realistic expectations. He has a great sense of humor and a clear passion for the field, which evidences itself in the classroom environment. I appreciated how Professor Bushkovitch continually pointed out areas that demanded further research, encouraging students to explore the possibility of pursuing the study of Russian history. The only unsatisfactory element was the end-of-term book review, which felt limited in scope.",
    "Absolutely take it. Early Russian history is fascinating, and quite different from any other history I'm familiar with."
