   "comments": [
    "I was not the biggest fan of presenting on the same topic from many different perspectives as I dont think there was enough variance...possibly there could be different cases assigned to each group instead? Also, the final project was tough too --- maybe similar structure with option of cases.",
    "I walked away from the course with many key concepts that I will bring with me to my job. I really enjoyed going through the cases as a discussion tool. Though I am not a management student, I felt like I learned a lot.",
    "excellent! extend the management theories to real workld case studies",
    "Strengths: cases, group presentations, literature, group work, classes are very interactive, extra TA sessions(weakness: size of class could be smaller)",
    "strengths: I love the case-based course. Everything we discuss seems incredibly relevant and practical. I feel like a learned a lot of really valuable skills.",
    "StrengthsGreat format. All cases and I found that very engaging. The class is based a lot on students participation and its more like a discussion so you sort of understand the process behind coming to certain conclusions about the case.WeaknessThe midterm and final presentations were too 20mins but each team had 7-8 people on the team which made it difficult to divide the work and present all the things.For the finals we had to come up with a case of our own and analyze a health care institution decision based on the class concepts, but again because of lack of time nobody got to present well and the other people in the class had very little time to understand anything.",
    "Comprehensive review, but I did not find the case format to be very engaging.",
    "Strengths-The cases are the strength of the class. The case topics are relevant and the supplemental readings are very helpful albeit sometimes lengthy.",
    "Strength - Breadth of healthcare topics, application of economic and management models, class engagementWeakness - nothing!",
    "This course is great. I learned so much, both material wise, but I also feel like I learned a new way of thinking. This will definitely be one of the classes I look back on at YSPH as the most valuable.",
    "course had some interesting topics and readings throughout. The cases were good, but it did not feel like a capstone class. It may have helped to have more guidance on the projects and a more clear understanding of what concepts applied to the different cases.",
    "Strengths: integrating previous coursework, variety of cases, use of supplementary frameworks\/ problem-solving techniques\/ evaluative metricsWeaknesses: missed class assignment is way too onerous (case questions would've been sufficient), need to better integrate the TA sessions scheduling-wise, final written case assignment should have been released at the same time as the group assignment because 1 week right after the group presentation was not enough time and very stressful amidst other classes, class felt 30 minutes too long - slides could be divided up in some way or posted on Classes*V2 as \"wrap ups\" after class.",
    "Lots of topics covered but not very in depth",
    "Was very much needed to tie in all the different classes taken at SOM and YSPH- this class really made the HCM curricula coherent.",
    "Really great class, case based. Discussion can get mechanical, but it helps to learn the frameworks",
    "Strengths - great topics, great group discussions.Weakness - not enough time left for professors thoughts and takeaways at the end of lectures."

    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0I liked that Professor Nembhard kept the course discussion-based, but appreciated that we had access to her slides that contained the main concepts. Sometimes I felt like the same people were called on to make a comment multiple times before I was called on.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0100\/100!",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Strengths: very kind instructor, very good teaching\/presentation styleWeaknesses: none",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is an incredibly strong facilitator of conversation. She is highly professional and has a lot of really interesting knowledge to share. She is incredibly well informed about all of the latest research for each topic we cover.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Great instructor. Very easy to talk to if you did not understand something. The only suggestion would be to have more time oriented structure in the class as for some classes I felt we didn't get through all the material in time and most of the classes went overtime.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is passionate about the material and this shows in class. She is organized and the flow of material and class structure reflects this. It is easy to tell that she strives to use techniques which aid in translation of the material. She is very knowledgeable but friendly and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is in the top 5% of the professors that I have had at Yale.She is smart, engaging and fair.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Professor Nembhard is a fantastic professor. She's a great presenter and all the classes are so well prepared and so well-structured. The readings and assignments she chooses are relevant and informative. However, I do think that Professor Nembhard picks favorites in the class (or based on past classes\/interactions) and this shows in who she is more likely to call on, have favorable interactions with, etc. This is really frustrating for other students in the class. I wish she would work on this because it takes away from what is otherwise, a fantastic job as a professor.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid was great and knows how to synthesize different concepts together to present the material. It was difficult to gather relevant information from the slides since we went through them so quickly at the end of each class.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Strengths: Enthusiasm, knowledge of topics, strong class facilitation (leading by example)Weaknesses: grade deductions for group presentation assignments seemed somewhat arbitrary",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Ingrid is extremely organized and engaging",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Very charming, but would like more in depth analyses of topics covered in class",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0Awesome- breaks information down into chunks, makes very difficult decisions easy to discuss and decide upon. Respects students' opinion well and role models effectively the manner that should be employed to deal with management situations effectively.",
    "Instructor: Ingrid Marie Nembhard \u00a0she is excellent, one of the best at YSPH and makes this a true capstone fir HCM students",

    "This course reviews, and calls for the application of, various management and policy concepts. The course is case based, and students come prepared having read the case and relevant readings. There are two case write-ups and two group presentations. I would recommend this course to any students who want a list of key management tools to walk away from their MPH with.",
    "Probably the best course that I have taken at YSPH",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Between this course and howie formans course at the school of management, there are no two better classes to truly learn about the healthcare industry",
    "Yes highly recommend it to everyone",
    "A great capstone course. Geared more towards School of Management and Health Care policy students but is very applicable to APMPH students as well. The course requires advanced preparation in the form of case readings weekly. There are 2-3 groups projects and written case analysis exams. I highly recommend this course to any MPH student. Regardless of your background, I would recommend this course-it contains very valuable, relevant material.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that plans to be a healthcare provider, device\/pharma, payer, and\/or plan leader.",
    "I would recommend this course to others. It is an excellent overview of relevant topics in health care management.",
    "I would recommend it, but i would also say to stay on top of the readings and try to get a better understanding of howcore YSPH\/SOM healthcare courses applied to this course.",
    "A course that examines a breadth of current day issues faced by health care managers and administrators, consultants, policymakers, and providers.",
    "This course is very interesting and practical",
    "Even with management background this class was not in depth enough.",
    "Excellent!",
    "Great course overall, example of quality teaching at the school",
    "An overview of the biggest topics in American healthcare today. Very well done. Would recommend it."
