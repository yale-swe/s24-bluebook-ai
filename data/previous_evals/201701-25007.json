    "New approaches to tackling Development",
    "This course was amazing In that it taught me how to critically evaluate and approach the field of social enterprises through a rigorous case study and discussion based approach.",
    "I learned how to study and evaluate the impact that social enterprises have on the countries in which they exist. More than any tangible skills I gained, I saw a path for a career in business and consulting that would truly promote positive change in the world around us.",
    "This is one of the best courses on offer at Yale. It taught me to understand business fundamentals, impact investing, and social entrepreneurship. More importantly, it taught me to understand the power of market-based solutions in solving societal problems.",
    "Hands down the best class I have taken at Yale. Bo is the BEST and the knowledge combined with the experience are invaluable.",
    "This Ian a two semester course so i will give a complete review in the fall",
    "This class aided in my critical thinking and exposed me to a format of analysis for business structures.",
    "Insights into the world of social enterprises and market based means for development. I gained a greater understanding of impact investing, taking enterprises to scale, hybrid profit\/nonprofit business models, approaching major development challenges.",
    "I developed an in depth understanding of how to read cases in the business world. I also developed a more nuanced appreciation for the complexity of solving real world problems in seemingly ethical, fair and effective ways. It was a very eye opening and illuminating course.",
    "Insights about the world of social enterprise, as well as the power (and challenges) of market-based solutions to poverty"

   "comments": [
    "Prof Hopkins is by far the best professor I've ever had and his enthusiasm and passion for teaching the course really comes through and forms a strong foundation for the course. in terms of improvements, nothing comes to mind at the moment.",
    "I thought overall the course was taught very well. I still think that more connections with faculty\/social entrepreneurs would benefit the students greatly. For example, in developing my summer project, it would have been great to have professor facilitated conversations with other Yale faculty\/business school professors to aid in our development.",
    "This is one of the best courses on offer, and the instructor does an excellent job at facilitating discussion, while at the same time, teaching us something new every day. The best thing about this course is the practical skills that it imparts us. By working this summer for a social enterprise, we get the chance to put our knowledge into practice, and our learning is augmented.",
    "One strength of the class is that is is designed much more like a practicum than an undergraduate class. Throughout the course, you are working with a team of students side by side with an outside enterprise engaged in social entrepreneurship. This is extremely practical and the summer project gives you real, on the ground experience.",
    "I think the course did a great job of linking what we were studying to the real world. I also think the resources provided during the course were particularly helpful. It has shaped significantly the ways in which i address problem solving."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, take this course if you are interested in new approaches to development and both the ethical and business challenges that go hand in hand with social enterprises.",
    "Yes, this class what great. Bo is really passionate and friendly, and this is a class with real life application. The trip to Africa is also a great perk.",
    "200% YES! Highly recommended Overall the course is very well taught, discussions are moderated well, and it's a immensely engaging educational opportunity.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is truly interested in how social enterprises work in developing countries. If you aren't truly passionate about the subject (or don't think you would be) then this course would be a waste of time. Be willing to dedicate your summer to a project and be open to working on that project with a group of Yalies. This is a pretty team based class which will only be as good as the other students involved.",
    "This is one of the best courses on offer. Bo is an incredible instructor- he's fun, engaging, knowledgeable, and passionate. Regardless of what anyone's major is, this is one course everyone MUST take.",
    "100% absolutely - if you can get in, and you can make the time in the summer, take it. No question.",
    "Absolutely. A great way to learn a lot about the field of social enterprise.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in social enterprises and private sector solutions to international development.",
    "This class is a good business school overview and the extras (trip for summer) make it worthwhile although the class itself is not intellectually stimulating.",
    "Yes. Definitely. Bo is one of the most engaging professors I've met at Yale and also one of the most good natured. He really is a gem.",
    "Yes. After taking this course, I've been inspired to eventually start my own social enterprise!"
