   "comments": [
    "Whether or not you will find this class worthwhile will probably depend on your background in Spanish coming into the course. For me, this class was useful but not really transformative. I had taken extensive Spanish in high school, including AP Lit. I felt that my conversational skills were pretty rusty after many literature classes that were not very intensive, so I really wanted the opportunity to brush up on my speaking skills. I think this class definitely helped me to recover and maintain my conversation abilities, but I don\u0092t think it in the end really ended up enhancing them in any way. This is an easy\/appropriate class to take if you are looking to fulfill your language requirement. If you really want to perfect your conversational skills, this might be a good place to start, but it meets infrequently enough and involves little enough work that you probably won\u0092t make great strides.",
    "Yes. It's a fun and easy class. The reading is not the msot interesting you'll ever do in your life, but it's interesting enough.",
    "Don't expect to learn much grammar in this class, but do expect to be graded still on grammar skills. Also, it is a good attempt for improving conversation skills but in the end, it's all up to you.",
    "If you are going to take L5, take it with another professor. Teresa Carballal is a very strict grader, and your spanish won't improve much with her. Ame Cividanes or other spanish professors are fair graders and you will have a great time in their classes!",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course. I entered the course with an ability to understand, read and write with proficiency in Spanish. However, my previous Spanish courses had not focused on speaking skills. I feel this course helped me make great strides in my speaking ability. Therefore, I would recommend it to any other student seeking to improve his or her spanish oral skills. In fact I already have recommended the course to several friends.",
    "This is a great class for those who want to continue with Spanish and finish their language requirement but don't feel like taking a specifically focused class. Topics discussed range from legal issues to the environment to science fiction. Readings are not too difficult, writing assignments are every week are so, and the quizzes are doable - overall, as long as you participate adequately you will do fine. Carballal is a great teacher and she makes the whole thing enjoyable!",
    "It is a perfect class for those who have a high level of spanish but are not yet fluent. I would recommend taking this class",
    "Yes take it if you want to maintain your Spanish or improve it. Emphasis on conversing and reading though. If you want to perfect your grammar, don't take it. There's not too much on high level grammar.",
    "Yes i would recommend this course to another student.",
    "It's a fairly painless way to keep up with your spanish in class discussions motivated by short but fairly interesting readings and generic political debates. Never felt that I improved that much in the class, but it's tough to measure against how much I would have lost had I not taken it. There is weekly written homework that takes some time, but work besides that is fairly light. Teresa is a great teacher, btw.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student interested in improving his Spanish proficiency. It's a fun, pretty easy, and engaging course."
