   "comments": [
    "This is a great class for strongly history-oriented people. English majors not obsessed with history might be disappointed. Also, had either prof. taught it alone it would have been much better. Together they contradicted each other, had discussions between the two of them in front of the class, and failed to really relate their material to that of the other.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend ENGL 262 to another student if it is offered again! The opportunity to take a class with two amazing professors is second to none and ENGL 262 was definitely one of my favorite courses this semester. As an English major who was also considering being a History major, the combination of both the \"historical\" and the \"literary\" was very much in line with what I am interested in. The themes that we explored as a class were also incredibly thought-provoking (e.g. the question of historical vs. personal agency, the role of memory vs. the prophetic, the fictional vs. the non-fictional) and I am very happy that I had the opportunity to engage in such a unique junior seminar. The tennis match dynamic between both professors was also worth watching in itself (and made for some very entertaining class moments).",
    "I would recommend this class to students interested in close literary analysis of certain historical fictions (Waverly, A Tale of Two Cities, Romola) and historical writings. The class touches on the history of Britain and France in the 19th century, but the focus is on the close reading of the works themselves. Take a look at the syllabus and take it if you are very interested in the readings.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I don't feel that I grew as a student and writer. There were some great discussions, but, for the most part, the professors asked very specific questions that made it difficult to really talk about the material, and the class was mostly about trying to figure out their readings of the text, rather than coming up with your own ideas. Some readings were amazing, but others were incredibly boring, and it was sometimes hard to see the relationship between the assignments. For this reason, some classes were fantastic, but others were decidedly not fantastic. For me, there is no reason to take an English class that you don't love or that doesn't push you intellectually. This class did neither. Overall, I just didn't enjoy the experience.",
    "Yep!",
    "This course allows you to enter into the mind of 19th century England. The lives of past actions are embodied in these texts. They congeal in a way to give you not just a sense of the past, but all the preoccupations and feelings that come along with it. It heightens and expands what it means to learn history."
