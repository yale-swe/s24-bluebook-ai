   "comments": [
    "I definitely recommend the course as a great window into contemporary theater, which is helpful for a professional career, but also as a different way to apply more intellectual approaches to pop culture.",
    "Great seminar with very relevant material for anyone looking to go into theater in any capacity. Reasonable courseload and usually fascinating reading\/viewing. Professor Robinson is so smart and brings great insight to the discussions. Take it!",
    "Yes. Take it. A must take for anyone who cares about theater and is looking to pursue it further after college. Just an incredibly enriching class. My mind was expanded leaps and bounds in terms of what's actually going on right now in the theater world. Just the best syllabus too and a brilliant professor. What a class. Do the reading though!",
    "Great review\/survey of contemporary theater, both playwrights and experimental groups. It will broaden your theatrical horizons and make your knowledge\/opinions relevant.",
    "Awesome reading list. Marc Robinson is fun\/ funny. Opens up your mind to a lot of different ways of thinking about performance.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it if you want to learn about what's happening in the theater world now. I loved this course.",
    "Take this class if you have any intention of entering the theater in any capacity. It's a must for understanding what is happening right now from a practical standpoint as well as a theoretical one. Also just a fascinating and fun seminar.",
    "Readings more of experimental theater than \"Theater Now\" more broadly - the New York theater scene is heavily represented. Again, everyone in the class tends to be really into the material so discussion is lively. Lots of reading of plays, but fun reading mostly.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken in the TS major. Marc is pretty universally beloved and respected as a seminar professor for being approachable and occasionally awkward (in the best, most self-conscious way) - and then absolutely brilliant. The reading for this class doesn't even count as work because it's almost all shocking and excellent, or just thought-provoking at worst. Great discussion in seminar, amazing plays to enjoy over the course of the week. Also, such a minimal writing load for a high-level seminar!Like I said, Marc Robinson should be teaching three times as many undergraduate courses as he currently teaches. So approachable and lovely as a person, and so smart as a professor and mentor. Genuinely caring and invested in his students.TAKE THIS TAKE THIS TAKE THIS.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. The reading list is a bit scattered, but it is very thorough, and I feel like I now have a better understanding of the ideas \"theater now\" is centered on. Marc Robinson is insightful and engaging.",
    "Yes!"
