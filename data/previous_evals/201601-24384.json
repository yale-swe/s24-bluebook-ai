   "comments": [
    "If you ever wanted to actually look closely at the empirical evidence and models that affect the policies and opinions at play, this is a great class. It's hard because it's so academic, but it's also because you really have to push yourself to look at material that seems less interesting than just flailing big ideas around.",
    "This was a wonderful class. Rueda was an amazing professor. I suggest this course to someone who has already taken a political economy class or is familiar with the jargon (or taken some econ).",
    "In this class you read over political economy papers and then critique them. I would recommend this class to other students if they are particularly interested in the empirical strategies or theoretical issues within the field. If a student is interested in a more practical approach as to looking at inequality and what can be done about it, I would not recommend this course.",
    "I'd recommend this class as you will learn a lot and be exposed to a lot of excellent arguments. However, I would recommend knowing a bit about the subject area before taking the class as I think it would help with engaging fully in class discussions."
