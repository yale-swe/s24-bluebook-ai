    "Yes, if he\/she wants to know some basic ideas in this area.",
    "I would recommend this course. Students can grasp the basics of biosensing and bioimaging. For those who will conduct research in this area, this is a good course to take.",
    "This course is an overview of many different imaging modalities. You will probably find some of them useful and others not so useful. Hopefully, you will take the course in a different classroom than we did because ours was terrible. Hopefully you will have a really good TA like we did. Also, there is a ton of homework for this course and it's not always necessary. Some of the concepts could be presented with much shorter assignments. The assignments are usually pretty easy once you know what is expected of you, but it is usually not clear until you go to the help sessions due to the strange wording of the questions. I would recommend the class ifyou are not from an imaging background and want to learn more about the different modalities. I would also recommend it if you are an imaging student and want to make connections with professors doing research in these fields.",
    "I would recommend anyone in BME to take this course as it provides a foundation for many important concepts."

   "comments": [
    "This course is well related to my research so it definitely deepens my understanding in my profession. Some mathematics ideas about modelling is very useful in this course. They are applied in MRS, PET and some other imaging modalities.",
    "I could learn more about other bioimaging techniques other than MRI, the area I'm doing research. Those techniques are related so it's no harm to learn them.",
    "This course primarily gave me exposure to different fields of engineering than those I am currently pursuing. It probably won't contribute much to my research, but it has helped me to understand seminars that are imaging-heavy, which is quite nice."
