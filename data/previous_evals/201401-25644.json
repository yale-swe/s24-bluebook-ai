    "Basic intro to Arabic class, it's a hard language but useful today.",
    "Arabic 120 covers some of the more intricate and useful grammar needed to largely improve your writing and reading comprehension. You learn a lot more vocabulary and engage in learning some very practical reading skills (especially near the end of the semester). From what I understand, you finish working through the last textbook you started in first semester, while covering some additional grammar that is included in a course packet. If you get the chance to take it with Hasmik, you're in for a treat. She's really patient and understanding and loves to make the class enjoyable. Be prepared to eat some delicious Armenian candy and Arabic treats as well !",
    "L2 Arabic is a logical continuation of L1 and continues building on grammar and vocabulary learned in the semester before. As most language courses, your experience really depends on your professor, so shop around and make sure to end up in a section with few students, if at all possible."
