   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it if they were interested in the subject matter, the DS course on the whole, and if they were willing to do the reading.",
    "Yes, as it gives you a comprehensive taster of the range of historical and political thinkers. From there, you can narrow down what interests you most.",
    "yes I would recommend! did not expect to like it but just an interesting course.",
    "A challenging course that provides a strong introduction to classical historical and political thought. Nakhimovsky is slightly more challenging than other professors (requires weekly short reading reflections that could be a question or an observation that fascinates you) and class is more student-driven . I would recommend to be challenged within reason.",
    "Doing every page of the readings is hard, but makes it actually worth doing - don't do it if you're not interested in the texts and learning about their content. It's hard, but worth it. Final is very manageable, and sections are hit or miss - most people are very nice and want to work with others, but some people are frustrating to listen to.",
    "My favorite class in Directed Studies, good choice of texts and amazing professor. It was the highlight of my day.",
    "This course is demanding but rewarding, and the more you so, the more you get out of it. Listen to your fellow students - they have so much to say.",
    "Essentially, it covers the history of the beginning of the western cannon without actually covering the history about it. I probably wouldn't recommend the course to someone who couldn't handle the stress.",
    "DS History and Politics is a survey of the history of Western political thought and government in the context of important historical events. In this course, fundamental questions about the origin, purpose, and best type of laws, government, and human political communities will be debated and pondered. I would highly recommend this course for anyone interested understanding history and politics on a theoretical and abstract level, as well as anyone wanting to know the foundation and origin of our society- ie, why we live in a democratic republic with three branches of government- and questions as such. This course will certainly benefit anyone who wants to major in Political Science, IR, EP&E, etc.",
    "DS H & P is about ancient Greece, Persia and the Roman Republic and empire. The course covers the rise and fall of regimes and the varying constitutions or forms of governments. The course is about how various forms of government arise."
