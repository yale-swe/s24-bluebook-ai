    "Sonia Valle is so amazing! She is an incredibly sweet woman who really wants us to succeed. She is accessible and friendly and so smart, and if you can take a class with her, you should. Otherwise, this is a basic L2 language class - you will meet every day and learn a lot of grammar.",
    "Yes- would recommend",
    "Well, I wouldn't recomment language to anyone but since we have the requirement, it has to be done. If you want something that is useful, well taught, and fufills the requirement then go this route",
    "Lots of grammar, but also very conversational. The class is conducted almost exclusively in Spanish, but Professor Valle made sure all the students knew what was going on and were following. There is homework most nights, but it definitley helps with understanding and whiel there is a lot of work, it is very much manageabnle. It was a fun class that taught me a lot, so I would definitely recommend it."
