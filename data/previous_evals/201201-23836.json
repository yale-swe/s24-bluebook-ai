   "comments": [
    "This course was excellent. The strengths of this course were the readings and the interesting discussions. The seminar structure of the course allowed us to really interact with each other and talk in depth about the course topics.",
    "STR: good readings, reasonable work load, good balance of content\/concepts and discussion (i.e., exploration of concepts)LIM: ended a bit early",
    "Strengths: The course introduced us to some of the key areas of research in health economics, and some of the landmark papers and techniques for evaluation. I appreciated the seminar style and the discussions.Areas for improvement: I think it would be nice to dedicate a larger portion of class to more formal instruction. Along the same lines, it would have been nice to have theoretical readings accompany each of the applied papers. The class I enjoyed the most was on insurance markets because we had a chance to read a chapter from the Handbook of Health Economics. Reading that chapter put a lot of things in perspective and made the applied readings make MUCH more sense within a formal framework.",
    "It is a great opportunity to explore health and healthcare concepts from an economic lens. It presupposes a familiarity with econometrics, which would be helpful to know before signing up for the course. It should have HPA 583 as a prerequisite.",
    "The course offers a good overview of health economics at a greater level of depth. The final assignment then provides the students to focus on concepts one is most interested in which is also a good opportunity.",
    "I ended up really enjoying this class because it covered a lot of main topics within health policy with an great selection of readings that really highlighted specific issues. I didn't mind the reading assignments and I thought the final paper was a good way to let each of us divide into a specific quesiton we were individually interested in. For some classes, I would have liked to get a bit more background about the economic topics instead of dividing right into the readings. We did this for most classes, but more specifics would have been nice for several of the complicated topics. Also, although I liked the set-up of the class sitting facing each other, I really would have like this class to be in a room in 60 College instead of 47 College.",
    "This class is a very well judged mix of economics and public health, and was small enough to allow for a good level of class discussion.",
    "More of a lit review than in-depth economics.",
    "The course was very interesting, though I would have liked the class time to have more structure\/review of economic theory of the topics we discussed in class. I thought the readings were great and well suited to the weekly topics.",
    "excellent.",
    "Good course especially for people without extensive background in economics."

    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch was a really great instructor. She was extremely knowledgeable of the course material. She definitely pushed the class to think more critically about the articles that we read. In addition, it was impressive how dedicated and focused she was to the course given her competing priorities at the time.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0STR: Extremely knowledgeable, great discussion leader, fair grader, pushes students, clear and concise, able to teach a course even while pregnant!",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan was very knowledgeable about the subject and I really appreciated that she made the seminar safe for discussion. By 'safe' I mean that I never felt like I would be attacked for making an incorrect observation or asking a silly question, and I always felt comfortable to speak up. Sometimes we made inaccurateassessments of the research article, and Susan always validated our thought processes before correcting us. Furthermore, she did a great job at asking questions that would stimulate discussion.It's actually really rare to find an instructor who is as skilled in all of these areas as Susan, and I really appreciated her style.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Professor Busch has extensive expertise in the area of healthcare economics. She guided the course discussions well and selected reading that gave a great foundation for a strong knowledge base in the field.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan delivered the course in a thoughtful and well structured fashion.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Dr. Busch did a great job at picking readings that were interesting and able to be discussed in class. Some of the reading assignments at the beginning of the semester seemed a little bit like busy work, but she responded to the feedback we gave her at midterm and she altered them. I appreciated the weeks when there were multiple longer readings and she split up the class to focus on one half or the other. I think doing so actually enhanced the discussion because we were able to speak with more details to the article(s) we were responsible for, as opposed to simply skimming through all of them. I also appreciated how early Dr. Busch encouraged us to start thinking about our final papers and that she met with us individually to discuss our preliminary list of sources.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Susan went to a lot of trouble to make sure the material was at the right level and that everyone (even non-economists) understood it. Excellent instruction.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0excellent. very enthusiastic for all the topics tought and discussed. very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Susan Heidi Busch \u00a0Very engaging and approachable. Very good about giving feedback."

   "comments": [
    "This course was different from other policy courses in that it looked at health care issues from an economic perspective. I would highly recommend this course along with Jody Sindelar's course on Addiction, as these courses provide a nice introduction to contemporary issues in health economics.",
    "Absolutely, because it gives students the ability to better engage in discussions about health economics.",
    "A very brief introduction to current research topics in Health Economics.",
    "Very good and informative.",
    "A very good course.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who took the first economics class or has some sort of economics background. I was an econ major, but hadn't taken an econ class in 5 years so I was a little nervous about picking up the content at first but the way the class is structured is great because Dr. Busch covers specific topics each week. Compared to many other classes, I thought the readings were actually quite interesting. The final paper was also a very good exercise - although it's only five pages, it's very challenging because of the extensive literature review it requires.",
    "Good overview of key concepts in health economics.",
    "Good enough course.",
    "For a broad overview of health economics this class is great. There is bit of reading, but they are great articles and very appropriate to the topics discussed.",
    "excellent. highly recommendable to all the MPH students.",
    "Mostly literature review. If you have few courses in economics under your belt, feel free to skip this one."
