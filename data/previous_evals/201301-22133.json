    "TAKE THIS CLASS. I'm so grateful I made the decision to do intensive Russian at Yale. It's opened SO many doors for both my personal and professional life. It's a hard language, and you'll get the hang of it over time. Just be dedicated and patient and show your passion. Russian is an amazing language to know, and truly has changed my life honestly. I decided to take intensive after a visit to Eastern Europe. After learning Arabic, another critical language, I decided this would be another wise step. I was right.",
    "This class, combined with the previous semester, is a great way to learn lots of Russian fast. It's time-consuming, of course, and moves quickly. But it's so rewarding and absolutely worth it. If you're willing to make the commitment I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "You pretty much know what you are getting into with this course: lots of class time, heavy workload, tests every monday, but visible progress. If you really want to learn the language, take the class. If you're not in any hurry, don't take intensive. After a year of class every day, for over 1.5 hours 3 days a week, I can say it drains you. Professor Muravnik is great though! However, the class is taught by a TA 3 times a week. This wasn't really a problem, except for when the TA couldn't really explain the grammatical concepts well or wasn't too engaging.",
    "If you took RUSS 125, there's literally no reason why you wouldn't continue with RUSS 145. This is where you really consolidate\/solidify what you learnt in your first semester, and if you skip it it's seriously a huge waste."
