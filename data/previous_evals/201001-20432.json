   "comments": [
    "American Studies 807 was a course on performance historiography and gave us a thorough grounding in the major works in performance studies. More than that, it treated the subject of \"history\" and \"historical production\" as a kind of meta-level topic, putting performance studies and historiography more broadly in conversation with each other. For our final projects, we were asked to engage these ideas in a research paper that reconstructed a performance that had \"disappeared\" from the archives, thus making us to think critically about what \"remains\" in the archive and what doesn't and how we can make claims about bodies, identities, and performances when we don't have a lot of evidence to work from. While this might seem like an impossible project, it meant thinking critically about how history is made and transmitted as well, and our own implications in that process. I would HIGHLY recommend this course to ANY student in American Studies, since whether or not one is expressly concerned with the subject matter, it addressed questions and problems that are crucial to scholars in the humanities period, in a way more systematic and helpful than in any other course I've taken, here or elsewhere.",
    "yes, definitely for those interested in developing a strong historical approach to their field"

   "comments": [
    "I already knew that my dissertation will engage performance studies, but this course gave me a fantastic understanding of its primary concerns and, more importantly, the language and a framework that I can use to successful \"do\" this kind of work. Again, I don't think I've ever learned so much in a single course, on both a practical level and on a theoretical level. I wish that every course was structured in this way, where I get a broad and heavy amount of reading under my belt AND a seriously useful methodological approach. This latter piece is so difficult to do in an interdisciplinary program like American Studies. Paige McGinley gave me so much I don't even know how to begin to convey it."
