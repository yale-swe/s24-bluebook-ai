    "This class is a pretty good introduction to some of the essential topics in linguistics, although if you're looking to find out if you'll like linguistics as a field I'd recommend taking Intro before you take this so you can see what all the different topics in linguistics are, since not everyone loves syntax. I'm personally not super into syntax but the course itself was totally worth it and the workload was really manageable. Also, Raffaella is really kind and accessible so if she's teaching it again definitely take it!",
    "Syntax I is not easy, and learning the basics can take some time. Especially as someone who didn't take intro to linguistics before, I sometimes thought it was a little fast-paced towards the end, but it was manageable and always fascinating.",
    "I took Syntax 1 without any linguistics background and I found it perfectly accessible. It's one of the core areas of linguistic theory, so I probably wouldn't take it if you don't have at least a passing interest in linguists. If you are interested and want to do something a bit more involved than Intro., syntax is the real deal but still doesn't demand a ton of time. Of course, for prospective linguistics majors, this is probably a must-take and I wouldn't hesitate to take it freshman year if you know that's what you want."
