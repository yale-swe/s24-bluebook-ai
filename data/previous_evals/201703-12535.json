    "It was an excellent course, but one session of French history could help a lot.",
    "This course was a nice, though not exhaustive, survey of different possible approaches to writing cultural history. I enjoyed most of the texts chosen for the course. I found at times it was difficult to find the through-line for the class, occasionally getting bogged down by the work of breaking down an entire book's structure and content each week. It would have been useful to come up with succinct summaries for each cultural historian we examined so that each approach to cultural history we observed was clear and easily compared from one cultural historian to the next."
