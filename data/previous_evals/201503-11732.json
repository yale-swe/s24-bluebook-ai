    "Would highly recommend to anyone interested in gaining a working knowledge of poetics from this period - I can't speak personally for those with a significant background in this area and looking for a more targeted approach, but I imagine the professor's broad area of expertise makes this an ideal opportunity for you too.",
    "I highly recommend EALL 303 to anyone interested in premodern Chinese literature. It is an excellent course.",
    "This is an incredible course taught by someone who understands classical Chinese poetry better than probably anyone else. What a pleasure it was to take this course!",
    "This class, although taught in English, will require a high level of proficiency in Chinese. However, professor Sun is extremely patient guiding you through the deep meanings behind those poems, and you can learn a lot, about poetry of course, but also about Chinese culture at large."
