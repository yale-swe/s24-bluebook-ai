   "comments": [
    "Math 112 is a general calculus class. It is comparable to what one might learn in an AP Calculus AB course, with a few new concepts thrown in here and there.",
    "I would recommend Math 112 if you need to learn calculus or fulfill a distributional requirement.",
    "if you've already taken calc in high school, it'll be an easy QR credit and review of old concepts. If you haven't taken calc and aren't naturally a math-y individual, make sure to get help from outside sources and KEEP UP. The class will feel like it's moving quickly and the midterms sneak up on you.",
    "Math 112 is a class you take because for one reason or another, you have to. Don't take this class lightly! It was very difficult for me, even after taking high school calculus. However, I do feel that I learned a lot. Also, be aware that you cannot use a calculator on the tests, which isn't actually as bad as it sounds.",
    "It's a really easy class if that's what you're looking for. Two midterms and final are also fairly easy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Math 112 because I think everyone should have a basic knowledge of calculus. The class isn't so bad if you've taken AP Calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to others because it is a good introductory math class, and it is a good class to get one of the 'QR' credits out of the way.",
    "Math 112 is essentially I very fast paced, rigorous, in depth, Calc AP AB. I took AB last year and I still struggled to keep up with all the material. The course moves extremely quickly and it can be very difficult to follow. I believe that is largely a product of most of the students previously taking calculus and the department trying to make it decently challenging. The discrepancies between the sections are massive. Some students I talked to received excellent review guides in Anup Rao's section. Other's, like myself, were at a great disadvantage as Cartwright did not provide these. Furthermore, it seemed that increased communication between the professors would greatly help the teachers. Often it was very apparent that Cartwright had no idea what was on the tests or the homework. Overall, Cartwright is American and is very easy to understand, but he has difficulty making the lectures interesting. I would not recommend this course if you are not required to take it or don't love math.",
    "This section with Prof. Cartwright was not too bad. He is nice and tries to be funny. Take the course if you need the QR credit.",
    "Yes. Great basics of calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has a strong background in calculus, because it makes grasping the material a lot easier.",
    "It's one of those pre-med requirements so if you have you take it, take it."
