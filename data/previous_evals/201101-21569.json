    "MMES is a very unstructured, independent major, and the senior essay is the same. There were minimal instructions, and my advisor Andrew March, who was also DUS of the major, was unhelpful and inattentive, despite the fact that I had been trying to get his attention since August. This was forgivable (if unfortunate), but he also gave me wrong instructions for how to hand in my senior essay, which is just atrocious."
