    "Take it...very relaxed, make what you want of it...fun and interesting.",
    "This class is fairly loosely structured, which allows for a lot of creativity in the projects. I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to learn how to silkscreen, and just people interested in printmaking in general. We don't make t-shirts, though.",
    "I would highly recommend Silkscreen Printing. It is an enjoyable class with a manageable workload. You learn a lot about from a great professor.",
    "Art 355 is an excellent course for a student in any discipline. The workload is not overwhelming, the professor is excellent, and the assignments are exciting.",
    "This class is so much fun! There's something mystical about silkscreen printing. Even though we can all go to a digital printer and have our images or designs perfectly printed in any color fashion we want, the silkscreen captures an ethereal (in a good way) quality that digital printing lacks.If you're a graphic design major, thisclass should be mandatory."
