   "comments": [
    "Really fun\/ interesting! A great break from normal law school classes! Please offer more classes like this! Prof. Whitman is entertaining and knows tons of random interesting information!",
    "This class is really, really interesting, and Whitman is wonderful. He is really interested in the material and makes his lectures engaging. What I really liked about this class is that we did not have to read a single case. We covered a lot of really cool historical topics. Definitely something in there for everyone.",
    "Interesting discussions but lectures felt disjointed. It was difficult to connect each lecture to the other, no overarching theme.",
    "If you are looking for the ability to skip the class itself and just pick up 4 units for writing a hands-off, low stress paper (25 pages on the topic of your choice seems to be the expectation, can be carried over into the next semester) this is the class to take.",
    "Professor Whitman is an energetic and delightful teacher. He always covers more than it's possible in a single class, making the class truly comprehensive. The reading is varied and provides exposure to diverse areas of research. Whitman is very open to student suggestions, available outside of class, and flexible with assignments. A real delight to learn from and work with.",
    "Professor Whitman's enthusiasm and deep knowledge is obvious. The course was one of the most entertaining I've had at YLS, and also one of the most intellectually stimulating. He does a marvelous job of leading us to consider the big questions -- e.g., why we have a jury system, or what it means for a legal system to be based on custom. The reading was often dense, but not burdensome, and often included the greatest hits of Western legal historical scholarship over the past century--not too shabby.Structurally, the course was a mess. Prof. Whitman frequently confessed that he didn't know whether we'd end in AD 1200 or AD 1900, and one was never entirely sure what we'd cover in a particular lecture. But in a course like this--where the big takeaways were thematic, rather than doctrinal minutiae--that didn't detract from its overall value. A more regular, predictable syllabus might be nice, but it wasn't necessary in this case.",
    "Whitman is incredibly nice and so responsive to student questions, and class time is fascinating especially if you haven't had ancient history before. Not sure this is at all legal, really, and the materials feel sort of random, but the class was entertaining, at least.",
    "Overall the course is very good. I will only like to suggest fewer readings for each class. This could improve the discussion in class.",
    "The class was so interesting - I loved it!",
    "I found this a bit of an oddball for YLS, but a wonderful one. The readings are so much fun that you should really do them, even if they seem dry at first, but even if you don't you should still go to class.JW sometimes puts off students a bit by being a little quirky--a smidge of favoritism (or what appears to be it), certainly bias towards the topics he finds interesting--but that's hardly new for the law school. The value of this course is far beyond what you'd think--it's like the entire liberal arts experience crammed into a law-school sized package. Most people who've had a decent amount of European history will find some repetition, but we do go into way greater detail, and in any case everything's kind of drawn back and put into perspective anyway, so it's not repetitious.If you're curious, shop the class and see if you can show up and sit through 90% of his lectures while still taking decent notes. If you can do that, I think you're pretty set. It's like watching an awesome history video twice each week.Most people write papers; I took the final and found it not bad on the above attendance plan. I think it's a bit of an underrated option.",
    "Only take this class if you are genuinely interested in the topic. Many students appreciate this course and Prof. Whitman's lecture style, but those students seem to have come in to the class with a lot of background knowledge in the topic (eg, Classics majors, English majors, etc.). I would NOT recommend this course to anyone, such as myself, who lacks sufficient background knowledge in the material.",
    "Whitman is a great professor. His class is very interesting and his style of teaching is very entertaining. I learned a lot in this class (even though I didn't always do the readings). The exam was very fair and does not necessarily need a lot of preparation.",
    "An outstanding class taught by a thoroughly outstanding and warm Professor. This class should be made compulsory, not only for YLS students, but for anyone on this planet who has a mind, because this is a colourful class on The Human Condition -- why do people behave the way they do, where do conceptions of right and wrong come from, why is society structured the way it is. Fantastic material, fantastically presented, without any of the oh-so-unnecessary stress (eg cold-calling) that prevails in so many other classes here.",
    "Prof. Whitman cares deeply about the ideas he engages and develops--and about giving his students the space to give shape to their own. He is a rare treasure at YLS."
