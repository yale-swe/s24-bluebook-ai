    "You write one paper. That is it. And you get a science credit. Total win.",
    "The science class non-science papers dream of: one research paper on your topic of choice and a short presentation. I'm pretty worried about the grade, though, since we get NO feedback.",
    "This class was a beautiful, beautiful way to fulfill the baneful Sc credit Yale imposes on its students. Prof. Summers (affectionately known by his first name) is a boss who knows everything there is to know about science. However, for some reason, he chooses to teach this class to people who are extremely indifferent to scientific issues. It was a great cohort of students that became very close, and we had a great time. Little work (one presentation and a paper) that I actually enjoyed doing by the end--I learned a great deal from my project. If you can get into this class, do it and don't look back.",
    "EXCELLENT TAKE THIS CLASS. Again, if you can get in, TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT! Easiest class I've taken at Yale. One of my favorite classes at Yale, and I HATE science classes (and am very bad at it). And the least amount of work you will ever do for a class at Yale. I also enjoyed discussions, it can get boring but if you take it with your friends this class can be awesome. Bill is so chill, and our class had so much fun with this.",
    "I looked forward to going to this class every week. It has to be the best science credit available for non-science majors. You spend all semester exploring a scientific issue of your choice and also discuss the topics chosen by your peers -this makes for an extremely relevant and fun class that incorporates the interests of everyone.",
    "Definitely take this class rather than wasting a credit on a gut. You get to study something you actually find interesting and the course load is light until you turn in the final paper."
