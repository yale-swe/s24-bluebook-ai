    "I'm definitely more aware of the built environment and the public sculpture around me!",
    "This class was brilliantly hands-on, combining field work, trips, and software to immerse the students in the process of conservation both theoretically and practically. Working with the IPCH has been a delight - as have the endless resources both Professor Wexler and those at the IPCH seem to be able to offer! I now have a clear understanding of the conservational process for outdoor sculpture, as well as a better contextualization for its politics and power in public space.",
    "The course brings insight from Preservation of Public Sculpture, from the History of American Sculpture, and from Digital Technologies that might strengthen the public's relation with public art. I believe because it is an interdisciplinary course, the insight is mostly on understanding how these tools work together to further enhance the relationship between culture, public art, and audience engagement. The paths are very open and there were many directions to choose from at the moment to write the final paper and to think about how to apply this in the future, either from the academy or from a curatorial perspective. The possibilities are very rich and I was amused to see these different disciplines together certainly to speak about a specific problem with many angles."

   "comments": [
    "I believe this course was an experiment in its initial form. I think it would be strengthened by a) bringing Art History students in. I truly believe some of the differences between American Studies students and Art History is one that must be breached for this course to be fruitful. Both the artistic and historical aspect of public art must be taken into account in order to produce students that could become strong curators. b) As teh syllabus solidifies and maybe a second lecturer also becomes a formal part of the course, this course could even be organized as a series of debates of students."

    "Not too much work and you learn a lot! Professor Wexler is really nice and approachable and enjoyed the seminar. I really appreciated all the field trips and interactive learning we engaged in.",
    "If you are looking for a skills-based a approach to learning, a deep contextualization of outdoor sculpture and public space, and are committed to the intellectual challenges that Professor Wexler always works her students through, then this is a class for you."
