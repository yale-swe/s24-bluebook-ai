    "A good chance to work with the Russian language in areas other than history and literature -- the typical course load discussion areas for language instruction classes.",
    "Since there's going to be a new teacher next year, take this with a grain of salt. It was mostly a class on russian culture, not a discussion practice. We had not much opportunity to talk in russian in class, as it was a seminar-style discussion.",
    "The strength of the course lies in the professor, Rita Lipson. She is a dedicated teacher who is not only knowledgable but caring and a very interesting person. The course was in some ways an experiment as we were reading a text that this course did not explore before; it was rocky sometimes and it could have used more direction. That said, it was enjoyable, the student presentations were wonderful, and taking a course with professor Lipson is a joy. It's sad that she will be retiring but I am very happy I took this course!",
    "Russian 185 is \"Advanced Conversation and Composition,\" which means that there's a ton of speaking time (your conversation skills get really good), the readings are contemporary, and you practice writing. We also were assigned to listen to the radio. Sometimes the assignments were not clear, but I imagine this varies teacher to teacher, and it was really nice to feel like we could do whatever seemed like it would be best for our own Russian practice."
