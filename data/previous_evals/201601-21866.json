   "comments": [
    "It's good, but a lot of work. A lot of memorizing.",
    "Fast-paced and difficult. Study hard and prepare to do a lot of self-teaching if you have Clay.",
    "Not much thinking involved - all the exams require rote memorization and understanding of the concepts in the powerpoints. There aren't really any curveballs. That being said, the material adds up quickly so do not fall behind and you'll be fine. There is also no need to freak out about Professor Clay, it just so happens that the metabolism section of the course is one of the most dense, but she's not a bad lecturer herself. She takes the time to review concepts from previous lectures at the beginning of each class and really ties it all together. Her review sessions for her 2 midterms are also really helpful because she goes through all the main connections between the material covered.",
    "I definitely would never recommend this class to another student.",
    "While I enjoyed the topic, the pace of the course was pretty fast, though necessarily so since there's a lot of material to cover. Breaker and Engelman were great instructors, but I felt that Clay wasn't as effective at explaining the material. Also, her exams were much more difficult than Breaker's and there was material on the third exam that she said was not going to be on the exam. I've heard the MB&B class is much better, so I would suggest taking that one if you can. It's not an awful course, but it was much more difficult once Clay started teaching. Once we started metabolism, it became one of those classes that you have to review the material for everyday in order to be on track.",
    "honestly one of the best courses of the pre-med track, if not THE best. ties together a lot of the knowledge you learn in intro bio\/chem\/orgo courses and gives tremendous insight into how our bodies work and why doctors make recommendations like \"consume more folic acid\". breaker is incredible and his tests are manageable. clay is very obviously a genius though her tests are pretty hard. engleman is not a great lecturer but his tests are also manageable",
    "Overall, this was a fine course. The last half of the course is much harder than the first half-- so much memorizing.",
    "Assuming you're only taking this class because you have to, it isn't as bad as everyone says, but it still isn't enjoyable. The first half of the class with Breaker and Engelman is a lot easier than with Clay, but that's mostly because the metabolism material she teaches is just a lot more challenging. The first two exams are also a lot easier, but the pace of the course really picks up halfway through and you have to put in way more time to do even half as well on the exams. It's nice that there is no final, and you can kinda do a brain dump after each of the 4 midterms, but that also means you only get text grades, no credit for psets.",
    "Take it in the fall. Not with these lecturers.",
    "MCDB is a rewarding course. It's difficult, but at the end of the semester, you'll really appreciate just how far you've come. The professors are great, and although the exams are challenging, the professors are always willing to help you.",
    "This is going to be a very difficult course. It will be very stressful, and the amount of information you have to learn is immense and at times just impossible. Do not underestimate it, and study for the midterms well in advance. If you can get through it though, you'll have a great, thorough preparation in biochemistry.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in biochemistry with the caveat that the class environment is extremely catered to premeds who are grade-obsessed and make lecture and section painful to sit through. That being said, the way the course combines topics from both semesters of MB&B biochem mean you learn a lot in a short period of time. The material gets exponentially more difficult towards the end of the course, however, so study up.",
    "MCDB 300 is a hard class, and it requires a lot of self-motivation to do well. There aren't problem sets for the first half of the class so you have to be proactive in learning the lecture material. The material in this class is really interesting but it is also difficult and the pace is very fast.",
    "An intro class to biochemistry. Try not to take this class if you can take the other one.",
    "I would re commend reviewing your notes at least weekly to stay on top of the material. It's a lot to take in and you're better off if you do it a little at a time.",
    "You're probably only taking thing this because you have to honestly. Just start memorizing everything the day you learn it and it'll be fine. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. There is just simply TOO much information to understand and synthesize in a few days. Trust me on this one, study early.",
    "Don't get behind and you'll be fine. Biggest problem is that the \"easier\" stuff at the beginning of the semester gets stretched out, forcing metabolism to be covered at a breakneck speed. Clay gets a lot of flak, but she's a good professor and really wants you to do well, and will go out of her way to help you (if you ask!!).",
    "Nicole Clay was actually fantastic and made the course so enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "A very good biochemistry course. The first half will not be too challenging for those who have completed the BIO modules, and I recommend staying thoroughly on top of the material the second half of the term, or you will fall behind. The professors are all super accessible and really want to help students do well. No final is really nice, just 4 midterm exams.",
    "The first two instructors are great, straightforward and clear. The material is understandable and expectations are reasonable. The remaining of the course is brutal and expectations highly unreasonable. I typically enjoy this kind of material but was very disappointed by the lack of learning anything from the midpoint on.",
    "Switching the instructors so frequently was extremely unsettling and made it impossible to become accustomed to a certain study strategy. Also it made no sense that the final exam was not during finals period. Having four midterms, each a quarter of the grade, was extremely stressful. Word to the wise: do NOT fall behind!! If you are prepared for the lecture before class it will make your life ten times easier."
