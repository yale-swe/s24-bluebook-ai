    "The senior essay in French can be painful if not time-managed well, but if you space out the work, choose topic and get all research materials well in advance, it will be enjoyable. Make sure you pick a topic you love! There's nothing worse than being married to a topic you don't enjoy writing about. Choose an adviser who you are comfortable with; having had them before as a professor helps. Do not leave the writing of the essay to the last minute! It will take longer than you think, especially if you haven't ever written a paper of this length before (if you are not doing the intensive major the French senior essay may be either in French or English and is about 30 pages). I stayed over Spring Break to work on mine; though I missed being with my senior friends on vacation, the last few weeks of second semester were so much more relaxing and open for me since I'd completed a draft. If you're not a very well-disciplined worker (I wasn't), it might be helpful to draw up a set of goals for every weekly meeting with your adviser. This will help keep you honest in staying on track to eventually write the thing. In the end, it's just a really long essay!"
