   "comments": [
    "No. Reasons above in the evaluation of the teacher section.",
    "It is an annoying class to take so only take it if you need to.",
    "If you're planning on going into a math-intensive major, it's definitely a survivable class. It's not enjoyable, but you can make it through it. I feel like it definitely prepared me for higher level maths, even though it wasn't one of my favorite courses.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you need it for your major. You need to be able to teach yourself if you want to do well in this class.",
    "I am a math major (which is to imply that i really do love math) but i hated 115 so so so unbearably much. having it at 9am didn't help (PLEASE don't do this to yourself...) If you've already taken BC and test into 120, don't take 115 just because you think it will be easy and you think you need a review. it will not be that easy. the midterms are hard and the final is muderous.but help is available if you seek it out, so if you do take 115, GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!",
    "Math 115 has made me a better mathematician. However, if you aren't aiming to go into mathematics, or some major that will require a strong basis in mathematics, I wouldn't recomend it. The homework load wasn't too bad, but the midterms--and the final especially--sucked. Still, if you need to take this course, don't let people scare you away from it. I would just advise you to continue to review things that you learn in the course throughout the year, so that you will be well-prepared for the final. Also, I would like to note that Apoorva Khare was a good professor. He taught the material using many good example problems, and was good at remaining interesting even at 9:00 in the morning. One last note: DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE IF YOU'RE *ONLY* TAKING IT FOR THE QR! Especially if you don't like math. Try a logic class.",
    "I advised NOBODY to take this course (even if you've taken BC calc like I did). Take it at a community college back home and transfer credits. Don't waste your time and money. I've taken BC calc before and got a pretty good grade in this class and I'm still really irritating about how crappy a course it is. I used to love math so much until I had to take math 115.The textbook they use is also terrible. It's rated the worst calc textbook on amazon.com.",
    "Integral Calculus. I would recommend Mathematics 115 to those students without prior exposure to AP Calculus BC, otherwise I would suggest taking a higher level mathematics course such as Math 120.",
    "tough",
    "Do not take this if you do not have to. A lot of people who already have learned the material take this for an easy A and it is frustrating if you are looking at material for the first time.",
    "Mathematics 115 is basically the second half of an introductory calculus course. It emphasizes memorization rather than true mathematical understanding \u0097 i.e. it is more important, in this class, to learn formulasthan to understand why they work. I would not recommend taking this class. You learn little in the sections, the homework assignments are only a bit of practice, and the exams are quite challenging if you do not have a firm grasp of the material. This class gives you a survey of integrals, sequences, series, and a few other things, but is more about memorizing than truly learning."
