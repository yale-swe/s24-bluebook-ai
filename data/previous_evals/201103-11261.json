    "Question 4: The final exam was the day after thanksgiving break which was a bit harsh considering it took away from family time having to study for it. With that said, it was nice to get it out of the way before other finals.",

    "Reading all of the journal articles provides a very clear training in reading articles analytically. That was very useful.",
    "The case studies and certain guest speakers.",
    "Links to applications - policy etc.",
    "Michelle Bell! She is literally the only person I've ever met who both appears to have substantial moral purpose to her life work AND correctly understands the importance of objectivity in the search for truth.Stop and read that again, it's serious.As a result she has a tremendous amount of my respect, and is also uniquely able to teach environmental health the way it should be taught. Also people like her should run the world."

    "More continuity within the course and less focus on air quality.",
    "Three hours seemed a bit long, but the discussion format and the break time in the middle helped a lot with this.",
    "The response papers felt a bit like busy work.",
    "Too much analyzing scientific articles and discussion based around these papers. Discussions could be based more around case studies and \"what you would do and why?\" rather than \"what are the strengths and weaknesses of this article.\"",
    "Amity Doolitle. Everything that is right about Michelle Bell is wrong about Amity Doolittle. She is just so biased, ideologized, and unscientific. Professor Bell should really just give the EJ lecture next time. Professor Bell's comments at the end Professor Doolittle's lecture were the only parts of that lecture that were worth noting down.The other guest lecturers were pretty solid, but it would be worthwhile I think for Professor Bell to exert some amount of additional control and coordination over the content of those lectures...there were a few weeks that seemed to be stepping on each other's toes--zoonotic diseases and vector-borne diseases and occupational health all ended up overlapping a bit more than I think they needed to."
