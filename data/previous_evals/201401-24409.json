    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Nature and Globalization is one of those courses that completely alters the way you think about the world. Professor Hebert is a wonderful teacher that alternates between lecture and seminar style for an overall fantastic experience. She assigned no more than 4 readings per week, and they were all of manageable length. This allowed the class to really dive deep into each reading (not to mention actually read everything). Everyone should be required to take some kind of anthropology, and this is a great foray into the field.",
    "A truly interesting course exploring the connection between a global world and our natural world, exploring specific topics and issues applying to each. If the course material looks interesting to you, take this class! There is a lot of work, especially because it's crucial to do the readings, but if it's something of interest to you, you will enjoy it.",
    "Nature and Globalization begins with a critical analysis of what \"Globalization is,\" transitioning through economic anthropology, it relates globalization to the consumption of nature, while giving great insights on anthropological themes like local vs. global, the driving forces of capitalism, what endows states with power to govern people and nature, and the history of environmental thought. This class was a great surprise for me, and for many EVST students, as it touched on many themes much more interesting than anything found in a very technical discussion of either the environment or economic globalization. The course is refreshingly non-eurocentric, with readings spanning all continents. Some of the theorists discussed in complement to the course readings include Marx, Foucault, and the Frankfurt School. The class ends with discussions of health, neoliberalism, technology in nature. I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in understanding the intersection between culture, economics, politics, and the environment, as well as to anyone who might have any interest in the themes involved. I would also recommend this class to anthro majors who are not necessarily interested in the environment, but are open to very interesting discussions. If you're looking to become more analytical, this class has four 4-page reading responses that tie together the readings for one week which were challenging, but a great exercise! Take home midterm, take home final. Prof. Hebert is an amazing, thoughtful, witty, teacher with great lecture and discussion guidance skills. Awesome class!",
    "This course is simply a review of readings relevant to the course subject matter. The readings are difficult so at times it was very helpful to have professor Hebert and TA to help analyze, but it can get very mundane if you don't vibe with a reading one week. Overall generates smart and interesting discussion if this is your jam!",
    "Absolutely take this class. It is hard work--there is a lot of literature to get through and the take-home midterm and final are demanding. BUT every article you will read is incredible interesting and the midterm and final force you to synthesize and build upon everything in a really neat, rewarding way. Make sure you do all of the reading--no skipping because we will continue to draw upon all of the reading again, and again throughout the semester. However, it is so worth it--I learned so much from simply the readings alone. It is also useful to have some background in social theory because Foucault always comes up and the brief introduction we get in class isn't really enough. Overall, TAKE IT. The professor is incredibly smart, dynamic, articulate and kind, and the teaching fellow, Rebecca Jacobs, is the bomb.",
    "The class is an analysis of the concept of globalization and it calls into question many of the assumptions we have today about what \"nature\" is, whether or not globalization is a new phenomenon, etc. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the concept of globalization from a theoretical perspective."
