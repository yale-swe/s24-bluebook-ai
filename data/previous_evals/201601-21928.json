   "comments": [
    "Really great comprehensive class that covers many different aspects of theater. Lots of different aspects are touched upon so whatever your niche may be, you'll find something that you like. Great discussions, but lots of reading. Really interesting and somewhat challenging papers. The course, and specifically Joe Roach, will help you improve your mind as a theater person.",
    "THST 111 is the continuation of 110. If you have already done 110, even if you aren't a theater major, you should take 111. It's definitely more enjoyable in terms of the readings, especially since (finally) playwrights figured out they didn't need to write in verse. The reading load seems lighter than that for 110, and even if it isn't in actual pages it certainly felt that way. If Joseph Roach is the professor, DEFINITELY take it.",
    "If you have to take it, you'll get through it and enjoy parts of it. If not, pass on it.",
    "Thst 111 is an excellent way to gain an introduction to a broad survey of theatrical development over the past three centuries. On its own, the course is instructive, and reading through the works in chronological will give you a deeper understanding of theatrical development. However, if the course is also being taught by Professor Roach, then I can really promise that the class will be incredible. Professor Roach does an excellent job of teaching theater as both a scholar and a performer; literary analysis is paired with discussions about acting and directing, and tracking of historical theatrical development is accompanied by a survey of the developing set and lighting design philosophies. I deeply recommend this course for anyone who wants to become better versed in the breadth of historical theatrical styles, and particularly recommend Professor Roach as an instructor.",
    "More fun that 110! I liked the contemporary material. The workload is okay, the papers were hard, the exams were pretty basic. Joe Roach is a really cool professor.",
    "Would recommend. A good survey of more recent theater.",
    "This class is a walk through the history and theory of modern drama. The plays are very interesting but the workload is consistent. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH JOE ROACH. He makes it by far the most interesting because he is so knowledgable and passionate about the subject matter.",
    "To me it was like a literature class but only reading plays. You read so many plays that have been deemed important to theater history. Great class especially with the performance project at the end!",
    "THST111 is a great class that often does not carry the drudgery of a prerequisite. The required plays are interesting and plays that any well-versed actor\/director\/techie should know. I now feel much more well informed about both various styles of theater and theatrical technique, and can definitely say I learned a great deal about theater and its intrinsic ties to our world's definition of culture.",
    "THST is a spectacular course, especially if you can take it with Professor Roach. If you have any intention to engage with works of live performance at any point in your life, and especially if you plan for a life in the theatre, you MUST MUST MUST take this class. You will read fundamental texts and learn about classic performances, actors, designers, and interpretive approaches from a variety of perspectives--even getting to work on your own designs, put on a creative group project, analyze interdisciplinary art pieces, write action\/beat analyses, etc.--at least with Professor Roach. Regardless, the text themselves are worth engaging with even if you took all else away. An amazing opportunity to read some of the most influential plays in the canon (and beyond the \"canon!\") An incredibly diverse list of readings\/texts\/academic supplements. This class is fun, moving, and essential. It will change your view of what theatre is, has been, and can be. Professor Roach is utterly brilliant, loves his subject, and is always willing to talk to and engage with his students, who he clearly respects and cares for deeply. Don't miss this opportunity!",
    "I would unquestionably, unhesitatingly, wholeheartedly, recommend THST111 to another student. You shouldnt feel like you have to be a theatre studies major or a humanities person to take the class, seriously, there was a mechanical engineer major in the class and he loved it! Its a great survey class for anyone that wants to learn about theatre from the reformation to the present day. The work load is substantial with about two plays, and some theory readings, due per week (a play due Tuesday and a play due Thursday). The papers are so much fun to write because they have you take the point of view of a director and a critic. TAKE IT, and especially TAKE IT WITH JOSEPH ROACH!!!",
    "Yes, 1: it's a prerequisite to be a thst major 2: Covers great material and illuminates the history of theatre",
    "Yes, definitely."
