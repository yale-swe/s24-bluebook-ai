    "Since I am interested in contemporary literature, this class certainly helped me because ethics is all the time more important in contemporary debates. The simposium is an excellent professional exercise, and the only time we have this opportunity in our department. The class also teaches us how to relate literature to other cultural and historical debates (not just art as autonomous all the time)."
