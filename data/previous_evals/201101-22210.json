    "Take this class. Herr Stern is incredible. You will learn German and develop a nuanced appreciation of the language. By the end of the year, we had read a play and short story by Brecht, a mystery novel, and poems by Rilke and Goethe. This is the way to learn a language. And despite what others say, you do learn a great deal of speaking skills.",
    "I've been telling everyone to take this course, if you have a thick skin. It seems like people who get scared of Herr Stern have a less positive experience. Or people who tune him out, also. For me, this course was a great experience with a great group of people, and I learned an amazing amount of German, more than I could have thought. We were reading Brecht by the end!",
    "Take it, if you took first semester. But make sure you're dedicated. If you don't need it for a language credit and have no overwhelming desire to study the literature though...maybe do other electives? This needs your attention.",
    "This semester of intensive german is meant to practice your speaking skills, as the first semester is focused primarily on grammar -- reading and writing. While I recommend the first semester for anyone who seriously wants to learn German, I do not recommend the second semester. It is a waste of time.",
    "I would recommend German 145 to any student who has the time (read: you CANNOT slack...ever) and determination to learn a difficult language thoroughly in one semester. Expect to hate yourself for choosing to do so on some mornings. If you're a senior, reconsider doing both society and Intensive German at the same time because there are tests every Friday morning during the first semester. Expect 2 hours in class each day and up to 2 hours of work each night. If you're up for the challenge though, it can be one of the most rewarding experiences you have here."
