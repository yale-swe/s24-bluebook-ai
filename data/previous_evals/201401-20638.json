    "This class is a continuation of MUSI 210. While 210 only covers diatonic harmony, 211 concentrates on integrating chromatic techniques into diatonic structures. The class is a great experience to anyone interested in music theory and imparts a very useful body of knowledge to any aspiring composer.",
    "Take it if you have to. There are some interesting things in the class, but I really don't feel like I retained that much from this class. Work can be incredibly tedious, especially if you've already been part-written to death in 210. Things are more interesting than 210, thankfully. Mark is a nice guy, but probably won't be teaching this again.",
    "Musical techniques and analysis of pieces in the romantic era. In difficulty, it seems like a bit of a jump from baroque\/classical techniques.",
    "Learn how to write using methods and ideas one may not have thought of before. I would recommend it to any student interesting and fluent in music.",
    "211 is essential for those wishing to understand 19th century harmony in preparation for higher level music courses. It can be fun with a good teacher, and model compositions\/analyses are useful for any budding composers, musicians, or thinkers in general.",
    "Chromatic harmony is tricky and weird. But interesting and pretty. Take this if you're going to be a music major (you have no choice) or you're DYING to analyse Schubert songs.",
    "I would recommend the course to my fellow student if he\/she is inserted in hearing and analysis. This course is very hearing-oriented and helps improve one's sensitivity about music."
