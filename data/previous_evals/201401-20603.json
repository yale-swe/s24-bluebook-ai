    "It's like DS Lit, but in French. And with Prof. Duval. That means several things. 1. It's like DS. If you loved the DS format (3 5-page essays, lots of reading), this will be perfect. It shares the flaws of DS, though: breadth over depth, occasionally pointless discussions, allusion-happy freshmen. 2. It's in French. The discussions and the essays are in French. It's really not a problem if you've done L5 here at Yale. But if you've taken a year off French since high school, it might be a little rough going. 3. It's with Duval, who is, by general consensus, one of the greatest professors in DS if not the school. So if you're deciding between 170 and 171, that perhaps decides it.",
    "Summary: a 4th section of DS, with all literature being originally in French. The spirit of DS but all in the original language. Recommendation: I would recommend this student to any student in DS who enjoyed that kind of environment and also enjoyed French. I might recommend that a student currently in DS would think carefully before taking FR 171 as a 5th class as I did, as my only regret is not having more time to read the works carefully.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "Take it if you are in DS, you speak French, and want to become a better reader, writer, and speaker of French. The workload is not bad, but you are expected to have done all the reading in fine detail (as one always should, but which is sometimes impossible in DS), and to turn in nearly perfect essays.",
    "A great course for students who want to supplement the spring semester of DS Lit with more French classics. This is pretty much DS Lit in French, but with fewer works, and therefore more time with each work, which is pretty great (since DS covers so much in such a short time). We draw parallels between some of the works covered earlier in DS (e.g. The Odyssey and The Aeneid), but others can stand more or less alone. We even get to vote on what we want to read for the last work in the semester (something from the 20th century, which is refreshing after Proust and Flaubert, to be honest). Speaking as someone who didn't do all of the assigned reading (interpret that as you will), I will say that the more of the reading you do, the more you will get out of this class, but that's true for DS, as well. That said, it's still great: Duval is a sweetheart, and he has amazing insight about these works. Overall, I would definitely recommend it as long as you won't get bored of French literature for a semester.",
    "This is a wonderful class. The syllabus introduced us to a wonderful range of different kinds of French literature, from the genesis of the language in 1086 to the early 20th century. It really adds to the DS experience, and the reading is just plain enjoyable. Professor Duval is the star of the class, and the real reason the class is so wonderful. He is incredibly lively and passionate, and so ridiculously insightful - you will learn so much about these texts. It's a workout for your French, but Professor Duval is incredibly supportive both in class discussions, in his comments on your papers (he gives 4 pages of comments for a 5 page paper), and in his office hours, which you should definitely attend. That said, the class struggles if people aren't on the same level language-wise. You don't have to have perfect French, because it will improve a lot, but you do have to be able to carry on a conversation about literature in French.",
    "Less reading page for page than a DS course but similar in scope and chronology. Make sure you feel very comfortable with French before taking this course, I found vocabulary to be challenging in the earlier works and unlike in 170, the exam is written rather than oral."
