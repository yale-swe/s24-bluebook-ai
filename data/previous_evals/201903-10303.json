   "comments": [
    "This course was such an important moment in my interrogation of social theory via the Anthropology major, because of its non-Western syllabus of scholars and because of Vivian's thoughtful instruction. I learned to parse through texts to fully develop a postcolonial critique of systems and social constructs.",
    "Great insight into the political and historical forces that shape perceptions of and relations to Africa & the Global South. We covered categorizations and constructs that have been used to characterize Africa from the time of colonialism until the present day, and ways in which the legacies of colonization endure in present day relations between the Global North and the Global South, as well as in world institutions such as the IMF, World Bank etc and systems such as structural adjustment.",
    "This course gave me a better grasp of reading dense material as well as discussing the material with peers. The papers allowed me to practice and improve critical thinking abilities and apply them to discussions in class.",
    "I was able to engage with some amazing African scholars and put readings\/topics like the Invention of Africa in conversation with others like the Invention of Women which were really enlightening. I think this course also did a great job of discussing Africa in the World in a way that did not homogenize or perpetuate its invention but rather actively deconstructed it and its implications by employing a transnational framework still structured on specificity.",
    "I gained a deep understanding of ways Africa has been understood in relation to the rest of the world, particularly surrounding colonization. I learned a lot of information about African history, and how different thinkers have interpreted the impacts of historical events on Africa's social fabric and economic processes. I gained a nuanced understanding of the history of dichotomies preceding the terms \"Global North\/Global South\" and the complexities in the action of defining areas of the world.",
    "At the beginning of this course, I had no idea what the Global South was. I now understand the complexity of this term and I have gained an interest in exploring South-South relationships.",
    "Never before had I encountered a course that introduced me to an understanding of race, class, politics, and development in Africa in such a thorough and thought-provoking way as this course. I have come to understand not only the arduous history of Africa with the West since the beginnings of the transatlantic slave trade but have learned of the ways that white supremacist views of exoticism and backwardness toward non-white people and culture led developed the backdrop to capitalist and imperialist encroachment onto the continent. I learned of the changing nature of this race supremacist ideology and how it led to the creation of race science and the eventual development of cultural deterministic theories as related to development. I learned the ways in which the West hampers economic growth in Africa through international relationships, global financial institutions, and foreign aid. I have engaged more African authors and scholars than I had ever encountered in any other course I've taken, which has had a thorough impact on my own conceptions of development and what I envision greater development in Africa looking like."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the syllabus and texts; Vivian's lecture\/seminar model; the assignments and workload Weaknesses: wish the discussions could have gone a bit deeper and stuck more to some of the texts, but not a huge issue at all; wish I had gotten some more thorough feedback on my papers",
    "A strength of this course, aside from the nuanced and highly engaging academics, was how Vivian nurtured a close relationship among the class members for a relatively large seminar class size (about 20). The atmosphere was relaxed and yet intellectually challenging, and we were able to share differing opinions without generating tension in the room. Aside from this, the course materials are super interesting and manageable to read each week, and I felt like I was learning a lot each week (unlike some seminars where you come out wondering what exactly you have learned throughout the whole semester). Part of the class structure was having pairs of students co-facilitate each session after a brief lecture by Vivian. While this was a fun and creative way to engage with our classmates, I felt that class-lead presentations should have taken up less time so that we could get more content from Vivian each class.",
    "I would love to have heard more from Vivian!!! The little intro parts at the beginning of every class were very helpful and I would have liked to have heard more of what Vivian was thinking.",
    "ER&M is likely the best course I've ever taken at Yale. At the start of the semester, I was unsure about taking the class; I had VERY little background on the subject and had already committed to four other difficult courses. Looking back however, I am so so grateful that I eventually decided to stick with the course. Africa in the World has a fair amount of work: about 100 pages per week of sometimes dense or difficult reading, reading responses each week, facilitating discussions of the readings twice during the semester, and three 8 - 10 page papers. Every piece of this class, however, was absolutely worth it -- grounded on history, ethnic and racial theory, and primary source documents, this course gives deep insights into the history of Africa and the implications of its past on contemporary African society. The content covered in this course is definitely not present in any other class at Yale, despite how integral it is to any form of meaningful engagement with the continent. Professor Lu is an absolute gem -- her knowledge of the field is shown through her incredible selection of readings and wealth of knowledge provided during our weekly seminars. There's nothing I can think of that could make this class better, other than bringing Professor Lu to Yale as a permanent faculty member so this course can continued to be offered. It's a huge shame that she'll be leaving next semester, and I wish Yale could have recognized the immense value she brings to the university and her students.",
    "The course was effective in discussing the course materials and fostering a environment of critical thinking and discourse. The one weakness was lack of time, which is a fault that belongs to no one, since the conversations were plentiful and engaging.",
    "I think the course wonderfully wove readings with multimedia sources and structured the class in a way that reflected the topics\/was consistent, building off each week. Though the essays were spread out, it at times felt like a lot to be both responsible for leading a whole day of discussion, writing weekly precis and 3, 8-10 papers. It was all definitely doable but time consuming especially if you were actually really engaged with the material and wanted to put forth a good effort.",
    "Strengths: Professor Lu was great. The progression of the course material was very intuitive, following both chronology and dichotomies mobilized in each successive time period, e.g. west\/orient, civilized\/uncivilized, colonizer\/colonized. Discussion was extremely fruitful, everyone in the class really cared and it showed. Weaknesses: Sometimes, I felt like in the service of higher-level discussions, the class lacked some basic grounding in the facts of historical events and terminology and I struggled to stay on top of what was going onmaybe if we spent a few minutes per seminar just going over the time period and historical context before diving into the texts?",
    "Great selection of readings that work well with the structure of the class. The setup of the course ensured that we were able to build up to our own interpretation of what the Global South means.",
    "This course is extremely well structured in facilitating discussions and student interpretations of the text and material encountered in class. It pushes students to think for themselves about the ways in which ideology, institutions, and structures continue to influence life in Africa to this day. It also does well in pushing student to think for themselves and engage the complex and difficult topic of greater development in Africa beyond the lens of a western ideology."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! If you want to get away from the suffocatingly Western syllabi of social theory courses at Yale, you should take this course or one like it!",
    "Yes!! You learn a LOT and get introduced to a host of great authors and thinkers. Now when I read African studies related articles or books, I actually recognize most of the names that pop up and am familiar with those thinkers' contributions to discourse in the field or their contributions to nationalistic movements, de-colonization, pan-africanism etc. The readings and workload were very manageable, with a 200 word precis to be posted online each week about one of the readings. This was nice because even if you struggled with some readings you are able to focus on the one you are more comfortable with, or expand on your challenges with a particular reading\/ your questions in your precis. There were three papers throughout the semester, all of them 8-10 pages, INCLUDING the final paper!",
    "I could not recommend this course more to ALL students at Yale, but the shame is Professor Lu will to be at Yale next year.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, especially those interested in the topic at hand. The material and discussions provided an in depth analysis and discussions regarding the course topic and improved my understanding of the discourse relating to the course.",
    "Yes I would! The people in the class and the topics each weeks really created such a great learning environment. We had students from so many different fields which made the perspectives brought really enlightening and added layers to the questions at hand and interpretations of the readings.",
    "Yes!! Professor Lu is leaving :( But if someone else offers the course, definitely take it as an introduction to not only African studies, but also to thinking about how to conceptualize the world and think of ourselves versus others. Also, the readings are fantastic.",
    "This has been one of the most intellectually engaging courses that I have had at Yale. It has engaged my beliefs and views with great scrutiny and has caused me to re-evaluate nearly all that I know and believed that I understood about the history, beliefs, practices, and relationship of Africa with the rest of the world."
