    "Yes, definitely if someone is interested in animation.",
    "Every week you learn some new aspect of 3D animation, like lighting or character animation, and you'll do a little project on that. And then that all leads up to the final project where you can do whatever you want! Try not to be too ambitious with that final project cause just one minute of work is a lot to do.",
    "Digital Animation is a fun course that is both an art and technical class. Over the course of the semester, we learn how to use Maya to produce 3d models, rigs, and animations. The first half consists of projects assigned in class that are designed to practice animation basics. The second half of the course is focused on building a final project of your choice. The topics can range from videos, short films, video games, etc. I highly enjoyed taking the class. The workload (particularly for the final project) is intense, but well worth it. The professor is great. I would highly recommend the class.",
