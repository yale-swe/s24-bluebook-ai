    "Spanish 110 is your basic elementary language course - you learn the basics of Spanish as you would any other language.",
    "Spanish 110 is an extremely intensive introductory spanish course. If you keep up with the work, it can be a successful and rewarding experience. I would recommend Spanish 110 to others.",
    "A great introductory language course to take at Yale-Spanish is not a hard language to pick up and you learn enough to write full paragraphs and have basic conversations with your classmates and the professor. It is five days a week and you get homework everyday, but its very manageable as long as you're regular with your homework and study (an hour per day max.).",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. She was a great professor and I learned a great deal.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, but you have to take it seriously. It isn't a gut, even though it's basic Spanish."
