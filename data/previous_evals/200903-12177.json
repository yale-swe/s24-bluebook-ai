   "comments": [
    "A presentation of the plausibility of extraterrestrial life and where it could exist due to astrophysical properties.",
    "Interesting class that melds together various fields from biology to philosophy. Interesting reads!",
    "It is a class that combines all the sciences. Take it if you like a little bit of everything.",
    "It involves looking at a lot of pictures. You spend more time learning about life on earth and solar system formation than anything else.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was both fun and informative. Though a science credit, the course is quite relaxed and does not have too much of a workload. However, (for those looking for a gut class), there is indeed some work, which actually needs to get done. (That said, not all of every assigned reading is necessary as long as you understand the concepts.) If you don't find the subject matter interesting the work will probably just seem tedious and irritating. I was interested in the subject, so I never really minded doing the work. You also get to do fun things that don't seem much like class, like going to the Leightner Observatory and watching alien abduction videos; not to mention being able to come home and tell your suitemates things like \"Today I learned the history of the Universe.\" Take this class; it's more than just an easy science credit.",
    "If you are not crazy about the sciences and have a small interest in our universe, take it",
    "Take it if you're not looking for much work and want a science credit. Can be interesting, but was often pretty boring.",
    "This is a relatively fun class for those interested in astronomy. The workload is very light.",
    "Yes, whole-heartedly"
