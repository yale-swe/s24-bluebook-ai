   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you want to learn more about Pathology. Most useful disease related class I've taken at Yale so far. Prepare to write some essays.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, describing it as a shallow-depth overview of a variety of diseases.",
    "I would summarize the course as a specific overview into topics in Pathology.Yes, I would recommend this class to to other students. Especially those interested in the the molecular mechanisms of disease.",
    "A really good overview course. Most lectures are very interesting, there is not a lot of work week to week, just 2 exams and a final. Definitely a great intro to a lot of diseases, allows you to learn more about different professors and their interests and explore a bunch of different areas.",
    "Pathology 690 is a course were different professors talk each week about a particular disease that they study, and discuss the molecular basis of the disease, as well as current treatments\/newest findings.This class is very interesting in terms of learning about different diseases, but definitely not for learning about detailed mechanistic studies in each disease. I would recommend it to students looking for an interesting class to take.",
    "It is a series of lectures taught by specialists in that particular discipline. I would highly recommend it because it is a great introduction into pathology.",
    "Path 690 was such an interesting course to take as a student interested in science and hoping to go into medicine (I'm senior at Yale). The course is structured in a \"seminar\" style format with a different faculty member and topic almost every week. It covers a number of different diseases and conditions, the science background to understand them, and the current research going on right here at Yale--all from an expert in the field themselves. The workload is very manageable, with two 4-question take home exams (responses limited to a 1\/2 page-- assigned on Thurs, due the following Tues), 3 discussion sections (unlike undergrad classes, you must actually prepare for these--list of about 10 questions or so), and a 4 page (single spaced) paper on a topic of your choice. The questions are thought-provoking and require you to think about the topic and search the primary literature to formulate a response (and sometimes propose experiments) rather than to simply regurgitate information. I would recommend this class for a senior with prior lab experience.",
    "This was a very interesting class that covers numerous topics. I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because you learn about a range of topics in sufficient and reasonable detail.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would recommend it to another student since it was an excellent review of diseases and their basic principles. The class did a very good job of teaching many basics of cell biology through the lens of pathology.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. The class was very interesting and informative",
    "I would say that it is a good overview of molecular mechanisms of disease. Some of the lectures(the hematology lecture in particular)were subpar, but many were great, especially Dr. Madri.",
    "Pathology 690 is an excellent survey course and introduction to pathology research here at Yale. The class begins with talks on less familiar diseases, but introduces the concept of inflammation, which is recurrent in just about every other disease covered in the rest of the course. By the end of the course, you can expect to feel more comfortable with reading and writing about scientific research related to disease.I would certainly recommend this class to a friend."

   "comments": [
    "I am a first year student and have not yet chosen a lab to join. The overview of multiple diseases given in the course encouraged me to connect various pathologies, and began an interest in some diseases for me.",
    "It helped me think about a lot of different areas of research outside my own discipline and broaden my way of thinking.",
    "This course was a broad overview of many different topics and so it did not contribute directly to my research. However, especially as an undergraduate, it was the perfect introduction to the different types of research one can do and an example of the way advances in science and medicine are so intricately interconnected. I discovered new areas of interest and with my career really just beginning, I feel that this course has opened a number of areas to explore as I decide what I would like to do.",
    "It may not be directly relevant to my dissertation or research, but I am still trying to determine a field ofstudy and this class has been useful in showing me a wide range of fields to study."
