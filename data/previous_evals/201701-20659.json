    "The main goal of Global Catastrophe was to help students develop a nuanced style of thinking and to dig beyond the surface of important scientific dichotomies such as science vs. politics, science vs. religion, and science vs. capitalism. Many people are quick to cast judgement on these issues, so Prof. Rankin worked to help us develop a framework so we can think about these with more background.",
    "I learnt to challenge cartoons, to think less myopically about the Earth and the environment.",
    "Developing key insights into intellectual history study as well as the ability to critically question ideas about science and scientific study through a humanities lens.",
    "learn about the connection between science and: politics, economics, environmentalism, government, etc. with the topics being stuff like global catastrophes like overfishing, global warming, etc.",
    "I learned a lot about history of science.",
    "Most useful information presented was the history of science.",
    "Absolutely none.",
    "Learned about the relationship between science and religion, politics, and business. Some really interesting insights about different trends that go against the conventional wisdom of how science evolved over the years.",
    "This course offers an amazing insight into the relationship between politics, economics, religion, and science through the lens of modern (plus a few ancient and biblical) catastrophes. It was really eye opening as far as challenging my perspectives on the simple dichotomous relationships between between these various topics.",
    "Definitely learned a lot that changed my views and understanding of environmental concepts and science concepts.",
    "Global Catastrophe teaches you how to critically analyze issues about science, politics, and religion\/economics. You learn about issues relating to fish, oil, global warming, and the age of the earth.",
    "This class taught me about analyzing the history behind scientific developments. Rather than just learn about proven scientific theories, we learned about the process of coming up with the correct explanation and the debates that occur between competing viewpoints. This class was a historical analysis of the discussions surrounding seven different catastrophes.",
    "This course raised really interesting questions about science and it's relationship to industry, politics, and the public. I learned about how to think about issues of science more critically, challenging simple narratives of scientific progress and controversy. Many of the questions that we grappled with in this class in the context of environmental science also applied in my other history of science and medicine classes that focused on health and medicine, which made the questions feel that much more important and exciting.",
    "I learned how to think more critically and how to make connections that go beyond the surface level",
    "I learned about what Prof Rankin called the seven catastrophes. We discussed may different aspects of science, such as its role in the public, and its relationship with religion, capitalism, government, etc.",
    "How to analyze scientific history better.",
    "This class teaches its students ways of thinking and ideas that can be applied to a huge number of different fields. It gave me a better understanding of different viewpoints and frameworks, helped me understand how to usefully discuss issues with people with different viewpoints than my own, and gave me perspective on some historical catastrophes that helped me better contextualize present-day catastrophes.",
    "This was an fascinating look into the history of science. The historical aspect - learning about debates on fixism v mobilism, the development of weather maps, the overfishing crisis - was incredibly interesting. I had not learned about most of the discussed \"catastrophes\" in previous history or science classes and the material was both relevant and fun. This course also taught me the classic mistakes people can make when discussing scientific discoveries, such as thinking in terms of dichotomies, and the idea that scientific progress is not linear. A particularly interesting aspect was the look into social construction, and how it could be affecting climate change awareness even now.",
    "This class was super interesting-- really changed the way I think about science. Although there was quite a bit of reading every week, it was pretty accessible and section discussions helped hash out the important points. The world load was low and exams were fair, although there was never an answer key released to tell you where you went wrong. Those are really my only complaints, other than that, this class is really ideal and was a perfect 6th credit! Prof. Rankin is also awesome.",
    "I gained a decent amount of knowledge about the history of past and current global catastrophes and feel better equipped to respond to these problems in the real world.",
    "This class was pretty engaging, interesting, and fascinating. Really taught me how to look beyond a dichotomous point of view for solving real world issues.",
    "I did not expect this class to be really great, but it was! Professor Rankin is an incredible lecturer, and as a student of environmental history it was incredibly helpful in understanding the intellectual history of the discipline. Reading so many different sides to scientific issues is SO important for scientists. He was able to bring in an astounding number of different opinions on each unit. Also, thinking critically about the very institution of science was new to me but now I think it is so important and can't believe I didn't do it before! I would highly recommend this class to science students who want a more historical\/humanities-based analysis of the way science functions in society.",
    "Important global catastrophes that affected our planet. More importantly, I learned that science does not exist in a bubble and that it is connected to numerous other fields like economics and politics."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very well-structured, and you could tell Prof. Rankin has spent a lot of time designing the curriculum to enhance learning without bogging students down with unnecessary readings and mundane details.",
    "Strengths were definitely very engaging professor and very interesting content.",
    "more feedback on op eds and midterm. I got some points off on the midterm and got absolutely no feedback on why. maybe like a word or 2.",
    "I understand that the nature of the material is complicated, but I think the course material should be more organized in a way that the complicated nature of the material can be described clearly. Maybe fewer big words and back and forth of the material may be more helpful?",
    "Lecture slides had strange vernacular. Way too many exclamation points!! Wish it was a little more straightforward. Make sure each TA is qualified to teach the course next time.",
    "Absolutely excellent lectures packed with easy to follow material. Did a great job addressing misconceptions of science. Would have been less engaging to go broader with more examples of the trends discussed but less insightful if we closely read into a small few. Some of the readings are dry, but the professor tries to have us go into them knowing what the takeaways should be.",
    "This class was really amazing and well organized. Lectures and section were engaging and well structured, readings were straightforward.",
    "The strengths: you learn the basic facts of environmental crises and get to know how responses to those crises fit into historical contexts The weaknesses: tough to find certain consistent narratives throughout - definitely learn a lot about disparate issues like science vs. politics\/religion but sometimes it was hard to see the connecting lines through the units.",
    "The design of this class is very good and I think that historical analysis of scientific debate is really important. That being said, the course was difficult to follow at times, largely because we were presented with so many competing viewpoints at once that it became difficult to keep everything in order. Professor Rankin provided a good outline of each lecture at the start of each class, but it didn't seem as if we followed that outline at times. I think there is a lot of good information in this class but it is currently difficult to keep track of everything we learn about. I think either lessening the number of authors and names we need to learn or providing review sheets that include important people would help address this problem.",
    "I think the organization of this course is very conducive to student learning. Both the class as a whole and the individual lectures were structured around overarching themes and questions, which I found very helpful on framing the specific content we learned. Towards the second half of the semester Professor Rankin incorporated more of the readings into lecture, which I think helped the course work seem more cohesive.",
    "I think this course was really well structured with interesting, relevant readings and engaging lectures.",
    "Amazing teacher, amazing content, amazing TAs",
    "I enjoyed it very much, but the readings sometimes felt too long and not necessary to do well in the course. Some lectures felt very abstract as well.",
    "Overall, the course was fantastic and the lectures were particularly strong. Professor Rankin did an excellent job outlining topics of lectures and covering a lot of material each lecture in a memorable and meaningful way, ending each lecture discussing lessons to be learned and questions still to be answered. The only suggestion I would have to improve the class--which was done halfway through class due to feedback from students--would be to have a little more focus on picking out the main points from the reading in section, which was an extremely helpful change halfway through the semester.",
    "It would have been nice to discuss Nuclear Winter some more. I feel like Nuclear Winter and the Ozone Hole were skimmed over a bit in comparison to other catastrophes.",
    "I think if you pay attention in lecture and section and do the readings, you will have everything you need to do well. I found the readings really dull, though, as I'm more of a STEM person.",
    "The class was great overall. I would like to see the slides with more information. The slides were a little annoying to study from because they added one line each time, rather than having all the information on the slide.",
    "The lectures were riveting. Professor Rankin is SO organized and clear in the way he lays out the content and themes of his lectures. It was clear to me every step of the way what the expectations were for me in lecture and in section and with readings\/assignments. Rankin is brilliant, and weaves together so many cool topics into one class. Can't give too many suggestions except that to engage the students a tiny bit more during lecture would have broken up the rhythm a bit and changed the dynamic amongst the students.",
    "Strengths: Great introductory course. Prof Rankin is clearly passionate about this stuff so it shows. Also, Prof Rankin really makes an effort to make the material accessible to people of all audiences, especially since sometimes it can get a little science-y, with the global warming unit, for instance. Weaknesses: I wish the lecture slides were more informative, sometimes a slide would have just a few lines and it'd be hard to see how it connects to the larger picture (which is important in this class!). I understand that this is probably an incentive to make students attend all lectures, but I'm sure there has to be a middle ground. I noticed that Prof Rankin reads off typed notes, so perhaps for future iterations of the course, he could post those written notes on Canvas afterwards."

   "comments": [
    "Take this course if you want to develop a solid framework of the history of science in the United States. Even if you're not interested in the history of science, Global Catastrophe deals with many big-picture problems such as science vs. capitalism, science vs. religion, and science vs. politics. By taking this course, you'll have a better, more nuanced understanding of these problem, and more generally, know more about how the world works.",
    "Yes, really interesting but some TAs are much better than others.",
    "Yes would recommend - interesting content and new skills learnt while workload is definitely manageable.",
    "Not as exciting as I thought it would be but the readings were really interesting. Not AMAZING but still a good class. You shouldn't take it unless this is something you'd absolutely love.",
    "Absolutely, taking the class as a STEM major it offered an enlightening perspective on the development of science over time.",
    "Global Catastrophes is a cool HSHM course that has a pretty clear theme through which Professor Rankin teaches the material. The name of the class may be a bit misleading, since it isn't focused on the catastrophes themselves as much as the social, political, and economic issues surrounding them. It's a history course, not a science one; that being said, it is a cool perspective on science.",
    "Concepts covered in Global Catastrophe were interesting, although we did not go very into depth in this course. If you've taken another class whose material at all overlaps with this one, I would not recommend taking this course. Op-ed assignments were interesting. A major weakness of this course is that the TAs seemed to have extremely little, frankly inadequate knowledge of science (this is a history of science course so that was a big deal), which took away from the overall experience. Maybe it was just my TA, but I hope the course makes an effort to choose more qualified TAs in the future. I didn't like the format of the lecture slides, they were kind of scattered and ambiguous and did not effectively convey necessary information and topics to understand. However, I enjoyed the lectures themselves and gained some new perspectives on science\/religion\/politics\/capitalism\/progress in science after having taken this course. Not a lot of work but midterm and final were really difficult to finish in the time allotted, which grading did not account for.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who doesn't like humanities classes. The class was okay and getting an A or A- (more likely A-) is achievable if you're good at writing or if you binge study terms before the exams. Overall, the material in the class was repetitive, prolonged, and boring. Also, there are 2 or 3 readings a week that aren't particularly helpful to your knowledge of the material as long as you pay attention in lecture. Less interesting than the title of the class makes it out to be. Sections are pretty much useless.",
    "Yes! Its an interesting class that doesn't require too much work outside of the classroom. The grading is also very fair.",
    "As a stem major looking for a humanities credit, this was not a class I enjoyed at all. The material wasn't engaging at all and the readings were only useful in helping me fall asleep at night. No doubt Professor Rankin is an expert in his field, I just personally hated the topic. If I had another chance, I would take another humanities credit. Pros are the workload is manageable and you will get higher than a B if you put the effort into the class, cons is its very uninteresting in my opinion and I don't feel like I learned anything new or particularly useful.",
    "Pretty interesting stuff if you're at all interested in the history of science or big ideas about the relationship between different institutions of society.",
    "good class. beware that this is not really a class about different catastrophes throughout history, but more about the history of science and its nuances. the readings are too much, but you can definitely get by with just skimming them and skipping most of them. midterm and final aren't that bad.",
    "Yes, absolutely! Prof. Rankin is an amazing lecturer and the course material is super interesting.",
    "Great course and rankin is a solid lecturer. Essay tests.",
    "Yes.",
    "No. Unfairly graded for how little we learned.",
    "I would recommend if you are interested in certain environmental crises and are dedicated to doing the readings.",
    "I would",
    "I'm not sure if I would take this course if I didn't have an interest in the history of science already. I expected the class to be primarily about learning how catastrophes such as global warming and the hole in the ozone layer affect the earth but it is more focused on the scientific debates that surrounded those issues. That's completely fine, and I think the right kind of student will really enjoy this class, but if you're expecting to go more into the science of these issues then this might not be the class for you. We do discuss the science a little bit but it wasn't a major focus. That being said, the class does have a light workload. There are two one-page, single-spaced op-eds, a midterm, and a final. Professor Ranking provides review sheets for the midterm and final, which you can bring to the exams, and they are pretty helpful. At times, the grading seemed tough, but it is a pretty low stress class. If you're interested in the history of science and want a class without a lot of work then take this, although it is sometimes difficult to follow the lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! I was not initially excited about this class and was taking it because I needed an out of pathway course for my major. However, this ended up being my favorite course of the semester. We asked a lot of interesting questions about science and I think that any student studying history of science and medicine should consider taking this course. In this course you learn a lot about specific environmental science controverisss\/catastrophes, by more importantly you learn how to think about science as it interacts with social, political, and economic forces.",
    "Yes, absolutely. The course covers a broad number of topics and challenges you to think differently about topics you thought you understood.",
    "Yes!!!!! 1000%",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. It was very interesting and Professor Rankin is great!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I can't think of a major to which this class is not applicable, and Professor Rankin is a wonderful professor. Even if you are not particularly interested in catastrophes, the class gives you an integrated perspective of many different disciplines and an idea of how they might best all work together, and it helps you better understand other points of view and what they might offer when working towards potential solutions to complicated problems.",
    "Amazing lectures, readings were hit and miss as far as how interesting they were (although I stopped doing them later in the semester as I got busier and it became apparent that doing the reading had no effect on my grade). Bill Rankin is a fantastic lecturer! His ideas are frame-shifting, and his delivery is incredibly logical, cohesive, and organized. Section was the worst, but I guess thats largely dependent on the TF and the students in it. The workload is very light, especially considering that the readings are optional, considering completion of the readings probably has no effect on your grade.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a well organized, enlightening course.",
    "I would recommend this to someone interested in this sort of topic or to someone looking for a humanities credit.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone! It really dives into relevant issues in the world and guides you into taking various approaches to understanding the issue and working through the problem. One main point of the class is to tackle complex issues with more than just a scientific or political lens, but using an interdisciplinary approach.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! It is not very difficult, but I still learned a lot during the semester. Professor Rankin is so cool, and would recommend taking a class with him because of how organized and clear his lectures were. Despite not having to work super hard, the readings were mostly good and the assignments were interesting and different (writing op-eds instead of mini papers). The exams were straightforward but did definitely facilitate learning themselves too.",
    "Highly recommend - easy fifth credit. There's not a lot of work throughout the semester (two op-eds and a midterm and a final), but the exams (midterm and final) require a substantial amount of preparation. I would spend an entire day or two studying\/reviewing the material before an exam. But you can get by in the course without doing the readings and just cram\/memorize everything before the midterm or final. Note that it is more of a history class than a science class, so there's a lot of memorization. The exams aren't bad at all, they mostly focus on larger themes. Prof Rankin gives two sets of topics to talk about for the questions, so if there's something you aren't too sure about on the exam, there's something else you can talk about. Don't have to do readings, beyond just skimming for 15 minutes before section to get something to say!",
    "Definitely."
