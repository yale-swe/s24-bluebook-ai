    "This was a fantastic course. I learned how to speak Spanish so much more fluidly and understand Spanish much better. The tests and presentations were not easy, but they were the right level of difficulty to improve my Spanish abilities without being overly difficult.",
    "Spanish fluency, grammar, vocabulary, reading literature",
    "After 140 I feel more confident in my Spanish speaking abilities. I never real felt comfortable speaking in front of people until the end of this course.",
    "I improved my spanish speaking skills as well as my ability to read more complex texts in spanish.",
    "This class definitely helped me with learning Spanish overall, and I feel as if I'm closer to being fluent in the language coming out of the class.",
    "I greatly improved my speaking, writing, reading and listening abilities through this course. I learned the intricacies of the different tenses and when to implement them, and practiced them in class. I stretched my vocabulary and learned about Latin American history and culture through our course readings and films.",
    "I become more confident and comfortable taking a Spanish course at the college level. We covered a variety of grammar-related, as well as cultural, topics, including indicative present tenses, past tenses, compound tenses, and the derivatives of these in the subjunctive mood. Became more comfortable with timed compositions and the ability to do correctives helped me see what mistakes I consistently made so I could work to actively correct them. With the class size, I actually got to know my classmates as well as Dr. Cividanes. We had a blast! Overall, I learned a lot, and this course was one of my favorites this semester!",
    "- improved listening, written, and oral skills in Spanish - became not only more proficient in the language, but the history and culture of Spanish countries as well",
    "I learned a lot more Spanish, and I feel like I definitely improved on my speaking. I just wish the Spanish Department would stop teaching Columbus and his letter of discovery. It is one thing to talk about Columbus as a colonizer and whatever, I think we should still focus on the Indigenous people and their perspectives of interacting with Spanish colonizers, but when they paint this picture of Columbus in class as the discoverer of America I just want to get up and leave the classroom. It is honestly not this professors fault, but I have had to sit through at least one Columbus remembered classes in L2, L3, and L4. Its literally 2019, and we still cant seem to pivot the way that we discuss him in an academic setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: very organized, good emphasis on speaking and conversation, good level of work, tests and presentations were effective Weaknesses: This isn't necessarily a weakness, but sometimes it was a lot that the class met everyday",
    "My fluency definitely improved during the course, and I really enjoyed the readings of the class. That it was everyday helped too. I think that speaking opportunities in the class could be improved; if we had Spanish tables available for L4 students outside of class, or just more opportunities to speak in Spanish outside of the 50 minutes of class, that would help.",
    "This course was challenging. It definitely challenged me. I worked hard to understand the material and learned a lot. If you want to become almost fluent, take this course. It is not easy, but worth it.",
    "One strength was that it met every day, so there was a lot of continuity and a lot fo chanced to practice your spanish. The readings we did throughout the class were well chosen as well. One weakness is that there is a good amount of work since the class meets every day. Especially in the first half of the semester, when we were learning complex grammar, the supersite would reguarly take 45min-1hr each day.",
    "A big strength of this class is definitely Ame. She always cared about every student, and always made learning the material fun.",
    "This course has no weaknesses. The students are immersed by having class everyday and online homework most nights, which is super manageable and complements having class everyday. Professora Cividanes is an incredible instructor as well.",
    "Strengths: Well organized (the whole semester was planned out, which I really appreciated!), lots of support, great professor, manageable work load. Weaknesses: I really can't think of that many. Sometimes the course moved pretty fast, and we couldn't slow down because all the sections had to follow the same schedule.",
    "Strengths - diverse curriculum with many possibilities to succeed - an appropriate amount of challenge - small class size facilitated a teamwork mentality and discussion Weaknesses - Class being held everyday paired with a strict attendance policy made it difficult for students when feeling unwell, stressed, etc. - Supersite often had technical glitches, and the smallest mistakes dropped grades significantly",
    "A major strength is how organized it is, and it honestly has to be. I would never have been able to keep up in that class without the Course Packet. So thank you for that! Oh also I loved the trip to the Art Gallery. That was so cool."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. It greatly improved my ability to speak and understand Spanish. The teaching was very clear and organized. The emphasis of the class was not on memorization of grammar and vocab, but rather on speaking, reading comprehension, listening comprehension, and writing. The things we learned were always applied in real life contexts.",
    "If you are willing to put in the daily effort and you enjoy the language, I would recommend the class.",
    "If you are interested in becoming a better Spanish speaker than yes!",
    "Yes, it was a well-structured course and my teacher taught in a clear way. This class definitely improve my ability and interest in regards to learning spanish.",
    "It's likely that taking this class is a part of the foreign language requirement, but I'd recommend this class to people regardless of the requirement. It was overall a fulfilling course, and I certainly enjoyed the experience.",
    "You should definitely take this class, especially Ame Cividanes' section. She's an absolutely amazing teacher who is understanding and caring of her students, and genuinely wants to help them learn. She's also always on her game, super organized, is great at explaining grammatical points, tenses, etc., and gives great feedback that really helped me learn spanish. As per the course in general, the homework is on a nightly basis but isn't too much at all so long as you keep up with it each day. The exams, presentations and written compositions are all nicely spaced out and fair. The course readings and films are interesting as well.",
    "Yes, yes, yes! VERY well organized, workload was manageable, and I looked forward to class everyday. Everyday class was a challenge at times, but also one of the greatest strengths of this class, as you got to keep speaking and practicing your Spanish everyday. With the class size, I actually got to know my classmates as well as Dr. Cividanes. Everyone felt comfortable being creative and practicing. Very supportive environment. For example, one group's interactive component for a presentation was painting in the style of surrealism, just like the artists they discussed! We had a blast! Overall, I learned a lot, and this course was one of my favorites this semester! I cannot recommend this course enough!",
    "Yes! You really do see a difference\/improvement in your Spanish week by week, and there are many different structured activities throughout the course that adhere to the interests\/learning styles of all students. The small class size also makes it easier to work through academic struggles.",
    "I mean if you need the credit, at least you will come out of it probably being better at Spanish than you were before."
