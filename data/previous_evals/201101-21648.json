    "If you are serious about research in the social sciences, you simply must take this course - it fosters a very healthy academic scepticism. Alan Gerber knows everything there is to know about experimental methods, and will be delighted to share it with you. Highly recommended.",
    "YEAH TAKE IT!",
    "Fantastic class. Really helps shift the way you think about political science as a discipline. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale thus far.",
    "If you're in to quantitative political science, absolutely take this class! Professor Gerber is amazing and cares a lot about his students; the readings are fascinating and not too long, and the final project is really rewarding if you put something into it. I highly recommend this class.",
    "Good course; work load is not that hard and the experiment you run is really interesting.",
    "Good class, but not great. You learn a lot from the experiment in the end."
