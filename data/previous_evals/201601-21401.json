   "comments": [
    "It is a class worth taking. I think the instructor is very important, so if you are unsure, try to shop two sections and decide which seems more appropriate to you. There are review sections, too and I found the ones held by Miki Havlickova and Lake Bookman particularly helpful. I would advise you use office hours and coaching sessions.",
    "MATH 120 is a very challenging class, especially if you are not a STEM person, but I still recommend it because multivariable calculus is important whatever you end up doing. I strongly suggest that you take the class with Miki, Miriam or Daping; I would not recommend Guangyu, he is not engaging and I struggled to follow his classes.",
    "Pseudo interesting material but very hard exams. Would not really recommend taking this class unless its a requirement.",
    "It is a hard course, but one that is not impossible, and one with many resources for students who have trouble. Some truly interesting concepts are covered if one is willing to do the work to fully understand them, and to get help if this is difficult.",
    "Math 120 offers a chance to learn a great deal of material, which is very useful for virtually any STEM major. The workload is difficult yet manageable and rewarding. In addition, if a student wishes to pursue the fields of computer science or math, this course is an essential, as it will teach important concepts with multiple real-world applications. However, at the same time, it is a very enjoyable course for all majors, because it definitely strengthens ones problem-solving skills. I would definitely recommend this course to another student due to its usefulness and excellent teaching style.",
    "Most people who are taking this class are doing so because they must. It's hard and be prepared for challenging exams."
