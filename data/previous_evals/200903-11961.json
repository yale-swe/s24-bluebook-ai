   "comments": [
    "This is a fun class to take, especially if you want to improve your basic musicianship (such as sight singing, interval recognition, dictations). Music major or not, this class will help you significantly. The only downside is the required keyboard lab, which takes a lot of time to practice (you essentially learn how to play figured bass) for a class that is only worth half a credit.",
    "If you are interested in music and have not before taken time to develop your ear this is a great class and well worth the time.",
    "This is an excellent and rewarding course. You basically get to sing and listen to music during class, and have piano lessons once a week. If you're a music-oriented person, what's not to enjoy about that?I loved this class. Wish it was worth a full credit.",
    "Helpful to work on hearing music (intervals, dictation, memory) but it moves very quickly, and if you aren't already fairly proficient it is hard to improve with the limited class time. There is hardly any homework (except for keyboarding), but in a way that's bad, because there are lots of quizzes and it's hard to prepare for them.",
    "Absolutely. This is a great course for anyone who wants to improve their musicianship skills, from novices to experienced vocalists and instrumentalists. This class is a very small time commitment that has much to offer anyone interested in interacting with music."
