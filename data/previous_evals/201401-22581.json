   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend Spanish 660 to another student as an excellent introduction to Cervantes, the Quijote, and 17th-century Spanish literature. The close readings of episodes and the incorporation of historical background\/criticism provided a comprehensive understanding of the Quijote and the major political, social, and literary ideas which inform it."

   "comments": [
    "This course greatly increased my knowledge of 17th-century Spanish literature and the many literary traditions involved in Cervantes' creation of the Quijote. I feel that the analytical approaches used in this course will allow me to better approach other works in the same time period and beyond."
