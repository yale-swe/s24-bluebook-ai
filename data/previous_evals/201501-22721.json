   "comments": [
    "This class may be a lot of work and take a great deal of your time, but Russian is not an easy language to learn. That being said, it's probably the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. Definitely take this one!",
    "Yes! The Russian program is excellent, such a wonderful language class experience.",
    "This class is a logical extension of RUSS 110 and is the same exact course structure. I greatly enjoyed first and second semester Russian. There is no reason to drop after one semester of Russian. Each day is a manageable workload, and yet you learn so much!",
    "I would recommend only for students who are really serious about the language. While I a happy that I took it at Yale, I believe that if Freshman fall I might have not taken it at all due to the difficulty in the class and language as a whole. I do not have any regrets, though.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Russian is challenging- actually it seems to be extremely difficult if you're taking it as your first foreign language or languages are generally not your forte. I found it to be manageable with a background in Latin (since Russian has similar declensions) and French, since they share some words and grammatical constructions. As a non native speaker I briefly considered taking intensive but am now really glad I stuck to normal L1-L2 since there is a LOT of grammar in L2. Julia is an incredible teacher- you must take it with her if you take the class. She's funny, directs an engaging and organized classroom with tons of opportunities to practice speaking, reading, pronunciation, etc. She'll challenge you if you're a language whiz and support you in and out of class if you're struggling. Take Russian- the course is just so well put together if you're interested in the language you should take it.",
    "Definitely. If you want to challenge yourself in a different way, do take it with no hesitation. Russian culture and language is very interesting."
