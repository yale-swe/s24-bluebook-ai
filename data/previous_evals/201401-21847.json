   "comments": [
    "Awesome course! Work hard & Play hard! The performances are what your class makes of them, just don't forget to have fun.",
    "This is a very unconventional class. You study cabaret through secondary historical sources, through contemporary portrayals, through closely related art forms such as novels, plays, movies, etc, and through putting on a cabaret yourself. You also participate in master classes with visiting artists. It's fascinating, but not entirely cohesive for obvious reasons, so be prepared for the fact that synthesizing the information is not easy.",
    "The course is a survey of the history and development of Cabaret throughout Europe. In the latter half, we go into the ways Cabaret is still seen in performance arts today (i.e. burlesque, circus etc.) The readings and part-lecture part-seminar class discussions are accompanied by a series of performance projects. There's a lot of flexibility and freedom in what you perform; the aim is to explore the process of Cabaret by actually creating it.",
    "This is a super fun course. Not too much work, except for at specific times when the performances are happening. This feels like a course that is still being built at this point, so students might have a heavier hand in determining how the course goes."
