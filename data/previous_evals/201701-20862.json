    "This is the first class that has made it clear to me that higher level mathematics is very different from high school mathematics and calculus. I started this class after having taken MATH 225 (Reflection Groups) and with no knowledge of group theory. You might feel unsure the first weeks of class regarding the material, as it moves from groups and subgroups to defining normal groups, the correspondence theorem, classifying finite subgroups of O_2(R) and O_3(R), to looking at the orbit-stabilizer theorem, group actions, root systems and Coxeter graphs. Now that you read this everything will be new, but it is so for almost everyone, so do not be intimidated, even if people have seen or heard some concepts from other classes, e.g. physics. Persist and use office hours.",
    "Learned a lot about n-dimensional symmetry groups, what we can\/can't say about them. It was a nice refresher on linear algebra, and a good introduction to some group theory as well. Proof-based, like most pure-math courses.",
    "The biggest thing I probably got out of the course was a stronger grasp on basic group theory and a much better understanding of Euclidean space and linear algebra. I also got a taste of proof methods I'd never really explored before, such as classification of groups and constructing elaborate bijections. Overall, a very fruitful, and confidence-building class before taking abstract algebra next semester.",
    "I developed basic group theory knowledge, as well as practical knowledge of linear algebra.",
    "This course was the first math course I have taken \"for fun\" aka by my own volition and not for my major and I would really advise it! It was a wonderful introduction to group theory and just generally really interesting material."

    "The textbook used for this class is Grove's and Benson's \"Finite Reflection Groups\" of Springer-Verlag. During the first half of the class, I learned most of the material from Prof. Qi's notes and Michael Artin's \"Algebra.\" The second half of the semester, we focused on root systems of reflections and Coxeter graphs and this is when I used Springer's textbook. Someone in our class described it as \"compressed.\" There's a lot of material in that textbook and many steps are justified by being \"natural\" consequences of previous observations. Prof. Qi's notes are much more useful, especially the second half of the class. An element that makes the class challenging is that there is no fixed textbook. I only figured out what parts to read by looking at both Artin and Grove & Benson and whenever I would notice something familiar from lecture, I would go on and read the lesson on X textbook. Homework was assigned once in two weeks and included 5-8 problems. The problems were challenging for me, as I was not very experienced in proof methods and I could not see right away which way to go about a problem. Office hours and talking to other classmates helped.",
    "The first half of the class served as a pretty good introduction to group theory, while the second half leads up to the discussion of reflection groups. Honestly, none of the material ever became too abstract -- perhaps only the first half of the class if it's one's first time dealing with group theory, but some of the proofs are quite tedious and very long. Thankfully, for some of the longer proofs, like the classification of all finite reflection groups, one only needs to understand the general idea and methods. My one qualm with the course is that sometimes, it feels like the lecture isn't able to fully elaborate on some of the key ideas of a given topic, and one is forced to resort to the class textbook (Grove and Benson's Finite Reflection Groups), which probably has some of the unconventional and difficult to read notation I've ever seen in a math textbook.",
    "I enjoyed that the course had an arc, and there was a clear big picture motivation for what we were doing. That being said, I believe that certain proofs\/lemmas could get confusing because I wasn't sure what their purpose was. Along with this, it sometimes felt like we were going through so many different topics, and we didn't have time to become familiar with them before we had already moved on. Only at the end of the course did I realize how they all played in together.",
    "The course is hard and moves quickly and sometimes understanding what is going on in class on a given day can be hard but its very well organized and if you take your time things come together in a really awesome and engaging way. One thing that could be changed was the grading scheme which ended up being kind of confusing. I think one 5 minute quiz may have ended up being the same percent of our grade as the midterm.",
    "Went a little fast over the reflection groups part. Otherwise a great intro and review of group theory and advanced linear alebra."

    "I would recommend this class. It is challenging and a lot can be done to improve it (having Prof. Qi compile notes into a book would help, telling students which chapters in which books to read before\/after each class would also help), but I really liked what we were learning. It was completely new to me (I had taken linear algebra the previous semester), but I have some better understanding of higher level mathematics. Prof. Qi advises students to take classes simultaneously in math and not in isolation, so that what you learn here can also come up and be used in another class. He recommended us to take Abstract Algebra next semester, since Reflection Groups is part of abstract algebra. Make sure to make time for this class.",
    "Definitely worth taking this course, especially if you're in the math major. A lot of pretty mind-expanding geometrical concepts, and a lot of good work with group theory in a (relatively) more applied setting.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student if they were looking for an introductory math course to ideas of group theory and general proof writing. However, I would not recommend this to someone who already has a fair amount of experience.",
    "Definitely! If you have any interest in math this course is excellent. It definitely helped me refine my linear algebra skills and gave me a good base for group theory all while getting to play with\/think about shapes and symmetries."
