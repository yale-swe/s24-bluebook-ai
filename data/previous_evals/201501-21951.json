    "A good class if you have little experience with writing academic papers. Might be limiting if you are an experienced writer or if you are looking for a writing course with room for creativity and flexibility in writing styles. Also choose a section with a topic you are interested in, otherwise the workload will just be oppressive.",
    "This class is a must if you are interested in social media, technology, and a bit of analytical writing. If you want the easy A, this is not the place to get it. Professor Klemann is serious about writing, and everyone in the class was equally as serious. You should be ready to put in the work and a lot of hours for each paper, but if you enjoy writing and utilize the resources like peer editing and office hours, this class should be very, very enjoyable. Professor Klemann is amazing, and you will not regret taking this class. And I feel that my writing has improved steadily over the semester, and I feel more confident about my writing than I ever did before. Ask a lot of questions, throw out ideas even when you think they're crazy because Professor Klemann loves original claims and they're what really makes your paper shine. Definitely recommend!",
    "It was helpful with my writing and very interesting.",
    "Although by the end of the semester I was definitely feeling tired of writing essays, I still really appreciate what I have learned about formal argumentative writing from this class. Professor Klemann was very helpful and was clearly devoted to teaching us, so I'd definitely recommend taking her class if you can. If you like essay writing, then you'll definitely enjoy this, and if not, then this class is still fairly interesting and isn't too much work for a writing credit.",
    "It's a great course for becoming a much better writer. Don't take it during a semester where you won't be able to dedicate a lot of time to it, because the writing does take up a good chunk of time, but you will get sooooo much more out of the course if you put in the time to work on your writing.",
    "I came in to this course as a sophomore STEM major who really needed a writing course to fulfill the distributional requirements. I had heard there were easier writing courses out there that are a lot less work, but I chose ENGL 114 because the reviews were great and I wished to improve my writing, even if I would not seriously take another writing course at Yale. ENGL 114 turned out to be one of my most rewarding classes. I saw my writing improve immensely, I met some incredible students and became close with them, and most importantly, I became more confident in a subject that I was always a bit shaky in. I definitely recommend this course - the work load is a bit heavy, but it is fair and certainly worth it.",
    "I do recommend this course to another student, especially if you're looking for a course that will help you improve your writing to whatever it is that you feel is 'Yale' level writing. I came into this course looking to improve my writing because of my insecurities with my writing. I feared that I was behind in my abilities as a writer here at Yale, but taking this course has shown me that not only am I a better writer than what I thought I was but I have also become a better writer through that process. This course gives you that opportunity. Take the course. You won't regret it.",
    "Digital Childhood was a fun and engaging discussion-based class with a lot of writing and reading, but the amount of work is justified. You will look forward to coming to this class every day. If you have any interest in how digital technology has influenced childhood and you would like to greatly improve your writing skills, please take this course.",
    "I would recommend English 114 08 to another student."
