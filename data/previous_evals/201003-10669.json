    "Take the class, take any class with Alex. The seminar was experimental, challenging and rigorous. Each student was demanded a lot of, particularly in reference to presentations and discussion. If you are interested in learning and challenging tropes of knowledge and methodologies you ought definitely take the course.",
    "This course was structured around geographic locations of the Civil War and focused primarily on the ways in which nineteenth-century Americans experienced the war and expressed those experiences. The readings cover a broad range of issues, are fascinating to read, and, together, told a story of the American Civil War unlike any I had previously been exposed to.If you are looking for a course to learn about the war's battles and generals, this is not the one to take. Coming to the course without a strong background in American art, I had hoped to gain a deeper understanding of the broader trends in the history of art during this period as they related to the Civil War.The discussions that focus on the writing of history and the way that we experience the past may be useful for students in a range of disciplines."

    "At the first class, Professor Nemerov outlined sixteen points that framed the class for the semester. These points, and their manifestations, are ones that I will return to again and again. The research paper allowed me to explore a topic that I had long been fascinated by, and will likely contribute to the ways in which I approach my own field of interest."
