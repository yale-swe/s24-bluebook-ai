    "It feels unfair to evaluate this workshop in the questionnaire format that applies to other courses. Strengths include free lunch and coming together as an intellectual cohort (not necessarily in that order!) It offers an ideal format for being guided through the requirements for writing a prospectus and taking the oral exam, while also not being too time intensive. In questions 4-8 on this form, my answers are driven primarily by the format: it's not a course, it's meta-support. For that, it was well organized and well run. I wouldn't change anything."

    "The prospectus workshop is a useful format for bringing AMST graduate students together to impart and share information on the dissertation process. It can feel as much like a support group as graduate student training--but I consider this to be its strength."
