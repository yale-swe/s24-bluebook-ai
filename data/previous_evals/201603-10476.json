   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I developed scientific writing and analytical skills through this course. I also further developed by bench lab skills, including reflux and recrystallization, and further perfected skills learned in CHEM 222L.",
    "Reflux, reflux, reflux",
    "This course was pretty interesting, but your experience in the lab completely depends on who you get as a TA. Luckily, my TA was great but all of the experiences I learned the most from had little to do with the course framework itself and had more to do with who I was randomly assigned to. Hopefully there is good continuity in the quality of TAs otherwise it could have been another required lab drag.",
    "I gained considerable confidence in the lab environment over the course of this Lab. In comparison with the first semester, where the hands-off nature of TA interactions felt scary at first, I was used to it, and the somewhat repetitive nature of the labs themselves (reflux in a round-bottom flask, crystallize, filter: repeat) helped me feel like I understood more of the procedure. I got some practice with mechanism, and learned both umpolung chemistry and diphenyl shifts, as terms, but did not have either explained to the depth that I would have liked.",
    "Relative to orgo 1 lab, I learned how the finer aspects of chemical structure (mainly due to conjugation\/resonance) affect reactivity and how they can be used in identifying that compound. I also learned what specific analytical chem data matters in a research setting and how they are used to present results.",
    "Experimental techniques, concepts of organic chem reactivity, good laboratory practices, and scientific writing skills",
    "Organic chemistry lab is definitely a critical supplement to the lecture class, as it definitely helps to understand the concepts learned in the latter by applying them in practice. That being said, this course is certainly not a repetition of previous classes, as there are new methods and principles that are best learned through a more hands-on approach. Beyond that, practice managing experiments in this course also helped with my research outside of class.",
    "I refined the lab skills I learned in organic chemistry I lab and became much more efficient at performing tasks and analysis. We did reflux, TLC, mp, IR, NMR and more. I also was better able to understand how organic chemistry theory that I learned in lecture could be applied in practice."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are its focus on developing more independent lab student, and its emphasis on the process of experimentation, rather than only on results.",
    "We kept repeating similar experiments with different reagents, which got a little boring. But that made it great to really understand the reaction mechanisms and learn everything you need to know about reflux, TLC, IR, NMR etc.",
    "The chemical knowledge that this course felt like it was trying to impart, backed up by the multiple-choice final instead of a practical, seemed to be coming more from the concurrent CHEM 221 lecture than from this. This lab allowed a tactile understanding of some basic elements of the chemistry that we are asked to learn, but the short lectures (mostly going over mechanism) are not enough to persuade me that the exam is testing the main focus of the class, and the repetitive nature of procedures feels like it wastes an opportunity for breadth of learning. The emphasis on formatting in the post-lab assignments, and the sheer number of points that were accounted for in that, rather than in the chemical content of the report, seemed to defeat the learning purpose of the exercises. If the nature of the report is to engage us with chemical thought, then the point values should reflect this. If, like many poorly taught high-school classes, the point is discipline, then I feel like this is a misguided approach. And if it is truly to prepare for the \"real world\", and \"real scientific publishing\", then I feel that we should attempt to analyze the experiments that we have accomplished and write cohesive summaries in a publishable style, if not on a publishable topic itself.",
    "This course is strong in that it is very well organized and complements the lecture well. You gain a lot of practice with basic procedures and really learn the chemistry behind what you're doing. I do wish though that we gained exposure to more synthesis and analytical techniques. With the exception of NMR, pretty much every week was show up, add reagents to a flask, heat at reflux, vacuum filter product, analyze through melting point\/TLC\/IR, rinse and repeat.",
    "The course was very well organized, and each lab was designed to teach a certain aspect regarding experimental practices or an organic chem concept. The one thing I would say is that there seemed to be a disconnect between the expectations outlined for writing lab reports and the actual grading -- for example, when we were told to draw out a mechanism from an existing scientific paper, we were then penalized for writing the wrong mechanism even though the mechanism was taken directly from the paper given to us. In addition, it seemed that grading was significantly more harsh compared to CHEM 222L, which meant that we had surprising low grades throughout the course as we adjusted to the new expectations. Perhaps better communication of the new grading expectations would have led to a smoother transition between 222L and 223L.",
    "This course definitely feels like the cumulative result of the previous semester, and the labs feel all the more interesting because of it. The manual was always informative when preparing post lab assignments, and the lab text was a good resource for explaining the necessary concepts. The TAs are very helpful in the pre-lab lectures as well as during the experiments themselves; it is thanks to them that I always felt prepared and got so much out of this class.",
    "The course is strong in that it repeats the same types of techniques and students become proficient in them. This lab also related to the lecture better than the first semester and I think I genuinely learned more chemistry. However, many of the analysis performed in lab is antiquated and not actually used in current research. We only used NMR, used in all organic chemistry labs, in the last week of the course."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely! One the better labs I have taken at Yale. Dr. DiMeglio is a great course instructor, who is very hands-on with her students and TAs. Enjoy it!",
    "The lab reports are really easy and short and the final lab exam is also only an hour multiple choice exam. Best chem lab I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, I learned more about biological mechanisms of organic chemical reactions.",
    "You only take this because you're required to, but if you'd like to sacrifice an entire afternoon doing chemistry lab then this is the course for you!",
    "Don't you have to take this course? For those of you who do - you'll be fine. It's run the same way as the last half, and you don't have to worry too much. Just remember to format everything perfectly, and once you've gotten points taken off of a post-lab assignment for something like labeling an IR spectrum, don't be me, and forget to do it the next time around, too. For those of you who don't, and are considering this course anyways, kudos. As I said, you'll still be fine, and you must already know what it's like, having taken CHEM 222L. I don't think that the minimal intellectual challenge is worth taking it without a requirement, honestly, and while I think that the final exam is easy to study for, it doesn't feel like it's as related to the course's teaching as you would want it to be. AKA, more stress than that's worth, and unrelated to what you want to learn. Find something interesting instead.",
    "While I doubt anybody would take organic chemistry lab for fun or out of pure interest, if you happen to be enrolled in the orgo 2 lecture, it wouldn't hurt to also take this course. It's pretty low key (exact same format as 222L, but with less focus on nitpicky formatting things and more focus on content), and you learn interesting material that complements the lecture well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is my personal favorite of the lab classes that I have taken here so far, which I attribute to the dedicated instructors. Unsurprisingly, I would recommend trying to take this course with the corresponding lecture class, but it is not unreasonable to separate the two.",
    "The class is good but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it. It's not super interesting unless you really like chemistry (in which case you're probably in a major where it's required) but it's a good solid course with a manageable workload.",
    "Most students take the lab because they have to (pre-med, major requirements) but it was enjoyable. Orgo labs overall are way better than gen chem labs and second semester orgo lab was focused more on the synthesis of various compounds that aptly illustrated mechanisms learned in the corresponding orgo lecture as opposed to the the technique focused first semester orgo lab."
