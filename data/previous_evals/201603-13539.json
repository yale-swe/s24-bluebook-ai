The only adjustments I would suggest are having either a large term paper in stead of the mini papers, as there wasn't much space to really get into our chosen topics. I also wish the two exams before the final were so memorization based. This made it possible to do well on the exams without understanding the material or what one was writing.

   "comments": [
    "As someone with previous exposure to domestic healthcare, the classroom experience didn't add much value for me beyond the slide decks. I don't know that this could really be improved upon - it's likely the nature of the beast when teaching a big lecture class that needs to cover a lot of content.",
    "Too many things to memorize for the exams and too many exams!!!",
    "I enjoyed the course overall. I thought the short writing assignments were a nice way to think a little more in depth on some topics of interest. I felt some time pressure in the exams, especially the first one, which I felt was much more difficult than the second, especially the quotation fill in the blank from the Whole Foods exec. Aside from that, I thought the course was very well done, though a bit fast, I enjoyed it overall.",
    "This was probably my favorite class so far. Dr. Schwartz definitely knows his material and even though the lecture is very long, I think he does a good job of keeping things entertaining. The current events section at the beginning of each lecture is my favorite part. I wish we had more time or opportunity for in-class discussion.",
    "By far one of the best courses I have ever taken. Jason is exceptionally knowledgeable, approachable, and helpful. Would recommend this course to anyone and everyone.",
    "Superb. Loved it.",
    "I did not really enjoy the papers but the course overall was good! I learned a lot about health policy and it was presented in an interesting manner through graphs and others images.",
    "very useful class!",
    "This course was fantastic. We covered all of the basics of health policy in a thorough and thoughtful way. I liked how we related all of the topics back to current events and were able to have open discussions about things that are currently happening in health policy. There was a lot of reading, but it was all really interesting information. All of the information was presented in a clear way. The course was organized in a way that people who were unfamiliar with policy could access the material, but the people who had a lot of experience with it were not bored. I really enjoyed both of the writing assignments, as they allowed me to explore the topics in a way that I found interesting. I did think the questions and grading of the exams was overly specific, especially for the length of time we had to complete the exams. For most of the questions that I had points taken off for, I would have been able to provide the complete answer if I had more time.",
    "The class does involve a lot of readings, but all help to understand the material covered in class. The exams are fair, but challenging.",
    "I love this course. The lectures are well-structured, the information provided is both useful and suitable for our level (especially for students that are not on health policy track), and the course materials are interesting and clear.",
    "This course would be better delivered in a MOOC format (with the capacity to watch lectures at 2x speed). If you have prior knowledge of American healthcare, the vast majority of this class will be review.",
    "Interesting topics covered and writing assignments are a great opportunity to synthesize ideas and share opinions.",
    "This was my favorite course this semester.",
    "I really enjoyed health policy. This class shaped me from a person who felt completely unqualified to comment on anything policy-related to someone thinking about switching to the policy department. The class covers a wide range of topics in enough detail that you feel that you can talk about them without being too overwhelming. I thought that the two written assignments were thought-provoking and the tests were fair. I especially enjoyed the lecture on vaccinations, likely because that's Jason's area of interest. My only complaint is that the final was scheduled on the same day as the epi final -- why? With a whole week of potential dates, the first years don't need to be subjected to that stress.",
    "Fantastic course! The only weakness was the use of the clickers, as the surveys didn't seem to provide additional information.",
    "GREAT. I wasn't sure what to expect from this class...the material has the potential to be dry and dull but I LOVED the course. Extremely relevant information + presented in an engaging manner.",
    "I think that the course was good in that it gave a broad overview of health care in america. I think that i didn't leave with so much poicy information as insurance and the way the healthcare system works. For me that works but i don't think i got a good understanding of how health policy itself is made and operates.",
    "the best part was that the instructor used to dedicate first 5-10 mins or so discussing the latest news relevant to health policy, I always looked forward to that. I liked the idea\/topic of 2 short assignments too. The clicker questions were all very interesting and a great way to keep the students engaged and express their view point on certain aspects of health policy. Overall very well designed course.",
    "Strengths include the writing assignments and discussions which allowed us to synthesize what we'd learned; the \"in the news\" section which tied material back to the \"real world\"; and the radiant enthusiasm of the instructor. There were few weaknesses aside from the fact that it can be difficult to pay attention for a 2.5 hour lecture.",
    "I loved this class, Jason made the course material extremely accessible and easy to understand although the long course time was a struggle",
    "It's a really hard class especially for international students. I struggled a lot, not only for the language but also for the unfamiliar with health care system in America. I tried very hard this semester, however, I may just be able to get a pass. Maybe it should not be mandatory for every students.",
    "I liked the topic and how it related to current events. My main issue with the class was its length. It was too long a block of straight lecturing (we did have a break at the midpoint), and I often found it difficult to concentrate, especially in the second half of class. (This was made worse by my class schedule, because this course fell in the middle of an almost seven-hour block of classes. Perhaps other with fewer classes that day were less bothered by the length.) Another issue I had was that I was not quite sure about how to prepare for the first test. I think more information on what to study would be useful, as well as TAs that were better informed about the test's contents. Then again, the first test in any class is always harder to prepare for.",
    "This course was REALLY well-organized and Jason was exceptionally transparent in all grading and assignments given. His lectures were cohesive and flowed so well. I was actually excited to go to class each Thursday because I just had to sit there and take in the information and learn. The exams were a little frustrating at times. In particular, the memorization portions that were mandatory really didn't represent my mastery of the material, thus I constantly lost points on those sections. The final was a really great way to summarize the semester and all the varying intricacies of the US health system and show how much we have learned. BUT, writing for 2.5 hours is the worst thing in my life that I have done (even more painful than a PhD defense). Wish there was a way to change it. The writing assignments were an interesting way to individually analyze material that we are interested in. I would almost suggest to incorporate more of those.",
    "Strength - loved that we would start every single lecture with an \"In The News..\" section. This really helped me connect class material to current events. Also liked that we have a break in the middle of lecture. I thought the HW were good at incorporating our own interests into the class material - really appreciated that. Weakness - Not a major critique, but it would have been great to have been given a numeric grade value on our HW assignments (we were only given H, HP, P, etc). This made it hard to determine where in the class we stand in regards to grades going into the final.",
    "Lectures can be long, as it's on Thursday afternoon from 3-5:20pm. However, the halfway break was helpful. The content was really interesting- I looked forward to reading for the class each week.",
    "Fascinating material, interesting readings. Sometimes the professor can ramble about the material, saying the same thing a few times. But I think it's because he's so passionate about the material",
    "One suggestion is to provide grading rubrics for papers and final written exam. Grading sometimes felt arbitrary so it would have been nice to have a sense of what graders were looking for. There felt like too many slides to memorize for exams, though I don't know what you can really do about that. Enjoyed the format - papers were very manageable and the two exams really did help facilitate my learning, though perhaps it would be better if they were more focused on big ideas instead of little details such as what is PCORI. Jason is a great lecturer and I felt inspired to be in his presence. I'm a health policy student so really enjoyed our little seminar-type discussions to delve into the material more deeply, though perhaps Jason could have talked less so we could express our opinions more.",
    "I thought this was a great course, it's just A LOT of information to learn. I honestly didn't do a whole lot of learning during actual class time in terms of preparing for the exams. For exam, I had to re-learn a lot of the material again by transcribing the professors slides.",
    "There is a lot of material in this course and I appreciated the professors work to tie in what we were learning to practical events using news stories and other relevant information. The class does drag a bit but that could be due to the length and late-afternoon timing. I enjoyed the two assignments and was glad we did not have a required section. I don't think we needed to have two mid-term exams even though I understand why that was done as the final was more of a test of bringing themes together (it still might be easier to just have two exams with the final being on the second half of the course). Additionally the first exam and the final exam were too long. The professors estimates on timing are not enough and it is really too hard to complete everything that is required. On an unrelated note it might be nice to include some information on dental care\/insurance since many people don't have it and it is especially important to children and low income communities.",
    "Lots of reading. Not necessarily a bad thing. I thought the little essays this year were a HUGE improvement over the notorious group projects of last year, which sounded like an unholy nightmare. I also learned a lot from the essays without feeling stressed by them. I thought the mid-semester tests were fair. We were given lots of information about every assignment and test well beforehand, which was great. As for the final exam, I have no idea how they're going to grade that. I kind of wish that it had been more like the other two mid-semester tests, but comprehensive.",
    "Having taken the upper-level class and being a policy student, this class was a waste of time.",
    "excellent class",
    "I think the lecture was a great introduction to the topic, especially for people who had never taken a health systems of policy course. However, I do wish we delved more into the politics of our health system rather than sticking with facts and numbers.",
    "Very good course overall. Covers a range of material in health policy and in an interesting manner.",
    "Very organized presentation of material and course in general.",
    "some of the readings were too long. and the final exam could have been a final paper instead of in-class essays",
    "The course included a lot of reading despite significantly being reduced from last years. However, most of the readings were summarized succinctly in the lecture slides. Professor always encouraged participation which helped contribute to an interesting conversation about health policy, especially about experiences abroad. Moreover, the length of the class is rather longer than it should be which makes it difficult to be attentive. It almost feels like a marathon.",
    "I loved this course! The lecture was very thorough and interesting. I enjoyed all the readings.",
    "Strengths- Should be a mandatory course for everyone who wants to know how US health system is run as compared to other major health systems in the world.",
    "Content was interesting. Strengths - allowed us to focus on our interests through assignments. Weaknesses - tests had questions on quotes and axis of tables instead of basic principles - which is not informative or useful for non-policy concentrations.",
    "Very interesting and comprehensive course that approached aspects of health policy from varying perspectives; I'm interested to see what the material will be next year.",
    "2",
    "A great intro course if you don't have any health policy experience. However, if you're hoping to go in-depth with any particular topic, you'll be disappointed (except for vaccinations, which is Jason's primary area of research). The assignments give you an opportunity to go a little more specific and thoughtful with policy questions, but I only wished that we did so in class.",
    "It provides you with a detailed overview of the US healthcare system and since that is the main focus of the class- it accomplishes that task very well. However the weakness is that there is so much information thrown at us that only requires rote memorization and not a thorough understanding of the intricacies of health care policy. I wish the class had placed a greater emphasis on critical thinking and maybe walked us through the challenges of changing or creating health care policy.",
    "Lots of work burden, and the exams cover too much elementary knowledge, and more discussion may be better",
    "It is a good introduction of the health policy in U.S.",
    "Great class!",
    "Good overview of the American healthcare system and its myriad and complex components. Professor Schwartz was an engaging lecturer, especially considering the long lecture time and potentially dry material. Appreciated the time we spent diving into the ACA and its role in (re)shaping American healthcare. Perhaps it would be outside the scope of the course, but I would have liked a little more exploration of \"health policy\" in addition to \"health systems.\" The ways in which policy impacts health of a population are not limited to concerns over how professional healthcare is organized, financed, and delivered (which was the overwhelming focus of the course). Also would have liked to see more analysis of the IMPACT of various policy decisions on actual health outcomes (ex. comparative analysis of outcomes in states choosing to expand Medicaid post-2014 vs. those choosing not to expand).",
    "This course covers a lot of ground, however it's taught in a very dense fashion that can be inaccessible to students with variable learning strategies. Dr. Schwartz speaks very quickly for 3 hours and individuals who have a hard time with auditory learning may quickly get lost, as I did. Thankfully most of the material is captured in the slides and readings, but in general I did not find it to be a particularly pleasant learning experience.",
    "The class time is much too long. Impossible to pay attention",
    "I think this class gives a good basic overview of the US Health care system. Useful class.",
    "Overall, I greatly enjoyed this class and learned a lot. Before taking this course, I knew basically nothing about health policy and this course definitely sparked my interest. My only concern was that I felt the two short writing assignments were graded really hard. I think it would have been beneficial for the graders to take into account that not everyone had a background in health policy. Based on the comments I got on both of my papers, I felt that I was expected to know a lot more than I did.",
    "Great course but has way too much information.",
    "Great course Good learning experience",
    "I finally have a grasp on the US health system, including knowledge of the events that have shaped our current policies. The professor knows a remarkable amount amount about health policy. The only weakness is that it's a long lecture on Thursday afternoons and thus you cover a lot of material in one block each week.",
    "Most of the content given in this class is very interesting. However, it is a very academic class both in style and in content. Most of the learning happens outside the class through readings which are very interesting but demand an unrealistic amount of time per week. The lecture itself is very long and hard to pay attention throughout its duration. The content given in each class is excessive and therefore each class is difficult to process. This is why most of the learning happens when students can sit down go through the lecture and the readings but that is extremely unlikely to happen with all lectures and throughout the whole course. If able to commit 65% of the time a proper learning process for this class -as it stands now- requires, then by the end of the semester students will have a good comprehensive idea of some relevant topics to health policy. Although the midterm exams are not conducive to learning. I believe it could be improved if spent more time to teach relevant topics more in depth, and reducing the amount of topics. The first, introductory session should be less in content and time. In addition it could benefit from a more professional, less academic oriented style since health policy is extremely relevant and applicable subject.",
    "I learnt lots of useful things from this course, but many information is not related to my future and some are a little bit boring",
    "We were given a lot of content in this class, which didn't necessarily feel like the most useful way to think about health policy. I have taken health policy before, and I was hoping to get more concrete skills out of this class that might include how to write better about health policy, or how to think about policy development more critically. The way the information was presented was a bit overwhelming. I think this class would be much better if we had a shorter lecture paired with a weekly discussion section so that we could apply and talk about some of the content we were learning. I also wish the assignments had a little more feedback, or that we maybe had more regular work throughout the semester so that there was more room to figure out how we might be able to think more critically or differently about the topics we were covering. I don't think I learned anything from doing the assignments, or that I improved how I could write or talk about policy. It also felt like the tests covered so much material that it would be helpful to spread the work out a little more.",
    "It's a great course. Could be better by incorporating other health systems of other countries more.",
    "This class is fine. Not terrible, not great. It's heavily lecture based and he wants to know a lot of details for the exams (even though he says he doesn't).",
    "Great course that gives you a nice overview of health care systems, including the basic terminology and concepts, with an emphasis on the US but coverage of other countries as well.",
    "Long lectures are hard to sit through, should have been more concise at beginning of class. This class should meet twice a week instead of once. Still too many course readings. Would have liked to have heard more of a policy analyst perspective on certain topics. Tests covered some trivial details like that exact words a random CEO said or how to do calculations we never saw an example of in class. Homeworks should have utilized a priori rubric. Homework and midterms graded too harshly for a required introductory course.",
    "This course provides a broad overview of US health policy and health systems, while also providing substantial details on specific topics within the larger system. It provides you with a crucial understanding of health policy that will help you no matter what you want to do with your MPH. It provides you with a language to understand current events and engage in informed arguments about your positions. I would recommend that the course be taught in two shorter sections in the future. This would help greatly with attention span and improve engagement with the material.",
    "I think the information provided was good and offered insight into the different ideas about certain topics. I think there were a lot of readings that made it easy to fall behind. I think the opportunity to have a facilitated discussion on some of the ideas in the papers would be helpful in understanding the topics and better understanding the different opinions on them.",
    "It is a great overview of the structures and systems that comprise health policy in the US as well as in other countries. Provides a very comprehensive and detailed overview of US health care and health insurance. However, I thought the lectures were way too long--a lot of the information presented could have been condensed. I also thought it was really repetitive for health policy students in particular. I loved the lectures on global health, vaccines, and comparative health systems--it was a nice way to learn about the US health system from a variety of angles.",
    "very well planned and thought out, topical - the 'in the news' sections were much appreciated. the class size was v big and as such it was not conducive to discussion , but the small group sessions for policy students were a great addition.",
    "This course is wonderful. Professor Schwartz is incredibly intelligent and an engaging lecturer. He clearly cares about this class and his students a great deal. This was by far the best class I have taken at YSPH. You learn so much and Professor Schwartz makes all of the material manageable. Great class!",
    "Great course. Fill in the blanks is not a good examination question for graduate students.",
    "Information regarding the U.S. healthcare system. Basically memorizing facts.",
    "I learned so much thank you, Dr. Schwartz!",
    "Exam styles need to be changed",
    "Strengths: material Weaknesses: amount of reading, length of class",
    "This was definitely the course in which I learned the most. Professor Schwartz was very energetic and, although the 2 1\/2 hour lecture was a very long time to pay attention, he made the large amount of material as engaging as possible. I definitely enjoyed the class more once we got into more case studies, like the Vaccination class and the Comparative government class, but I also appreciated how the material in the first half, although a bit dry, gave me a solid foundation of understanding for the case studies. The one class that I think we could've done without was the one on Global Health, because it was a somewhat shallow introduction to a subject many students had already studied in greater depth. I think it might have been more interesting to do another case study like Vaccinations, which was super engaging.",
    "This course focused too much on memorization and not enough on conceptualization. We should have been required to give greater consideration to the big picture in health policy. One of the most useful exercises was the final exam, but we will not be receiving feedback on that.",
    "Very comprehensive overview of the U.S. Health Policy system. This semester was also an interesting time to take it given the elections and possible consequences of the new administration. Strengths: Detailed lectures; useful for those who do not have a lot of background knowledge on U.S. Health Care\/Health systems. Weaknesses: There was a lot of material condensed into each lecture that made it hard for me to retain the material\/continue paying attention, especially during the latter half of each session. If it's possible to break up the weekly lecture into two, shorter ones, then I think students would get more out of the sessions.",
    "strengths: class structure was very well organized. Lectures were very engaging and course material was relevant to current events. Thoughtful assignments were given which corresponded to course material most recently taught.",
    "A great overview of US health policy. My only complaint would be the level of minute detail we needed to memorize for the exams.",
    "I think that the course was great, except for the scheduling. It would be better to have the course twice a week for an hour, rather than one 2.5 hour block. And preferably in the morning, if that would be possible, instead of the afternoon.",
    "Strengths: Pace of course was great. Material very interesting. Jason is an amazing lecturer, very knowledgable and the most organized professor I have ever had! Loved his class. Weaknesses: The last 15 min of class it was always a little tough to concentrate (after 5 pm)... a little long.",
    "A great overview of the US healthcare system and current debates in US (and global) health policy. The course was fantastic. My only complaint is that the 2.5-hour lecture block was a bit unwieldy, especially so late in the afternoon; a twice-weekly lecture of 75 minutes might be more suitable for this course."

I think I enjoyed health policy more than I would have, if I had another professor.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Excellent instructor, very interactive and engaging",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is an incredible instructor. He is so well-versed in the topics, and keeps up to date on current events so he's always able to make things relevant. His energy kept the class interesting for the full two and a half hours and he did a great job of keeping us engaged the whole time. His ability to answer any and all questions is truly impressive. He is very approachable and always willing to help students with anything, whether or not it's course-related. Despite it being such a big class, he was able to make it feel like a small seminar course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is a phenomenal speaker and always keeps the material presented in class VERY recent (usually includes news that came out the same day). It was a pleasure to get to listen to him speak about health policy, especially in the midst of the 2016 election.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is an excellent lecturer and a great professor outside the classroom. His classes are always interesting (although they are SUPER long and only once a week), class materials (readings) are great and relevant, and he is always approachable outside of the class. He's super fast in replying e-mails and always make himself available for students who need help. BEST PROFESSOR EVER!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwarz is a capable lecturer with broad knowledge of the field and a passion for teaching. He has a difficult task in teaching this intro seminar. I'd like to see a lot more time spent on comparison between the US and foreign health systems.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Wonderful professor whose passion shows during his lectures. Does an excellent job of teaching students the basics in order to set a foundation for understanding the bigger picture of health policy in the U.S. Approachable and always willing to discuss various topics with students.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0There is no one else on the planet like Jason Schwartz. He is by far the best instructor I have ever had at YSPH. He teaches dry, dense health policy material in a way that is engaging and fun. I cannot recommend this course enough, I will miss his class.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I really liked Dr. Schwartz. He was clear, organized, and very receptive to students' comments and concerns. I enjoyed going to class each week.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The In the News section was fantastic and provided real world examples of things discussed in class. The slides were always engaging, and the presentations were well put together.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Excellent!! Very knowledgeable, open to student feedback during class, and very organized.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I think he was a good professor. Enthusiastic. Didn't place emphasis on grades so much as retention of information. His exams were a bit hard to place just in the sense of knowing what was going to be on it but i think he tried to do justice to a lot of material and not alot of time. Clearly enjoyed the material. was very good at answering emails in a reasonable time.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I always hated health policy and thought it was boring and difficult. I started liking it for the first time after taking Dr. Schwartz classes. He is a great teacher, love his teaching pedagogy, he did a brilliant job in making the course interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Strengths: enthusiasm, knowledge, adaptability, willingness to work with students, sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Fantastic teacher, great at explaining stuff and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Even though the class is hard, professor Schwartz is great. He is very passionate with this class, and I think he's lecture is clear.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Despite the length of each lecture, he was always an energetic and thoughtful speaker. He always made the classes interesting, and I appreciated his sense of humor.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason is great, very organized and that is so much appreciated. His lectures are cohesive and he clearly spends a lot of time reviewing them and selecting articles that are crucial to current health policy topics to discuss in class. Students never wanted to hear how he evaluated exams or written assignments, yet his attempt and full and complete transparency was great and really appreciated to those who have been in similar shoes. He tried to make everyone happy, and while a class of 120 is almost nearly impossible, I think it was very kind of him to do so. He was willing to change is something didn't work out.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0My only critique is that Professor Schwartz speaks a tiny bit too fast. Early on, I knew I would have to audio record the lectures because I had a hard time following without lecture slides.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great professor, but his lectures are very dense and it is hard to pay attention for all three hours of straight lecturing. He knows what he is talking about and creates easy analogies to learn by.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is a passionate, receptive professor. I enjoyed his lectures and choice of readings. The final exam was also very enjoyable!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Fantastic. A little wordy, but it reinforces his point. Clearly cares about students and their understanding of the material. Wonderful, knowledgeable and inspiring professor!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Awesome!! This class sometimes felt like a marathon but he was energized the entire time. He's a great lecturer, but could have let health policy students talk more during our small group discussions. The \"in the news\" section of lectures felt pretty pointless, it took up a lot of time and didn't necessarily teach us new material. Overall, though, Prof Schwartz really wants his students to learn and I feel like this course provided me a very vital background in health policy that will serve me for years to come.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very excited and passionate about the topic. He makes the information easy to digest for anyone to understand.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Seemed enthusiastic and knowledgeable. He was also extremely accommodating to students in their needs for extension, outside help, etc. I would enjoy taking a small class with him.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I thought that his lectures were great, honestly. I liked how detailed they were. I feel like I know much more about health policy now than I did before. He was also very helpful in office hours. I hope that he gets tenure.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He seemed to know what he was talking about.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Wonderful professor! I thought this pacing was great and he was extremely well organized. He was also able to make it engaging and spark great conversations.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great instructor. Not boring at all. Knows the material front to back and is willing to hear student input.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very organized.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He was engaging, bright, and did a great job of connecting the topics we were learning with current affairs and news.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Superb orator. I don't think anyone else could have captivated a class in Winslow for more than 2 hours at a stretch. Really respect the research that he put in the class presentation",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Instructor recognizes when he has overwhelmed students and tries his best to make changes to help. However, the amount of assigned readings are still significantly high and are difficult to keep up with every week.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is an incredible lecturer. He is very engaged and passionate. I really enjoyed how incorporated current news into lecture. He has inspired me to take other health policy courses.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very energetic and enthusiastic about health policy",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Good professor, passionate about teaching policy. Strengths - very fair with grading and structure of assignments and tests. Weakness - much of the class focused on hospital\/ACA; therefore, difficult for non-policy concentrations or people less interested in policy to remain interested",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Insightful, well-informed lecturer. However, you do speak very quickly at times",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason Schwartz is great--really knows the material and makes sure to connect themes with current topics. The class is a little long, even with the break, so it does get kind of monotonous, but that's more of a criticism of the class structure itself.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The instructor is very enthusiastic about the class and the topics he teaches, which definitely comes through to the class. He's also very approachable and encourages question and discussion in class on certain topics. However there was a lot of material in the class and not much about the challenges or intricacies of health policy.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Nice teacher",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The only problem of him is that he speaks so fast and monotonously. As an international student, it's hard to absorb his content.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is a great instructor who brings a huge amount of energy and knowledge. He keeps students interested and is very open to talking with them about their interest during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0See response above.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is incredibly knowledgeable about the material he lectures on. Unfortunately his rapid delivery of this information means that much of his wisdom is lost on those who can't keep up. If only the course had been broken down into shorter segments that met more frequently over the week, I think his teaching style might have been less overwhelming. I thought the final essay was a horrible way to assess students understanding of the material. Students had no preparation\/practice for timed essays of that magnitude. Additionally we were told we would get 15 minutes to strategize our responses, but the instructions were 6 pages single spaced which took 15 minutes to read.... totally overwhelming and frustrating end of semester assessment, particularly when students are overwhelmed by back to back exams and don't necessarily have the most well slept, clearheaded minds.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He talks quickly, but is passionate about the course content and that shines through in his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason Schwartz was excellent and really got me excited about health policy! Thanks for being awesome.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very responsive professor. Makes an effort to know everyone that goes to his office hours. I would prefer the classroom to be not so dark though.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great teacher",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Wonderful! I crafted a great course that introduces you to the US health system (and a quick foray into global health systems). The compiled readings for the class are the best list I've ever had for a course.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0The professor is very passionate and accessible. Although he is very ambitious in the amount of content he wishes to teach, he makes an effort to make content relevant and current.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Dr. Schwartz is great. I think it could be helpful to make slides available before lecture, as there were so many in each lecture and we covered so much material that it was hard to take notes in smart ways.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz was very accommodating to my conflict with the exam time, and was also very enthusiastic about teaching the Health Policy students in the optional seminar.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He is an excellent instructor.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Excellent. Very dedicated and passionate about the subject. Excellent assigned readings.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0I had no interaction with the instructor whatsoever besides listening to the lectures. I did not like long-winded introductions to the what was going to be due weeks away or current events. It seemed to take forever to get into what we were covering that day. Often like the graphics used, take home points are not clear. I feel like he had interesting things to say, but had too much to say and didn't really prioritize what he was delivering.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason is SO smart! He provides robust, thoughtful, and intelligent descriptions of the nuances of health policy. He is approachable and fun as well. His lectures are very organized and relevant to current issues.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Instructor was good",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He is very a very engaged and enthusiastic lecturer. He makes himself readily available to provide support to students and was really invested. He also structured the progression of lecture topics in a great way. However, I felt like he at times talks too fast in lecture and it was hard to stay on track especially in such a long lecture.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Every lecture was an excellent learning opportunity. I have thoroughly enjoyed the course taught by Dr. Schwartz, and really value all that I have learned from this course. Thank you",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0excellent, Jason's passion for his subject made his classes a pleasure to attend.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz is a genius, so kind and a talented lecturer. He is the best professor I have had at YSPH so far and I only wish I could take more classes with him.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Knowledgeable and passionate about topic.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Excellent professor. Passionate and kind. I hope to be a professor like you one day!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Nice and open to helping students.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz was very energetic and, although the 2 1\/2 hour lecture was a very long time to pay attention, he made the large amount of material as engaging as possible. I found his Vaccination class especially interesting and would've loved to here more about his research.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Outstanding presentation skills and grasp of the complex topic, this is sort of \"dry\" lecture series for me and but I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures presented by Dr Schwartz Encourages independent thinking",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Professor Schwartz seemed passionate about health policy, but unsure of himself at times.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very knowledgeable and gave a lot of wonderful insight. Only criticism is not so much about content, rather teaching style Professor Schwartz would sometimes speak very fast, which made it difficult at times to keep up with the material. Would suggest slowing down.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Very responsive to student questions\/needs. He is a dynamic lecturer and makes himself readily available outside of the classroom. I originally was not interested in health policy, but he made the material very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Great lecturer. Really attentive to students needs and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Prof Schwartz is great!",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0He was awesome. Highly recommend his class. Very smart, dedicated, interesting, and really cares about making the class great",
    "Instructor: Jason L Schwartz \u00a0Jason is one of my favorite professors from my time at YSPH. He was always kind, attentive, and thorough in explaining concepts to the class. He took particular care to clear up concepts that would otherwise prove confusing or tricky for students. He also made ample time to meet with and advise students outside of class hours."

   "comments": [
    "An introduction to health policy with emphasis on major government programs, private insurance, and the ACA. The course is primarily focused on domestic healthcare with a couple of weeks spent on international topics.",
    "Great course, I feel like I've learned so much practical knowledge",
    "Good course but the exams...",
    "This is a fantastic course that touches on many aspects of health policy. Each session starts with \"In the news\" allowing for consideration of current events related to policy. This was one of my favorite courses this semester and I'd highly recommend it for anyone interested in policy.",
    "Take it! This class does a good job of giving an overview of health policy and showed me so much material that I never knew before and that I'm interested in pursuing further.",
    "Take it. A must.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because you gain a lot of knowledge about health policy and Dr. Schwartz is good and passionate about the material, especially the vaccination unit.",
    "highly recommend",
    "Great course, and would definitely recommend. The topic is highly relevant and very interesting. The professor does an incredible job.",
    "GREAT CLASS! The readings are relevant and I always find them enjoyable to read, classes are long but interesting, homework (2 short essays during the semester) is reasonable and Prof. Schwartz always make his requirement super clear. Great class, great professor!",
    "This is an intro seminar course. You can do very well in it without attending lectures. If you have prior knowledge of the US healthcare system (or the time to read \"America's Bitter Pill\") and the class is not required, you'd likely be better off taking something different.",
    "Great course and provides a solid foundation for understanding US health policy.",
    "Tremendous!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I think it's a good policy starting point, and I feel encouraged to take the other policy classes now.",
    "An EXCELLENT summary of US Health Policy. I truly have a much stronger understanding of US health policy and relevant issues after having taken this class. I finally understand some of the nuances of Medicare\/Medicaid\/VA\/IHS that had eluded me before and I also have a better framework with which to understand health systems more generally.",
    "Definitely, I would. Anybody who is interested even remotely in public health\/epidemiology\/preventive medicine\/health policy should definitely take this course, its relevant to all fields and they would definitely enjoy the experience.",
    "This course is great for someone with a limited policy background. I learned about a lot of broad concepts that were completely new to me. Dr. Schwartz is very engaging and entertaining.",
    "Loved this class! I would take it again.",
    "Good, just a little bit hard.",
    "This is a great class to better understand the US healthcare system. Even if you're an American with some background working in the healthcare field, I would recommend this class because it provides a better idea of many facets of our Healthcare system. I think it's an extremely important class for all public health students.",
    "This course is a tremendous introduction to the complexities of the US health system and US health policy. It delves in deeply to varying aspects of the topics and gives the students a great selection on where there is need for improvement. This class is highly recommended, Jason is a great professor and really knowledgeable; you will come out of that class learning a tremendous amount of info and not even know it.",
    "A good overview of the US healthcare system.",
    "Great course!! Mostly about insurance, which is a really complicated thing and I'm glad I got to take a course in it so I was able to finally understand. Prof Schwartz really knows his stuff and was very prepared for lecture every day. It's not an easy course - there's a TON of material to memorize for each test - but you feel genuinely like you're benefiting from your learning in the course, which is awesome. I feel like a smarter, more informed person after taking this class. The final exam final is great, also.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. I came in with no policy background and I feel like I have a greater understanding of health policy and health insurance, absolutely necessary and vital information for the real world.",
    "Good class to take to get an overall summary on U.S. Health Policy including the history of insurance, how insurance works, the ACA, and current policies.",
    "Lots of reading, learned a lot, engaging lectures, not too stressful.",
    "If you have taken the upper-level class already, this is an easy review and you can easily do well in the class without doing anything but reviewing the slides to know exactly what he is looking for from you. It is annoyingly specific so even seasoned policy students will get tripped up on naming topics by specific authors etc.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone!",
    "Good introduction overview class.",
    "Best Introduction to Health policy possible. Must do for all MPH students",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is not familiar at all with health policy. For individuals who have an idea of what is happening both domestically and internationally with respect to health policy, this class may be much less exciting and interesting.",
    "The course have too much exams and essays",
    "This has been one of the most enjoyable courses I have taken at YSPH. I learned so much about health policy within a short period of time.",
    "Yes, always and should be mandatory for every public health student",
    "Interesting content, good to have a basic understanding even though my post-graduate interests are not in policy.",
    "A great intro survey course into health policy. It touches upon a lot of topics, but sadly without too much depth. The final is useful in getting you to actually think about an answer broader, applicable policy questions, but it would be nice to see that more during the semester.",
    "I would recommend it for people that want all the details of existing US health policy but I would recommend an alternate class if someone was interested in creating US health policy.",
    "yes, a good class to learn about the basic principle about health system and policy",
    "This is a great class that covers the foundations of health policy. Dr. Schwartz makes the assignments interesting and lectures relevant. I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "See above",
    "The content of this course is hugely important, and if you are excited to learn about policy and are a fast thinker with a long attention span, this is the course for you! However, I had a very hard time paying attention in class and despite being interested in the material did not enjoy this course.",
    "Its a worthwhile required course that will allow you to better understand, navigate, and do advocacy work within the US Health Care System.",
    "This course was excellent! It was one of my favorite and most well-organized classes I've taken at YSPH.",
    "It is a required course for the MPH track, but a great course if you want to know all you need to know about the U.S. health system.",
    "Yes",
    "Great! One of my favorites at YSPH",
    "I would recommend this course for people who have little or no experience in health policy and are interested in getting a broad overview of main topics and issues. However I would not recommend this for professionals looking for a more in-depth, analytical and discussion-based lecture with current and relevant applicable content.",
    "good",
    "It's a great course.",
    "You have two options for health policy if you're not on the policy track. Both have their advantages and disadvantages. This one is a huge lecture-based course with a lot of readings and a lot of material. If that works better for you, go for it.",
    "Very good course that I would recommend as essential to obtaining basic literacy in health care systems and policy - which is presumably important no matter which academic track.",
    "Pretty dry overview of how the American healthcare system is organized. No particular to depth to any topics. Okay survey class.",
    "This course is very important for anyone pursuing an MPH. It provides incredible relevant and important information on health policy. I feel more prepared as a health professional after taking this course.",
    "An overview of current main topics in US Healthcare. I would recommend this class because it provides a better understanding of the topics that drive our current policy.",
    "This course is a high-level overview of the US health care system. It is a great introductory course--I would definitely recommend to non-health policy students.",
    "A great intro course for people who have limited knowledge of the way healthcare is organized in the US.",
    "It was a great course, and I would certainly recommend everyone to take it! But I thought it would have been nicer if the lectures were broken up in two parts a week instead of one long chunk.",
    "Great course! You will learn a lot about the US health care system and it will make you want to take more health policy classes. Professor Schwartz is a wonderful, kind professor who could not be better at his job. Take it!",
    "Very important course. Gives much insight to U.S Health policies and systems.",
    "Crash course in U.S. healthcare system.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "Memorize everything",
    "Although the first half of the class was a bit dry, this was definitely the course in which I learned the most and the case studies in the second half of the class were very interesting. I would definitely recommend taking this course for a solid foundation in how health policy works within the US.",
    "You will learn a lot of facts, but you will be left with a lot of questions. The readings are also burdensome, but not helpful.",
    "I recommend taking this course to understand the very basics of what is a very complex health policy system in the U.S. I would note that while this is a course on health systems, there is only one week on international health systems. While heavily U.S. based, this course is certainly a good gateway for others that you could take during your time at YSPH.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!",
    "I would recommend it if you have an interest in learning about the US health care system...this is the main focus. It is very informative and interesting",
    "A great introduction to the current \"landscape\" of US health policy. While some of the material, especially toward the beginning of the course, overlapped with material I had previously learned in HPM 560, the two courses quickly diverged. I would wholeheartedly recommend this course."
