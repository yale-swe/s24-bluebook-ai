    "A word of advice: DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE DIFFICULTY OF THIS CLASS, especially if you struggle with proofs. Definitely take this class with Angluin.",
    "This class is a good survey class of the mathematics needed for computer science. Unfortunately, it does not get very deep at all into any of the topics that the course covers. The degree to which most topics are covered is not great enough to really understand any of the topics.",
    "CPSC 202 is a phenomenal introduction to more theoretical mathematics. If you have the opportunity to take it with Professor Angluin, I wholeheartedly recommend it. She makes tough concepts easy to grasp.",
    "!!! Take this course with Professor Angluinshe made the course what it was. My suitemate took CS 202 last fall with Professor Aspnes and dreaded every lecture, PSET, and exam. He said he didn't learn anything and didn't think the course was taught effectively. I was worried about taking this class, but I ended up enjoying it immensely and feeling I learned a lot. Professor Angluin pays very careful attention to her students and tries to pace lectures based on understanding. As always, her lectures are interactive and facilitate productive dialogue in order to clarify the content. She has given me everything I ever wanted out of a math course. All the topics are relevant to CS and she focuses on developing an intuition for the material. tl;dr: This is the introduction to proof-based math I wish I had in freshman year. If you're even considering the CS major, take this class now just in case so you don't risk taking it with a professor who frankly doesn't give a shit about your education.",
    "An introduction to all the techniques you'll need from discrete maths for comp science. Take it if you're not too fond of more theoretical stuff and are not too fond of proofs, otherwise do Math 244. Actually take this, Dana Angluin is amazing.",
    "Yes -- it's required for computer science majors, but I'm applied math and I thoroughly enjoyed this choice over MATH 244, having shopped both.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I've heard it's slightly easier than its equivalent in the Math department (MATH 244), but it's not an easy class by any means. You should definitely take it if you find math and computer science interesting and want a general introduction to discrete mathematics. This class covers a lot of different topics with not a lot of depth on each topic. Professor Angluin is amazing, and you'll definitely enjoy the class if you take it with her. Remember to get ahead of the game on the problem sets and they're really quite manageable. Just know, this class is a large time commitment, so don't bite off more than you can chew!",
    "This course gives a brief introduction to many of the mathematical concepts employed in computer science. No concept is covered in too much depth, but a good general understanding of each is expected by the end.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want a quick two-week overview of a lot of different topics. I learned a lot and definitely understand how these topics relate to CS.",
    "If you've never done proofs before, this is a great way to learn how to do them. Dana Angluin is a wonderful professor and I certainly learned a ton. That said, this class definitely took up more time than any other. The psets took me between 10-12 hours; they're tricky. I highly suggest doing supplementary material. The midterm and final are significantly easier than the psets (thankfully). You'll cover all sorts of topics, and you'll learn how to read (more like decode) mathematical texts\/symbols, which is incredibly useful.",
    "I would summarize this course as one that is not strictly about computer science, but one that teaches you about problem solving and how to think about problems. I would recommend it even to those who aren't doing computer science because it is a good discrete math course.",
    "Yes - Prof. Angluin was very thoughtful and the grading was very lenient. Really boring for anyone who's taken real Math classes at Yale.",
    "Very good course to learn a bunch of different computing concepts. Moves pretty quickly since you only spend a week or two on any one topic but it's a good course.",
    "As far as classes go, CPSC 202 is quite niche in terms of material covered. If you don't plan to use this for your major, you could probably invest the credit elsewhere. That being said, if you are a computer science major, this class is great and very stimulating. You will definitely learn a lot in 202, especially under the guidance of Professor Angluin.",
    "If you have to, take it. It's not thattt bad. If you're deciding between this class and MATH 222 and you're not a math genius, take this class. I know people who are very good at math, but still found Math 222 too hard. Some people also dropped down into our class, but you must do so before the midterm. Homeworks and exams are both difficult. Homeworks took me 6-15 hours, depending.",
    "With Professor Angluin, this is a good course. While homework was significantly more difficult than lecture, I felt that the time I spent on it was worthwhile. I feel like this course is a good level of difficulty-- you will certainly learn something while not being overwhelmed.",
    "Fantastic class under Dana Angulin. I highly recommend this course. Work load is exactly as advertised and the psets are very fun. Great class to enter into the world of proofs and discrete math.",
    "Take this course if you have to. It isn't great, but you learn to write proofs which should be useful. I dropped down from MATH 244 after shopping period -- you should take 244 if you actually want to learn discrete math in detail, but be aware that it is a LOT of work so build your schedule around that class. 202 is average work so unless you're a math god, it is probably more manageable and teaches you as much math as needed.",
    "This is a decent math class. No complaints.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in CS not only will you have to take this class, but you will enjoy it. DO NOT TAKE MATH 244 if you are not a gungho math person. Take this!",
    "I'd take this class if you have to for the major. The class covers a few topics (graph theory, set thoery, linear algebra etc.) If you're a non-CS major who is very interested in these topics, it's probably better to just take courses in all of them seperately.",
    "Not really worth it if you are just taking it for self enrichment",
    "There isn't really a reason to take this course unless you're a CS major. From what I've heard from peers, it is a less intense version of Math 244 with some different emphases. If you are at all interested in computer science, take this course. It gives a great overview of the mathematical concepts you'll need and be forced to be interested in if this is the field for you. There is 1 pset a week that takes 7-10 hours. These are definitely challenging but (at least the year I took the class) we could work on them with others in the class. The midterm and final are very fair and it is graded on a curve. Don't be too scared on this class.",
    "Yes, it was a good survey course.",
    "Prof. Angluin is the best, don't hesitate to take 202 if she is teaching.",
    "Great course, in fact, my favorite this semester. At times it can be very challenging (especially at the start), but just keep pushing through! It's essentially proof-based discrete math.",
    "I actually am not a cs major. I'm premed but wanted to learn more about formal math. I think this was a great way to get introduced and learn some cool stuff. Not too hard if you have a flair for this stuff.",
    "If you are interested in math, I would recommend. If not, it's too technical.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone with an interest in algorithmic thinking and the math behind computer programming. Much is taught and learned.",
    "202 taught by Dana angluin is a really fascinating, wonderful course!!",
    "A terrible class that tries to teach interesting and complex material to really subpar students who milked answers from each others and the TAs. It was actually brutal going to ta office hours and watching how the kids just did not fundamentally understand most of the course work and just memorized how to do things. Especially since the exams are similar to the practice, this made it easy for the slowest of students to do well.",
    "CPSC 202 is designed to cover a broad spectrum of topics; therefore you won't really go into depth with anything and you won't really learn much. The lectures are long and hard to follow, and the online notes are ridiculously bad. Nevertheless, the problem sets aren't time-consuming and the tests are very fair and straightforward. Don't take this class unless you must for the major. That being said, Dana is a great teacher and mentor, and if you choose to take it, take it with Dana.",
    "Only take it if you are required to. If you have to take this course then take it with Dana. Its very proof heavy and theoretical. Homework assignments are helpful in learning the material being taught but sometimes they are time consuming. Classes are good but often I felt like the material was flying over my head so I was scrambling to take notes and keep up.",
    "CS 202 is an excellent course, and Professor Angluin is awesome to take it with. You go over so many topics in this class like relations, graph theory, logic, number theory, probability, linear algebra and other things I'm forgetting about. The workload is completely reasonable, maybe 4-6 hours per week, and the two exams were sufficiently difficult but very doable. Even if you aren't a CS major, I would recommend taking this class if you're interested in discrete math.",
    "CS202 is a proof-heavy math course with direct applications to fundamentals of computer science. Having had no prior experience with math proofs, I found the first problem set extremely challenging. This was compounded by the fact that the material on the problem set had not yet been covered in lecture, and the TA's office hours tend to only be helpful if you have highly specific questions or are simply looking for your work to be checked over for errors or proof strength (nb: definitely bring your completed pset to office hours each week to be checked over by a potential grader before submitting it in class to ensure the maximum amount of credit on each assignment). After the first pset however, the subsequent assignments directly correlated with the material covered in that week's lecture. Start the problem sets early, and often if you get stuck, the material covered in the next lecture will help you finish the rest of the assignment. If you do the readings from the text as well as make sure to follow along with the proofs outlined in class by Professor Angluin, the problem sets become fairly easy to reason out with no need to attend any extra office hours. They also build on each other, helping to reinforce concepts and a mode of thinking that will serve you well on the exams. Professor Angluin is a wonderfully invested teacher who is passionate about the subject and truly wants each and every student to come away with a greater understanding of these concepts. Since she prioritizes your learning, she is a fair and patient instructor who encourages class participation and truly makes an effort to get to know each student. She has a dry sense of humor and is very approachable.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot about mathematical proofs and logic.",
