    "German's an excellent class, of course if you want to actually learn German. It's demanding, but not unreasonably so.",

    "Good second level german course",
    "German 120 with Jason Kavett is definitely a rewarding class, especially for those looking for a good balance between grammar\/vocabulary and learning about the cultural aspects. The atmosphere of the class is very friendly and relaxed, creating an setting in which students felt comfortable asking questions when unclear about a concept or simply to further inquire about something about German culture.",
    "If you want to take German, you should take L2 also...",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class for another student because it finishes off the basic rules needed for speaking in German. The rest is just memorization."
