   "comments": [
    "Brazil Land of Future? Was a class that for the majority of the semester focused on the political and social history of the country. Towards the end we discussed racial inequalities, political corruption, and environmental issues. I would recommend this class to any student that has interest in Brazil, primarily in it's political structure.",
    "If you're interested in Brazil and in political sciences research, you should take this class. If you're not, that's probably not the best course for you. Be prepared to write a loooot, like actually a lot. Also, never ever ever miss a class, otherwise you're gonna have to write more papers than you thought you'd have to.",
    "This class was a great assessment of the government in Brazil and it's relationship with it's constituents. Seeing Brazil's role in the world was very enlightening, and an extremely important field of knowledge due to the World Cup and Olympics.",
    "If you are interested in Latin American politics, this class is a great way to get your writing credit checked off your list and to be in a small, discussion-based intellectually stimulating class. The reading load is heavy at times and 4 short papers +1 final paper seems like a lot, but it is doable and Professor Fried is very helpful. I would absolutely recommend Poli Sci 426 to a fellow student.",
    "Interesting overview of Brazilian history and current politics. I went into the class knowing nothing about Brazil and now have a pretty good understanding of contemporary Brazilian politics. I thought it was a great opportunity to learn more about the country in depth. The papers were on any topic that you wanted and were pretty manageable. If you need another writing credit and a poly sci seminar, this is the way to go.",
    "A perfect way to get an introduction to brazil and its politics. There are some things that are glossed over that cane makes things at times confusing but all you have to do is ask and he happily clarifies.",
    "Bad class, don't take it. Not very good, even if you put in the work."
