   "comments": [
    "This senior research course has been very interesting and rewarding. I have appreciated the chance to work long-term on my thesis focusing more specifically on one biological process rather than many. For the first time, I am seeing the pieces of evidence that come together to make a scientific claim. I understand the pace and organization of a lab and setting up experimentation. The organization of evidence finding, analysis, then interpretation is something that I have been able to apply outside of the course as well. I find that this clear cut experimental approach is helping me with my public health research which is much less clear cut.",
    "You work in your lab so you'll be learning different things. You will write a proposal and grant proposal, which are good skills to have.",
    "Became a more independent and productive member of my lab--the value of this course and the senior research in general is very contingent on the quality of the lab that you are in and the mentorship that you are able to receive there.",
    "I have learnt an awful lot in this semesters research - being independent, conducting own experiments and analysing results with software (which I previously had not done).",
    "Plasmid construction, assays, subcellular fractionation, immunofluorescence microscopy, and CRISPR methods",
    "Research skills in my lab.",
    "I learned how to work more in depth in a wet lab environment, thinking about the questions I want to pursue, what skills and techniques I need to learn, and to plan over the course of semester and a year to be able to accomplish these tasks. Also the grant proposal taught me what is required to write a grant proposal.",
    "Working in a research lab down at the med school, pretty cool stuff.",
    "A lot of my research was on AV fistula, so I learned a lot about that and that Vascular system",
    "This was a senior requirement, and I think most insight and skills developed depend on your research mentor and principal investigator (PI). In my experience, I worked closely with my PI and he was very constructive and realistic in developing a good project for me.",
    "Research",
    "I am learning how to perform biological research with mosquitoes.",
    "I was able to continue expanding my knowledge of laboratory techniques and how to think critically about the experiments we are running.",
    "Western Blot and IF staining.",
    "Independent research",
    "I learned much about the scientific research process and techniques including gel electrophoresis, immunoblotting, column purification, and dialysis. I learned how to integrate laboratory time into my schedule and take the lead on an individual project.",
    "I am learning to apply many of the lab skills I have learned in my pre-med classes in real life. Not only am I understanding the experimental difficulties of research but also learning to navigate trouble-shooting when results don't turn out as planned. I am thankful to be in a lab that aligns with my interests and goals"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: individuality",
    "Better instructions on the grant proposal",
    "Strengths: the ability to get a more hands-on experience in lab, see what it would be like to be a graduate student in biology and have your own project that you are working on. Limitations: It is VERY hard to be productive in lab if you are just beginning your senior year, or if you have never spent a summer\/a period of time doing full-time research in your lab. MCDB does not require you to be in a lab before this class which I think is a significant weakness, as being in a lab and doing your own research is truly the culmination of the major and it is difficult for that to be meaningful without significant lab experience. PhDs take 5 years, so in one semester it is hard to feel like anything was accomplished.",
    "Different PIs have different requirements that seriously effect the long term joy students have while doing research. Also, some contact\/feedback from the professors of the course would be nice - either at the beginning of the semester, or if they had office hours, or even if we just had an initial meeting where we had a chance to meet them.",
    "No weaknesses - a great way to gain experience in the lab whilst earning credit! Hugely beneficial.",
    "strengths are learning lab skills, applying theory to practice, planning and executing experiments, fostering relationships with mentors, and growing as a scientists.",
    "Strength: lots of independence\/freedom to pursue one's own interest, which I appreciate. Weakness: lack of community",
    "I think this course really depends on the PI that you are working with. I mostly worked with a mentor, assistant research scientist, in the lab, who was very helpful throughout and I maintain a great relationship. It helped me really connect with the people in the lab.",
    "The model doesn't necessarily lend to equitable situations-- thankfully I have a great mentor and PI who would be responsive to questions and help with reports\/proposals. Not everyone might have this luxury.",
    "I think this course is well-structured to meet the demands of many MCDB majors finishing their senior requirement. The information\/syllabus given was helpful, but I think the difference between the initial proposal and the final proposal could be better--as in, there would be better development. However, I understand that not much progress can be obtained in 2-3 months depending on the project and student schedule, so this is understandable.",
    "It is a good class and the set up\/information set up on canvas is good.",
    "I really enjoy being able to work at a lab that studies the condition that I am most passionate about studying: type 1 diabetes. I have learned a lot from my PI and the other lab members.",
    "Good senior requirement.",
    "There should be more face-to-face between seniors and the MCDB 485 course instructors. There should be weekly drop-in hours in which students can come by to ask questions about the course, research methods, etc. Students work in different labs and interact with the PI differently, so having a consistent instructor to meet with is important."

    "Yes the MCDB thesis is very accessible and a great way finally apply basic science education.",

    "A requirement for the BS, however it is truly a great opportunity to see what it is like to be a full-time researcher and have your own project.",
    "Definitely if you are passionate about science and would like to gain lab research experience",
    "Yes, but only if you have an understanding PI and a mentor who cares about your progress.",
    "Yes, reseach is invaluable!",
    "Yes - it is a great way to learn more about research.",

    "Mandatory to get a BS.",
    "Yes, any MCDB senior should take this course in order to get lab experience. The course itself could be organized better, with more frequent communication with students."
