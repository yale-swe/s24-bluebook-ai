   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned about each of the research methods in the social sciences as well as the basis of epistemology: all things I had never learned about in depth before and it was all very valuable as a social science student.",
    "This course really pushed me to think critically about EVERYTHING I read. And what things I should think about in order to think critically about the things I read. I definitely have a greater appreciation for qualitative research because there is (and should be) so much intentionality behind good research.",
    "This course provides students with a firm foundation of knowledge in research methods based in an introduction to epistemology. Teaches students how to research well, problem solve, and create a do-able project that can yield great results.",
    "This course was a great overview on how to conduct social science research. It built a lot of practical skills from how to read and evaluate research, and how to build a feasible project from forming a research question to writing a proposal.",
    "Learned about a broad range of methodologies in social science research, as well as epistemology and theories of knowledge. Developed some skills to read academic research critically, and how to go about conducting one's own research.",
    "A good understanding of basic epistemology, knowledge about classic qualitative and quantitive research methods, and the ability to read and intelligently discuss theory and the work of others.",
    "This Course both taught me the nuts and bolts of doing social science research but also gave an overview of why we have to be so careful about research from an epistemological perspective. This course then originated theoretical but then became quite practical.",
    "A basic introduction to several research methods, nothing in depth.",
    "the focus of the class is understanding different ways to approach research in sociology and pushes you to think critically about publications and studies",
    "I learned how to develop an original research project from examining the existing literature to choosing the best method for research and formulating a concise research question. I also learned some of the epistemological theories that are behind sociological research.",
    "This is a great course introducing a variety of qualitative sociological methods. I learned how to conduct a qualitative research project from start to finish, and critically examined a number of fascinating pieces of sociological research with an eye to their methods. After taking this course, I feel prepare to do my own qualitative research, and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of other pieces of research.",
    "Throughout this course I learned an incredible amount about research in the sociological field. I had very little background in the area, but I feel fully prepared to pursue a career in the sociology area. This class helped inspire me to look into research careers.",
    "I gained a more comprehensive understanding of the different methodologies used in social science. This information enabled me to critique and assess the strengths and weaknesses of different research, as well as understand the limitations and unique capabilities of different types of research.",
    "I learned how to approach social science literature with a more critical eye -- to engage more deeply not just with research findings, but to consider the strategies, tools, and ethics employed by researchers to answer their questions of interest. I also learned how to go about formulating meaningful research questions according to my broader interests.",
    "The course did its job in teaching us the proper methods and strategies to conduct sociological research."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Discussion based class which was sometimes challenging but forces you to engage with the readings which is probably a good thing.",
    "Strengths: discussions, Professor Mahler, TAs, interesting readings Weaknesses: I think the only thing I would have liked is a bit more support on the midterm. I think the concepts were a bit challenging to ground because it was abstract. Since these concepts set the framework for the rest of the course, making sure students are comfortable with that material is important.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Flow of Class Variety of Assignments Weakness: Some of the readings were a bit dry, but the discussion made up for it!",
    "Its very repetitive at times, kind of a necessary evil if you're a sociology major. I feel like this course could be integrated with the quantitative class in like a daily, 1 hour class. The first half was great, especially with all the theory of epistemology. But second half was ehhhhhh",
    "The risk of doing a survey course, really in any subject, is sacrificing depth for breadth. Unfortunately, particularly for methodology, a broad knowledge is less helpful than specific in-depth knowledge. Though I developed some skills to critically analyze research in this course, it wasn't much of an extension of what I was already doing reading research in other courses. Plus, I didn't feel like I left with any specific knowledge on methodologies. Would be great to learn some computer programs, and statistical methods too, as I felt like the quantitative section was lacking. Class discussions were generally good, but sometimes the class was so big that it was difficult to participate. I would suggest splitting the class into two sections if it continues to be of such size in the future.",
    "Everything was great! I especially loved the section on epistemology as I found it fascinating and applicable to pretty much every aspect of life. Good readings and great class discussions. My only suggestion for improvement would be to be careful about having too much work on certain weeks, as sometimes the workload for this class was extremely high which meant that I wasn't able to spend as much time on some aspects (usually the readings) as I had to focus on a different aspect (usually a writing assignment).",
    "This course naturally is meant to impart information as a methods course. However the class it taught in a seminar style. This means that the professor finds it harder to transmit the information in a structured way but that the discussions and the class periods themselves are more enjoyable then sitting in a lecture. I think the professor understands the perils of this style and works through them well. The only minor issue I have is that the class could be better structured or more explicitly structured. There is a natural arch of the class but that can only be seen in hindsight. Likewise the individual class periods could be a little more structured to make sure the information has been covered.",
    "The course was listed as a methods course but had a major focus on epistemology. The epistemological section was interesting but unexpected.",
    "I liked the beginning of the course and the way we discussed basic skills before moving on to specific kinds of studies I thought there could have been a better way to make the class discussion-based and I often felt as though Mahler had a specific idea of what students should get out of a reading or discussion and there was not an alternative correct answer",
    "The class is able to provide good examples and give a reasonable how to to prepare students to right a sociology thesis or another research paper. The final paper however could have been improved if there was more direction on how to write it.",
    "This is a really great course. In other hands the topic might be much drier, but Professor Mahler did a GREAT job selecting interesting readings, getting the class to engage in debate and discussion over research, and gave thorough feedback to everyone in the course, even though it was a fairly large section.",
    "I thought the structure of the course was strong. Splitting the class into theory in the first half and then methods in the second half was a nice way of setting a foundation. I would have liked a little more theory in the second half as it pertained specifically to a module's readings.",
    "I think the class had too many assignments, given that some didn't really help me learn, such as the reading notes and review of a senior thesis. I did appreciate, however, the fact that some of the assignments built up to the final project, because it was a really helpful way of breaking up the big final writing assignment and also understanding a new form of writing that I hadn't had experience with before.",
    "The only suggestion I have would be to perhaps consider avoiding structuring too many class periods as simple reaction periods to assigned readings -- I often felt that my own reactions to the readings weren't particularly illuminating, and perhaps more concrete or structured discussions or critiques of some of the research we looked at might have been helpful. This is not a criticism, but just a personal reflection, especially given the fact that sometimes I felt ill-equipped to deeply process some of the readings on my own.",
    "Strengths: The assignments throughout the semester prepare you for your final assignment and you really do grow from them. It helped me learn what methods I prefer and would be interested in for my senior thesis and future projects. Weaknesses: The assignments seemed crunched at the end. Time management was also an issue. I also think presenting theory pieces throughout the semester instead of only the beginning would improve the course."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend, it is also required for sociology majors, initially I was unsure if I was enjoying it but I think it was definitely worthwhile in the end.",
    "Definitely yes. I decided to shop this class randomly and stuck with it. This course was by far my favorite course this semester. Professor Mahler and the TAs Jean-Baptise and Luke all contributed so much insight to the class discussions. They were keen on giving constructive feedback and providing help whenever necessary. Such a great combination of people to make this methods course a lot more enjoyable than you would expect from a methods course.",
    "Yes, this course challenged me and made me feel capable of creating a great project!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in conducting some sort of social science research.",
    "Take it if you are a SOCY major I guess, I would actually recommend a more specific method course (quantitative methods\/ethnography\/etc.) This course was so broad and tried to touch upon so many topics that I didn't feel like I got a good handle of any of the concepts. Professor Mahler is helpful and wants to help you succeed, and class discussions are generally OK. Writing the research proposal at the end of the course was a helpful exercise, though you could do that through other courses as well. You do read (parts of) some famous\/seminal works in sociology, which is a plus too. Also be warned, half of this course is epistemology (only the second half is reading through research papers).",
    "Yes! Great class, especially for people interested in sociology, but would be interesting for anyone!",
    "This is a well done methods course that is broadly applicable to anyone trying to do social science research. It is well taught and has a wide variety of readings. the Workload is manageable and the class does a good job in holding your hand as you work towards a final research proposal which could be the basis of your thesis.",
    "The class is definitely designed to be taken by junior sociology majors, it is a good class to get students thinking about senior theses, I would not recommend the class as a just-for-fun class",
    "I would recommend this course to other sociology majors.",
    "Even though I wasn't a sociology major, I learned a ton about conducting a qualitative research project and would recommend it to anyone doing senior thesis research of planning to do any sort of qualitative research in the future (including policy\/research analysis). Professor Mahler made this a great experience. If you are a Global Affairs major looking for a research design course to take, this one is it!",
    "Definitely take this course if you are interested in research or sociology in general. It provides good theoretical knowledge and also good practical case studies as well. Definitely a great class.",
    "This course was not particularly exciting to me, just because I am not super interested in methodology. I did really enjoy the fact that the course did transcend pure methodology in some respects, because it addressed epistemology and questions of what knowledge is and how we gain it, because I am more interested in these broader, more theoretical questions. Overall it was not an unpleasant class, and was well structured, so I think that if this is an area of interest for you it would be extremely helpful. I learned a lot, even though sometimes it felt like there was too much busy work.",
    "Yes -- this course helps one interpret research more accurately, given the imperfect nature of any particular research approach. The session on epistemology was particularly illuminating, and it helped me reconsider a lot about how knowledge itself is arrived at via research processes.",
    "Yes."
