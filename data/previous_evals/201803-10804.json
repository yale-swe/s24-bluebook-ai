    "I liked the variety of reading\/viewing material we were assigned (stories, poems, cartoons, dramas, etc.). I think the main difficulties with this course stem from the fact that the students have varying skill\/experience levels and come from very different programs and backgrounds. Thus some students were okay with the difficult and amount of work assigned, but I think some students might have felt a bit overwhelmed at times. It's hard to find a balance."
