    "Everything was good.",
    "Yes",
    "Some of the explorations were limited by cost. It would be nice if the school had lasers, lights etc that could be checked out like a materials library. Collaboration with other fabrication classes could bolster this library.",
    "Many resources were available to us upon our needs. Both the photo and fabrication labs were extremely useful and pretty much open for our use.",
    "yes",
    "There were obvious issues with the IT resources available in the 7th floor classroom which were consistently on the fritz. This problem is of course school wide.",
    "Yes, everything I needed access to was made available to me. My only complaint is that the computer in the 7th floor classroom would fail or lag or freeze during almost every class, often bringing digital presentations to a halt. I wonder if anything can be done to improve this situation?"
