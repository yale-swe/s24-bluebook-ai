    "It was interesting, but not the best EPE class I've ever taken. If you're into the theory, and not so much the application, it might be a good fit for you. But don't expect to come away knowing a ton more than you knew going in.",
    "Yes take it!",
    "AWESOME CLASS. BEST SURPRISE GUT SEMINAR EVER. if you can get in, TAKE IT. there's nooo work and she's a very easy grader. i don't think anyone in the class is getting below a B+ or A-. And the material and readings were really interesting.",
    "The course is an overview of the responsibilities and duties that humanitarian intervention entails. The course is great because professor Zinn introduces 'real world' learning to each of the classes.",
    "Okay\/Good. No strong feelings.",
    "It's a pretty solid class and I am glad I took it. I would recommend it. The workload is light compared to other classes but you still have the opportunity to discuss important issues of today in real-time (e.g. Sudan, Iraq...).The real world learning simulations were def. a plus.",
    "yes. a good seminar with interesting material&not a lot of work.",
    "I suppose I would recommend this class to another, except only if they understand that at then end of the course there won't be some blinding beam of light that's suddenly going to tie everything together as sometimes happens in other courses. If you find another class that suits you better, you might be better off taking it.",
    "If you are interested in policy and ethics of intervention, this is a course for you.",
    "Easy, enjoyable course. Not hard to get a good grade. Hopefully your class will be more engaging than mine, though, as it was not a particularly stimulating class. Would be a good class to write your senior essay in, then you can make more of the material.",
    "This is a great class (especially if you are looking to write your senior essay in it). Interesting and very relevant material.",
    "Eh, maybe. Wasn't as engaging as I had hoped for although it seemed interesting from the syllabus and from the round of introductions we did in our first class. Interesting readings but not challenging in the ways that helped me to significantly grow my knowledge and skill set relating to human rights."
