   "comments": [
    "This is an amazing class that you should absolutely take! These cases are really important in recent IR history and class readings and discussion are REALLY fascinating. Professor Howorth is amazing and this class is a joy. One of my favorites I've ever taken at Yale!",
    "it's a good class if you like the topic, workload very manageable",
    "Strong political science seminar that fulfills expectations. You start with a little theory, and then you focus on case studies. Reasonable amounts of reading and writing. This was my favorite course this semester because I enjoyed the discussion-based meetings and general dynamic.",
    "An incredibly valuable seminar that teaches you the complexities and controversies surrounding the practice of humanitarian intervention. I thought it was a relatively simple concept but this course taught me how nearly impossible it is to implement interventions uniformly because every case is unique. Absolutely take this course!!!",
    "It's a wonderful class! Take it!!",
    "Great class. straight-forward and predictable. legit assignments, no fussy stuff, no surprises.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class--you learn so much about world dynamics that you've probably vaguely heard of, but don't know much about. It offers a really clear summary of one dynamic of IR and how it has played out over the last 40 years or so, and leaves students well prepared to think about the future in this respect, and forces students to reconsider blind humanitarianism, which is helpful when thinking about how you evaluate policy.",
    "I would recommend this course. I learned a lot, and though it was a survey course of different interventions, we were able to go in-depth on many of them.",
    "Awesome class! I learned a lot! The problem is that humanitarian intervention is complicated and you won't really come out of the class with a framework through which to evaluate future crises. However, you will learn a lot about interventions & genocides of the past, which I feel is really valuable. It felt a lot like a history class at times -- the readings were reviews of what happened in different genocides, many of which I knew nothing about before the class. Howorth is a great professor who's pretty amazing at facilitating group discussions. The 2 assignments (long papers) give you the chance to explore some aspect of HI you feel is interesting. Howorth is a fair grader and lets you write about whatever you want basically for the papers. Overall would recommend taking!",
    "Great overview of various interventions and their history-- will give you a great sense of international successes and failure and you will probably be exposed to situations you may have never known existed. Reasonable work load and good instructor. Definitely recommend!",
    "You can think of this class as an introduction to (mainly) post-Cold War international affairs. You cover a lot of the major interventions of the past two decades (Rwanda, Bosnia, Kosovo, Libya, Syria, etc.) and the material is interesting. Can get a little too \"in the weeds\" with some of the legal talk, but overall a good course.",
    "Incredible course. If you get in, take it. I almost didn't so I could take another course, and I'm so glad I stuck with this one. I walked in knowing very little about humanitarian intervention, and was worried that I would have a difficult time in a class with Global Affairs majors who had been studying this stuff all throughout Yale. But the readings we were assigned all put us on the same page by laying out brief histories of the region. The case study approach is one of the highlights of the course. You get to go into detail on various policy questions, and, by looking at how different interventions turned out so differently, you get a sense of how complicated humanitarian intervention is. Howorth is the course highlight. He's an encyclopedia of knowledge about interventions and foreign relations more generally. He's also an incredible seminar facilitator. He is able to summarize people's points succinctly, and then throw them back out to the seminar to ask what people think of said points. He also doesn't let people get away with BS. He'll challenge and prod you, and force you to back up your point. Finally, he's incredibly funny. The 1 hour and 50 minute seminar goes by super quickly because of Howorth's wit and humor."
