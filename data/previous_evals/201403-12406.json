    "I definitely would recommend it to another student, especially if someone wants to study a useful but uncommon language.",
    "I had heard a lot of bad things about Arabic at Yale, but was determined to take it anyway. I am so glad I did. Especially with Sarab. She is a somewhat more challenging professor (out of the two that taught this semester), but she also teaches us more, and is just very on top of it. She knows how to teach and she does it well. The first few weeks are super overwhelming and I thought I was going to be majorly struggling all semester (some students come in with previous Arabic knowledge which makes things harder), but after a bit, it evens out. The workload lessens as the semester goes on, but you still learn a lot (although the vocab is weird). The tests and quizzes are very doable if you study a bit, and Sarab dropped the lowest test grade and lowest quiz grade. I'm excited to continue to 120.",
    "I had no experience with Arabic before taking this class. At the beginning of the semester the workload was, admittedly, verging on absurd. 3 hours a night is not a joke. You have to really want to learn the language. However, in the second half of the semester the time commitment with homework decreased and the burden was not so bad. However, you MUST keep up with the homework. If you don't, you will have no idea what's going on in class. If you work hard you will do well in the class and you will have a good foundation of Modern Standard Arabic.",
    "A very intensive language course. This class will be very diffcult and impossible if you dont do the homework every day and study extensively for the tests and quizzes.",
    "Arbc 110 is a fun class that will give you a good foundation for studying arabic. Don't expect to be able to have entire conversations after the first semester, but it is a lot of fun, and albeit a lot of work.",
    "This class does involve a fair amount of work, resulting from the fact that Arabic is objectively one of the most difficult languages for native English speakers to learn. However, Professor Sarab's dedication to the subject and her students always meant that if you put in the time, you'd keep up with the pace. Expect a steep learning curve while you learn the alphabet for the first 2-3 weeks, after which the difficulty starts to level out. I really enjoyed the class overall and think that the small size and informal nature of our section helped create an environment where everyone was constantly learning from everyone else. I can't believe how much we covered in one semester after starting from scratch, and I definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the subject.",
    "A solid introduction to Modern Standard Arabic - with a focus on learning grammatical rules, and acquiring a (mostly) useful basic vocabulary. Constant work throughout the semester (although easing up a bit at the end), but the work itself is never too difficult and oftentimes is fun and enjoyable. You probably won't learn too much dialect in this class (the once-a-week TA session was good but not the most effective), but dialect in any exclusively classroom setting is especially hard to teach.",
    "Arabic is really a language you need to commit to. The workload, especially in the first few months, is heavy and it takes a lot of practice to get good - but its worth it. Also, be warned: how much you learn, and how well you speak Arabic, really depends on which teacher you get. I lucked out and got the good one - and my Arabic is already miles ahead of those in the other professor's class, even though we're supposed to be on the same level.",
    "The first semester of Arabic is a dive head-first into an intense and different, but fascinating language. Modern Standard Arabic is the focus in class with the Shamii dialect being introduced in the discussion section. The pace is very rapid at first and be prepared to spend a couple hours each day doing the homework, but it evens out as the semester goes on and is quite reasonable. Despite hearing several bad things about the Arabic department, I was pleasantly surprised by this class. Sarab Al Ani is a wonderful teacher: fun, well-organized, and helpful. She made class very enjoyable, and was always there to answer questions. Beware of the section which was not at the same pace as the class. As such, I felt very bored in section and developed only a very rudimentary understanding of the Shamii dialect. Also, while language is a major focus, culture is almost completely bypassed, which bothered me. However, I would definitely recommend this class WITH SARAB to anybody who likes languages and is interested in Arabic. A slight knowledge of\/background with the language definitely helps, and most people had some previous exposure to the language, but it is not necessary."
