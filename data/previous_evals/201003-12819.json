    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in the topic. The workload itself is not terrible but interpreting the past is definitely a challenge.",
    "I would recommend this class to another Anthropology student, but not to any other Yale student. Some of these topics could be seen as very boring and tedious to those who are not focused on the anthropological or archaeological fields. We analyzed many in-depth scientific field observations and read through some dense material that others may not find captivating.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Especially if you have any interest in the exploration of human evolution in which hominins are not put on a pedestal but are instead recognized as just another piece of the environment in which they live.",
    "This class is very flexible, and almost disorganized. Expect to put in significant effort if you want to gain significant comprehension of the material. Professor Hill is very laid back and very fun to be around, and is a walking encyclopedia on hominid evolution, but this also means that he won't force you to do the work you need to do. I'm not sure I would take it again or recommend it, but you'll need to shop it to get a feel for whether the atmosphere is one in which you'll thrive."
