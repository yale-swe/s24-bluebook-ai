    "This's a great and interesting course. The story in French in Action is funny. Madame Burton is a great teacher. She's very supportive of her students and has a good sense of humour. You may feel lost at first because of the immersion method, which means the prof. only speaks French in class. But you'll get used to it after a while. The method really works well. Be sure to catch up with your workbook.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 1 with Burton. She's a great teacher, funny, and she makes class enjoyable, and really helps you learn French.",
    "Introductory French situates students in an immersion approach for learning the language, which gets them familiar with concepts and vocabulary by using conversation context. It is a very enjoyable course, not only because of the video we watch every week, but also because of the small size of the classes we have daily. If you do the work, you will definitely be able to come out of first semester being able to maintain a basic conversation in French with another person and to write competently as well.",
    "Great course if you want to learn the language, and your only option.",
    "You are basically submerged into the French language, which is great. I learned so much in just the first semester. It's an intense intro course; if you really want to learn the language as quickly as possible this is the class to take.",
    "A lot of work, but taught well."
