    "The course was a wonderful introduction to the canonical themes and works in the field. The personal classroom setup was conducive to asking questions and engaging in interesting discussions.",
    "I gained extensive knowledge on a host of themes in the South Asian, especially Indian, context such as colonial legacies, language politics, party politics, communal conflicts, civil-military relations, poverty and inequality, service delivery and migration.",
    "I learned a great deal about South Asian politics, particularly during the first few decades after India and Pakistan gained independence. I engaged more deeply with issues of identity, ethnicity, and nationalism than I had done in the past. Further, I became more familiar with some of the cutting edge work on public goods provision and governance in South Asia."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: A course especially designed for advanced readings on the topic was a wonderful way to harness our background knowledge to expand our horizons on a wide range of topics The small classroom setting allowed for engaging conversations. The readings were a great mix of the classical and the newest works in the field. Weaknesses: Some more concrete guidelines about what is expected out of the final paper would have been helpful.",
    "Strengths of the course: (i) As mentioned earlier, it covers a range of themes such as colonial legacies, party politics, service delivery, communal conflicts and hence, very valuable for anyone keen on specializing in the South Asian region; (ii) The readings are a really good mix from various disciplines: political science, economics, history and anthropology; (iii) It is taught by Prof. Wilkinson who is extremely knowledgeable about the South Asian context. Can't think of any weakness of this course!",
    "Strengths: great smattering of readings from a wide range of time periods; course encouraged us to think about potential avenues for future research Weaknesses: could have incorporated more contemporary political science literature on Pakistan"

    "Yes, it's a terrific way to become acclimated to political science scholarship on South Asia and think about potential future avenues of research on the region."
