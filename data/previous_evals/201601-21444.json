    "Well, you missed it. Unfortunately, you missed a tough, hilarious, and grammatical year with H Stern. It's not often that you find someone who does something so excellently for 25 years. Good luck finding another language course that will teach you about linguistics, poetry, and life in general.",
    "Dative Plural? \"-n!\"",
    "The best course I've taken at Yale. Unfortunately, Herr Stern is retiring this year. He's the best human being I've ever met, and it's too bad future generations of Yalies won't get the chance to take Intensive German with Herr Stern. Two hours of German a day is a lifestyle and failing to complete second year German by May was simply not an option. As Herr Stern was fond of remarking, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, might I remind you, the decision to learn German was yours, not mine! I am simply here to facilitate your learning, and no one is leaving this room until they learn 2nd year German!\" I am proud to say I have most definitely learned second year German under his expert tutelage and am writing this review from the comfort of my room rather than WLH 201.",
    "It won't matter to the next class, as Herr Stern will be gone, so who knows what it will be like. But a class where you learn not just German, but how to learn. You'll be amazed at what you can read at the end of nine months."
