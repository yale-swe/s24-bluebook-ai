   "comments": [
    "I learned about how environmentalism in India has evolved from colonialism to the present.",
    "Learnt to read and synthesize anthropological works, especially in context of South Asia. Gained experience in carrying out long-term, in-depth research for the final paper.",
    "This class has given me an incredibly new and insightful perspective on environmental justice, and a new mode of thinking to approach it. In addition, I have a newfound and rich knowledge of specific issues of environmental justice in South Asia.",
    "This class was full of knowledge about South Asia, India primarily, and having never studied this region specifically I learned SO much. Environmental justice was the underlying\/indirect theme that connected all of the books and topics that we discussed, so we didnt go very in-depth into conversations about EJ specifically. However, this allowed us to get a broad understanding of the many factors that are contributing to issues of environmental justice in South Asia. This felt like a great design for students with limited prior knowledge about the region.",
    "This class helped me develop a framework for looking at environmental justice. We talked a lot about ecologiessocial, politicaland how different webs of relations among people, animals, and natural objects like trees make up a society. We looked beyond simple caste or religious classifications and examined how different classifications blend together and shape interactions between human and non-human actors. It's a good environmental justice survey course if you're interested in South Asia.",
    "I learned a lot about the nuance of evaluating anthropological problems in South Asia, as well as several new terminologies.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of issues relating to the environment and environmental justice in India. This course did a good job of highlighting specific areas of importance in environmental discourse in India. I also think it exposed students to themes through the readings and discussions which made formulating a research topic easier and made it feel like the units all tied together well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thoroughly enjoyed the course and have few suggestions about how it could be improved. My one suggestion would be to decrease the amount of time spent on introductory PowerPoints at the beginning of the semester. I felt that we occasionally spent too much time in class reviewing background information on the readings instead of discussing the readings themselves.",
    "Strengths: i enjoyed the class discussions and readings. i especially appreciated times when prof anusha synthesized things for us, this helped me make better connections and foreground the discussion better Weaknesses: i wish i had received more feedback, though i did get very detailed comments on my proposal, i didn't hear much for most of the semester + never got an official grade on my proposal (which is fine, the comments were helpful enough). while i liked the thematic organization of the readings, sometimes I was left yearning for greater historical\/political background, which was missing after the first 1-2 weeks of readings",
    "The seminar\/class format and discussant\/respondent format made the class highly interactive and more interesting. The readings were interesting and insightful, although I do think each weekly reading assignment was a little too lengthy.",
    "Strengths: Chandanas expertise and the way she framed discussions. The books that we read and the anthropological foundation of the content. The range of interests\/backgrounds in the class that allowed for really interesting\/varying perspectives. Weaknesses: The lack of explicit focus on environmental justice and the way that it was only focused on if people talked about it. The way that the class sometimes felt like a book club where we discussed\/focused on the authors\/niche topics of books but didnt always connect it to any broader conversation.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings and discussion structure of this course. The professor and students were all very thoughtful and engaging because there was so much to discuss. I don't have many suggestions of ways it could be improved."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in environmentalism in South Asia. The seminar offers a thorough survey of secondary literature in South Asian environmental anthropology.",
    "yes, this is a great taster to anthropology for people new to the field. indian environmentalism can be analysed from so many different lenses, and the anthropological one proved to be particularly interesting.",
    "Definitely! It is a niche subject with themes that are applicable to many different subject areas.",
    "Yes! I looked forward to this class every week. My class was small (I think 11 people total), so discussions never felt competitive, and sometimes there were silences that some might call awkward, but which I appreciated because they gave me time to think about what was just said and respond appropriately.",
    "Absolutely, if they are interested in the subject matter it is quite thorough and well organized.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Anusha is teaching it again. It exposed me to many topics I hadn't learned about before in a way that allowed me to formulate my own thoughts about the readings and comments. I think it is an important and valuable course for anyone interested in environmental issues and would probably be a good course for anyone to take."
