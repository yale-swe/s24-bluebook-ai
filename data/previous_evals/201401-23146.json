   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, especially if they are preparing for the CP exam.",
    "If you are interested in comparative politics, this class is necessary.",
    "I would summarize PLSC 778 to a peer as the forced march through the cannon of comparative politics. We covered classics of the field, newer works, and got a taste of what the areas are for major research. However, there wasn't much time to dwell on any of them, as we had to keep going.I would reccomend it to anyone who is a) going to take the comp, b) if not in the sub-field wanted an overview of the sub-field of comparative politics.",
    "Yes, I think if you are planning to do Comparative Politics in any way, especially if you don't have a strong background in it, this class is very important.",
    "Absolutely necessary for preparing for the comprehensive exam.",
    "A whirlwind tour of CP. You have to be self-motivated to get through the readings as Steven does not check if students have read."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "great in-depth but also broad overview over recurrent topics in CP.",
    "This course was useful, as it was a chance to read a number of works I know I needed to read, but hadn't, especially for classic older works such as Lipset+Rokkan, Huntington, Levi, Gellner, and Anderson. It gave me a sense of what is going on in some parts of the discipline, such as democratization or varieties of capitalism which I hadn't read before outside of methods classes.While I don't see it particularly contributing to my dissertation\/research, it was needed to make sure that I have at least a basic knowledge of works which are cited in almost all comparative politics papers, and to be able to interact more intelligently with papers from unfamiliar research agendas at comparative politics workshops.",
    "I definitely learned things about comparative politics in this class. Again, would much prefer newer material.",
    "The course provided an excellent and essential overview of key themes in comparative politics. Such an overview is, I really believe, essential for any graduate students with any interest in the field.",
    "It did give me a better understanding of Comparative work and some different options for how to pursue it. Professor Wilkinson was also great about talking about the profession and what makes a successful job talk or comprehensive exam essay. I don't know how it helped my research in particular because I'm not really planning on doing Comparative work, but it is important for knowing more about the Political Science field and being able to speak about questions from a different perspective.",
    "Provided clearer expectations for the comprehensive exam than any other course.Provided a broad overview of comparative politics.",
    "Helps me pass the qualifying exam and learn about many interesting topics."
