   "comments": [
    "Math 115 is a great calculus course. It is challenging, however.",
    "This course is an obvious choice for all students who have not yet finished single-variable calculus. If possible, take this course with Dr. Rolf. He is a fantastic professor, really approachable, and brings a Texas twang that can't be matched. His class involves slightly more work, since you have to watch videos outside of class, but you will be more prepared as a result.",
    "Standard, solid. Exams can be tough but the psets and recommended problems will prepare you well.",
    "A great math course if one puts in the necessary work, but the work will to a degree shape your academic routine.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course to another student at all because of its extreme workload, the teachers, and the material.",
    "Math 115 is very solid calculus course. The problem sets are challenging but usually not overly frustrating, and the exam have the right difficulty, are clear in what they ask, and are generally well designed. I would recommend Math 115 to another student. More specifically, I would recommend that they take this course with Prof. James Rolf.",
    "I did this course with pre-lecture videos and they really helped me prepare for the upcoming class. I would recommend this course to other students, but I think most people take it for some pre-requisite or major.",
    "Yes. MATH 115 with Rolf was a very unexpected but pleasant course. For a math class, the class was quite engaging. The class size of about 35 worked really well for me. The psets and tests were fair for the most part.",
    "Interesting because of the videos. Though they required work before the class, I think it really paid off.",
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "This course is extremely difficult and time consuming. I would not recommend this course to anyone because it is extremely difficult to comprehend what is going on and to keep up with the instructor.",
    "This course teaches the second half of AP BC Calculus, or single-variable integral calculus. I would recommend this course to anyone coming out of AB Calc\/differential calculus, or anyone who wants to review the second half of BC Calculus\/integral calculus and series.",
    "Take it with Rolf! His class was awesome and he's just a great guy.",
    "I only recommend this if it is a requirement for a major or something. It is a very difficult class...and the problem sets easily take up 6-8 hours of your time a week. You will do a lot of self-teaching...the midterms and final are difficult as well, so expect to invest a significant amount of time studying for those!",
    "If you're into math, or if you need it for a major\/pre-professional requirement then I definitely recommend taking it with Dr. Rolf. If you're not into math, I wouldn't bother taking it.",
    "I would recommend this course. While the videos and prep problems add to the homework load I found them generally quite helpful. Go to problem solving sessions if you're unclear on any topics.",
    "I would recommend this interesting course. It is an encompassing calculus course which develops important methods and thought processes. I would recommend it because it is fun and also very relevant.",
    "If you need it as a requirement you have no choice but to take Math 115. Its definitely a manageable class but much tougher than any AP calc class. It starts off nice, but quickly becomes more tedious and difficult. Even people that took BC struggled. Definitely choose Rolf, he is a great professor and his enthusiasm makes the material bearable.",
    "Pretty standard overview of integral calculus but topics are covered slightly more in-depth than in AP Calc BC.",
    "If you're considering taking math 115, you're in for a bad time. The professors aren't great, and the class generally sucks. The p-sets can be challenging, but aren't too bad and can help you understand material that you wouldn't have gotten from class. The tests always have some material that you aren't expected to know or aren't taught. If you can skip the class, definitely do it. It was by far my least favorite class all semester.",
    "It's a fair amount of work, but not overwhelming. There are online lectures and prep problems in addition to p-sets and in-class lectures. Take it if you have to for a major, but if you are looking to fill a QR requirement look elsewhere."
