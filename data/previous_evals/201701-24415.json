    "Excellent class! Taught me about the intersection of race and migration and the nuances between Nigerian policies and American ideals.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -I enjoyed the structure of the class. -I learned a lot from the readings. All of the readings are incredibly informative and engaging. -The environment in class is very open, and it is never intimidating to ask questions. -The material that we cover in class is rarely repetitive, thus making each class different. Ive never been bored in class. -A lot of freedom to write papers on topics of your own choice. Weaknesses: -The weekly readings can sometimes be dense, thus making me spend a long time on the reading responses. -A significant work load.",
    "Professor Adesola was well versed with the course material and punctuated lectures with personal anecdotes that gave the class an excellent feeling of authenticity.",
    "A strength is lthay it goes over much of the material in a timely way. A weakness is that the class could drag on at some points.",
    "Many strengths- only weakness is the expectation on the reading response to cover 50 pages of reading in two pages.",
    "Great professor and classmates who are all engaged in the information",
    "The course material was really interesting, and the structure was pretty well organized. The only weaknesses were the lack of feedback about your grade and the level of engagement of other students which isn't something you can control all the time."

    "Yes, definitely take this course regardless of your major.",
    "Great way to learn about Nigeria",
    "I would, because it's hard not to do well in the class.",
    "Yes!! Most interesting class.",
    "Yes",
    "This is a pretty chill class. It's meant to be a lecture but there were so few people that it was basically a seminar. As a mechanical engineer taking this solely for the social science credit it was a perfect fit. Two short (6-8 pg) papers, a presentation, and weekly reading responses that half the class does, compared to my other classes it was an easy GPA booster. But if you're looking for intellectual stimulation, this probably isn't the class for you. The professor is really chill and all he does is read from his slide sets that he's already prepared, he does tend to ramble tho but literally everybody in this class is either Nigerian or an athlete. As a black American I thought the material was really interesting but nobody else in the class seemed to be engaged at all. That said, it's an easy class, the professor is chill and it's cool stuff if you're interested in African studies."
