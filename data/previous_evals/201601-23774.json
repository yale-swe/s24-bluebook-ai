    "It is an interesting class in which you model statistical data and draw conclusions. You will examine many statistical economic and microeconomic theory papers as well as dabble in game theory and industrial economics. It's all very interesting subject matter. However, I don't know if I'd recommend this course just because it is such a wild card as far as grading goes. The homework expectations were obscure and the tests were purposefully made longer than we could finish within the class period. I would take it if you're going to go with Credit\/D but otherwise it's a big risk.",
    "One word: Horrible. I can't even find any strength to commend the class about. Professor Michi is a funny and accessible guy, but the humor wears thin quickly as the jokes repeat themselves. The class has NO structure. Most of the materials is a repetition from Intro to Microeconomics, meaning you gain nothing. Lectures are a complete waste of time. But hey, at least you get to \"get your hand dirty with data,\" right? NO! It boasts to be a data analysis class, but all you do is copy down whatever he does on the board with minimal explanations. Without previous experience with statistics and econometrics, you won't understand what you're doing at all. I get out of class without zero knowledge of what instrumental variable is, or better yet, what data analysis even is. To make it worse, exams are extremely unfair. He just decides to throw graduate-level data analysis questions into the exam to make it impossible for us to finish it in time. He even admitted himself, \"you won't be able to finish in time this time.\" The whole class literally started cracking up when he distributed the exams. I understand the motive of throwing curve balls at us and make the questions harder, but REASONABLY hard, not IMPOSSIBLY hard. People who get the questions right either take econometrics before OR the luck lady just casually decides to shine on them that day. So, a defying HELL NO. Run before you can.",
    "256 was my worst class at Yale. Not because I did badly -- I am almost sure I got an A. It is because Mitsuru Igami is overall the worst professor I had at Yale. Let me tell you why. First of all, he shows up to the classes unprepared. He used the class computer for data analysis applications, wasting almost a quarter of the lectures trying to figure out what was going on with the computer. His lectures were disorganized -- nobody followed him. He is disorganized in general -- cancelled about 4 lectures and did not make up for them. I took intro micro, and I did not learn a single thing from his lectures. Secondly, he did not explain any of the ideas behind the data analysis, only giving vague ideas that you can find in a high school intro to R class. Thirdly, his exams were very unfair and hard because they were terribly structured and purposely irrelevant. In the first exam, he asked multiple choice questions for data analysis and made us pick any of the answers we want (not necessarily one). However, he did not penalize for wrong answers, which is hilarious because you could literally pick all of the answers and get perfect score. It made me think he is actually stupid. The first exam was nevertheless ok, and people did well, so he got \"kind of scared\" and said, \"promise no one will finish the final exam on time.\" So, in the final exam, he asked questions that I had no idea how to answer, even though I had taken econometrics and statistics and had studied very well for the exams. He also asked stupid questions like \"how many research projects is Professor Igami conducting currently?\". Lastly, he NEVER gives written instructions for anything and does not respond to his emails. About the homework, he did not tell us what to do clearly (only mentioned vaguely in class with his terrible English that we should bring the data analysis that we did in class), so many people ended up getting low grades for no reason because they did not add anything to the classwork -- which Professor Igami did not ask for. PLEASE DO NOT GIVE HIM A FULL PROFESSOR TITLE. HE DOES NOT DESERVE TO TEACH AT YALE",
    "A very gutty gut, especially if you're good at econometrics and microeconomics. Warning - the finals\/midterms are very unfair. (In this review, gutty gut means little work. I'm suspect that grades are going to be distributed randomly - as in completely randomly, with no regard to effort inputted or inherent ability.) It's OK to make tests hard to give students intellectual stimulation, but some questions are just ridiculous.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is not inherently hard, but he did make the final exam brutal. This was to get a better distribution, but the course still follows the econ curve.",
    "I had very high expectations for this class, and they fell flat. When I heard the title, I thought that we would be learning real world solutions\/stuff you learn as a consultant. Some slides like on entry\/exit and competition did provide some of that insight, but the rest was a repeat of introductory micro. The midterm was very easy and the final was very difficult. Overall, I felt that I got more out of the interesting papers that Igami wrote than from the actual class. This class is better suited for freshmen\/sophomores who haven't taken introductory micro and\/or econometrics yet. Also, the timing of the class was annoying; instead of capping the course, Igami just put the course at 4pm Wed\/Fri. I ended up missing several Friday classes due to scheduling conflicts.",
    "The material is a good synthesis of economics and statistics. The Professor is very funny and engaging. That being said, he cancelled five of our twenty-three classes. That's unacceptable for a Yale course, if you ask me. I really felt like we didn't learn much, and most of the lectures were wasted on going over papers that he wrote that didn't subsequently tie into our curriculum. If the Professor can focus more on the Stata and economics lectures, I think the course could greatly be improved. The final was also out of nowhere, pretty sure we covered only 60% of the material on it. Our psets were our class notes, so that was dope but also dumb.",
    "This class is a joke and should not be taught at Yale in the upcoming semesters! As an Econ Major, even though I went to all the lectures, I did not learn a single new thing. He was disorganized and only talked about his own papers. All we learned in the class was how great his 3 papers are and how he arrived to publish them. Ridiculous! Don't take it!",
    "Yes, do it. workload is light and gives good Stata practice.",
    "Needs restructuring v confusing but potentially really interesting.",
    "Do not take this.",
    "A good course to take prior to econometrics to get an elementary understanding of stata and data analysis and review some topics from intro micro.",
    "I would take this only if you understand that the exams and assignments are not very enlightening and if you are really interested in the content, which I found to be more interesting than the assessments themselves.",
    "!A: This was AN EASY, HORRIBLE ECON ELECTIVE. The PREREQUISITES***: You MUST take econometrics and intermediate micro before this class if you want to do WELL on exams. they aren't official, but everyone has taken them. ***PROFESSOR***: Igami is funny, but he's a bad lecturer. you will not learn anything from him. he DOESN'T RESPOND TO EMAIL. doesn't tell you what midterm and final will be like. COURSE CONTENT: you learn a bit of intermediate micro, a little game theory (cournout, bertrand) and a little vocabulary jargon about markets and competition. I learned almost nothing. ASSIGNMENTS: literally graded on formatting. you have to staple together stata logs that you did in freakin' class and then print out graphs and make them look nice. That's literally it. MIDTERM: manageable, but longish. split of intermediate micro type questions of profit max and multiple choice questions about regression and stata. FINAL: brutally hard and long. don't know how I will do. GRADING: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS CLASS. no work though very easy!",
    "This class was very well done. I learned a lot, and got very good at solving complex strategic math problems and regressions. The only qualm I have with this class is that a bunch of very high level Econ majors were taking it, and it was supposed to be marketed towards people who only have into Micro level of experience. The curves were harsh, and a little unfair for that reason.",
    "Nice class. Easy. Professor is an entertaining lecturer",
    "This is a great class to take if you are looking for something interesting and different. There are two parts to the class. One day a week we have lectures on theory of all things relating to \"strategy\" in the economic context (market structure, oligopoly competition, collusion, investment decisions, entry\/exit decisions, etc). On the other day we get hands-on experience with data analysis techniques as Professor Igami guides us (HIMSELF! NOT A TA!!) through the analysis that he has performed in past papers. The workload outside of class consists mostly of writing up the records of these data analysis sessions, and is very light. Professor Igami is endlessly entertaining, and even if the class is scheduled at a crazy time it is absolutely worth it just to be a part of. I am so glad I took this class, and if you are looking for a change from the normal, anonymous grind would recommend it wholeheartedly."
