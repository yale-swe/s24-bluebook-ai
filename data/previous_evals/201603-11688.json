   "comments": [
    "Meeting five days a week is a definite strength of this course, as this, combined with the requirement that we speak Spanish in class, helped facilitate rapid learning of the language. Some of the homework seemed like busy work, but overall I thought the homework was also helpful in reinforcing concepts learned in class.",
    "A definite strength is the rigor of the course - really forces you to learn and retain. A weakness is that the pace of class means you learn quickly but also forget quickly.",
    "The instructor did not always adhere to the syllabus completely, which made me slightly confused regarding the allocated homework which we had to complete. I felt that the readings in the coursebook could have been provided with more definitions included in the glossary because the text included much unfamiliar vocabulary which we had to look up otherwise. The textbook was very expensive and we could have been provided with cheaper options where the entire book could be used instead of just Chapter 10 onwards."
