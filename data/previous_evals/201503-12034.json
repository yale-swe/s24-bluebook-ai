    "AMAZING! FREN 110 was a wonderful experience! The classes were a pleasure to go to each morning and they provided me with so much knowledge! Every class was extremely engaging and fun-- especially the Tuesday presentations that featured the French in Action videos. The French in Action method ensures that you are immersed in the language. I managed to learn so much in just a semester-long first level course that I can now have full conversations with people! Matuku Ngame is one of a kind! Somehow he managed to make learning French fun and relatively painless! He's seriously one of the best instructors that I have encountered in my academic life and it was a privilege to be taught by him this semester! He was always so patient with students whenever we did not understand parts of the material, and made himself available for office hours on the day of each exam. TAKE IT WITH NGAME IF YOU CAN!",
    "This is an excellent class if you want to learn to actually speak French. Whether you are brand new or want to rebuild your foundation in the language, it is a very good class. While the homework isn't particularly difficult, there's a good bit of it. Tests can be difficult, but the class didn't bring a particularly large amount of stress to my schedule.",
    "It's a tough class, but it's rewarding.",
    "I definitely recommend this class - if you ever want to learn french, this is the way to do it.",
    "I would recommend French 110 03 to a fellow student, and caution them to get ready to spend a couple hours each day reviewing the textbook, the videos, and also the course packets and handouts. The speed is fast and there are a lot of essential rules to know when building a foundation in the language. Ultimately I approached the technical language aspects as though is were a math class, while working on me French conversational skills with a language tutor provided by Yale.",
    "French 110 is a very demanding but rewarding introduction to the French language. The famous Capretz method, which is what the course utilizes, immerses students entirely in French from the very first day of the course, and students interested in taking the course should enter it with an awareness of this. It is very much like being pushed into a body of water for the first time and being forced to learn how to swim, and while this is very effective and I am so grateful for the amount of French I have learned in merely on semester, it is absolutely a time-consuming challenge. However, a great professor and a supportive classroom atmosphere--as I had--can make all the difference. The weekly tests every Monday night are both a creator of stress and a great indicator of progress--though they understandably become progressively more difficult, they also demonstrate just how far one has come throughout the course and just how well the week's lesson has been absorbed. The videos presented each week were enjoyable and became a great constant in a course of many fluctuations and quick progressions. Overall, a very good way to dive into a language, but with a method that takes a great deal of getting used to!",
    "French is a difficult language but the way the course is structured at Yale is very straightforward and fair. If they truly care to learn the language, they should succeed.",
    "Would absolutely recommend French L1, if you're willing to put in the work. You can certainly get by decently by putting in minimal effort and doing the minimum amount of homework, but if you want to learn the language well, it will require a good amount of time spent on homework. As someone who didn't devote a ton of time to the class, I still can say that I learned a lot from the course.",
    "Learning a new language is difficult so don't expect a high grade in the class. It is possible to do well academically in the class but you should really be focused on learning the language and enjoying the material. I would highly recommend French 110 to other students.",
    "I would recommend French to students who really want to learn french. However, I would warn them that it is really hard.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is challenging, but teaches you a lot.",
    "The course is wonderful for beginning French learners or those who have dabbled previously. I did not anticipate how much I you would learn in this class, but I am so glad I chose to take French at Yale because I do not think I would have learned so much in a semester any where else. The system of learning the language is different form anything I've ever seen before but it is truly effective. It was tough during the first few weeks, but once I figured out how to study for the class, it was fun and rewarding. I would recommend being in Professor Ngame's. He is very willing to work with students who show effort.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you are seriously interested in learning French. If you're just looking to fulfill your language requirement and have never taken French before, I wouldn't take this class. You have to be invested in the material because it requires a lot of work and dedication. Be warned, there are others with prior experience with French, but I wouldn't let that deter you, because there's no curve. If you do take it, try to get into Matuku Ngame's section. He's the best."
