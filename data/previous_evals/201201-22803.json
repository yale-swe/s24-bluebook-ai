   "comments": [
    "Concept driven approach to general relativity and quantum mechanics. You learn the concepts behind all the complex physics and mathematics concepts. It allows you to think critically and synthesize the basic ideas behind these abstract topics. Highly recommend!",
    "If you need a Sc credit but want to still be interested in the class (as opposed to just doing mindless busy work or reading from a textbook all day), then take this class!!!",
    "Eh. The format needs some work. Seminar was grueling, because there's only so much depth to a discussion between non-science majors on these relatively complex phenomena; none of us really understood the underlying concepts for most of the course, and Prof. Harris' explanations were not always clear. He's a cool dude though. The weekly reading responses were incredibly onerous, and exams were way too long. The final paper was a nice way to go in depth on any area in quantum physics though.",
    "Take this if you're not a physics major, but you're interested in quantum physics, the theory of relativity, string theory, etc. The readings and lectures are really interesting. A lot of the times, you won't understand it, but since allof it is so uncertain and theoretical anyway, you'll feel good for understanding what you do. The two hour class sometimes dragged on, especially when I was sleepy, but it's only once a week, and it was definitely worth it. Workload is very manageable, quizzes and grading is very fair. Professor Harris is uber helpful and a lot of fun. I recommend it!",
    "It is very interesting material but you will only learn it if you do all the reading. The class itself is dry.",
    "I would recommend it only for students who are genuinely interested in the subject matter.",
    "I hear that they are making this class a lecture instead of the 20 people seminar that I was in this year. If so, I would definitely take it, because I think the least interesting parts of class was the discussion part since in a science setting, there really isn't much in way of an \"opinion\" to speak of but actual facts and concepts that the professor should just explain and teach. The concepts themselves are interesting enough to learn about and you can do so rather well from just doing the readings. The lecture wasn't super exciting, so don't take it if you want something entertaining. There was quite a bit of reading and homework each week (around 6 hours) and it's not a gut science class by any means, but the homework is really how you learn, so it's worth it. There are two quizzes, a midterm, and a paper, and they're all do-able.",
    "I would recommend this class if you have the time. You want to make this class a priority, so you can read all thematerial, soak it in, and attend the optional sections. This is not a class you just want to get by in. There is some amazing material and it deserves all the attention it can get. You'll learn about special relativity, black holes, multi-universes--some mind-blowing stuff. I wish I was able to put more time into it.",
    "Take it! An AMAZING science credit.",
    "It's a really fascinating class- if you're a non science major interested in quantum you MUST take it!",
    "Quantum Physics is definitely an unusual science for non-science majors course, in that you learn quite a bit of higher-level physics, including material that even physics majors consider advanced. However, this is almost entirely theoretical (not applied) and not at all quantitative, so if you're looking for a more math-based physics, this is NOT it. You'll learn a lot of really fascinating topics, from quantum tunneling to the Many Worlds Interpretation of the universe to the workings of black holes. The reading can be a bit long and tedious but the Scientific American articles tend to be more interesting and easier to understand. Overall, the amount of work is not unreasonable, though it is definitely a more difficult course than you *could* take if you just wanted a gut science credit. If you're looking for the easiest credit possible, just take Physics of Music andaccept that you won't learn anything interesting. If you're willing to work harder in exchange for actually knowing what quantum physics means, then take this class. Be warned though - class meetings themselves can be painfully tedious sometimes.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this class. I don't feelthat I learned very much, and the intellectual level of the course was low. If you have a strong background in math and physics, take a real physics class. If you don't, you can read Scientific American on your own, and it will be basically the same as taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because you learn about such neat stuff."
