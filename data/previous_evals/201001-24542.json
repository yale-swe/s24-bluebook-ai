    "This is a course that is only relevant if it is required, in which case you will take and enjoy it.",
    "It's required for EVST majors.",
    "A great chance to work on something that you're passionate about and to get credit for it. Beware of competing interests on your time and don't be afraid to push back when the process isn't working for you.",
    "The year-long senior essay is painful to be sure, but it is also something you can be proud of when you finish. I think the support you get throughout junior and senior year as you research and write your essay is unique among Yale's majors, and I'm convinced it is incredibly helpful for future research endeavors.",
    "This is the second semester of the EVST year-long senior essay. It is entirely self-directed, but with a draft deadline of March 1. This helps. Choosing the right advisor is crucial, and having one that can meet regularly helps immensely."
