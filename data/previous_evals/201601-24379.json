   "comments": [
    "WGSS300 is a necessary class on an important topic. Andrew was a dedicated and caring instructor, who posed many provocative questions. I particularly appreciated the effort he put into providing quality feedback on student work. At times, the discussions lacked focused and direction, but I have every confidence that Andrew will continue to grow into an outstanding teacher.",
    "I enjoyed this class greatly. The material is very interesting, the course is well taught, and the workload is very manageable. Professor Dowe did a wonderful job tying in different aspects of LGBTQ life in different parts of the world. The course's focus on the Anglophone Caribbean and South Africa provided interesting comparisons of two different places and their respective modes of life. Overall, this was an extremely enjoyable and insightful course.",
    "I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND this course to any Yale student. I think that the themes of the material are highly important for each student to engage with at some point during college. This course in particular is so specific that it is impossible to lose sight of the relationships between texts.",
    "Yes, take this course! Necessary, urgent, brilliantly composed syllabus - every work is very different but so easy to talk about with one another. Andrew Dowe is so supportive and excited about your ideas too!"
