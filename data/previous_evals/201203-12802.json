    "Good basic Spanish class. Juan Pablo is a fun professor, and very good at teaching. He is extremely nice as well!",
    "If you are going to take Spanish, take it with Juan pablo. Also take spanish, as of L1 it seems like a relatively easy and useful way to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "Great class. Moves quickly though. Keep on your homework.",
    "It's a basic Spanish class covering material from, well, the beginning and ending with the imperfect tense. While most will have taken Spanish at some point before, it isn't necessarily that much of a detriment to learning the language. You have to make sure you get a good teacher, although it's impossible to shop the different sections because of the way the classes are set up during shopping period. Juan Pablo is a fantastic teacher - he genuinely cares and is one of the nicest teachers.",
    "I would recommend it only for someone with no spanish background. The course is very well designed to introduce individuals into the language.",
    "Yes, I would recommend Spanish 110 06 to another student because the teacher was very good and it was a great class that provided a basis for the Spanish language.",
    "Easy class if you took Spanish before or if you put the effort forth. Do the homework, do well on quizzes, and participate and you will do fine.",
    "The class is hard but will help you understand what you need to know for Spanish Level 1.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course.",
    "Spanish 110 is an introductory course to Spanish. It's great for getting you to really immerse yourself in a new language. Moves much faster than high school Spanish."
