    "link theory to practice. interpretation of data and set up tests using softwares",
    "A solid understanding of basic statistical analysis and how to run many of these tests in Minitab.",

    "I expected to cover a broader range of topics, with less in-depth discussion of any single procedure. I found the coverage insufficient for practical use in my field of research. Specifically, I wish that non-parametric tests were covered.",
    "Yes but we were told many times that there were things that we wouldn't understand and were dismissed. I didn't love this aspect of the course.",
    "Yes",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The main strength of the class is certainly the use of the streaming service, that greatly facilitated engaging with the class while busy with dissertation labwork. I think the main weakness of the class is the relative limited topical coverage. I don't feel ready for more advanced classes that I would have liked to take next such as Spatial Statistics. Instead, I will almost certainly take Multivariate Statistics first.",
    "Weaknesses- TAs didn't always seem to have full understanding of the course beyond just the lectures. The lecture slides were really unhelpful and organized in a poor manner. Strengths- I enjoyed having the online recordings so that you could attend class and then watch the lectures after.",
    "Too much great content in the slides sometimes mean less clarity. We might need an better outline of the course content and logic flow.",
    "Great professor -- really wonderful teacher! No real weaknesses.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer is an incredible instructor, he's great at explaining difficult concepts, he explains things in multiple different ways often using different methods so if you don't understand one way, you're likely to understand another way he walks through a concept. The course teachings and the course assignments align well meaning I never felt I didn't have the skills and knowledge to answer questions on an assignment as long as I actually attended class and watched lectures. The only small thing I would suggest\/request is for the professor to chat about the final project a bit sooner, it was completely my fault that I didn't start it sooner but an earlier discussion about it might have really helped me. That's not a complaint though - it was entirely my fault for not thinking about it until a bit too late."

   "comments": [
    "I think it was a good introduction to stats but I'm not sure if I could do any statistics leaving this course without using step-by-step instructions",
    "Stay on top of the readings, class videos, and workload!",
    "Don't fall behind and make sure you start thinking about and meeting with the professor early about your final project. Also: go to office hours! Professor Reuning-Scherer walks through problems that you're stuck on and is incredibly helpful.",
    "I audited the class and it was a great and easy way to refresh my stats because Jonathan is an excellent teacher; however if you are thinking of auditing, really commit to watching all the videos otherwise it doesn't fulfill the purpose. If you are not very good at math or lack a strong quant background, it is a very good class to take. If you are very experienced and knowledgeable with math then it will feel as too basic (take other stats courses with more calculus\/proofs)."
