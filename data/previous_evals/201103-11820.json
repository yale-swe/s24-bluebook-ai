    "I would if the student wishes to gain mastery over his subject. I would not, if the student will not take the initiative and get work done on the essay early. The more self-motivated you are, the more suitable the course will be for you. Writing an essay for a seminar could be very rewarding as well. Both are difficult, but, at least, more often than not, your teacher will provide sufficient structure for you to get your essay done on time. It is nice, though, to not have much additional reading for your course if you do English 490.",
    "Writing an independent essay is an awesome way to study something that you care about but that there may not be a class for. Although it is certainly a stressful process that requires a lot of organization and advance planning if you want to avoid a panicked end of the semester, when I finished my essay, I felt like I had really written something all my own.",
    "It's important to be self-motivated.",
    "This was an independent study -- so it will obviously vary by professor and project. Still, I highly recommend doing this. I had Professor Bloom who provided no guidance really. Better to pick a less big\/famous professor because they'll actually help you more."
