    "I would definitely recommend this class since it was both fun and intellectually stimulating.",
    "It's a very helpful course to all cell bio PhD students, and even for all BBS students. It helps us to establish the background knowledge of cell bio, know how the cell work, learn how to solve scientific questions.I'd highly recommend this course to other students.",
    "It's a great course and gives us an advanced background of cell biology. I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, but I would highly encourage them to be involved in the discussions unlike some of my classmates.",
    "Cell Bio 606 is a good overview of very current research pertaining to rapidly advancing fields in cell biology. It is effective at introducing current literature on a variety of topics.",
    "I would recommend to another student.",
    "Yes, absolutely.",
    "Helpful, if you want to learn some cell biology.",
    "I would recommend it. I think it's a great way to learn about how molecular biophysics is intersecting with cell biology in interesting ways."

    "I have a much more biophysical background, therefore this was great to learn so much about cell biology. This course has made many papers that were once inaccessible for me readily accessible. This could help greatly since I can now much better understand all of the literature in which ever area I go into, not just the work directly related to what I will be doing.",
    "This course help me to understand a lot of the experimental designs and the ways to solve problems. Besides, it introduce many important findings in various fields of cell bio. This indeed broaden my knowledge.",
    "It is a good extension I would say.Also, it is good for me to choose rotations.",
    "I learned how to more effectively read and analyze scientific literature. That is a skill that I feel will take me far in the scientific community.",
    "Good.",
    "Because my work is in microbiology, it does not seem to be helpful at this time.",
    "I learnt a few cell biology topics.",
    "I am not a cell biologist, but I appreciated the papers that could track the movement of certain proteins through the cell. This was very interesting and could (perhaps) be applied to the research of my protein, but may not actually show anything interesting to me because my protein is not involved in any cellular signaling."
