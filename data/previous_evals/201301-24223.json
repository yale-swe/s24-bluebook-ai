   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The class was well-organized and obviously very well thought-out in how all the topics connected together and was meant to teach about policy from the get-go. For most of the MPH students in the class, the political science stuff was very new and interesting.Weaknesses: The time. Oh, God I hope it's not 8 am anymore ever again. Really killed the class for me as I am not an early riser, but I still thought it was excellent.",
    "Good organization to the course, but group project is a struggle to coordinate so that drafts written by different people are fluid and comprehensive. Good readings and seminar discussion. Somewhat unclear grading.",
    "The class is very good. Informative and something I would use outside YSPH.",
    "This course was different from any other course I have taken at Yale. It has a political science nature to it, and talks about a lot of the theory behind the politics that exist around healthcare. I really enjoyed the course, though it was slightly hard to concentrate on such a complex topic so early in the morning! The assignments were extremely difficult, but I learned a lot; I would say that it was hard to decipher exactly what we were supposed to be answering. The prompts could be make simpler, which would be helpful.",
    "Very good class!",
    "This course is incredibly interesting. The material lends itself really well to interesting class discussions.My only complaints would be about the second assignment:I don't feel that it is a practical policy brief. In my view, a policy brief should be short, highlight key points, and make a recommendation. While the first assignment allowed us to follow those steps, the second assignment asks us to talk about concepts that seem too abstract to be relevant to politicians or bureaucrats creating policy. We are asked to talk about four types of federalism, which in reality would never be explicitly discussed. Certainly for a political scientist these are useful distinctions. However, using these terms in a policy brief seems counter productive. Individuals in HHS or congress who might read a paper that talks in depth about \"catalytic federalism\" would likely not understand what you are talking about.",
    "Good course. It would probably be even better at another time (not so early in the morning).",
    "Loved this course and changed the way that I think. This course's papers were the most challenging that I've done in grad school, but I feel like I got so much out of them. I think I would be asked to do assignments like these if I were to work as a policy analyst. So I appreciate that they're very applicable for my future career path. This class has a lot of readings each week. So that was a bit tough to manage on a weekly basis.",
    "This course is very interesting - providing an assessment of the political factors affecting health policy in America. It is a very ambitious course, probably too ambitious! Though this course had an overall organization, sometimes it was hard to see the organization through all of the details (hard to see the forest through the trees). There were many readings - probably too many. I feel that there were some main points that were important to learn and discuss - but because the material became so in-depth and detailed and massive, we lost track of the main points.Similarly, the two assignments were too ambitious and too huge. I felt that the assignments wanted us to synthesize all the material from 1\/2 of the class AND come up with new perspectives! Because there was so much material in each half, this was a massive undertaking and too complex to be a useful learning experience in the time allowed. It would be a better learning experience to have smaller projects more spread out - so that we could chew on a smaller amount of information at one time. Maybe these smaller projects could add up to an understanding of the same whole - but not be so overwhelming.",
    "This course was one of my favorites at YSPH so far. I really feel like I learned and gained a lot from it. I especially feel prepared to write a policy brief or analysis for a future employer. I'm not sure if the weaknesses are anything that can be changed, but 1) I thought many of the readings were dense and difficult\/boring to get through and 2) the 8am start time was just not conducive to learning for me, especially for a class that really needs your brain to be on and working.",
    ".",
    "Great class discussion",
    "Strengths -- felt like a health policy student in earnest through this course; learned ins and outs of politics around health care from history to simultaneous and often competing influences\/priorities of federal, state, and local entities; papers, particularly the 1st one, felt like real, tangible products that I could submit to potential employers as demonstrative of my Yale Health Policy degree acumen.Weaknesses -- 8AM start time (it is very difficult to be fully engaged, participatory, and\/or enlightened by the really intricate, fascinatingly nuanced 2-hour weekly discussions when the start time is 8AM. Even a 9AM start would be a drastic improvement); while I understand that the paper prompts reflect the many issues that political analysts must take into account when creating policy briefs, the convoluted nature of the prompts made it extremely difficult to understand what was being asked. The first paper, for instance, had 3 main issues (cost containment, quality, obesity), each of which had 2 considerations (public support and political feasibility), that were to be inspected from 2 time-specific perspectives (reflective of Obama's 2nd term campaign vs. looking ahead to his 2ndterm) all while considering which of the 3 issues should be taken up and making some sense of what it means to have the dual audience of the Obama Administration and the Democratic National Committee -- as I hope can be seen, this was far too loaded to easily make sense of what was being asked.",
    "Great discussion. Wish it was later in the day and the group project was not worth so many points.",
    "The conversation might have been livelier if it wasn't at 8 in the morning ;)Other than that: as for the final group paper... I felt the project suffered a bit from tragedy of the commons. I can only speak for my group, but: everyone pulled their weight and did their part and took the assignment seriously; however, as it was given at the end of the semester, time for thisassignment was subsumed by the hectic schedule at this time of year. I think we would feel more of an obligation to each other and be able to commit more time to collaboration if the assignment was given earlier in the semester (when we would continue to see each other in class and be better positioned socially to hold each other accountable for the quality of work that we produced individually for the group).",
    "This class met at 8AM which is not conducive to lively policy discussion. Clearly there is value to training for \"real world\" experiences by managing these interactions early, BUT given that many other public health courses are later in the day it was a task to shift sleep schedules just for this one day in order to make it to class and contribute thoughtfully. Aside from the time, the content was appropriate and relevant.",
    "The class is really good - the material is incredibly interesting and Mark presents it all in a very compelling way. However, it is way too earlier in the morning - it was really hard to get up for class. This probably would have been one of my favorite classes at Yale if it had been in the afternoon (or at least not at 8am).",
    "Overall, I very much enjoyed the course and thought the structure to generally be successful. I think perhaps assigning less weekly readings and instead spending more time discussing those readings in class could make lectures a bit more dynamic. As for the projects, I think the group paper project needs a little refining in order to be totally successful. Overall, I enjoyed the class but think it could be improved by tightening morning lectures and perhaps reworking the group project (perhaps an individual paper and a group presentation?).",
    "Very interesting topics, classes had structure",
    "The course was excellent in providing an introduction to very important policy topics to all students. I wish this course had been taught the first semester instead of the big introductory course. The policy students can certainly benefit from having a smaller classroom session with Dr. Schlesinger earlier on during their MPH",
    "This courses' biggest strength was the format of the in class lecture\/discussion. The instructor lays out a clear outline of what you will talk about and makes it very interesting to listen to. The readings can be good, but are sometimes too long or wordy to convey a message.I think the assignments are actually a weakness of the course. I don't have much of a policy background, and felt very unprepared for the first assignment. I managed to get a decent grade on it but felt like my paper was full of fluff that I didn't really understand. I think the paper can be written in a LOT fewer pages than we were asked to do (which was 15).The readings are also too overwhelming; choosing fewer readings that cover the main points would be more effective. I sometimes give up before I start due to the sheer volume of pages to get through.",
    "The greatest strength of the course was the professor--he made himself available to students. Because of this, the class became a little more customizable--it put more responsibility on the student to use the professor as a resource and as an opportunity to get as much out of the course and material as possible. The readings were challenging--especially the volume of material. It became difficult to synthesize\/absorb and integrate so much material. In this regard it may have been beneficial to have a short one-page weekly summary on the readings as part of the course work. (Or even a suggestion by the professor on ways to organize the readings--perhaps systems that other students in the past have developed and found helpful--I did not learn that I needed a better note-taking\/organizational system for the weekly readings until after struggling with the material for the first assignment). I thought the 2 assignments were both excellent opportunities to engage with the readings.One weakness: no seminar. It might have been helpful to have more opportunity to integrate and explore the readings\/themes through discussion. This could be done through a structured seminar--maybe even one topical discussion every 2 weeks. Or writing could have been another mechanism for more on-going integration of the material and ideas. It would have also been great to have an opportunity to read other student's ideas: a couple of seminar papers so that we can be exposed more to other ways of thinking and to see how our peers are thinking about and working with the material.",
    "Excellent lecture and discussion. Biggest strengths are breadth of issues covered and professor; biggest weaknesses are amount of reading and lack of small group discussion. Recommend having either an extra session or background material on American political system."

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great teacher.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a great facilitator and he truly cares about his students' learning. He's flexible and really pushes students' thoughts. I really enjoyed his class and his teaching style!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesinger is very knowledgeable about this subject matter. He seems enthusiastic about this area and teaching it to students. He presented the material in an organized way, and he is able to generate good interactions with the class. Dr. Schlesinger was open to students questions and concerns and seemed to genuinely want to help students to learn the material.Dr. Schlesinger waited to give us the two assignments until we only had 2 weeks to do them. I don't know why he did this. They were huge assignments. It would have been helpful to have the assignments earlier so that we could begin to think about them and formulate our ideas as the class went along. The assignments were two huge to do in 2 weeks and were too overwhelming in that short period of time - thus I felt they were not a good learning experience. Either give them earlier and students can think them over longer, or cut them into pieces and give smaller projects more frequently.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger is a great instructor, he is very knowledgeable and the lectures are very organized, with each one building off of the other. Tough grader, but very detailed in his feedback.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Professor Schlesinger is extremely attentive to students and solicits feedback frequently.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Strengths -- so knowledgeable on so many subjects; appreciated that he peppered (but didn't over-include) several of his own publications in the syllabus; forced students to think through many layers of political forces shaping health politics in the U.S., focus on two policy brief assignments, opportunities to apply each week's learnings to a specific content issueWeaknesses -- sometimes in-class questions were so nuanced that it was difficult to understand what was being asked",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Great professor. Kind and enthusiastic, and very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Honestly, I wasn't all that interested in this course, but I took it b\/c it is required. At the end of the semester, I can say I learned a great deal about motivation in policy\/politics as it relates to public health, and while this subject area isn't my forte, I see the merit in incorporating the sort of analysis we did in this class into my future work. In short: Mark, you made me care about something I previously had very little interest in. This is an excellent litmus test for a great teacher.You treated your students with respect, encouraged discussion, and all with a sense of humor. You also broke down concepts for students w\/o a comprehensive background in either public health or politics, without oversimplifying and engaging students from diverse academic backgrounds. Well done.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Incredibly intelligent guy, very thoughtful and encouraging of comments. Has a way of spinning student comments to be positive, and teases out meaning behind comments in a way that inspires confidence in students to continue contributing. Lovely man.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a really good section leader - he ties in readings well and helps students arrive at insights on their own. The class is always interesting, even though it is so early in the morning that most people walk in half awake.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is an excellent professor who is incredibly available to his students. He is always willing and able to answer questions. Mark also keeps a \"cool\" vibe in his classroom. Lectures seemed like discussions rather than opportunities for pendatic displays. Mark also clearly has a great command of the current health policy landscape, and it was great to have that at our disposal.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Incredibly knowledgeable and an adaptive teacher",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very thoughtful and interactive style of teaching. He always directed the dialogue and allowed for students to guide the conversation.I wish he would do two things: 1) reduce the number of reading and 2) be more strict about making sure the students complete them before class begins. This would lead to an even greater degree of participation in the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0The instructor is very engaging and interesting to listen to. I also appreciate that he provides perspectives on all sides of an argument. He is fairlyresponsive to questions, but his wording on assignments is a little vague.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Strength: Very knowledgable about the material. Classes are taught in an interesting way--they are semi-structured and allow for a more fluid exchange between students and the professor. I like this style a lot, it is not something every teacher is able to do well as it can be difficult to ensure that all the important take-away points are covered sufficiently. However, it encourages critical thinking and greater engagement with the readings. Classes felt dynamic and more alive than a straight lecture often does. I also thought Prof. Schlesinger was a great resource and a true teacher. He cares about the interests of the students and is sincere in wanting to help students get the most out of the course to meet their own personal\/professional goals. He is approachable and a good listener.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesinger is fantastic. He is extremely knowledgeable and makes the material accessible to students with examples and good reading selection (handouts were helpful during class!) He also facilitates discussion well and is available to students to discuss concepts or related topics."

    "Yes, definitely take this class. If you are an MPH student (unlike me), then I gather that 99% of the material here will be new to you and you should really know it to go anywhere in health policy or public health. You'll learn the political science foundations for analyzing issues in health policy, done in such a way that you'll be able to speak to specifics of the field but also more generally as well to public policy problems of other types and also analyze them. Take it! Heavy on the reading sometimes but he helps to put it all into perspective.",

    "This course looks at different frameworks\/avenues of policymaking as they relate to healthcare. Throughout the course, we looked at the role of public opinion, federalism, and the courts in healthcare policymaking. The two paper assignments are extremely difficult, but make you think at another level.",

    ".",
    "This course is your first opportunity as a Health Policy MPH candidate to truly feel like you're putting your policy know-how onto paper through the assignments. The class sessions force you to think through complex health policy issues from their historical roots to potential future directions. I absolutely recommend this course and wish it was offered in the Fall for 1st semester 1st year students instead of the spring.",
    "It is extremely valuable to know the intricacies of politics in policy making. A must for policy students.",
    "In this course, you as a class will analyze the many factors that go into policymaking in the realm of public health, including how policy makers might motivate others and be motivated themselves. The course will cover legislation, leadership, the courts, and evidence-based research on public opinion.This is a great *introductory* course for anyone looking to better understand politics through the lens of public health, or public health through the lens of politics.",
    "Interesting readings, good discussion, great class in general. 8am is way too early, though.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is definitely interested in health policy. I'm not sure that this course is suited to someone just testing out an interest. If you know you have at least SOME interest in policy, I would take this class. It was fun! and Mark is fantastic. You'll learn a lot about how policy in the United States actually works, from the influence of drug companies to judicial bodies. Overall, great class!",
    "Really great way to learn the basics of politics in field of health. The instructor does not expect you to come in with a background in politics although you will be expected to learn as you go and to do some more readings to catch up with the rest of the class if you do not remember anything from the intro to health system class.",
    "This course analyzes important policytopics for HPA students",
    "This course gives you a perspective on why health policy has evolved into what is has become. It does NOT give any sort of overview on health policy basics. I would recommend it if you have an interest in understanding how policy works; however, a non-policy student may be better off taking a less abstract course.",
    "The course is challenging. Health policy is extremely complex so there's a lot to try and understand and integrate. There is a lot of material and the reading is often kind of dry. However, there is a lot of opportunity to develop your ideas and get solid feedback and support todo so. You can use the assignments to really push yourself. You have to be self-motivated to get the most of out the class, there is no hand-holding--so it's also an opportunity to learn a lot about yourself: your strengths and weaknesses as a student and also to get a sense of what policy work is all about. Lectures are always engaging. The professor is great.",
