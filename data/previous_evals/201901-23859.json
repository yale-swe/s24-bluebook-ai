    "1. Basic Trade Theory, 2. International Economics",
    "A great course, with a lot of topics that are really useful for us as central bankers.",
    "I developed my knowledge and understanding of the economics of international trade and international finance.",
    "The most valuable thing I walked away with was how to think about economic issues in sequence. Many of the problems we addressed at the end of the course were difficult to answer on the top of my head. But when given a minute or two to work things out, I found that I could almost always reach a satisfying conclusion."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: the materials are systematically well explained.",
    "Strengths - Sigga is very nice, and a true expert in her field. Weaknesses - The course should have a pre-req. I didn't have prior exposure to any finance, and I struggled in the latter half of the course. The course seems to be designed to comment on current events, but then tries to make it accessible to intro-level students. But without prior experience with the models and frameworks being built upon, it was really hard to learn it all from scratch. I think this class is better suited to students with a knowledge basis already.",
    "Good mix of theory and current affairs. The problem sets were rigorous enough without taking days. The instructor is very knowledgeable and very personable.",
    "The course lectures were made up very well.",
    "This course moves very quickly. It may be helpful to have more regular problem sets to make sure that we are getting the right idea. Another option would be to have online quizzes linked to the readings to encourage students to do those readings. The strength of this course is Sigga - she is engaging and clearly knows these topics well. I really liked the case studies that we did.",
    "I really appreciated how the course was structured, and found the course excellent as it was."

   "comments": [
    "You will gain a lot of knowledge about international economics, especially capital flows, trade balance, and exchange rates",
    "Absolutely, this was a great course! The readings, assignments, slides, and lectures were interesting, informative, and helped to improve my understanding of the subject matter.",
    "I think this class would be interesting for those who have experience in finance\/international trade\/international economics. If you have a basis of information, you will enjoy and learn. But for those who lack that basis, it feels like a lot and can be a bit stressful to learn everything. We only had 5 psets, but they would take me hours and hours - and I still got things wrong.",
    "Absolutely, in other classes, I constantly used knowledge gained in 601 to add insight how the economics affected the policy.",
    "Yes. This courses workload is appropriate and we can get knowledge very smoothly.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in thinking about international economic issues. It would be helpful to have a strong background in micro and macroeconomics but it is possible to do this course with a reasonable level of understanding.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student, though I may encourage them to take a Macroeconomics course beforehand. I walked into Sigga's class without very little economic background, and did a lot of self-studying to keep up with the second half of the class."
