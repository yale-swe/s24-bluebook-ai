   "comments": [
    "Only if you're serious about taking the language courses through L5 (with a Light Fellowship) can you expect to hold a conversation in Chinese, so take an easier language if you're not committed. Otherwise I would recommend taking this course.",
    "Chinese L2 is a very challenging course but definitely rewarding in expanding Chinese speaking, reading, and writing abilities. The course is an exact repetition of L1. Tests are just as difficult as L1. Pretest review sessions are very helpful. Narratives are a bit more difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Be prepared for the work, but you know it's coming, so you'll be alright. Jump on learning those radicals\/characters immediately, and listen to the recordings. You'll learn so fast you'll be amazed. You'll really grow to love the language and the people you're learning it with.",
    "Such an amazing fun class. The small class size and intimate relationships with the teachers are great. We learn so much useful Chinese grammar and vocabulary. If you have time to take Chinese, you should absolutely study it at Yale. I am exceptionally happy I decided to take it, even in my senior year. It was either my favorite or second favorite class in all of Yale.",
    "The course is a lot of work but among the most rewarding classes I have taken.",
    "CHNS 120 is a continuation of CHNS 110. Five days a week, 50 minute classes, about 2 hours of homework a night depending on efficiency. The teachers are amazing, and the rotation system makes it so you get used to different ways of speaking and different methods of teaching. The small class size also allows your class to feel like a family. The homework may seem tedious at times, but it is what makes studying for tests so easy. I highly recommend this course. One of the best decisions I made at Yale. Definitely take it!",
    "I had to take it to get credit for 110, but I would definitely reccomend taking Chinese. I learned so much and plan to continue studying it. The teachers are fun, helpful, and great. A lot of hard work, and a big time commitment, but is definitely worth it in the end.",
    "I would recommend this course because you learn a great deal in a short amount of time. I would however be sure to explain you have to be willing to accept a large workload.",
    "CHNS 120 is a fast-paced Chinese level 2 course with daily homework, daily quizzes, and chapter tests about every two weeks. You will learn a lot and it will be very rewarding. The class sizes are small which ensures that you pay attention. I definitely recommend the course to anyone who has already taken L1 CHNS 110 and wants to continue their Chinese studying. The Chinese program at Yale provides you with the best learning environment and teachers possible.",
    "I would highly recommend Chinese 120 to other students. The work can take a lot of time and be tedious at times, but it's a wonderful class and everything is worth it!",
    "Chns 120 is an amazing course with extremely caring teachers who sincerely want their students to succeed. The class size is small, usually capped at 10 students, and the environment is very friendly and conducive to learning. Although the workload is heavier than most foreign language courses, this class is ultimately one of the most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale."
