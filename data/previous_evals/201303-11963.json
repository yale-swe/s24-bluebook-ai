    "I highly recommend this course. HIGHLY. It gave me so much to think about, a new spiritual awakening with every class. But, I was only able to have this experience because I was willing to put in the time and emotion to engage and challenge the readings and class discussions. This isn't a class where you'll get anything out of it if you obediently swallow whatever's spoon-fed to you.",
    "This is a very unusual course. Very interesting, sometimes unsatisfying. I think a number of us found it quite useful\/transformative. I think the only way to be sure of how you'd feel about it is to shop."
