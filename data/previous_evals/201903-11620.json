   "comments": [
    "Writing skills, how to format a senior thesis, how to conduct research on a given topic, how to defend and refine a research topic, general skills for writing and reading well, the list is really pretty endless. This class improved my writing, my reading, and my ability to structure an essay. If I hadn't taken this class, I would have been seriously lost writing a senior essay. Now instead, I really feel pretty on top of things and know exactly what I need to do to complete it.",
    "Better exposure to research methodologies and the diversity of interests in the class. I actually really enjoyed the process of walking through each person's project and helping guide the process of research.",
    "I really learned how to research and plan ahead for my senior thesis work next semester.",
    "The course is a time to develop the research question for your thesis. I went through many phases of changing and revising my research question but I was particularly behind in this aspect, so I suspect that other students got more out of the class.",
    "The course gave us a strong foundation in the concept of research and a structured environment in which we could further develop our research questions.",
    "I revised my thesis proposal and began the research and writing process.",
    "great planning for my thesis"

   "comments": [
    "The interactions between students was fantastic so I think that was a real strength. Most of the people in this class were writing their essays in the hopes of winning an award (and two became Rhodes Scholars while we were there). Just being amongst people like that was fun and meant I learned a lot. Being around other people also helped me understand that what I was struggling with was not unique; we all have to overcome the same things when we write our thesis. Aside from that, I think Professor Huber did a great job setting up the course.",
    "I thought that it was really positive to have this class in general to keep us accountable. I think that this class was also strong since people did seem to genuinely engage with each other's materials. I think that we could have more writing pieces or assignments that are peer-reviewed early on in the semester!",
    "All strengthshe was really flexible to our demands and invested in our projects.",
    "Strengths of the course are Professor Huber and the opportunities we had to receive feedback from our peers in small group settings. If I could redesign this course, I would make it so that we have specific benchmarks that we need to meet each week\/every other week (i.e., have your motivation written by week 1, have your preliminary research question written by week 2) because I felt that everyone came to the course at different stages in the process and often felt that I was behind. I would also have liked to discuss the different research methods relevant to a political science thesis as well as well as the different possible formats of a thesis because I left the course unsure of what my thesis will look like moving forward.",
    "The course was really well-structured and created a really helpful, constructive environment. The structure of assignments and weekly check-ins helped keep me accountable for my research goals every week.",
    "Strengths: Professor Huber is really helpful with feedback and is flexible in structuring the course. (Potential) con: Despite weekly check-ins, there isn't a huge incentive structure to motivate work. Most people used the first semester to edit their thesis question, create a methodology, write a chapter outline, etc. I think the vast majority of the writing will happen next semester.",
    "There could be more emphasis on writing that was to be directly included within the actual body of the thesis and more peer reviews of that work. Also, possibly different assignments for intensive majors who are a step ahead by virtue of a previous semesters work.",
    "This seminar was greatly helpful for my thesis preparation. I think the structure was good and would recommend adding more time for work on specific sections of the thesis."

    "Yes. If you plan to write a yearlong thesis, take this course. It will most likely be an overwhelming task if you don't as you'll procrastinate and probably end up writing the whole thing in the last 3 weeks of the Spring Semester. This class creates deadlines internally so that doesn't happen and gives you plenty of time to think your thesis through. As Professor Huber said, your thesis is an opportunity to have your entire liberal arts degree culminate in something you can be proud of and something that you can become expert in. That's ultimately far more rewarding than a large, badly written literature review like it can be if you wait too long in the Spring.",
    "Yes! I think it's a very valuable experience to write a year-long senior essay and have a classroom of PLSC majors that are genuinely engaged with assisting your paper. It's definitely collective learning and struggling.",
    "Yeah, especially if theyre doing the year-long thesis.",
    "You have to take this course if you are writing the yearlong senior essay. I would recommend it because the senior essay during the fall semester isn't a class with allotted time on your schedule, so it is good to get into the habit of dedicating time each week to your thesis.",
    "Yes! I absolutely would recommend this course!",
    "If you're writing a yearlong thesis, you probably have to. But it's actually a good course that will help you refine your research ideas!",
    "Definitely. If you are going to do an independent thesis for Political Science, do the full year and take this seminar (it's mandatory anyways)"
