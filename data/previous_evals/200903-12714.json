   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "The heavy reliance on traditional drafting techniques and maylines at the beginning of the semester was a complete waste of time, especially after completing the summer session. Mid-semester, we were encouraged to explore our ideas further, but the organization of the course from that point on completely fell apart. The students would be much better served with a Visualization class that introduces new techniques and ideas to the students rather than traditional and out of date methods of architectural representation.",
    "Yes I think the sequence is fine.",
    "Why didn't we learn how to clarify our drawings for studio in visualization instead of having strange time consuming assignments that detracted from other courses, especially studio. If we devoted as much time to production for studio drawings as we were required to do for visualization assignments that often didn't make sense perhaps we could have learned more and improved the quality of work for studio. Hopefully the digital sequence next semester is a drastic improvement.",
    "It shouldn't occur at all because it was nothing but a giant waste of time.",
    "Yes. It's a very valuable course for the first year.",
    "I think developing representational skills as early as possible is important, so this would be the most appropriate time for this course.",
    "I think so. But emphasis should be on architecture and the value of ideas and exploration - not meaningless graphics and presentation!!That should be reserved for the double valued assignments or the final.And if its about hand-drawing then the students shouldn't be 'rebelling'. This leaves half the class hand-drawing and the other half doing stuff on the computer. Of course each of these is just a tool but there is a big difference in what someone can produce with one in the time given in comparison to the other.",
    "I don't know what the point of this course was. Thus, I don't know where it belongs. If better executed, it could have been valuable. But it needs a lot of work to get there.",
    "This course makes sense as a YSoA requirement, but I don\u0092t think this year\u0092s incarnation achieved its aim of teaching our class how to \u0093visualize\u0094 without the use of computers.",
    "I believe that a visualization course is necessary for first year fall. However, this course has not fulfilled that particular role.",
    "Yes, it occurs in proper sequence.",
    "Rightfully belongs in the first semester, as it explored certain formal and spacial issues as abtract studies, and at face value.",
    "If this course remains the same, it should be a summer session course. Most projects and discussions felt to be of the same quality and exploration as a first year, first semester undergraduate course.",
    "No. It should have occurred over the summer.The class was not relevant to what we were studying in studio at all. Also, it emphasized hard-line hand drawing WAY too much. I think that it would have been much more useful to either focus on sketching or computer drawing. What we did in this class was an exact repeat of my first semester in undergrad architecture. This is a good class for people without architecture backgrounds, but nearly irrelevant to those who had one.",
    "I understand how important visualization is and its roll in an architectural education. I think that I would have benefited more if this had been a course completely about free hand drawing.",
    "This course occurred in proper sequence.",
    "I think it is in the right place.",
    "yes",
    "I felt as though the course material was perfectly suited to its sequence.",
    "Yes, I feel it was in the proper place, but the class needs to clarify (and communicate) its main objectives much better. This class failed to \u0093teach\u0094 me anything. It was merely a set of exercises without any real guidance. A typical assignment was to go draw something and then re-gather to review and highlight a few unique (not necessarily good)drawings. No examples or techniques were taught beforehand on how to better approach the assignments. This was very frustrating and a wasted opportunity to impart knowledge to students.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes",
    "This course should have been more of a requirement for students with non-architecture background. A lot of students who had background in architecture felt this course was a repeat of undergraduate courses. I think the course would be in proper sequence if it had been more exploratory with digital techniques",
    "Yes",
    "Now was the right time, just wish the course was not required.",
    "There should definitely be some \"visualization\" course in the first semester. It is not yet right though (but definitely a move in the right direction from the watercolor class).",
    "Yes.",
    "Technically, yes.",
    "This question points to one of the fundamental flaws of this course. Visualization II was continually ambiguous about what type of course it was. It was neither a skills class nor a rigorous investigation of representational concepts. Furthermore, each assignment was unnecessarily confusing. There was some potential at points but the range of topics and lack of rigor made this class seem more like an undergraduate course.",
    "It should be taught where it is, though perhaps the content should be different.",
    "Yes. There exists no other place in the sequence where this class could move.",
    "I think it occurs at the right point in the curriculum, because I think it is best to learn visualization skills as soon as possible.",
    "Yes. The course sequence is appropriate."

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "The course context flowed in a well-organized progression over the course of the semester. It was not always obvious from week to week what the next step would be, but I think that was beneficial in terms of encouraging exploration of the task at hand and being creative in responding to it.",
    "Overall I was disappointed with this class. I felt it was a missed opportunity because of the organizational approach taken in its structuring. To begin, It was unclear what the goals of the class were. This made weekly assignments seem to be unrelated to any overarching learning experience but rather were isolated activities without a pedagogical context. While the exercises seemed ostensibly to relate to studio work, in reality this relation was superficial--esp. the cut and fill clay exercise. Assignments were disorganized as well. I think the perpetual trouble students had in understanding the assignments came not only from their written description but also from how they fit into any context in the class as a whole. Here it was frustrating not knowing what we were goingto be assigned in advanced. It made it difficult to come to class mentally prepared to engage the material from week to week. As an alternative to the current class structure, perhaps an approach that includes a historical component as a grounding for the exercises where lectures would look at different aspects of visualization throughout history as a context for that week's efforts. Or perhaps a grounding of the class with an emphasis on sketching as a major component to the larger goals, basically just something that gives the class a clear set of goals and structure.",
    "It was all pure production with no teaching happening whatsoever. It was all pointless and did nothing but detract from my time spent on studio.",
    "It's a wonderfully organized syllabus, especially the geometry part. I'm unsure about the final project (3A-3C). The assignment was amazingly unclear, poorly written, and underwhelming in terms of its challenge presented to the students.",
    "I think the body of material and content of the course were somewhat confusing. At times it was very difficult to figure out why we were doing what we were doing.",
    "Sequence - good build up.Syllabus - somewhat of a mystery.Assignments - burdensome as the semester progressed - questioned the relevance though they did become more architecture-related. Some assignments were too long or asked too much of us however the instructors were understanding in that they did grant us some leeway in response to studio finals.",
    "The concepts that we were to learn should have been presented more clearly. The assignments were okay, but they were too poorly described to be graded with a number-based system. A number-based system accompanies a set of expectations and rules that need to be clearly delineated. This never happened, and thus, the concepts behind each assignment were lost upon a bunch of students sitting around trying to guess why we needed to do this or that operation in this or that kind of drawing. This is not a productive way to spend one's time.",
    "There seemed to be some logic to the first three assignments, especially with Kent\u0092s lectures on geometry. But I completely lost track of the course trajectory once we started section 2. There was very little use to try to tie in part 2 to our studio cut\/fill exercise; it didn\u0092t help me with my studio project and it seemed completely unrelated to the previous assignments. Overall, it seemed as if every assignment was tacitly expected to be done on the computer but to look as though it was done by hand.In pinups, it was clear that students who made interesting, beautiful work, usually with computer help and even if it had nothing to do with the assignment, were rewarded with high praise. The students who attempted to closely follow the assignment\u0092s instructions were often overlooked. I was especially frustrated that the grading reflected this disparity as well. There seemed to be very little logic to the grading. The one time that I received a lot of positive feedback in a pinup, my grade was mediocre, but I had no idea how to improve my performance. I also never understood the grading for \u0093completion\u0094 which would seem to indicate that if you finished the assignment and followed the directions, you should get full credit, but this was never the case.",
    "While a visualization course is necessary in the progression of an MArch I program, I am not certain that what was taught this semester was the correct content for such a course. There was hardly any instruction on methods of representation. Therefore, the class became a semester-long use and re-use of our existing visualization skills.Assignments were difficult to decipher. Though they seem open-ended, specific grading requirements would emerge during the in-class crit.Though hand drawing was encouraged, the drawings favored during the class review clearly favored computationally generated geometrical complexity.While there was an attempt at dealing with concepts that related to our studio projects, it would have been better if these assignments asked us to represent our studio projects so that this class doesn't become overlooked in our rigorous coursework.",
    "The aims of the course seemed torn between instructing the conventions of architectural drawing and instructing artistic sensibility. The two often seemed at odds. The assignments were often architectural, but they were evaluated on strictly artistic basis. I think the course should be simply a drawing course; the lessons would inevitably translate into architecture and more like influence the design process and not just presentation techniques.The sequence did not influence what was going on in studio.",
    "Sequence and content attempted to sync with issues that studio dealt with, but this was perhaps not as successful as it could have been (i.e. even greater and more explicit correpondence with studio, if this was in fact the intent). Assignments were fun, interesting, and often liberating exercises in themselves, although I feel that I didn't necessarily acquire any particular skill in the process.",
    "Everything about this course was unclear. After having taken it, I am still not sure what this course was about or what its intended goal was. The semester started with weekly lectures that did not seem to match up with the assignments, nor made much sense to us as an overall class; however, the lectures stopped halfway through the semester and then class time seemed to be largely filled with \"busywork\" or in-class reviews. Neither of these helped explain the purpose of the course.Most assignments were time-consuming beyond what they were worth. If, as a class, we all learn something from a heavy assignment, then none of us minds putting in the time to complete it. Unfortunately, this course repetitively asked for models, drawings, sketches that seemed pointless and\/or unexplained, which resulted in complete frustration in our studio. Instead of being an exploration in visualization, this frustration rendered each assignment as a waste of time and something that got in the way of completing other coursework.",
    "It just needs to be changed drastically. The assignments were unclear, irrelevant and outdated. It would help greatly to explore visualization techniques that are actually used today or try to explore new ways of representing an idea rather than techniques that are not used in the field today.",
    "I do not think that either professor knew what they wanted for us to get out of this class. This was a course that severely lacked direction.",
    "We started by looking at simple, flat surfaces and eventually moved to complex three-dimensional forms. Drawing was done by hand at first, and later we were encouraged to use the computer to model and draw our work. I felt the sequence moved at a reasonable pace as an introduction to visual communication.",
    "There seemed to be a discrepancy in the true intent of the course. Actual techniques of visualization were very rarely discussed, and it became more about the ideas behind the assignments themselves, such as geometry, topography, space, etc. There was very little emphasis on drawing technique, and the role of the computer in the assignments was never clearly specified. The assignment descriptions were extremely vague, resulting in confusion and misreading of intention. Similarly, the grading of the assignments was inconsistent and there did not appear to be a consistent grading standard across all assignments. Many of the assignments themselves were great exercises, but it was not always clear how they fit into larger course goals. The first three assignments were the most helpful, especially because they were the only ones that united the in-class sketching exercises with the out-of-class work in a very direct way. In general, the sketching assignments which allowed us to explore and sketch on campus were excellent, and should have been continued throughout the semester. It would also have been helpful if specific sketching techniques were discussed in class to help us develop our skills further.",
    "I enjoyed the last assignments and the drawings I produced. Some of the early assignments were simply unnecessary.",
    "2nd half of course and assignments - in particular the last assignment sequence 1C-3C - in my opinion did not progressively present new or more advanced visualization ideas\/techniques for a graduate teaching level that built on what was presented up to that point. These particular assignments were a bit tedious and lax in inventiveness as they essentially repeated elementary spatial exercises that did not present any of the challenges that one would expect of a graduate level course.",
    "I really loved this course. I found the material engaging and felt as though the assignments allowed a lot of room for experimentation. In addition, the structure of the assignments encouraged both hand drawing and work within the computer, which was extremely valuable to me. I don't have an architecture background and this course gave me an opportunity to familiarize myself with Rhino, AutoCad, and the Adobe Suite without abandoning hand drawing (which I love). I also thought that the structure of the course was very intelligent. I liked that the assignments were grouped together with a review at the completion of each third assignment. Using previous assignments as launching points for subsequent work gave the course a sense of cohesive, productive exploration.",
    "The written assignments were too convoluted which resulted in a lot of second guessing about their intended goals. Also, I feel there was a lot of repetition of, seemingly random, drawing operations (e.g. interesting with a random polygonal form, translate between sectional cuts, etc.).",
    "All of the assignments were very interesting and engaging. However, as it was discussed at the end of the class, it would have been better to have some of the more involved exercises (such as the several last ones) earlier in the semester. So the sequence could be from 2D patterns and geometries, to simpler 3D volumes and massing, to complex 3D geometries (IPMS) and computer modeling and representation.",
    "The material covered in lectures, although interesting, was usually tangential to the rest of the material of the course. There could be an entirely new dimension to the class if there was a focus on looking at the tradition of architectural drawing and representation so we could better situate ourselves in that tradition.The assignments varied greatly in their effectiveness. But mainly the problem was how they were presented and how they were reviewed. Especially in a class with the possibility for so much personal expression, it is important that expectations are clearly laid out.It would be beneficial if the drawing assignments were focused on more substantiated material. Either the focus should be that everyone has to develop their own way of representing a common thing or everyone has the freedom to produce drawings more of their own invention. Instead the content of the assignments often focused on a very abstract set of operations. I often had difficulty justifying what were inevitable arbitrary decisions, and in the end just left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",
    "The last three assignments we did should have been placed at the beginning of the course because they were helpful with understanding the basic fundamentals of space.",
    "The assignments were frequently vague and prompted questions for clarification. Perhaps it was the intention to leave the assignments open for interpretation, but it seemed to result in so much confusion that by the end of the semester it was difficult to have the desire to produce what we thought was being asked, because it was almost impossible to know.",
    "The material of this course is based more on artistry than on architectural ideas. Granted, representation it fundemental to architecture; yet architecture as a practice is a focus on creation and you do not build a painting. The later part of the course was usefully in its study of formal tectonics and kinematics, but it was at a point of the semester were these studies could have been. coupled with earlier studies in studio at the beginning of the semester.",
    "The third assignment sequence (3a-3c) was the best - it most fully demanded \"visualization\" and had tangible architectural content (abstract problem solving). Of the in-class exercises, the outdoor sketching and the axonometric objects exercises were the best.Most of the lecture content seemed unrelated to our education other than offering a prompt for the exercises (though I can see how some might have been interested in the pattern-related material).",
    "The sequence of projects should be adjusted slightly. The final project which involved the construction of different spatial conditions within a rectilinear prism should have been the first assignment. Each assignment should have encouraged students to move more fluidly between analogue and digital means of production.Sketching assignments should have been taken more seriously. Perhaps sketchbooks could have been reviewed every two to three weeks through a small group \"table\" discussion. While students are in the field sketching, a small group would have an open sketchbook review where Sunil and Kent (and TA's) discuss successful and unsuccessful sketching techniques\/strategies.",
    "The sequence was often repetitious and disjointed. The assignments were confusing and poorly prepared. Furthermore, the grading system was undefined and provided no feedback to help the overall work.",
    "The hand-drafting component of the course is not necessary. Most people end up tracing their drawings anyway, and even the people who do hand-draft don't really learn much from it.Perhaps some of the assignments should integrate better with studio - instead of creating drawings of abstract geometric objects we could push our skill in representing architectural spaces we are actively designing in studio.Even when we finally moved to printed computer output, the drawings were still heavily grounded in a hand-drafting aesthetic. The computer frees us from that aesthetic, and pushing beyond itfor computer-specific output would have been interesting.",
    "The third could be moved to the first or second. The IPMS assignment and construction may benefit more being the last project. The work tried to mimic the work in studio, but it wasn\u0092t too successful. Good amount of assignments.",
    "I think that the course content was not as good as it could have been. First of all, I think that the course material could have been better coordinated with our studio work. I think that this would have produced better work as we would have been more invested in the weekly assignments. Second, I feel that too much emphasis was placed on hand-drafting. While hand drafting is valuable, I don\u0092t think that it should be the centerpiece of a visualization course in a progressive architecture school. I think that other visualization tools and methods such as computer-aided visualization tools and techniques should have been investigated more in-depth throughout the semester.",
    "Please refer to answer 8.",
    "The course material seemed disjointed and lacked cohesion to an overall whole. Themes under exploration that were supposedly linked to themes in studio were loosely applicable at best. Assignments lacked clarity and frequently seemed disconnected from the course 'themes.' Rather, they were often poorly explicated, smacked of 'busy work' and, due to the courses position in the schedule, detrimental to the quality of work in other classes. In-class reviews of work were extremely unproductive, with an effort made to comment on EVERY work rather than focus on a few with reference to successes and failures in the assignment. This, along with a seemingly arbitrary system of in-class grading,made it difficult to understand what was sought from each assignment and contributed to an increasing sense of apathy as the semester progressed. Further, constant insistence on the same use of materials was counterproductive in the context of individual assignments, discouraging of exploration, and in general, frustrating."

   "comments": [
    "I had no expectations to speak of initially. I was pleasantly surprised at the variety and quality of assignments and how much I enjoyed myself over the course of the semester.",
    "I expected to learn about visualization in a coherent manner and this was not met.",
    "This was the course I looked forward to most and ended up being, by far, the most disappointing. I expected to learn how to draw and sketch better. To learn how to take what I see in reality and in my mind and put it down on paper in a readable compelling way. I learn nothing and still struggle with conveying my ideas on paper.",
    "I expected more freehand sketching and practice to help us see better, think better, and ultimately illustrate our ideas more effectively. But the course was so narrowed down to the ABC presentational techniques,which is somewhat unsatisfactory.",
    "My expectations for this course were based on my experience this summer with Visualization. Despite its faults, it was definitely better than the summer course.",
    "Expectations weren't clear from the get-go but I did learn quite a bit over the course of the semester. I would say if I did have any expectations that they were met.",
    "I wanted to learn to draw (by hand) and present my ideas better. Though I got a lot of practice, I'm not sure if I have actually learned anything. I expected more student-teacher interaction and guidance. In a drawing course it is a crucial part of learning. Otherwise, the teacher cannot track individual students as they progress and struggle with particular problems, and the students get few, if any individual critiques.",
    "I assumed that we might be taught to draw or draft according to certain methods, and I assumed that we might have lots of opportunity to sketch, but we were not explicitly taught any new drawing skills (except, perhaps how to make a computer drawing look like a hand drawing) and there were very few opportunities to sketch. My favorite parts of the class were when we had the chance to draw on campus, and I wish we had done that every week.",
    "I was very disappointed in this course, for the reasons above.",
    "I expected to sketch more often and develop my ability to get down information quickly and convincingly. We barely sketched, but there was constant emphasis on our ability to convey information through very premeditated and planned out drawings instead.",
    "Sunil and Kent are both great professors. Their combined knowledge is amazing and it is great to be able to hear both of their perspectives. However, for the majority of this semester, it seemed that Kent and Sunil were on different pages. Even when explaining the assignments out loud to the class, they couldn't seem to agree what the point of the assignment was. Needless to say, this not only confused the students in the class, but also instilled in us a complete lack of motivation. If our professors can't even agree on what we are to explore in this assignment and learn from it, then how are we supposed to know what the goal of it is?I am still confused as to what the expectations and goals for this course actually were and I am pretty sure that none of them were met.",
    "I expected it to teach me new ways of representing ideas, but I'm not sure I learned much of anything.",
    "I expected to develop my skills in carefully communicating three-dimensional forms. The course helped me to some degree.",
    "I expected this course to focus on techniques of conveying information through drawings, and in this sense, the course did not meet my expectations. Especially towards the end, the class seemed to focus too much on the design aspects of the assignments. While many of the assignments were helpful in themselves, the class discussions were not as on point. Furthermore, the vagueness of many of the assignment write-ups seemed more often to obscure intent rather thanprovide room for interpretation. Often, it was clear in the reviews that there were definite intentions for what was expected, intentions that were not clearly communicated at the time the assignment was given.",
    "The emphasis on hand-drawing is suffocating. The summer session covers that and all of us know how to draw. I enjoyed the assignments which allowed free media, but hand-drafting is something I did in high school and is no longer relevant. Drawing, sure, has value, but I wish the class had focused on advanced digital skills and sketching every day.",
    "I expected the course to engage students in a more balanced way between hand drawing and computer visualization. Approximately the first half of the course required drawings to be hand-drafted. There was a lack of discussion throughout the course on what qualitative aspects of drawing could be gained from drawing manually by hand. I believe the thought process required to construct and visualize drawings as compared to computer modeling and snapping views is essential to the education of an architect. I believe that several of my peers will most likely complain in their review of this course in regards to the hand drawn requirements, and I would completely agree with them, but only in regards to how it was utilized and presented in this course. I believe the emphasis on drawing by hand was perceived by most as only a technical requirement, and thereby it's potential as a pedagogical tool was not fully realized. There were a few assignments where this could have been explored further including the handed object exercise where students were required to transform the handedness of the object by means of a series of orthographic projections by hand. The discussions were somewhat tedious as most students computer modeled the object and traced several of the views. The in-class discussions as a result focused more on patterns andorganization on page and less on the transformation process itself.",
    "I had hoped to familiarize myself with software and to become more comfortable with graphic standards for architecture. This course absolutely fulfilled the first goal and addressed the second at certain points (even though it clearly was not the aim of the curriculum).",
    "I really had no expectations for this class because I have heard from older students that it completely changes from year to year. Still, I was very disappointed and frustrated with the class as a whole. Its many faults made it a constant burden. I felt like I was wasting all of my time and energy (two things in short supply during the first semester) on pointless assignments that really did not make me any better of an architect.",
    "Honestly, I did not really know what to expect from this course at the beginning. Although I was surprised by the amount of time most of the exercises required and the complexity of some of them. But overall, I enjoyed the course very much.",
    "The in class assignments were often disappointing, especially with the added pressure of having to pin up work in fromt of the whole class after only a short time working.The lectures started off as a promising addition to the class but quickly fizzled off as confusing and not really relevant to the course.The drawing reviews, tended to be unfocused and not reflecting a clear vision of what the work was intended to achieve.However, I was often pleasantly surprised by the work I was able to produce for assignments that were manageable. And I have started to understand the importance of spending more time and effort on different types of representation and I have developed new skills.",
    "I expected that this course would help me hone my freehand drawing skills, but I was constantly hoping for some kind of drawing demonstration from the instructors. The assignments were often vague and the basis for the numerical scoring was not very clear, so any kind of example, or particularly a demonstration, would have been valuable.",
    "If hand-drafting is part of the syllabus, it should be taught with appropriate diligence. Tracing by hand of a printed drawing is a waste time and does not provide the \"visualization\" value that true hand-drafting of plan, section, axon, perspective, etc. can. It was not properly taught during the summer course either.However, the course must not be a manual\/analog only course. It is crucial that we are always being pushed to utilize and learn multiple techniques, computer software included, since they ALL provide different, valuable, \"visualization\" methods.",
    "I was expecting visualization to be more beneficial as a supplemental course to studio. In visualization I would expect to learn how to represent my studio projects better through rendering and drawing techniques - most of which would be explored through the teaching of current software programs\/plug-ins. This course was interesting as an independent course; however, it is to my understanding that the course should operate in conjunction with studio.",
    "I was hoping for a course to help develop my representational skill and techniques but this class was just a rehash of my first year of undergraduate.",
    "I was hoping to improve my architectural representation skills. Although I believe I have done decently in the course, I don't believe I have pushed my skills in a useful direction.",
    "I didn\u0092t know what to expect coming in. I would perhaps have thought since there is handdrawing, there would be some more exploration into uses of it. Perhaps some projected drawings.",
    "Coming into the semester, I was expecting to learn more about computer-aided visualization tools and techniques. Unfortunately, this was not the case. While I appreciate hand-drafting, I think it should have been a component in the curriculum, not the emphasis of the curriculum."

   "comments": [
    "This course was valuable as a means of exploring repesentation on the page and learning to value and evaluate drawing in and of itself. The assignments lead me to develop new skills and think more critically about my work and my drawing.",
    "I feel that too much time was wasted by this class.",
    "This course, along with the summer session, should be completely wiped from the Yale course of requirements. I gained almost no value in the drawings or models that I produced, as I found most of the assignments to be disorganized and lacking any clear vision as to what was expected of the end product. Instead, there should be an extra day of studio with a heavy focus on exploring broader methods of architectural representation, particularly digital techniques.",
    "Very little value...at first it was enjoyable...second half was a complete waste of time. It seemed like we went backwards in our exploration of visualization techniques and perhaps if this class was focused on improving our drawings for studio we could have gotten more out of each without feeling completely exhausted..I often felt i was compromising studio production to meet the bizzare requirements for visualization.",
    "No value. Worse than no value because it also detracted from the other classes.",
    "I was hoping that this course would really help push my representation skills, but I am not sure how much it did that.",
    "Not as valuable as it could have been for two reasons.Shift from hand to computer drawing.Lack of 'architectural' material.Many of the assignments were...object-like and many of the class results were accidental and lacked control. Students were as it were tricking themselves into believing that they had created something wonderful - but when asked to present - it became clear that they lacked understanding and therefore control of\/over core concepts\/tools\/methods. The emphasis changed from making something that works and was designed to randomization and computerized work devoid of true ideas and workings.Again - valuable in terms of production and presentation - not in terms of knowledge conveyed or critique of ideas.",
    "I have no clue what this course was about. I am unclear as to what Sunil and Kent intended us to learn, and am no less confused as to what we did discover and practice. Much of this frustration stems from their inability to address the analog v. digital approaches to visualizing, designing, and presenting. Many of the assignments were process-based and -driven, but the process was never honestly discussed.",
    "I felt I did not learn anything particularly valuable from this class, except that I now know what an IPMS is, and a few esoteric geometric concepts.",
    "With better assignments, this course could have allowed us to generate better representation for our studio and other design work. However, having had no actual instruction throughout the course, I felt that I have come out of this course with fewer hours of sleep and studiowork time, but really no other benefits.",
    "Many of the assignments provided conceptual challenges that I would not find in any other course. This was immensely valuable. The critiques were less valuable than the process of executing the drawings.",
    "While the course explored an array of interesting formal and spacial topics, I wonder whether I would have benefited from a clearer and more focused agenda. While the drawing critiques had great insight, the lack of a coherent set of critera for evaluation often made it difficult to decide how to conceptualize and execute a project.",
    "A course in visualization seems like a wonderful way to start an architectural course of study. I know a lot of us had little computer skills and all of us would like to improve our sketching. However, this course was about neither of these. The course was caught some where between asking us to do hand-drawings but then praising those that broke the rules and used the computer.It would have been wonderful to truly use the sketchbooks we were told to purchase and be taught how to sketch in a way that would have helped our studio projects. Or it would have been useful to have a class that showed us how to combine computer visualization with hand-drawing. A few times the course seemed to want to do these things, but just before it actually did, it took another turn into some assignment that, once again, made no sense.If this course is changed I think it has potential to be valuable. However, if it is kept the same it truly is a frustrating class that takes up a lot of time and seems to just get in the way of other courses that truly teach other aspects of architecture.",
    "Not nearly as valuable as it could\/should have been. This class has so much potential and it fulfilled maybe 5% of it.",
    "There needs to be a drawing course, i don't know if thisone fulfilled that requirement. It ended up being a lot of busy work and wasted energy. I am not sure what i learned from this class, but i am grateful it was not water-coloring.",
    "Sometimes this course felt very repetitive, since I have an architecture degree, work experience, and already completed a couple of visualization courses. The most interesting part for me was learning about new things - complex repeating patterns, symmetries, and three-dimensional forms like the IPMS.",
    "I do not feel I learned very much from this course, as the intentions of the assignments were often unclear and the class discussions meandering and inconsistent. Several of the in-class assignments were also unhelpful; only the sketching exercises had value for me. It was not so much the content that was a problem as the way in which it was presented. If it had been presented better, I feel I could have gotten a lot more value from this course.",
    "As before, I felt I advanced my skills and creativity with the last few assignments, producing what I feel were very evocative digital representations. I would have liked to sketch every day as a means of developing that skill.",
    "Evaluating this course in particular there is not enough value to support the need for students with an architecture background to go through this course.",
    "This class, for the reasons stated, had very little value to me. I always put it last on my list of academic priorities. Sometimes I spent no time on an assignment and received a great grade, and other times I really did try to produce a good drawing and received a horrible grade. There was no correlation apparent between effort and grading.",
    "I found this course valuable, not just because it allowed me to explore some of the representational techniques I was not very familiar with, but also because it exposed me to some things I have not even heard of - IPMS.",
    "For the most part, I enjoyed the class. I enjoyed the challenge of having to produce different types of drawings and having to develop different techniques, and in the long run, I will have benefited from the experience.",
    "Low value. I am able to develop a representational style though my studio work, so it hurts me more to work on projects that are not progressing an architectural skill. Improving representation through the practice of architecture seems more productive.",
    "I think the idea of the course is extremely valuable. However, it was hard to see the value in some of the material presented and assigned. The course should stand on its own - the overlap with studio only served to dilute the interest of the assignments and make them feel like unnecessary side-projects.It was often hard to see the value of an assignment beyond its completion.",
    "This course would have been more valuable if it were instruction-based. Visualization should be where students learn how to see an object or visualize space and represent it graphically or physically through model. This should be the goal; however, there was very little instruction in this course. The TA's very seldom were available and perhaps were not on the same page as the instructors as far as expectations and graphic standards.",
    "Low - the geometry lessons taught by Bloomer were very interesting, but I don't feel I have gained much in terms of useful architectural representational skills.",
    "This could and should be a valuable course. I know the class is still being worked on, but as it is now, there lacks an essential quality to it that comes to light in other classes.",
    "For a course with a lot of potential, I did not feel that it was as helpful as it could have been."

   "comments": [
    "I think my answers above sum it up. My one complaint might be that it was not always perfectly organized, however, I feel that this is possibly due to the instructors were adjusting to the class on a weekly basis.",
    "The instructors are excellent at in person engagement with the material and students , including the TA's. However the organization of the class was very poor.",
    "There was no teaching. We drew something and then talked about the drawings of the people who knew what they were doing. All you did was confirm to those who could draw well that they could draw well and left the rest of us in the dark learning nothing.",
    "The scoring system is helpful but somewhat discouraging if the students keep on getting the same score throughout the semester. A line of comment is far more valuable and helpful than a 7 or 9.",
    "I thought that Sunil and Kent were good instructors on a class to class basis, but I thought it was the over-arching goal of the course that was lacking. I also didn\u0092t get much out of the TA\u0092s for this course.",
    "Instructors were capable and taught or discussed the material well. TAs were very helpful in deciphering some of the more complicated assignments.",
    "Kent is full of amazing ideasand facts. However, his lectures had little to do with the rest of the course.Sunil gave very little feedback to the class' work, and what feedback he offered was not very valuable or well-considered.Juenan did not have a very good understanding of what Kent and Sunil wanted, so her input was rarely very helpful. We turned to her for explanations that often misled us and thus made our scores suffer.",
    "I enjoyed Kent\u0092s input in the course, but so often he was absorbed in geometry and distracted by beautiful compositions that were unrelated to the course assignments. I felt that Sunil was too worried about being nice in pinupsand that he should have been more honest in commenting on student work if we were not completing the assignments satisfactorily.",
    "I feel that the geometry lectures were repeated too many times, though they were probably the closest thing to any sort of instruction that we had over the semester.The TAs were also uncertain of the purpose of these assignments, and therefore were not as helpful as they could have been.",
    "Again, the critiques were ineffective. They were long and redundant, since every drawing was discussed at length. Often people left mid-way because they couldn't get close enough to hear what was going on. It's a shame that the students were not involved in discussion and critique. The TA's also did not contribute, and barely participated outside of class either.",
    "It was simply unorganized and boring in class.",
    "This was definitely a self-directed course. For the most part, we were on our own and the only real feedback we received was during the drawing reviews. Each assignment was different, so it was difficult to gauge our performance on the drawings until after we had been evaluated.",
    "Both Kent and Sunil were excellent instructors, but sometimes it felt their interests and teaching styles were incompatible. They both provided good criticism and interesting comments, but the lack of clarity in the assignments seemed detract from the overall dialogue. It might have been better there was a single instructor who could provide a more consistent vision.In general, the TA\u0092s were helpful, but they were hampered by the vagueness of the assignments. Often different TA\u0092s would have different interpretations of what was expected, which led to further confusion. If the assignments were more clearly written, the TA\u0092s could have been much more effective.",
    "The TA's, and my TA, Kevin, were helpful.",
    "TA(s) could have engaged in the class more. They were fairly quite and did not contribute to the class discussions.",
    "Both Kent and Sunil did a great job with this course. My one complaint was that their assignments were INCREDIBLY obfuscatory. This was extremely frustrating at first but I soon realized that it presented us with a unique opportunity for individual exploration within an established framework. The one issue that followed with this was that grading of the projects often seemed to be based on how well the piece met requirements and this seems a bit unfair considering how vague the assignments were.",
    "Both the instructors and TAs tried very hard to be helpful. The assignments, however, were a little too text heavy, not always substantive, and sometimes deliberately obfuscatory. I also felt at time that both instructors and TAs tacitly recognized the pointlessness of this class. Why teach something you feel isnot worthwhile?",
    "The assignments were very open-ended and so we had a lot of freedom with how one could approach and \"solve\" each problem. The instructors and especially the TAs were very helpful, but because of the nature of the exercises, talking to them brought just as much confusion as clarity to an assignment.",
    "It would have been very helpful if the TAs spent a little more time helping us develop the technical skills, either in drawing or on the computer, that we needed to develop these drawings. Also, the TA's could discuss examples of other work that would guide us in how to develop our own drawings.",
    "The instructor's were very useful and always encouraging more exploration and pushing the assignments further.",
    "This course requires more attention from the TAs to the students. With the wording of the assignments being so vague, someone needs to offer more instruction about what is being asked of the students. There should be a regular weekly meeting of the TAs with their respective section to address questions.",
    "The TA's were truely useless.",
    "The ta's were rarely present during in-class work, and almost never contributed to discussions\/reviews.",
    "The TA's did not engage enough with the students and were rarely available during their designated times. The TA's should be working through specific technical issues with students; especially if a student receives a \"low-pass\" for a specific drawing.",
    "The TAs did a great job throughout the semester providing feedback and interpreting the assignments. I really enjoyed Kent and Sunil as instructors. The class just needs to be completely overhauled with more clarity.",
    "The teachers have been very good, though at times a tad disorganized.I feel the fault with the course lies in its direction and content, not withe the instructors.",
    "Sunil and Kent were good and complementary professors. At the same time, however, their contradictions proved problematic when doing an assignment as the different perspectives could skew grading. For instance, those appealing to Kent\u0092s visual sensibilities but got reviewed by Sunil did not get rewarded with the criticism bias they preferred. I imagine it would work in the opposite fashion as well.",
    "I felt that the teaching methodology was not a good as it could have been. We were graded on our drawings, but unfortunately, were never really given input in terms of how we could improve them.",
    "Please refer to answer 8."

    "There was too much debate on the use of digital representation over drawing etc.Class time is the only time when the teachers can control the use of particular media. Obviously drawing is a very valuable exercise, so class time is the time to draw. Outside class time, all students can and WILL use digital methods to achieve time savings.Asking that they not do so is naive and counterproductive.Understand that while we are in class we will draw and when outide we will trace printed pages to achieve the effect of a drawn page.Is this the kind of practice that Yale actually wants to generate?Think of more creative ways to HARNESS the shift from drawing to computer, rather than denying it.",
    "none.",
    "A clear syllabus with a specific set of learning goals and the ways in which those goals will be achieved.",
    "use visualization to improve studio drawings",
    "Perhaps a combination of hand and computer drawings (on the same page, layered on top of one another, scanned back in and layered again) would be more productive then either the traced pencil drawings (at the beginning) or the truly ugly renderings at the end.",
    "Just eliminate the class already. It never works and all it does is take time away from studio.",
    "More freehand sketching time! More diverse media!",
    "For students with limited drawing experience this course can bevery frustrating. There is no actual instruction in any drawingtechnique so students are left to flail around on their own. Ifcourses such as this are intended to improve students' actual skillset, there should be far more instruction and far less crittime.",
    "A more clearly defined focus and goal.",
    "In my opinion, ideas were undervalued and the class-work became generic stifling creativity. This wasn't the fault of the instructors but rather the students. That said though, the instructors should have responded to this - preventing the students from defeating the purpose of the class and becoming too concerned with creating 'more of the same' just to prove to themselves that they could to promote a misguided sense of self-confidence of being able to do what others can do without necessarily knowing what oneself was capable of due to fear of failure.",
    "I sense that Sunil and Kent were meant to work together as a digital and analog union, but this schism is so absurdly stigmatized, and this class never addressed it. I would like to instead spend this class time learning how my methods, processes, and choice of hand or computer techniques change my presentation and design. Assignments that more thoroughly and specifically offer the intent of the exercise, the process, and the tools would be more instructive.Alternatively, abandoning the number-grading system, breaking the class up, and treating the course as a drawing course would be invaluable and much-appreciated.",
    "The course needs to more clearly articulate its expectations of the students, and the standards for grading need to be more objective and obvious.",
    "More instruction on technique, whether it be hand-sketching, drawing, or watercolor, such that this class does not become a simple drafting exercise.More sketching outdoors, and more sketching of ideas. I imagine it would be very valuable to have a class that helped us generate our diagrams for studio, or helped us generate good drawings for our projects. More relevance to other coursework would also be helpful so that this class doesn't become peripheral in our schedule.",
    "Less and more focused critiques.More TA involvement in critiques and outside of class helping with assignments.More emphasis on sketching and ability to convey information quickly, informally by hand.",
    "While perhaps difficult to achieve in the context of this course, a clearer set of critera for assessing student work might be beneficial.",
    "This course needs to decide what its goal is. It needs to take a stance on hand-drawing vs. computer rendering and then hold strong to that. When asking for hand-drawing, anyone that prints out computer drawings or traces a computer drawing should be penalized. When asking us to buy a sketchbook, we should be asked to use that sketchbook and have those sketches actually acknowledged. Same with models-- we all put a lot of time into required models that many times weren't even reviewed nor was it known who made them.The grading for the course also needs to change. When asking us to do the assignments we were required, each drawing should not be given a \"completion\" grade. These drawings were abstract, mostly with pencil, and each took a lot of time. Being judged harshly on \"completion\" after spending 8-10 hours on a drawing gives a student absolutely no motivation to spend that much time on the next assignment, especially when other students ignore the assignment, do it in the computer in 2 hours, and get praised for the work the computer essentiallydid.Assignments need to be more clear. Explanation of assignments needs to be more clear. The length of time each assignment will take needs to be recognized by the professors and modified accordingly. Lectures of this course need to have relevance, or at least that relevance be more clear. The \"grading\" needs to be more consistent and if it is truly going to be the determining factor between pass and low-pass, then it needs to be explained and stand firm. This semester grades were re-evaluated and lowered at the professors' wills; this angered people beyond belief and just added to the ridiculous charade they had set up as a grading system.Both Sunil and Kent are great professors. You can tell they each care a lot about their students and want their students to learn. It just never came together for them in this course. Everything was confused and vague and even though they both made themselves very available to us, we dreaded the assignments and often looked to ourselves to define them in any sort of way. The idea of a 3 phase visualization class is fine, but Visualization II should be much more clear, a much better help to those just getting into architecture, and should be something that teaches each of us skills we can put to work in our studio representation.",
    "Emphasize sketching as opposed to hard line drawing.Emphasize the computer.This could be a great opportunity to go over different computer programs and how each one\/combinations of them can create interesting ways of representing ideas.Incorporate this class into the summer session\/change it drastically.",
    "More direct instruction from the professors, at our desks during class time, would be helpful.",
    "I found it strange that a course intending to instruct in drawing, would not actually teach drawing during the studio hours. Instruction while drafting whether by hand or digitally is invaluable. First years would benefit from either a course on representation through digital means or a course that focused on teaching observational based hand drawing.Also, I found the grading system very frustratingly subjective. If there could be a more regularized system of grading based on the work, effort, and time put into projects, and less on the general opinions of the instructors it would be more beneficial.",
    "The course could be improved if it was given a more consistent structure, and if the course aims were clarified and consistently reinforced. The assignments should be much more clearly written, and it should be clear what the intent ofeach assignment is. More in class sketching would be very helpful, and it would also be helpful if more emphasis was placed on visualization strategies and techniques. In terms of structure, the second set of three assignments, dealing with topography\/surfaces\/IPMS seemed much weaker than the first and third sets.",
    "See earlier comments.",
    "I believe more emphasis in exercises and assignments should be placed on utility of \"visualization techniques\" and less on individual student design direction (which is what studio courses are tasked with). It seems if more assignments focused on student representation\/analysis of existing spaces\/objects utilizing specific visualization techniques(Ex. Beinecke, handed object exercise) and less on designing content\/ material for visualization techniques (ex. intersect construction of 1 assignment w\/ 6-sided figure) it would allow students the opportunity to focus more on these techniques as opposed placing more effort in creating design projects. I believe this is ultimately why the last assignment sequence was not as successful or at least as \"interesting\" to myself and most of my peers. It presented little new knowledge in regards to visualization and thereby placed more focus on designing the drawings.",
    "Clarify the assignments enough to justify the grading rubric.",
    "Please try to work on consistency of grades. It seemed like the emphasis. The point system was too complex and not transparent at all to students. In a school where the majority of assignments are pass\/fail, I feel the assignments in the class should be the same way. Also as previously stated, the class needs to clarify and communicate its main objectives much better.",
    "Please see my response to question 4.",
    "The course would be much improved by a much more serious consideration between the modes of representation used in the class. Obviously the question of hand drafting versus computer generated drawings is a huge issue. I personally, have always enjoyed hand drafting and think it is important to develop some understanding of the technique in a first semester drawing course, as one more tool that we have available to us. However, the problems in the class regarding this issue were twofold. First, the assignments we were given that we were required to draw by hand were completely unreasonable. The first couple of assignments, from the handed objects to the IPMS, were based on extremely complex geometries that were nearly impossible to construct by hand. Secondly, the discussion of hand drafted drawings need to be geared towards the types of information one can and cannot convey through manual drawing. It was frustrating when drawings produced by hand and by computer were pinned up next two each other and were talked about in the same way.the whole class would have been improved if the conversations were geared towards how each type of representation produces certain effects so we as beginning architecture students could have a greater understanding of the power and the deficits of the tools we used.",
    "This course should also teach digital design and representation because we ended up doing most of the projects in the computer but many students didn't even know how to use the software correctly.",
    "Additional clarity of assignmentsIn-class demonstrations by instructorsIncreased time with TAs",
    "I think each three-part assignment sequence should entail true, strictly enforced (if properly taught) hand-drafting, sketching and computer software use (modeling\/rendering in Rhino\/Maya... and drafting in CAD), though maybe in a different order each time. In class work should be devoted to presentation of visualized material - actual projects and their documentation\/presentation, and teaser exercises such as theaxonometric objects, as well as minimal technical instruction (this could easily be repetitive for most of the class though).",
    "The grading system for the course should be reevaluated. Students should have a better understanding for what they need to do in order to improve their drawings throughout the semester. Students should have a midterm evaluation meeting with an instructor and their drawings to talk about specific strengths and weaknesses within the work of the individual.",
    "While this course could have been an invaluable laboratory for experimentation in drawing, a preoccupation first with geometry and then with inconsequential exercises mired the curriculum. Both Mr. Bald and Mr. Bloomer are no doubt talented professionals, but other than their bemused metaphors, I felt that I was not garnering the education I would have liked from the course.Several things are necessary to make this course more important and enriching for future students. First, all of the exercises need to have a purpose that extends beyond the brief 'as such.' Whether that means making them relate to a studio exploration, or offering another meaningful framework, the assignments should be challenging and relate directly to a larger idea.Second, the class needs PRECEDENTS and EXAMPLES for the kinds of drawing that should be produced. These should not be former students drawings, necessarily, but works produced by professionals and leaders in the field. The crit discussions were inadequate and unhelpful to most students looking to improve or develop their visualization skills.Third, there should be a feedback loop built into the class, so that some (or all) drawings are critiqued and reworked, rather than the critique being the final step of the drawing.Finally, there should not be an explicit 'hand drawing' component. It is somewhat unfortunate that in contemporary practice, the only viable option for producing representation is through [typically]undercooked digital drawings. However, the remedy for this is NOT to mandate a retrograde drafting component, but rather to structure into the class a component which encourages exploring some kind of alternative or hybridized representation. This could open new discussions about the effectiveness of different techniques, and the meaning of the medium itself.I truly believe that this course has the potential to be one of the most enjoyable and important in the Yale Architecture sequence, so I strongly encourage reevaluating the curriculum and pedagogy currently employed.",
    "This course needs to be about the representation of architecture. The lectures should focus on the topic of representation and how to best convey the concept and intent of a design in 2D. Furthermore, the debate between the hand and the computer is a tired one. Either one can achieve what the intent of this course should be. The link with studio was a weak one that held the course back. Either the class should be developed independently or the studio projects should be the subject of the representation.",
    "Shifting the course to integrate with studio better would have been very interesting. I would have loved to have been able to push my representation of the studio projects through the help of a visualization course, where focus was on representation, not design.",
    "For one, the grading system changed halfway through the class, where the overall expectations were shifted to a higher scale. Some of the class found this to evidence the difficulty of a grading system on a drawing class. There was a sense of arbitrariness to the marks.It's hard to say how this class should be judged alone as it falls under a set of visualization classes that I haven't taken yet. I do think the grading system, instead of a pass-fail system, inhibits creativity. Often I was more stressed about doing things 'right' than trying out new techniques or ideas.We started off by having drawing sessions during class but it stopped as we went. I think these are valuable and should be reconsidered.The ambiguity of the assignments didn't bother me as much as how they were graded. As in, the ambiguity could lead to exploration but its handicapped the threat of grades. A studio model could work well.",
    "I think that the course would be greatly improved if a wider variety of visualization tools and techniques were investigated over the course of the semester. I also think that the course would be better if it was better integrated with the studio curriculum. Lastly, I feel that the course would be better if we received individualized input about how to improve our work.",
    "I appreciate that clear goals were set at the beginning and constantly revisited throughout the semester. However, the written explanations of the assignments were often confusing rather than intentionally vague. I believe that profound reasons exist behind each exercise; however, these were not effectively taught to the students.I think one way this situation might be remedied is to include lectures on how other artists and architects visualize. It would be beneficial to show us some examples of successful graphic representation in relationship to their themes. I appreciate the knowledge we have gained through the series ofgeometry lectures, although we need more lectures that relate directly to ways of representation. I find that the one lecture we had on \u0093topographic sections\u0094 more useful and inspiring. We should have more lectures like this one.",
    "An immediate need in this course is clarity in the grading of assignments. It was quite typical for works to garner higher marks despite generally failing to address the elements of the assignment - I feel this was often due to the constricted nature of the assignment and calls for a looser reign overall. I would also suggest a re-ordering of the course themes, in particular a switch of the themes addressed in the second and third parts of the semester. Finally, I would encourage that the course allow and perhaps require more exploration of different mediums in relation to the contextual differences between assignments, in particular mediums that may be new to much of the class. Using the same technique each time did not yield increasing quality of work, rather increasing frustration as the technique frequently failed to inspire as the assignments changed in focus."
