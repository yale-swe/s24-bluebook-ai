    "I think we learned a little bit of everything, I think it would have been good to more into depth into system dynamics and the other tools that were presented in class (decision matrix)",
    "I thought this course was very interesting and I learned a ton. I force myself to do all the readings I think that was really helpful. But it times I felt that the rest of the class wasn't exactly on the same page nor as engaged as I was which I found kind of frustrating. I do think at times we went to slow and at times we went too fast. I loved the panel presentations and the chance to interact with professionals. I wish this could've been expanded even further.",

    "The field trips were valuable and I really enjoyed having so many speakers. Having three professors with different expertise teach the course was also beneficial.",
    "I really like that the three professors have very different points of views. Also, the panels were very interesting.",
    "The best aspect of the course were definitely the fact that it was co-taught, and you had kind of a different flavor of every week, but also the opportunity to interact with professionals through the panelists that came throughout the semester. I think studying in a systems framework from different perspectives and having the opportunity to see things that are taking place on the ground are very important.",
    "Teamwork",
    "the skills and knowledge gained are useful throughout the life.",
    "The entire course session was excellent. provided us with there professor with different expertise, the course gave us a broad perspective on how to bridge the science on tackling the real-life issues on environment. though the course focused on water issue, the tools can be used on all environmental fields. Working in groups was also the best part of getting better understanding of the class materials. It also trained us how to interact with others especially with different academic background and experiences.",
    "The emphasis on group work felt more true to typical work experiences, which gave me a very different experience than any other class I'd taken here. I appreciated the long-term emphasis on the NYC system, it really allowed us to dig into some of the intricacies of it.",
    "I thougfhrly enjoyed lecture, the panelists, and the diversity of content an application.",
    "I liked the comparisons made between the New York water system and other systems across the world. System thinking, water and nitrogen budgets were also an amazing aspect of the course and helped me understand the challenges facing water Managers",
    "The diversity of topics and visions covered throughout the course were a great learning contribution. The focus on skills rather than on contents is definitely a remarkable strength of the course.",
    "given how many group assignments were expected, there was way too much reading assigned for the individual classes."

   "comments": [
    "Improved clarity of course goals, much less group work.",
    "The presentations we decide to give in class: It would have been great to give presentations on the different cities.",
    "I enjoyed the group work but there were a few assignments towards the end of the class that seemed redundant and it felt more like we were trying to complete things as fast as possible so we could move onto the next thing and there wasn't time to slow down and learn from the assignment. The Nitrogen budget specifically felt redundant.",
    "More depth in the assignments and feedback",
    "I think the aspect that needs most improvement is just the balance at times I felt we didn't spend enough time on the financial and consumerism components of the system. Perhaps having someone solely from DEP come in and talk about the inner functioning of the organization would be really helpful. Especially how finance and politics play into the water system. Loved the focus on engineering and watershed science because those are really important and most people don't get a background in them from other classes. I also like that we had to make the connections ourselves a lot of the time, but again, because I think a lot of the class didn't actually read the outside readings, it was harder for many people to do that. Also, why really liked having the external city, I wish we could've had an opportunity to present on the city rather than constantly presenting on the same topics amongst all four groups. It started to get kind of old and awkward after a while.",
    "Coordination between different teachers and TA's",
    "the practical session needs more time",
    "My suggestion wight be on the online materials. The online material is very complete and at the some point made us a little bit confused of the completeness. It would be better if the Professors or the TAs give an explanation of the online material content and how to use it.",
    "I felt like most of the assignments that had to do with our chosen city were a bit unconnected. I do like the option to choose and study our own city in comparison to NYC, but it felt a bit superficial with the assignments we had to do. Additionally, it would be helpful if the assignment descriptions were somewhat unified. It often felt like there were minor discrepancies between what was expressed in class and what was written on Canvas, which led to some confusion during the actual completion of the assignments. This, as well as the occasional lack of communication about when presentations were due in class, made most of the assignments slightly tentative.",
    "If the students were not in my group, it was like they were not in the class. I think they all have a lot to add and it would be great to interact with them more. Perhaps some mixing up of students in smaller class assignments. Or maybe for one assignment there is a student exchange program that emulates getting a new worker while being on an already established team. Also less presentations would be nice, or maybe an alternative to presentations. Something more creative... They felt routine after a while.",
    "I think there needs to more in-depth study of the alternative cities instead of just comparisons. This would help create solutions that could possible be implemented.",
    "It needs to be ensured that the different tools and methods covered throughout the course are not revised only superficially. A more in-depth use of the different tools would be recommendable. There is a great room for improvement in the quality and timing of the feedback provided to students. In our case, I had the feeling that our presentations and some of our written reports did not achieve high quality standards, but we never had any direct feedback on what we did wrong and why.",
    "Pete was very engaged and helpful on the fieldtrip but I found the classes run by Pete to be basically incomprehensible. The materials he assigned did not clarify matters and it was impossible to read his diagrams on the chalkboard, his powerpoints did not add value."

    "For the most part, yes. However, I do wish that we had some time to dig into each of the topics we discussed a bit further. I felt like a fair amount of classtime was wasted through in-class thought exercises and Q&A. I think some of those thoughts could even be made into small, short response assignments at the beginning of the semester, to get us interacting and working with each other more.",

    "Yes,it did",

   "comments": [
    "The advantages were that other group members understood some concepts better than I did. The disadvantages were that there was far too much group work. I don't think this is a true replication of collaboration in a work environment and, for that reason, I think the emphasis is misplaced. Specifically, most group members are very busy and don't have dedicated time to meet and actually complete assignments together. As a result, assignments are parceled out, which I think decreases the comprehension of everyone involved.",
    "I learned a lot from working in a team in this class. I really like all of the exercises we had to improve our team interaction.",
    "A large part of this course was group work. I think understanding that during assignment times, which is basically all the time we were meeting with our groups anywhere from 2 to 4 hours a week in addition to our class time. This was a lot of time, and I think even though we did the charter discussion amongst our group at the beginning, I think it would've been helpful for the professors to really explain the importance of ongoing work in your group. Especially how there's so much technology out there that allows you to do group work without being in the same room and how you can use these tools effectively. Basically it was very frustrating to constantly have to be all in the same room while editing a document line by line. This is mostly result of the fact that the groups had both native and non-native speakers as well as a wide range of writing abilities. Given the situation it usually fell upon one or two individuals to rework the text in order to best represent what the author was trying to convey.",
    "Advantages Get to know new people Learn more through knowledge sharing Complete assignments on time",
    "the group was really helpful on understanding the class material. My group member was excellent as they help me on sharing the assignment burden as well us gave me a different perspective on how to see the problems.",
    "I really enjoyed the format of the group work in this class. Working with the same group over the course of a semester allowed us to get to know each other well, especially our strengths and weaknesses. However, I think I had such a good experience because I was fortunate enough to get a functional, well-performing group. If I had the misfortune to land with a bad group member or two, I think I would have felt quite differently about the entire semester.",
    "There were many advantages to working in teams. We were able to rely on each other for support and clarity. It was as if we were in a clinic class and NYC DEP was our client. It was great having the time to really get to know my team. The disadvantages were that of any group, when there was disagreement or someone who just takes over. With a mix of academic and professional, it was never clear how to respond to group concerns. Also, some of the team members had higher expectations of of the team than the rest. Meaning they felt as though they needed to assign us work or were let down when we didn't respond to an email at midnight.",
    "This course is set up in a group work framework. Group work contracts are also set at the start of the course to ensure groups run smoothly. My group provided different dimension to discussions that strengthened our assignments. Any challenges that arose were ironed out immediately hence optimal output was achieved",
    "The group work was one of the big contributions of this class. Having a formal agreement on the rules for group work was new to me, and I would definitely recommend that for future work. As previously said, I would add more meaningful feedback (and why not more strict comments on the groups achievements) that might push the limits of the groups to achieve better results.",

This is a skill-oriented course that demands a lot of group work.
