   "comments": [
    "This course is an excellent, broad overview of Middle Eastern societies and cultures. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in anthropology, history, and\/or foreign policy in the context of the Middle East. I would also recommend it to anyone who wants to develop their understanding of the world more generally as this course challenges you to rethink many assumptions about \"other\" societies and cultures and provides a window into other ways of thinking, living, and experiencing the world.",
    "The course title is a relatively direct summary of the course (\"culture and politics of the contemporary Middle East\").I would certainly recommend it for anyone who is looking to explore the region through a theoretical and cultural lens but would warn that if an individual is looking to debate current policies or conflicts, this would not be the ideal course to achieve that end.",
    "This course is a \"must-take\" for anyone studying the Middle East at Yale, and for anyone interested in gender and\/or health issues in the region. It would be an excellent choice for graduate students from Anthropology, Sociology, Public Health, International Relations, History, and Political Science, as well as Gender Studies or Middle East Studies. Although not an overview of any one topic in the contemporary Middle East, the course give in-depth pictures of many populations, communities, and perspectives in the region through a serious of well-written and intriguing ethnographies. The choices for the reading list are impeccable."

   "comments": [
    "This course was very helpful in my research, providing me with a greater understanding of not only the Middle Eastern region but also different methodological approaches and ways of presenting one's research.",
    "Provided solid background of culture and politics of the contemporary Middle East which is what I was looking to learn Erne about in my first semester of graduate school.",
    "As a public health student, I feel strongly that this course broadened my understanding of health and social issues in a region where I hope to spend my life working. It helped give me ideas for how I might frame qualitative (and quantitative) research in the Middle East on various health topics, and gave me a better understanding of the feminist and gender-studies literature in the region. It also helped me understand communities in which I have worked in the past in a broader social\/political context."
