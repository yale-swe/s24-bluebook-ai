    "It's an amazing class. Just fabulous! Take it with Pinzka, though. I have heard negative reviews from kids taking it with other teachers. However, every one in our class was in love with the teacher and the course. It's soo relaxed and so much fun!",
    "All about current challenges, topics related to France (but applicable almost anywhere). A lot of class discussions.",
    "There's reading and homework for every class, but it's not overwhelming or time consuming--pretty standard for any language course. The one thing that was TERRIBLE about this class was the vocabulary tests. They were stressful and not at all helpful for learning new vocab, and even though I usually did well on them, I hated them. The test format of being asked to recall (out of thin air) 40 random words from a vocab list and use them in a timed, in-class essay was one of the most frustrating classroom exercises I have ever been subjected to. There just wasn't a good way to study for them. I tried numerousdifferent methods in the course of the semester, everything from writing my own nursery rhymes using the vocab (effective but very inefficient) to reading over an alphabetized list of words (overwhelming) to simply writing a selection of words from the vocab list on a piece of lined paper, over and over and over again (incredibly tedious). There were just too many words that we were asked to cover in any given test (usually about 200), and if you tried to make your life easier by focusing in on 40 or 50, you always ran the risk of not being able to use some of them based on the essay prompt you were given. While I understand that vocabulary is important in learning a language, there has got to be a better way to test it than this. I learned the vocab far more effectively through our use of it in in-class discussion than I ever did through the tests.",
    "It's a great class, fascinating introduction to current issues in France, goes a long way towards understanding the deep culture of the place. Interesting movies, stimulating discussion. Tests are kinda hard, but if you find a formula for studying that works, you'll be able to do them.",
    "YES, I absolutely recommend this class, especially with Madame Pinzka. The workload isn't too bad, and I found that my French really improved through all our class discussions. Madame Pinzka is also simply a wonderful person."
