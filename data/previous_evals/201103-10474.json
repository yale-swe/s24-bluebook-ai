    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course. It is important for any theorist to be familiar with the topics covered in this course. And Professor Cohn is brilliant.",
    "Music 945 addresses several recent and influential ways of theorizing chromaticism in 19th-century music based primarily on three monographs published in 2011. I would recommend the course to any student of music theory, because it touches on important topics in current theory scholarship."

The subject matter of the course might contribute directly to my future research, and will certainly have a more general impact on my thinking about music theory."
