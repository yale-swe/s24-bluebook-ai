    "I learned a lot of previously unknown vocabulary, grammar structures, cheng yu, and also so much Chinese culture this semester! The topics in 153 are much more advanced and interesting than 152, including Chinese traditional arts\/music\/calligraphy and Chinese philosophy.",
    "Immensely improved my Chinese speaking, writing, and reading abilities.",
    "I reinvigorated myself with Chinese, once again reviewing my own personal memories of Chinese. I was never good at chinese, so this was a hard class for me, and I learned a lot about Chinese sentence structures and vocabulary while reviewing old words.",
    "My knowledge of Chinese language improved in the writing and reading aspects, not so much the speaking. However, it was an excellent class overall. We covered a bunch of topics in Chinese culture that isn't used in everyday conversation, but it was incredibly interesting and engaging.",
    "It was challenging workload-wise, but I've learned a lot more vocabulary and grammar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class has clearly been taught with a lot of experience, so its structure works very well already. There are elements of everything, like writing\/speaking\/listening, in our homework and projects. Some tests can be a bit hard, but that's not a weakness of the course, it's just part of an advanced language class!",
    "We learned so much in such a short amount of time. I think some of the lessons weren't as engaging- but that was mainly when we were reviewing grammar. I loved that we did so many fun projects this semester and engaged with the language in a different way.",
    "Wang LaoShi was a great teacher, and she had good advice and also was very energetic when teaching. I find it amazing how she wrote her own textbook. However, it was hard to know how I was being graded and what grade I will end up with. At the time of writing this review, I still am worried about what I have gotten in the class.",
    "I wish we could practice our speaking (back and forth conversation) instead of learning very specific formal words that are typically not used, but I understand that there is a tradeoff in that respect. If there were less emphasis on fancy vocabulary and more emphasis on fluency of speaking, I think that would make this a better class. Overall, my Chinese did vastly improve.",
    "Strengths: Great instructor, engaging classroom and discussion format. Weaknesses: It's a very high workload! Also, the learning pace is so fast that I'm not sure how much vocabulary or how many sentence patterns I actually remember."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Especially Wang laoshi's section. If you are serious about improving your Chinese this class is definitely rigorous, but it is also fun and interesting.",
    "Yes! Be prepared for the work- the amount of work second semester is definitely a set pup from CHNS 152.",
    "Not unless necessary, but that may be because of my personal bias against Chinese. I love Wang LaoShi.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they wanted to improve their writing skills. Wang Laoshi is super engaging and very nice. She clearly cares about her students and manages to incorporate fun things like movies into our curriculum. Not only does your Chinese improve, but the class is enjoyable, so you have fun along the way! It is a large-ish workload since we have a quiz every class, but if you are coming from 152, I think the workload is less than first semester since you are already used to it.",
    "Yes, especially as a follow up to 152- youll find your vocabulary much enriched",
    "Yes! A great chance to improve Chinese with a fantastic instructor."
