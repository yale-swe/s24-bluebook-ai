   "comments": [
    "Yes. It's good for any student that wants to try an art class but doesn't want a bog commitment or intimidating environment.",
    "I would recommend this art class to a fellow student because it does not require an extreme amount of commitment even though there are assignments after every class. Also there is a good amount of time to do the assignments in. The professor is friendly and the people in the class are not full of themselves.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with little to no drawing experience or to someone that wanted to take more classes in the art department. I would not recommend this class to someone who enjoyed drawing\/had a lot of experience and was looking to grow artistically.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a charcoal-based drawing class who prefer working independently, since interaction and instruction from the professor is minimal.",
    "This was a great drawing class. I always looked forward to it as a place to unwind and just enjoy drawing. The class was always very relaxed but very productive. It was not too hard and I never got discouraged. I have never taken a formal drawing class before and I think this was a perfect introduction.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It was a course that was very enjoyable, low stress, though it did require a significant amount of work - something you'd need to be able to allot chunks of time to. The class focused on developing skills of perception through observational drawing, which is very necessary as a basic tool for beginning studio art studies.",
    "This class is accessible to people of all skill levels. It is a good way to get you drawing for a while on a regular basis, and you will develop as an artist. However, if you really have absolutely no experience, be forewarned that you will find yourself spending a lot more time making a lot less progress than some of the other more artistically-oriented students.",
    "Yes! Observational art exercises a part of the brain that many might not know exists! Over the course of one semester, you'll be able to see improvement as well.",
    "It is a good balance to a schedule, but does not offer a great introduction to art.",
    "Hardly anyone who takes this class (at least in my class) has no prior art experience. However, if you don't (like I didn't) and are interested in learning, don't be intimidated. Grading is based on how much you improve and the instructors are very supportive. It's not easy, but it's very rewarding. Great for people even in other majors that will use drawing, like architecture.",
    "I would recommend Art 114, definitely for beginners and even for more advanced artists. One learns the basic techniques and develops skill through a lot of practice.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to students interested in drawing (whether learning how to draw or simply improving their drawing skills). This class is the most fun and worthwhile for those who put a fair amount of time into their work outside of class. It is also a welcome relief from the typical work of problem sets and essays.",
    "You should definitely take Art 114 03. It is some times a hassle to walk down to the art studio with big folders, art supplies, etc., but well worth it if you love art and want to learn."
