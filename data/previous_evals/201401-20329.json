    "Brilliant professor, excellent topic, stimulating discussions. You read Greek texts about Socrates and then look at how thinkers through the ages have viewed Socrates. If you are interested in philosophy, classics, thinking, nonconformity, truth, beauty, love, politics... then I think you will like the class.",

    "Absolutely! Low workload, brilliant professor, deeply engaging material. The perfect HUMS\/classics seminar."
