    "I would recommend EGYP 131 to a fellow student - it's a really enjoyable way to spend a few hours every week in class, learning from an expert.",
    "Absolutely, 100% take this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in ancient Egypt or just want a unique way to fulfill your language requirement.",
    "Less structured than L1 and L2, but much more fun. Just translating, with a take-home midterm that actually took a month of hard work with a hieratic dictionary. Fascinating class discussions about Egyptian grammar and history. One of my favorite classes at Yale. Highly recommended."
