    "Don't leave the fall report go until the last minute.",
    "Great opportunity to do research for the senior project.",
    "Senior year requirement, not much to say - your experience will depend on your lab, so try to find the right fit for you.",
    "If you want to do the BS for MCDB, there's really only one other option and it's basically the same as MCDB 485 anyway. I think the course was valuable to me in the sense that it made me realize I don't really care all that much about research although I still really like biology. Make sure you get a good lab that can help you through all the steps of research because you're not going to get that much guidance in MCDB 485, even for assignments that are assigned by the MCDB 485 staff themselves and not by your actual lab. The research itself is not bad: just budget about 10 hours each week. The tricky part comes in the write-ups that you have to upload for the class. While you can fulfill it to your lab's specifications, there are almost none for MCDB 485 as a whole. Overall, not bad, but just know, you won't be getting much guidance here.",
    "One of the better major requirements in my opinion. If you're in a lab that you like with a project that you care about, it shouldn't feel like a chore, especially if you've already been working in a lab anyway. 485's good if you need to have time for extracurriculars, a job, etc.",
    "I would recommend to any science study to take the opportunity to pursue research at Yale.",
    "Pretty much a requirement of the major. Research is fun. Do a good job: letters of recommendation and possible publications can hang in the balance.",
    "MCDB 485 may be the most involved course that an MCDB student will take at Yale. Doing well in this course will require you to treat your research not as another class, but as a job. In doing so, you will not only learn about your field and the techniques used to conduct research in it, but you will better understand the context of all the material you had studied in previous classes and how you might apply it. It is essential that you keep meticulous notes and conduct your data analysis as you progress. This will serve you well when the time arrives to present your research at the end of the year. I would recommend this course to any student in the MCDB major. It has given me skills that will last the rest of my scientific career, enhanced my understanding of material in other courses, and provided me with additional research and conference opportunities for the future.",
    "If you're doing a senior thesis, I really recommend doing the whole year or even more in order to generate data. Things always take so much longer than expected. Take it, but only if you have good teachers in your lab and if you're willing to show some initiative to get the most out of your research experience.",
    "yes thesis requirement",
    "This is a fun way to fulfill the senior requirement for MCDB. Being able to work on an individual project teaches a lot of the essential skills needed to succeed in research. I never felt lost throughout the semester and felt well supported, despite it being an individual effort.",
    "Good year-long research for credit course. Find a PI you click with and you'll have a great year.",
    "This is the most common course for fulfilling the senior project in MCDB. I would recommend it over the intensive track, which only differs in the time commitment (20 hr\/wk vs. 10 hr\/wk) and the requirement of giving a presentation in both semesters. Many students who did the intensive track didn't seem to actually put in the extra time, so there's really no gain besides the word \"intensive,\" a huge loss in that you effectively lose the opportunity to take two more Yale classes, and probably a lot more stress. If you're planning ahead and considering the BS\/MS program, my advice is the same. It sounds fancy, but you need a PhD anyways if you want to be an academic, and the sacrifice is huge - 6 credits (and a summer) consumed by something you could just be doing for pay, and likely the necessity to retake several classes for graduate credit.",
    "Well, you have to take this course if you wish to be an MCDB major, but in regards to taking 10 hr vs 20 hr, I chose 10 hr just because I could be more flexible with my courses. I had to take at least 5 courses each semester during senior year while interviewing for medical school."
