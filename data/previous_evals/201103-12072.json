   "comments": [
    "Very small class which leads to lots of individual attention and discussion. Also a great booklist.Professor Zhuo is really nice and encouraging. She's not quite as nice on paper grading, but not overly punitive.The one problem I had was that not everyone took the work very seriously all the time (including me) which, since were only 7 kids, led to some very awkward and unproductive class sessions.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 175 to another student. The literature was very interesting and varied. I also feel my writing style improved greatly throughout the semester. Discussions were always engaging and interesting.",
    "This is a literary analysis class that involves lengthy readings, 3 papers (3 pages), and a final paper (6 pages). While class discussions were interesting, you get almost no guidance for the papers, so it's kind a of a stab in the dark. You are allowed to re-write each paper, which is really nice. However, meeting with Mme Zhuo often leaves you understanding how to improve the specific paper that you discussed, but not how to improve your writing in general. I would say be cautious about taking this class - it's probably better for someone who already has a good amount of experience analyzing literature in French.",
    "I would recommend this course. Since it covers French LIt. in a general way you are sure to find something that you will enjoy. Also French. lit is use fun.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn how to write an analytical paper in French. They are short so the work is not overwhelming. Professor Zhuo is great too."
