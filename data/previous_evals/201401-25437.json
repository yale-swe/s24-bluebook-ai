   "comments": [
    "It's a wonderful overview of health around the world, especially in developing countries. Skolnik is incredibly knowledgeable, and law school-style cold-calling really encourages class participation. He doesn't judge you if you don't know an answer. This has been my favorite class. Practicality was emphasized in a mostly theoretical school. Get in if you can.",
    "A good foundation in global health for anyone interested in the field or just interested. The professor is good and a good mentor if you're looking for one, and the entire course is designed to really give you the tools you need to think about global health issues in the right way.",
    "A great survey course of global health! I would definitely recommend to students interested in a broad overview of the topic. Skolnik is a great professor that clearly cares about his students. The three five-page policy briefs are not difficult and are a very important skill to master if you want to go into public policy. The midterms and finals are actually much trickier than you might expect, so read the textbook carefully to prepare for them!",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student. It was very boring and not engaging at all. Very repetitive each lecture, really no point in going if you read the book.",
    "If you're interested in global health, public health, or international development (or even if you aren't) absolutely take this course! Great prof, material is easy to grasp and interesting. You write three 5-page policy briefs, and one midterm, one final (both multiple choice).",
    "Global Health Challenges and Responses is a decent class, if you can stand listening to the professor talk about how great he is lecture after lecture. Take it if you have to but avoid it and take something else in the department if all you want is an intro to global health.",
    "The class requires one think critically about the field of global health and place oneself in the shoes of the health minister speaking to the finance minister of any country. Evaluating a country's individual needs and abilities to deal with global health allows for the student to grow in understanding the economics, logistics, and challenges of improving global health. The class was not static either, the format would change from just listening to the professor, having guest lecturers, and doing group activities.",
    "Amazing class!! This class is a must for anyone even remotely interested in global health. Great overview of basic health concepts. I would recommend it. Hopefully I can take another class with Skolnik in the near future.",
    "Practical course on the issues and plausible solutions to global health issues.",
    "Great class. I recommend everyone to take this class - especially if you even THINK you're interested in Global or Public Health. This class has given me a much deeper understanding of the foundations of global health and has given me the tools to think about and even tackle current issues. Take this class!",
    "HLTH 230 is a phenomenal introduction to global health. Professor Skolnik makes class interesting with anecdotes from his illustrious career. His dedication to teaching and mentoring is extraordinary. This class will open your eyes to what billions of people endure but leave you with a concrete sense of what the world can and is doing about it and how you can get involved. It's accessible to anyone even without a background in public health, international studies, or pre-medical sciences. I couldn't recommend it more highly.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this to any student at Yale. Taking this class gives one an appreciation for the little things we take for granted such as clean water and vaccines.",
    "You learn everything from the burden of disease to how science and technology affect health. The course focuses on least cost solutions, and incorporates ideas from economics to tackle problems in health (minus the math).",
    "it was a great overview of a class for global health. keep up with readings and study well for tests and you'll do fine.",
    "I would 100 percent recommend this class. It is fascinating and showed me a whole new field.",
    "Yes, definitely. I felt like I learned to so much from this class and the topics are things that are not covered in other classes.",
    "Great Course!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. It's a very thorough introduction to all aspects of global health and by the end, whether you started out caring about global health or not, you find yourself passionate about various aspects and equipped with the basic knowledge of what solutions could be possible. While attendance wasn't recorded at each lecture, it was interesting enough to want to go each class.",
    "This class is great. It really gives a new perspective on how rough life can be outside of the developed world. Also, basically no work. I probably spent 20 hours on this class over the entire semester, and that includes paper writing and studying.",
    "I would definitely recommend HLTH 230. If you are someone who is looking to get involved with global\/public health, this is a great course to take as an \"intro.\" I came out of the class with what I believe is a solid foundational knowledge of global health, development, the challenges we face in these areas, and what can be done to address them. Professor Skolnik is engaging, charismatic, organized, and always looks for ways to push all students. Take HLTH 230!",
    "I would recommend it as these are important health issues that everyone should know about. Hlth 230 enables you to learn about the broad issues that affect health, as well as the key risk factors, challenges, consequences and solutions.",
    "If you have any interest in the health of lower and middle income countries or even if you don't, you should definitely take this class. Professor Skolnik is amazing. He is enthusiastic. He frequently gets meals with students and gives some of the best career advice. This is a class everyone should take before they graduate.",
    "HLTH 230 is AMAZING. If you are pre-med, if you are interested in public health, if you like development economics, if you like anthropology, or really if you have any care at all about the health and peoples of the world, you should take this class. Professor Skolnik is hands-down the best professor I've had so far at Yale. He brings a huge deal of practical experience to the course, having spent many years working at the World Bank on health and education in southeast Asia. He brings all of this experience into the classroom, making you feel like you are directly responsible for researching and making all the important decisions about what health interventions should or shouldn't be funded in order to best reduce the world's sickness and suffering. You don't write papers in this course: you write write policy briefs. You don't give summarize readings in section once a month: you give presentations on how best to tackle AIDS or TB or the like in low-income countries. Professor Skolnik is incredibly accessible and will help inspire and guide you to a career in global health. You'll have a lot of fun along the way, and you'll become much better informed about the health of the world's poor.",
    "I would recommend it! It's a solid, very practical overview of important facts and overarching themes in global health. I was not a fan of the excessive kissing up to Skolnik that everyone did and how much he seemed to bask in it, but I still enjoyed the class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student, even if you're not interested in medicine or global health. Professor Skolnik is one of a kind and really makes sure to meet individually with each of his students. You learn how to write important policy briefs, and the TAs really try to make section interesting and fun.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. I loved this course, and I feel like I learned so much! I knew next to nothing about global health before taking this class, and it really got me interested in the field and in development work. It was a great pace for an intro level course, and Professor Skolnik was amazing. The requirements for the course were always very clear, and the professor was extremely fair about grading. This was my favorite course this semester, and one of the most interesting that I've taken at Yale."
