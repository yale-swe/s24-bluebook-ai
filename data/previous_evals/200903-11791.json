    "Networked embedded systems and sensor networks was a decent survey class of the current topics in the field. We were presented a lot of research and read a lot of papers. There was a semester long project but not as much importance was placed on these than was expected. I would recommend this class if you want to know a variety of topics and techniques, but there wasn't too much practical work or implementation in the class.",
