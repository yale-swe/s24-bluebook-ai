    "This was my favorite course of the semester! I enjoyed all the readings and classroom discussions. Everyone in the class had insightful comments to make and students did an excellent job at leading discussions and challenging the group with good questions.",
    "there was too much reading for some weeks. I think the class would be better structured if the first half was lecture and the 2nd half was discussion. That way, the nuances of the articles would be clearer.",
    "The discussions in class enabled to understand conservation issues from various perspectives: politics, economy, history, development etcI would recommend this class for second year students who are interested in conservation and development issues in developing countries.In general, this was one of the best classes I took while at Yale.",
    "On Question 7: During presentations of the topics of our final papers Amity was visibly falling asleep, which aside from being unprofessional was not very reassuring \u0097 considering she was going to be assigning us grades ...On Question 8: The readings were excellent and very helpful, although they became redundant after a while. We did not engage with the material analytically. Several rigorous students, including one of the Agrarian Studies fellows, came to the seminar for a few weeks before eventually deciding to drop it, presumably because the course was not sufficiently rigorous to be worth the time. I left the course thinking I could have learned much, much more from the material if we had had better guidance.",

    "Discussions and readings were excellent. It's a 3-hour seminar with lots of time to discuss the complexities of property rights.",
    "Class readings and discussion sections with the rest of classmates",
    "I first thought that property rights were simply an interesting tangent to what I was studying, but I soon found that they are an integral part of a lot of what people at FES are studying, so I was surprised that a course like this had never been taught before. It was new, interesting material.",
    "This has been my favorite course at FES thus far. The best part I thought were actually the first three discussion topics + readings (weeks 2, 3, 4). I liked starting with the underlying theory and re-engaging with thinkers like Locke and Marx which most of us read in undergrad. I also loved picking apart the tragedy of the commons and delving into collective action theory. Just overall, the subject material was positively fascinating.",
    "The readings; in particular these:\u0097Carol Rose\u0097\"Theory of Access\"\u0097Amanor 2008\u0097Zerner 1994\u0097Agrawal and Ostrom 2001\u0097Ewick and Silbey 1995\u0097Orlove 1991",

   "comments": [
    "Everything was great.",
    "none, course was great and class size was just right to make things run smoothly and to get the most benefit from them",
    "more explanation from Prof.",
    "The course is a lot of discussion, which, while interesting, is exhausting. Either cut the course to 2 hours or lecture for an hour. WHen the short lecture was added to the end, it made the course a lot better. We also want to hear from the instructor, not just each other.Also, a couple of the weeks got repetitive in terms of content. I think these topics included narratives, traditional land tenure, etc. I think maybe scrap one or integrate it into another. I know the class is international and not about property rights in any one country in particular, but i think we could have one class that would be a kind of case study of property rights in one country, including in-depth analysis of different types of regimes (both traditional and statutory), and also getting into some of the legal cases. A lot of property is legal--just head over to the Law School where they too have a semester-long course on it.",
    "Towards the end of the semester, the readings and topics started to feel a bit redundant (esp. when we got to the politics of representation). It would have been great to spend more time on the \u0091modern\u0092 topics at the end of the course, like carbon rights, bioprospecting, and intellectual property of indigenous knowledge. Maybe next year they can be expanded into two weeks towards the end instead of just one? Also, the mapping exercise was fun \u0096 the one where we looked at different maps of New Haven. I highly encourage more fun with maps.",
    "More analysis from someone familiar with the material. Amity left students to wallow around in redundant articles\u0097she rarely lectured and was moderately incisive when she did\u0097and the course very much suffered for it.",
    "Can't think of much"

Before this course, property rights were just a simple phenomenon to me but right now it appears to be a complex and source of rich\/elite to undermine the poor.",

Through discussions with my fellow students and the Professor, I was able to gain more understanding on complications of conservations issues in developing countries",
    "Yes, see above.",

    "choose a topic\/example you are passionate about early one, so you can then apply the theories and readings toyour case throughout the semester",
    "I would advise three things:1: They should take introductory social science\/anthropology classes in order to be comfortable with discussions and readings in class2: They should engage fully in discussion in order to benefit from the class3: They should attend talks to engage in a global debates about conservation issues",
    "The best thing anyone can do in this course is to take very seriously their role as discussion leaders when it is their turn to lead class discussion. I think this course succeeded because people did this creatively during the first few weeks and it really set the tone for a whole semester of high quality discussion and engagement.",
