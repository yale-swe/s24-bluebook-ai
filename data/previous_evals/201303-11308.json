   "comments": [
    "This is a good introduction to experimental philosophy and a very discussion-based section. Knobe is a great thinker and listener.",
    "I would recommend it to a student with at least a bare background in philosophical issues, and an interest in the new wave of thought called experimental philosophy (using empirical data to inform philosophy). Also, students taking this course should have some self-discipline in terms of doing reading and work required for the final paper. There is only one assignment, and that is the final paper.",
    "I loved the course. It covered many of the classic papers and also more obscure ones. The range of topics was very broad, jumping from very basic ideas in ethics to more technical work in metaphysics. Some familiarity with philosophy may be helpful, but I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested.",
    "I highly recommend CogSci 432. Josh Knobe basically invented experimental philosophy, so learning about the field from him is a unique opportunity. He's incredibly brilliant and articulate and great at guiding class discussion. You not only learn about the field and particularly cool discoveries and controversies, but you also get to contribute to the field - generating hypotheses in class discussion and ultimately possibly doing an empirical project for the final project. Josh is there to help you as much as you need. The reading load is very manageable and the only assignment is the final project.",
    "Every week you discuss a couple issues relating to a field that experimental philosophy explores. Josh does a fantastic job of listening, making you seem brilliant, and keeping the conversation on track. He is also very helpful with independent research projects: most of the work you do for this class is a final project which can be an experiment (and paper about the experiment) or a more standard philosophy paper about issues relating to experimental philosophy.",
    "I would highly recommend Experimental Philosophy to anyone and everyone, philosophy major in particular. The material is fascinating, Josh Knobe is a brilliant, engaging professor, the discussions are great, and the coursework is manageable. It introduces a field that seems to be rapidly growing in relevance, so if you're looking to go into philosophy I think this class is a must. Beware that the only graded assignment is due at the very end of the term.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Not too much reading or work, super great discussions, really interesting subject matter, and Prof. Knobe is just fabulous.",
    "This was a good course overall. Each week we discussed a different philosophical topic from an exphi perspective. It kind of turned into a methods course, though, spending the class time coming up with experiments that would elucidate nuances in the work we were discussing. Which is fine, but maybe a little different than what was expected. I think it's probably helpful to have a larger philosophy background in order to get more out of the course. Sometimes discussion can get caught in circular\/convoluted\/nitpicky conversations that could be frustrating, but Josh was usually pretty good at pulling us out of those.Josh is a really great discussion leader and professor. He is very approachable and flexible. I was really impressed by his abilities to facilitate a (usually) productive discussion, giving great explanations at the beginning of each section of the class to clarify things and then continuing throughout the discussion to repeat students' points in clearer terms and connecting the dots of each of our points so that the discussion moved forward in a cohesive way. He always stuck to his plan of how long we would discuss each topic and what aspects of the topic we would focus on at a time, which could be frustrating at times when he would shut down a certain line of discussion right when it was getting interesting. However, I understand the purpose behind that method and in the end it probably served the class well.I would suggest getting started on the final project early because Josh can give you a lot of assistance as you go to make sure you come out with what you (and he) want(s). It definitely sneaks up on you, since the work throughout the semester has nothing to do with it and is just readings each week. It can be a lot of reading some weeks, with a response due the night before class, but it's usually manageable.",
    "It's a must take."
