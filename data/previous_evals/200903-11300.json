   "comments": [
    "If you need a QR and want a cool professor, take this class. Not the easiest math gut, but pretty interesting.",
    "If you want a QR credit, it's a good option - not all of the math is a joke, but you can understand a lot of it without doing explicitly mathematical sorts of thinking. It's also generally interesting.",
    "Take it for an interesting, thought-provoking, not-too-demanding math credit.",
    "If you need a QR, I recommend you take it. At times it might seem like you're lost, but it's okay because the class is structured so you will be able to understand everything. I promise. The midterm and final are open notes which was REALLY helpful. The high point of the class is Michael Frame. He's awesome and amazing and REALLY cares about his students. If you have to take a QR, or even if you're just interested in Fractal Geometry, I would recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend it; the math isn't that difficult and the concepts are fun once you get your mind around them. Especially if you need a QR this is a good class. And Frame is a very strong professor -- very smart and good at connecting with non-math type students.",
    "Terrific class. I know a lot of people take it because it's a relatively easy way to get the QR, which is fine, but I actually feel like I learned a lot of interesting things that will affect how I view data and patterns in the future. Fractals will inform your view of how we should model systems, like the stock market, and will generally educate the way you view the world. Michael Frame is an incredibly nice man with a great wry sense of humor. He is very helpful in office hours.",
    "This was quite possibly my favorite class I've taken throughout my 4 years at Yale. I am not at all a science or math person, but Fractal Geometry has made me glad for Yale's QR requirement - otherwise I may never have taken it. Prof. Frame is without parallel and every lecture was endlessly fascinating. He transcended pure mathematics and left us with lessons about the beautiful nature of life and the universe as a whole. I can not recommend this class enough.",
    "Oh yes. Please give yourself the joy of taking Fractal Geometry, if for no other reason than the time spent loving the world in this class. It is so easy to forget why we take the classes we do, but Michael Frame never went too long without giving us a \"Wow\" moment, which reminded us that, true, many of us will never explore the vast applications of this field of mathematics, but regardless, the world is amazing and it is amazing to try to understand it.Of course, you may be a person who would love to explore the vast applications of this field of mathematics. I'd love to see more math majors take this class.As for the non-math majors, Michael Frame will be one of the most effective teachers-of-mathyou have had. He knows exactly what it is that helps students learn most effectively, and prioritizes that over everything else.",
    "I didn't think that I'd ever enjoy a math class again after high school. But this was an excellent class that showed me an interesting field of math without me having to remember calculus. I'm surprised more people don't take this class to get their QR!",
    "Definitely take it. I'm not great at math, and I was just fulfilling a QR, but I really liked this class. Fractals are a really cool thing to be introduced to. Michael Frame is wonderful, plus he tells jokes at \"half-time.\" Also, you can use notes on the exams, which I think is a nice acknowledgment that it's more important to be able to apply the concepts than to memorize formulas.",
    "The best QR you'll ever take. TAKE IT.",
    "A great introduction to Fractal Geometry. Good for non-majors--the math is not difficult--but the ideas presented are completely new to a lot of people and can be hard to wrap your mind around at first. Will definitely get you thinking in an entirely different way!",
    "I would recommend this to a student who wants to learn about a different kind of mathematics than the typical algebra\/geometry\/calculus strain. I would not recommend this class to someone who is looking for an in-depth understanding of Fractals, as we often had to forgo the proofs to many equations or processes because the proofs themselves were just too long and complicated. I would also not recommend this to a student who is looking for material that is founded only upon the essential mathematics learned in high school; this course requires you to learn methods that sometimes don't resemble the kind of work you would've done in high school math.",
    "I would summarize Mathematics 190 01 as an introduction to the wonder and far-reaching complexities of mathematics and science. I would recommend the course to any student but would mention that the level of mathematical knowledge, or thinking, required is quite high.",
    "If you're looking for a QR credit but don't want to waste your time on a meaningless gut, take Fractals. The workload is very manageable--only nine homeworks, all which take 1-2 hours at most, and a midterm and final with open notes--and the material itself is very interesting. Plus Michael Frame is an inspiring, truly gifted professor; one of the rare ones that really cares about the students. His jokes are amazing. At least shop the class so you can have the Michael Frame experience.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class! I'm not a very math-oriented person, but I loved this class because it seemed like a completely new approach to math, even though it did incorporate some more traditional mathematic things. If you spend time on the homework and take good notes in class, you'll do well on the midterm and final. Professor Frame is an amazing teacher, in that he takes a genuine interest in how well we understand the material - even if it means spending almost an entire class reviewing the previous day's lesson."
