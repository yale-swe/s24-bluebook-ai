   "comments": [
    "Great survey course of the history of climate science that will give you a well-balanced understanding of the carbon cycle through time.",
    "Great class! Both of the professors are really nice. I learned a lot about the carbon cycle - some of the concepts are slightly complicated but the professors made it very easy and interesting to learn.",
    "This is an enjoyable science course (and accessible science credit for nonscience majors). The discussions are interesting and the work manageable. Just be aware that few expectations are given for projects.",
    "You read a short paper for every class and post a few discussion questions. Each person does a presentation on one paper. Then the class has a discussion, really more of a Q&A with the professors. You also write a term paper and do a presentation on it. The course looks at how the science has developed over time, beginning with the first measurements of rising CO2 concentrations and then examining the growing understanding of the role played by the ocean and land as sinks and sources. There is also a lot on paleoclimate to learn from past climate scenarios and to predict possible future scenarios. As a person interested in going into a non-technical field related to renewable energy or climate change, overall I thought the course, while not incredibly exciting, was valuable for improving my understanding of how the Earth system responds to rising CO2 concentrations and what the most important areas for mitigation are. The course was not demanding, and it was accessible to non-science majors.",
    "This course provided a solid understanding of climate change and the carbon cycle. Even as a non-science major, I was able to engage in deep scientific concepts in a meaningful way. Trude and Hagit are great!",
    "Not much work, but not really sure how the grading turned out."
