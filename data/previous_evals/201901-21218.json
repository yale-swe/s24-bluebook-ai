   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Furthered ability to use MatLab. Advanced thought process involving Physics problems.",
    "I learned that I should never have majored in engineering at Yale to begin with.",
    "I learned about rotational, vibrational, and gravitational motion.",
    "I learned a lot of math and physics, but this didn't feel like in an engineering classes in that the problems were rarely applied to actual realistic problems. The information may end up being useful, but the context for why wasn't clear during the class. Beyond what I learned, this class was really bad. The professor many of the lectures, and the TA was a poor lecturer. Problem sets were heavy on algebra and short on meaningful content. Overall, a very poor course.",
    "I learned some more advanced topics from mechanics with vector and tensor calculus.",
    "The course is obviously on dynamics (e.g anything that is moving). Overall, I feel I primarily developed math and programming skills. The coding assignments are a little unrelated to the other content but will be useful in life. Most of the questions are fairly idealized as opposed to real world, but they teach useful advanced physics and math skills.",
    "Maybe some dynamics. Not too much",
    "Mostly expanded on physics knowledge that was previously learned in PHYS 200. Learned how to tackle more complicated problems and you use MATLAB.",
    "Pretty boring, just an extension of high school physics. A LOT of math.",
    "AP physics will get me far in life.",
    "I gained a surface level understanding of basic dynamic principles like coupled oscillations, moments of inertia, molecular dynamics, projectile motion and constrained dynamics",
    "Approaching topics in classical methods with vector stuff",
    "I gained some insight into engineering dynamics and rigid-body motion but more than anything I developed an understanding of engineering notations. I also gained some knowledge of tensors and particle dynamics.",
    "I extended my knowledge of physics in a manner more specialized for the way I will use it.",
    "Honestly have no idea what I was supposed to learn in this course..."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weaknesses: Badly organized, boring lectures, no feedback or care about students' learning progress. The professor was gone for the entire first half of the semester, leaving the lectures to his TA, who is a good guy but gives lackluster lectures and is not good at explaining things. Strengths?",
    "A computing class was not a prerequisite for the classes but literally every pset we had to code. Was not optimal for learning as the tests were not coding. Would have loved the psets to be more like the tests so we knew what to expect\/could get some practice with example problems on paper.",
    "I wish the problem sets had more analytical questions and less coding questions. I haven't taken a coding class so I essentially had to teach myself how to use Matlab, which was very frustrating.",
    "The lectures were a bit dry. About a third of the material covered must be solved using Matlab and is not tested. Otherwise basic physics knowledge is sufficient to understand the course. Topics are fairly interesting.",
    "There are few strengths to this course. Weaknesses included poor contextualization for how the content covered could be applied to solving real engineering problems and an emphasis on algebra and derivations that could be looked up.",
    "Our professor was not there for 8 classes and Peter our TF, while very smart and kind, had to teach us for 6 with the other 2 not occurring at all. That being said Corey and Peter wants everyone to do well.",
    "This course went terribly. The lessons almost seemed random. The Professor was absent for weeks which is completely unacceptable.",
    "The teaching was well done and the content provided a good amount of rigor that I think improved my engineering abilities. I would recommend spacing out the PSets a little more and ensuring the lectures are taught at a slightly slower speed since the concepts can be very confusing at times.",
    "Way too much algebra. Skip some from time to time",
    "The course is not well structured. There was 3 PSETs for the first two months. Then 3 in the last month. The PSET material was mostly MATLAB and really did not prepare you for the tests. O'Hern is an engaging lecturer but also was often absent and didn't seem to have a clear vision for what this course is supposed to teach.",
    "The class was mostly taught by our TA and I don't think I came away from the class with an overall understanding of dynamics; it felt like a series of smaller topics and linear algebra taught together, but I wasn't ever sure how it all fit together. I liked that we had Matlab assignments, I think it reinforced the skill well. It would be improved if the professor had office hours or seemed more invested in the class.",
    "Corey does not care",
    "Many of the lectures were way too much just working line by line through math instead of emphasizing the important points. I also felt the course was improperly focused. Modal analysis is very important for most industry applications yet only received a week, while particle analysis is fairly niche yet received far more attention.",
    "The strength of this course is that the material has the potential to be interesting. During one of the earlier lectures (given by the INCREDIBLE TA, Peter) we used Newtons Equations of motion in polar coordinates in order to derive the relationships that govern the eccentricity of a planets orbitthats objectively cool stuff. I also found moments of inertia to be quite interesting. The weakness of this course is the way that it is taught. The professor (who is also the DUS of Mechanical Engineering) was not committed to the course in any way. His TA taught the class. As much as I love Peter, it is not his job to lecture. Im sure he wasnt paid as much as he should be, given the work that he put into this class. Corey missed 8 of the lectures (6 were taught by Peter, 2 were canceled). This is unacceptable. If this class is going to continue to be required for the mechanical engineering major, it needs to be taught by someone who is dedicated to the task at hand.",
    "exams were really fair",
    "Oddly enough, the whole course felt a little bit like an introduction. The material was interesting, but we never seemed to get into real applications or actual engineering problems using the techniques. I enjoyed learning the fundamentals, but some higher level material would have been nice.",
    "I never really understand the overarching goal of the course other than deepening understanding of individual topics. I also thought the first weeks were almost impossibly difficult, then it got too easy, and finally settled to a good level of difficulty. Overall though, the subject matter was interesting and much of it seemed useful.",
    "Learning objectives were very unclear, homeworks and exams did not feed off each other at all, never sure what topics to know."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, if they are a mechanical or biomedical engineer or just want a bit of knowledge extension in physics",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students. Dynamics is really important in mechanical engineering, but this course will give you a poor understanding of it and cause you a lot of stress.",
    "Not really unless they have too. I thought it was taught incredibly quickly and with minimal explanation.",
    "A pretty good course overall and Professor O'Hern is a good teacher and reasonable. The content is useful mathematically although not always that rooted in real-world engineering. Be prepared for relatively few HW assignments that are fairly complicated and involved if done right. Also, the exams were fairly difficult but the grading seemed fair. Peter, the TA, was amazing and always helpful.",
    "Eh class which is frustrating simple sometimes and way to much algebraic derivation",
    "Its a required and important course of the MENG major. Its not bad but I do feel like it could be so much more.",
    "Meh. If you like math and physics, yeah.",
    "Its a mandatory class for my major",
    "If this course continues to be taught by professor Ohern, do not take it unless you have to. You will derive far more value from a different course. And if you must, get to know Peter (if he is the TA) and give him your complete and total respect.",
    "yes, fun class if you like physics",
    "YES! The best class in the major.",
    "If you are really interested in Dynamics, I would take a PHYS or APHY course. This class is required by the MENG major, but there are likely some courses which teach the material in more depth in the physics department.",
    "Yes! Just make sure to take advantage of office hours and homework help sessions.",
    "You have no choice but to take this class so"
