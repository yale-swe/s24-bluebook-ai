   "comments": [
    "This class is really interesting for linguistics people and not alike. It teaches some useful and foundational math principles in the really engaging realm of human language, and also gets very far in the realm of studying language by way of these models. I think it's a very interesting and fairly easy course to delve into some cool topics.",
    "It's definitely not mathy, so it's a good QR (if sometimes dull) if you're trying to avoid numbers, but it's also not easy. The take-home final was manageable, but the midterm wasn't easy, and the p-sets took a good chunk of time every week.",
    "The course had a clear structure and was well-organized. The weekly problem sets were fairly straightforward, and it was always clear what was expected of the students. The material from the readings was pretty much entirely covered during class discussion. The course material was pretty interesting, but sometimes the lectures felt a little dry. I would recommend this course if you like set theory and logic.",
    "The material of the class is really fascinating,n particular the way in which the issue is approached and the critical thinking that comes along with thinking abut language. The p-sets are not too difficult but do take time and critical thinking. At times while it feels the p-sets don't completely align with the class the Professor is phenomenal and along with the TA (who was also very good) they were always open to helping and answering questions. The lectures could get a little dry sometimes but its not something that can really be controlled since not all semantics topics can be equally exciting. You will gain a new appreciating for linguistics and above all learn something you may not always get access too.",
    "Amazing! Semantics was one of the best choices I made for this semester. As a STEM person, I had to pick a fun and interesting looking So (social) credit. I had a friend who was sort of into linguistics which biased me in this direction and I read that this course was about the logic behind language, so I took it as my one fun class not really knowing what to expect with no background. This class not only provides you with great dinning hall conversation that is extremely accessible\/relatable (since every one else you are communicating with has language too), but also makes you reflect on the fundamental processes of our own language. It has left me with a deep appreciation and understanding of human language. Further, in one short semester, not only have we talked about many of the main problems in semantics, but I feel this class has prepared me to analyze most any semantic phenomenon on my\/read a paper about. Actually, one of my favorite aspects of the class was the last third of reading semantic journal literature. Very manageable Psets (easy for those with any mathematical inclination) and a fair midterm. The take home final is a plus. Professor Deo said on the last day that half of the material is extensions beyond what we covered, but accessible based on the concepts we talked about, yet, I actually found this section to be the most fun and interesting of the entire test. We were actually analyzing linguistic phenomenon on our own and I felt completely prepared to do so. On that note, professor Deo is amazing. Extremely accessible and very kind. She is ready and willing to answer any questions and will talk about semantics in great depth for as long as you would want. Grading: easy ; Workload: light; Knowledge: very cool! HWSNBN",
    "I would recommend it if you already have some experience in logic or linguistics. Without it, you end up spending 4-6 hours on the psets each week (not counting section and office hours) and getting a mediocre grade. A lot of the material is also very dense and uninteresting especially if you don't fully understand it.",
    "I thought this would be an interesting QR for a humanities person but it ended up being pretty boring for me. It's not a gut but the concepts aren't especially challenging\/stimulating either. Maybe I'm just not that interested in linguistics or just not as an academic field. But if you need a qr and can't deal with numbers, this might be the class for you.",
    "For a non-math student who is looking for a QR requirement I would not recommend this course. You're better off with a different QR class because this one requires you to learn new materials that most people don't have background in, as well as a whole new style of thinking. It is a pretty difficult class for someone who has never studied linguistics, first order logic, and is just looking for a passable QR. This class had a lot of grad students and linguistic majors so a lot of time was spent catering to their questions rather than those that had no background and were just trying to learn the material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Semantics to another Ling major, or to someone else with a passing interest in linguistics, but make sure that they had a good understanding of what to expect: the QR credit is not there for no reason, and the class does entail some pretty difficult hard logic.",
    "I would highly recommend this course, as it is a fascinating exploration of language from an analytical perspective. The class was entertaining and informative, and I was just continually excited by semantics. It is also the kind of subject that carries into everyday conversations!",
    "his course is super interesting, but definitely earns it's classification as a QR class. Professor Deo and Sara are both very helpful and the lectures are pretty interesting. I would recommend it if you have an interest in language. Just don't take it if you ONLY want a gut QR.",
    "Semantics is a GREAT class. I took it initially because it's a QR and I'm a humanities major, but it quickly became my favorite class this semester. Even though it's not super math-y, it's definitely challenging. Conceptually, it's very difficult, but also completely fascinating. If you're interested in language and meaning, you have to take it. Professor Deo is an amazing teacher. Her lectures are very clear, and the discussions she leads are great. The problem sets and the exams are tough, but she makes it easier on you in various ways-- for example, very good homework scores are rounded up to perfect, and the final is a take-home. Some weeks the problem sets went pretty quickly for me, but other weeks they took a while. One good thing is that the nature of the material varies a certain amount from more formal logic-y to more conceptual, so if one week you find the material really tough, then the next week it will probably be easier for you, and for somebody else it will be the opposite. So, if you're willing to take time to really think about the material, you'll definitely be glad you took the class.",
    "The work itself isn't TOO hard to do decently on; what's much harder is actually understanding the concepts deeply.",
    "As someone who came in with no knowledge of Linguistics the class was sort of challenging. It varies from week to week as you move through concepts (which don't always build on each other, so struggling one week does not guarantee you'll struggle the next) but it was generally mildly challenging. However, once you grasped a concept everything became clear and easy, so a lot of the difficulty is based on whether or not you have a specific type of analytical mind. The PSETs weren't always as clearly worded as I would expect from a class on semantics, and took between 2 and 6 hours each. Interesting, but not a gut for sure."
