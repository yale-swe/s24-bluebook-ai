   "comments": [
    "A great course for those who have a good background in Chinese but may not have studied it recently or could have become less confident. Would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "Hard but very rewarding and fun",
    "Chinese 130 is a good intermediate-level course that works on improving students' command of listening, speaking, and writing Chinese. I would recommend this course to students with a basic foundation in Chinese; however, if you have taken Chinese for a considerable amount of time (AP level or equivalent), be aware that the textbook was a little light on new vocabulary words and that much of the in-class instruction consists of repeating after recordings. Nonetheless, you will learn new grammatical structures and some new vocabulary, and some aspects of the class are challenging even for those who have studied Chinese for a long time.Overall, I would say that this class provided a solid review and consolidation of previous years of Chinese. Especially if you are a student who started learning Chinese at Yale, this course will be a good continuation of your educational journey.",
    "I would recommend it- it seems daunting at first coming back from a summer break, but you soon are able to get back in the swing of things. I am happy with the progress I made this semester. Also, tutorials are much much better this year than L1\/L2.",
    "I would totally recommend this class. You see your chinese improve immensely from the beginning of the class.",
    "There is daily work, but this is necessary to properly learn the material. Essentially, willingness to work correlates stronger than usual to grades in this class.",
    "Absolutely take it! I learned more in one semester of Chinese here than in four years of high school Chinese.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It is demanding, but very manageable. It is not a course to take if you just want to \"get by.\" You must put in full effort, but it certainly pays off if you do.",
    "Fairly formulaic class: constant stream of work, but as long as you keep up with it you'll do well. Some of the lessons are outdated verging on bizarre, but this leads to more interesting classes. Expect to discuss your ideal marriage prospect and what alcohols make you vomit.",
    "A typical language class with a lot of memorization involved. Yes I would recommend it to someone looking to improve their Chinese skills."
