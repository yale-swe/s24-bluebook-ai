    "Illegitimacy is an excellent course that is simultaneously mind-boggling and fun. Professor Wetters is excellent and I highly recommend taking any course with him. The discussions are free and productive and I feel like I learned a lot in this course. If I could go back and take this course again I would, and I would recommend it to any student.",
    "Take this course! The syllabus is really well-constructed, developing the intellectual genealogies of some important 20th century authors and themes while leaving students the room to explore their own interests in seminar and in the papers. At times classes wander unproductively and it feels like a day has been squandered, but it's worth it. Professor Wetters is an amazing teacher; he's enormously kind and thoughtful, and really takes your ideas seriously.",
    "Only if you have lots of background knowledge in critical theory and find those texts exciting.. Otherwise no..."
