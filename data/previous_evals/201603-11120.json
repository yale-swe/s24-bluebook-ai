   "comments": [
    "I learned about materials and techniques for making art and examining art. I learned about the similarities and differences between different types of art (e.g. objects, prints, textiles, paintings, etc) from a conservation and analysis standpoint. I developed skills related to observation and materials analysis of art, especially when it came to my individual project.",
    "Evaluating and examining art, with a technical eye.",
    "I learned a lot about the methods and materials that are used in the making of fine art by listening to how different conservators do their job. I think that my observation skills have really improved from this class after having to detect certain imperfections or areas that were restored. Also, by examining different art pieces in the art gallery, I became very interested in art history, a subject that I had never had much exposure to but am now considering as a major. Besides learning about the methods and materials, I was able to see what working as an art conservator would be like and what they deal with day to day. I really appreciated being exposed to art conservation, because it is always a process that is kept hidden from the average viewer."

   "comments": [
    "I thought this course was excellent. I liked the structure of having the weekly presentations and assignments during the first half of the semester and then working with our objects in the second half. It is so cool to be assigned an object to work with individually. I liked being able to meet and learn from all the different conservators.",
    "Course is perfect.",
    "The strengths of this class was that each material was taught by a conservator that worked in that field. Thus, all the information was introduced by someone who was an expert in that one specific material. I also liked that we were able to practice some of the skills that are needed for conservation. After lectures, we would apply what we learned through assignments, such as doing textile cataloging or analyzing two different prints of the same picture. I think that a weakness with the course is that some of the material may be a little too advanced for someone who is not exposed to chemistry. For example, I often found myself a little lost during lectures on plastics and acrylic paints because I wasn't able to understand the difference in their chemical compounds and the names of each type of paint.",
    "I think that the structure and time management of this course was the one thing that stressed me out. It was nice in the beginning when we had a different person come in each week and they had a concise message to convey, but then when we started working on our individual projects, it was very unclear to me what was trying to be accomplished in each class period. Even if it was clear that the day was for learning about IR or something, i didn't feel like I left the period knowing very much about it or what we had seen. I felt like often time was wasted when people were looking at an object but didn't really know what they were trying to see. If there had been more of a schedule about how long each person should get to use each of the tools that were brought in, i think that could have helped. Also, for the first half of the semester, it was much better when we could examine pieces for our assignments in the gallery on our own time and used class time to see the pieces that are not on display, because it was hard to schedule extra time for people to come in and look at those pieces."

   "comments": [
    "This is a really awesome course! If you are interested in looking at the materials and techniques behind artwork and in focusing in detail on particular works of art, I would definitely recommend it. The classes with conservators\/curators from different departments and the corresponding homework assignments during the beginning of the semester are really cool, and the project where you analyze your own object is even cooler. It is accessible to people of different majors\/backgrounds so if you are interested in the material but worried about not being a chemist or art history major, you should go ahead and try it anyway.",
    "Without a doubt I would recommend this course. This course was the best! It would lift my spirits for the rest of the week. The highlight of my semester. It was easier for those who show an interest in art and had some background making art than it was for students who entered fresh. If you are genuinely interested I am sure you too will find this course to be fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who already has some interest in art conservation or art materials. I found that the people who were already interested or had some knowledge of conservation were able to enjoy the class more, while those that didn't were just a bit more confused. If you are merely interested in art history, I would recommend taking a class that focuses more on history, because that wasn't really the focus with the class.",
    "This course is really cool because it introduces you to the inner workings of the conservation department at the YUAG, You get to see pieces being conserved and learn about the techniques used to examine them. It is a little disorganized, the work is interesting and manageable. You get to examine your own object and write about it and, if you work hard on it, it is a very rewarding experience."
