    "This class will challenge you in meaningful ways, while supporting you to move forward. It is designed to help you learn, and if you accept the goal, you will come away with a greater understanding of inequality in the U.S. Professor Maralani is incredibly kind, encouraging, positive, and helpful. Go to her office hours. Ask her questions. She's THE BEST.",
    "I would absolutely, absolutely recommend this course. You will have lively discussions, really interesting readings, and asked to be analyzed in meaningful ways.",
    "Inequality in America is an excellent, but challenging course. It involves quantitative sociology, which takes an adjustment, and the writing assignments every other week involve a lot of time. But the class definitely expands the way that you will think about inequality and how to address it. Professor Maralani is incredibly helpful and accomplished, making this a very worthwhile and rewarding class totake.",
    "It's a class about inequalities. Inequalities that you probably never knew was so rampant. It is a very insightful course. I recommend it! I learned a lot and it made me more aware of the problems that this country should focus on fixing.",
    "It's an interesting class that's never the same, but always probes you in different ways. You break apart \"inequality\" in ways that will make you more knowledgeable and confident in your view of the world\/policy.",
    "SOCY 314 is a class that analyzes various metrics of inequality and goes beyond just identity politics (ie gender\/race\/sexuality) and looks at how systems of inequality work and function together to reproduce inequality. Next step is to see how to develop policy analyses and look at the system for what it is instead of through a political lens.Definitely recommend this course; its a lot of reading, a big project at the end (20-25 page lit review), but so worth it. Amazing course.",
    "I would recommend."
