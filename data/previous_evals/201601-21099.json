    "3 psets, no exams. psets are algorithms you can find online so you don't ever go to class (i went the first day, that's it). a breeze when you don't have a pset due, when you do you panic and freak out. if that's your thing, (as opposed to never panicking for a class, which is rare, or panicking the whole semester, so basically almost every other class) take it. if u need a fifth credit, take it. if you want a chill semester take it. if you want an actual applied math or cpsc class, don't take it.",
    "take if you're ok with 3 moderately interesting numerical psets, no tests, no class, and a grade that'll be a total surprise to you at the end of the term.",
    "A nice, rare CS gut. Take it, don't feel like you need to go class, and go to office hours if you need help with the three tiny assignments you have to do. Oh, and you probably won't learn much.",
    "People need to STOP UNDERESTIMATING THIS CLASS. The math is PhD level stuff and Rokhlin blazes through it. If you don't know linear algebra or C, you're gonna have a bad time",
    "Easy CPSC credit."
