    "I learned about how to read problems and draw diagrams in order to best decide how to solve them. I learned about air quality parameters and methods of testing air quality. Similarly I learned about water and wastewater parameters and the treatment of water and wastewater. I learned about the basic chemistry that environmental engineers use to solve problems regarding acid\/base systems, kinetics, equilibrium, and more.",
    "I learned how to better manipulate units and work equations, understanding what they actually mean in a real-life environmental scenario, as opposed to just plugging into an equation. I learned real-life applications of environmental problems and solutions.",
    "Learned about basic chemistry, water quality, and air quality control",
    "A general overview of certain environmental engineering parameters and tactics.",
    "Good, comprehensive introduction to Environmental Engineering, as promised, along with the opportunity to discuss various current issues in the sector. The discussion on the Flint water situation was particularly timely, interesting, and useful.",
    "We covered topics of water quality, air quality, learning to assess acceptable standards for both and how to calculate pollution levels in both.",
    "I learned a heck of a lot!",
    "I learned a lot of the basics needed for environmental engineering, including principles and concepts of environmental engineering, different areas of the field, and relevant mathematical\/problem solving skills.",
    "I gained a much better understanding of chemistry and engineering concepts.",
    "Lots of chemistry so I'd suggest only taking if you have a fairly decent background in Chemistry.",
    "- Basic environmental engineering problem-solving skills - Information about general problems faced by environmental engineers",
    "Basic knowledge of environmental concepts.",
    "I definitely solidifed my understanding of chemistry and manipulating chemistry problems."

   "comments": [
    "Something I really liked about the class was how much class participation was encouraged. That made me feel more interested in the material. Also, I thought the ratio of math\/chemistry we did vs. learning about environmental problems such as air pollution and sludge was good. I also liked that we learned about a wide variety of topics. I wish the class had a section focused on alternative energy sources.",
    "The strength is in the teaching assistants and the lectures. The weakness is in the ability of the class to cover all of the material in the set amount of time. The material for the course was not always well covered in the textbook, and sometimes class time was not enough time to go through all the material we needed to know. This class would greatly benefit from having a weekly section.",
    "Psets are hard, but help is provided. Peccia is a great lecturer and the class is a lot of fun.",
    "The lectures were well-organized, though I felt like the examples worked out in class could have been more like the midterm questions.",
    "I would suggest more explanation of where the various formulas given come from and what the environmental goals are as opposed to the rote mechanical science.",
    "I felt like it was a good introduction to environmental engineering, prof peccia is a great professor, is generally pretty clear and also thoughtful about his assignments. the workload is very manageable. the TAs were also a huge help and went above and beyond to answer questions we had.",
    "very casual - I like that!",
    "The course was a great survey course in that it covered a wide variety of environmental areas with not a whole lot of depth. While most of the assignments and exams were pretty straightforward, I would have preferred if we were given practice tests or review problems for the midterms and the final rather than being told to go on our own and study off of previous homeworks and notes.",
    "strengths: professor was engaging weaknesses: problem sets often ties had mistakes that made them difficult to complete",
    "The textbook is helpful and so are office hours but I did find the course to be quite disorganised which led to confusion.",
    "Strengths-small class, caring professor, interesting content, great TAs. Weaknesses-some material confusing, long psets.",
    "The psets were spaced out well and tests were fair as we were allowed cheat sheets. However, material could be presented in a more engaging way and more real-world application to go along with the quantitative problem solving would have made the course better in my eyes."

   "comments": [
    "It is an interesting class, and Prof. Peccia is always entertaining. I would definitely take it if you want a broad overview of what environmental engineering is all about.",
    "Yes, I think the class was a very good introduction to environmental engineering, even for people who are not necessarily interested in pursuing a degree in environmental engineering.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course felt the most relevant out of all my courses of study. What I learned directly related to the world around me and felt meaningful.",
    "Great credit. Would recommend to everyone.",
    "Yes - would recommend. Interesting, comprehensive, and amusingly taught.",
    "yep definitely! even if you don't plan to major in enve but are just interested in environmental issues i think it's an interesting course that's a QR\/SC CREDIT",
    "it's fine.",
    "I would. Great course and Jordan makes the class much more interesting.",
    "yes, it was interesting and enjoyable, but difficult...definitely have to put the work in",
    "Great if you're a prospective EENG major. An okay science course for nonmajors, but not all that applicable or interesting if you don't plan on continuing environmental engineering.",
    "Definitely if you're considering a major related to the environment."
