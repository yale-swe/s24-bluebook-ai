    "it's wonderful",
    "Unfortunately, I wasn't able to attend many of the speakers due to class and meeting conflicts. Would it be possible to change the time to 6pm?",
    "very informative",
    "the speakers were good but the food was not",
    "This was a great opportunity to hear from speakers in careers related to health policy.",
    "It was good. I really liked some of the speakers. For example the woman from the Obama admin that spoke on open data and the woman from Mannatt.",
    "I liked the selection of speakers! I think the selection this year is a lot better than the selection we had in Spring 2015.",
    "I like this course but I felt like some of the lectures were above my level of understanding but the talks improved greatly as the semester progressed. I would have appreciated some reading material sent before the lectures. The instructor should consider providing us with a list of basic legal terms at the beginning of the course, just like she does in her Public Health Law course. This would really help international students.",
    "Interesting lecturers! Shelley did a great job of finding engaging and interesting speakers. I do wish there were more globally focused speakers.",
    "The class was great with many diverse speakers.",
    "Some talks were interesting, like the gun control and unite for sight. The overall feeling of the course seemed like an opportunity for the presenter to talk about personal experiences, and for us to listen and ask questions later, time permitting. It felt more like a career-services info session than a lecture, which I do not know if is good or bad.. Free food is a major plus."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Professor Geballe is too great!",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0I wish the instructor had shared with us more about her work. She is a cool lady that has made a lot significant contributions so it would have been fun to see that side of her. She does a terrific job at asking for our input and taking it into account for future speakers.",

    "Overall, the seminar is great for learning about applications and gives real world context of health policy.",
    "It's great!",
    "Great selection of speakers! On the whole, I really liked this seminar. One small note for future students -- the timing of the class was kind of frustrating. It met at different times on different weeks (i.e. some weeks noon, some weeks 5pm), so plan for that when you're putting together your schedule.",
    "very good",
    "it is useful and you should go to see all the speakers.",
    "I did not go to a lot of these, because they were 12-1 on my clinic day. I wish these were more sensitive to scheduling for people that have jobs and obligations. For example in evenings",
    "I would recommend checking the speaker list and coming to the lectures that are of special interest. I think this course has room for improvement but I appreciate having a course tailored to health policy students.",
    "Yes, it is a good opportunity to hear the many roads a public health degree can take one.",
    "It is mandatory, so go, for free food and to see where others have succeeded before you, and learn what you will from their stories."
