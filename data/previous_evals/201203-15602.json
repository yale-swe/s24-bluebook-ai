    "Take it!It's great.You have homework everyday, but it's simple stuff.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to a fellow student in a masters program like myself, because it is much too rigorous. So much of an evening can be spent on the busy work of this class and graduate students don't usually have time for that kind of stuff. However, if someone is really motivated and has some self interest in learning the language then it might be possible. I've only met one other student to go completely through a language course, I'll be the second in a while at my program, but its because it moves so fast.",
    "Italian 110 moved too fast for my personal language abilities, but if you are capable of picking up a new language relatively easily, then I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It's fun, and you learn a lot very quickly.",
    "The Italian department is wonderful. The workload is the perfect amount, requiring daily exercises and a weekly composition and test, but it is easy to fall into a pattern of doing the work. I enjoyed the class and my professor. From day one I was impressed by the department because they went one step further and divided a class of twelve students into two sections of six. This kind of individualized attention was constant throughout the course. Take this class!"
