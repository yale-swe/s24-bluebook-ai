    "Very good and entertaining course. Reviews many concepts that need to be seen for microeconomics and business in general and helps you understand them more. The cases are very relevant and the topic selection is as well. It has inspired on me a bew passion on social business in developing countries.",

    "you learn a lot",
    "Very good way of seeing economic theories being applied to contexts of developing countries.",

    "Excellent class for anyone on the public or private side interested in working in developing countries.",

    "This course gives a helpful introduction to the challenges of conducting business abroad, the economic rationales behind institutions commonly found in developing economies, and some of the reasons these countries face the problems they do.I would recommend it with the caveats expressed above about the sometimes perplexing\/poor management of the course.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in the subject matter.",
    "I wouldn't particularly recommend the course.",
    "Great course for those interested in the use of economics to further development and understand its impediments."
