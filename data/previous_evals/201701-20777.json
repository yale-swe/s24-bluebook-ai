    "Learning Italian through a variety of different tools, by translating short stories, poems, films and through conversation and thematic essays definitely helped me develop my Italian skills to a more advanced level.",
    "I think that there could have been more of a focus on grammar. Although it is an L5 course, having a unit on grammar revision (going over grammar points that the class commonly made mistakes on) could have been very helpful to the class as a whole."
