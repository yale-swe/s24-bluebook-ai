   "comments": [
    "Take this course. I don't know if it will ever be taught again, and even if it is it won't be as good as it was with Anya. But, hey still take it.",
    "I am not sure if this course will be taught again, but if it is, do yourself a favor and take it. It is extremely interest, enlightening, and relevant. I can't recommend it enough.",
    "This course covers some of the important issues in native american art, and connects them to native american culture as a whole. Classes can get a little dull and repetitive, but overall worth taking.",
    "TAKE THE CLASS. This course was very well organized, well-taught, and extremely engaging. The instructor gave a very accurate portrayal of the class during shopping period -- it was a true introductory course (many intro courses at Yale are actually much more advanced than they claim to be) that focused on art issues while still including other skills typical of an art history course. The content is extremely important and engaging and truly relevant to everyone. Anya is an incredible instructor -- out of all the professors I've had at Yale, she has exhibited the best pedagogical practices in her classroom. She engages individually with each student, offering support at every step of the way. Her passion and extensive knowledge about the subject matter shines through in every class meeting, and her ability\/patience\/willingness to work students through their gaps in understanding is really valuable, especially in an ER&M class.",
    "Absolutely recommend. One of the best courses you'll ever take at Yale. If you've never taken an ER&M or Art History class, this is the one. If you have, take this one anyways because you will learn things you never knew.",
    "This class was one of the best I have taken at Yale, and I'm a second semester senior. All of that was due to Professor Montiel. She used the art we studied as a way to connect all of us to broader Native issues that would have been harder (at least for me) to understand in the abstract. She was always encouraging of every voice in the classroom, and brought such a happy, warm energy with her. She clearly cares a ton about her students - always going the extra mile to help us out. Oh, and I learned a lot too! Before I started this class, I don't think I could have named a single Native artist. Now, if you asked me my top three favorite artists of all time, I would say Joe Feddersen, T.C. Cannon, and Allan Houser. Turns out there is an entire world of incredible art that I had never been exposed to. How sad would it have been if I went my entire life without experiencing the beauty of Feddersen's Tire, or Cannon's Self Portrait in the Studio? I am so grateful to Professor Montiel for opening my eyes to all of these incredible artists, as well as the conversations that inspired their art. I look forward to continuing to seek out Native artists\/art in the future.",
    "This class was a fabulous opportunity to study Native American art, a subject that is not always offered. It gave a great introduction to both artists and political themes. I appreciated its approach to modern subject matter, beginning in the 20th century. This was important in combatting many stereotypes traditionally held about Native American art. Anya is an incredibly generous and knowledgeable instructor, one that I would highly recommend taking a course with!"
