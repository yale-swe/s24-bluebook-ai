    "Definitely take this class if you want to learn Portuguese. Not super difficult, and yet you feel like you learn a lot over the semester.",
    "A thorough, beginning Portuguese course. Yes, I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn beginning Portuguese.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student already familiar with another Romance language. Without a basic understanding of Spanish, I would not have succeeded in this course. Even with 12 years of Spanish, it moved pretty quickly, so if you don't have a basic understanding, you will have to compensate a lot throughout this course. Other than that, this is an interesting language that is less of a workload as other Yale languages. I think immersion is the best way to learn a language."
