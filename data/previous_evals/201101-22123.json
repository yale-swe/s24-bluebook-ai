    "Take it! The lectures are occasionally long and rambly, but the material for this class is incredible. It's one of the few classes at Yale with a reading list that thrilled me. This material has literally reshaped the way I view this country and its exciting and devastating history.A more appropriate title for the course would be: \"Blowing to Pieces Preconceptions of US History.\"",
    "I would recommend Formac if you are looking for a fun, laid-back class to take. It's not a lot of work and lecture is always decently interesting and fun.",
    "Really cool and interesting class. Professor Jacobson is a great lecturer and will keep you entertained. Get to watch funny videos, clips from movies and music videos, old ads, etc. It's a fun class to go to, and not that much work. There's a weekly mandatory section, two 5 page papers, a midterm, and a final. You pretty much read a book a week, but you don't have to read the books in depth, skimming is fine.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone in the market for a general survey course of modern American history. However, it's important to realize that since we cover a lot of ground, there are a bunch of gaps. Jacobson's style is to hit a few key people and especially influential movements rather than smear politics\/economics\/society through all decades. You zoom in on Janice Joplin, Jimmi Hendrix, Muhammad Ali, with full books or lectures showcasing these people. There's a bunch you don't cover, like the space race or the Cuban missile crisis. But the professor is excellent and really chill, the assignments aren't hard, and the class never drags over the semester. I enjoyed it and I feel like I got something out of it, and I never wanted to miss one of his lectures (don't be daunted by the 75 minute mark, he shows a lot of media).",
    "I think I would have gotten a lot out of this course as a freshman or sophomore. As a senior, it was pretty much concepts I'd covered in twelve other classes before...",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class. It's really interesting, but it's a lot more political and racial then the course description would have you believe.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I loved the class, it's a cultural overview of major movements in American Society from just after the first world war until today. It's very different from AP US in its emphasis on culture and change rather than people and dates.",
    "This class was incredibly interesting. Jacobson's use of different cultural forms in his lectures ensures that this class is unlike anything else, and I would recommend it to both american studies majors and any other student who wants to understand how our culture has evolved to where it is today.",
    "AMST191 was a relatively easy, fun course. There are lots of movie clips, photos, and songs presented during the lecture, and the readings (a book a week), while generally engaging, are not necessary. This is a good fifth class, as its material (the history and culture of the US since the 20s) is relevant, familiar, interesting, and presented in an easy-to-understand format, while there is almost no work (two 5-page papers on the historical and cultural significance of a photo\/event\/book\/etc., midterm and final exams) to complete.",
    "This is a very basic summary course. If you are looking to be challenged by new ideas about culture and theory, don't take it. The lectures often reinforce common perceptions, or misconceptions, about history, and don't make you engage deeply with material or your mind.",
    "Take ForMAC. It's an amazing class. It truly changed my perception of American Culture. A must-take if you care anything about 20th century American history. From the Harlem Renaissance to Bill Cosby, Janis Joplin to Madonna, Frank Sinatra to Bruce Springsteen, it's an amazing look at how popular culture both reflects and influences American politics.",
    "Great class, definitely worth taking. Not an overwhelming workload and you learn alot.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who is a non american studies major wanting a taste for amstud at yale",
    "It was a very interesting class that I highly recommend to other students. You learn so much.",
    "GREAT course. You are missing out if you don't take Formac with Prof Jacobson. This course convinced me to be an American Studies major. Never boring, always interesting. Do yourself a favor, and take this course.",
    "YES!! EVERYONE NEEDS TO TAKE THIS CLASS. One of my top 3 favorites at Yale. Seriously do it, you will learn more in this class than virtually any other. I've never had so much fun doing reading or writing papers in my life, true story.Oh and if you take this class YOU HAVE TO TAKE SECTION WITH ANDY HOROWITZ. Best section I have ever had at Yale, and most likely will ever have. He made the class for me, seriously get into his section if it's the last thing you do. He makes section really fun and interesting - it's everything a section should be: helpful, fun, and engaging.",
    "Great gut class. The lectures weigh more heavily towards trivia than analysis, so they're pretty much unnecessary to attend, the rest is common knowledge.",
    "I'd recommend it...it's fairly low key, lectures are interesting or at least entertaining, and Professor Jacobson makes a lot of unexpected connections that really change the way you look at cultural objects.",
    "This is a GREAT COURSE! We looked at twentieth century American historyas cultural critics, meaning, for example, we talked about The Wizard of Oz in our study of gender arrangements and listened to Hendrix in our study of the Vietnam War. Even though this is definitely a fun class, I learned more about U.S. History in ForMAC than I have in any other class in my life. I have also picked up new skills--the ability to historically situate and then analyze cultural products, even ones I would not have thought twice about before (e.g. Rambo and supermarkets). I would recommend it to ALL students, whether they are looking for a \"fun class\" or a class in which they can really learn a lot.",
    "ForMAC is a really fun class for anyone interested in 20th century American history. The lectures cover various narratives of the time period through a cultural lens- if you like watching movies, listening to songs, and analyzing ads, I think you'll enjoy this class. Professor Jacobson, although sometimes pretty liberally biased, is a great professor and makes the class really fun. If you have a good section, the class becomes even better. Overall, I would highly recommend taking this class!",
    "I would summarize FORMAC as a history course focusing on the reasons why American society has developed as it has in the last 90 years. Not date-heavy, this class focuses more on the ideas that were prevalent at a certain time and how they impacted the culture of that time. I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone - the lectures are always interesting, the reading load isn't too heavy (a book a week, but they're pretty light reading), and it really does force you to look at things around you in a new way.",
    "Definitely take this class; it is one of my favorites of the classes I've taken so far at Yale.",
    "Yes for sure. If you're interested in America or america culture definitely take this class.",
    "I would recommend it as an introduction class, after having taken more focused classes in the American studies major the class was a little repetitive.",
    "This is absolutely one of the classes you must take before you leave Yale. It's like attending a fascinating lecture series twice a week, led by the brilliant and theatrical Matthew Jacobson, and you'll only be graded occasionally with very easy short essays and tests. You'll learn to look at American history from a completely different perspective, spend a lot of time watching fun movie clips and music videos, and ultimately do very little work. This class is a winner.",
    "Yes yes yes!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class! It's the best class I've taken at Yale. Every lecture is engaging and you walk out seeing the world differently. Professor Jacobson is a phenomenal lecturer. If you do the readings you'll get more out of the class but doing all of the readings fully is not necessary.",
    "The class is a cultural analysis from 1920-2011. It is so interesting and I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. The outside readings are interesting, the lectures are FUN to go to, and Professor Jacobson makes the material fascinating.",
    "take it credit\/d. some of the lectures can be useless but Jacobson is a cool lecturer.",
    "Yes. Take it. Seriously.",
    "YES. Even if you don't do the readings (if you're taking it Cr\/D\/F), lecture is so enjoyable and informative. You'll get so much out of it if you take it seriously, do all the reading, and study for the midterm\/final exam, but even if you don't, you can't help but learn.",
    "Take this class. You are CRAZY not to. Whether you are a reactionary conservative or a full blown socialist, you will feel differently about America after taking this course - if anything, it will force you to challenge all of your assumptions, and teach you to view the culture industry in a totally new way. Professor Jacobson is amazing. Just YES.",
    "FORMAC's gonna give you a thorough grounding in cultural studies by examining the interplay between history and culture throughout the 20th century and before then. The readings are all awesome (especially the book that Jacobson actually wrote), and the lectures are super interesting and fun. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Definitely take the class, doesn't matter what major you are, you will love it",
    "Yes, definitely, if you have some background in basic American history but are interested in learning more about American culture.",
    "This is a class that helps you understand and conceptualize the world about you by looking at things that are not commonly seen in history books. I would recommend this class because of the material and because the professor is one that is very good at what he does.",
    "TAKE IT. Such a good class, the highlight of my semester. Professor Jacobson is fascinating and class is actually fun to go to. 2 papers, midterm, and final.",
    "Formac is awesome! Definitely take it. Learned a lot about our culture and how it reflects historical social trends.",
    "Highly recommend it. super interesting content and professor jacobson is awesome.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. There is a book a week to read, two 5 page papers, a midterm and a final. It is really not a lot of work and the material is really interesting and presented with great insight. Did you ever know that the song \"This Land is Your Land\" is actually a protest against the wealthy of society? Professor Jacobson is engaging and also chill. The lectures include songs and video clips in every class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend the course. It's a different way to look at American History from WWI to present. While it doesn't deal with so much dates as eras, you learn an incredible amount about history and more importantly, the environment that bred that history.",
    "It's a really interesting take on American history from the 20s to modern day. While it's presented in a blatantly liberal light, the material provokes interesting and nuanced ideas that you don't find in a normal, fact-based history class. I would recommend it to another student who is interested in the untold stories of history.",
    "This class will be frustrating to you if you've taken a lot of social history classes, but I would recommend this class highly to underclassmen without that kind of background.",
    "Yes. It's a really fun class in which you learn about stuff you wouldn't necessarily think to question or learn about. Jacobson is a fun and entertaining lecturer. And most of the assignments are actually fun to write.",
    "Great class, I recommend it to all students, not just AmStudies majors. It gives you a completely new appraisal of American History and explains dips into trends less covered in traditional courses. Lectures are fun and interesting and the work load isn't too bad. Take good notes in class.",
    "Awesome. take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. I learned so much about our history and culture as well as a new way of looking at the past.",
    "Great class. A must-take at Yale.",
    "really awesome lectures. the readings were dumb - as in i didnt read them and did well in the class. but really interesting classes.",
    "Take it. Definitely.",
    "This was absolutely, by far my favorite class that I have taken at Yale. The material and content of the class is interesting and relevant, and Professor Jacobson's lectures are always engaging and thought-provoking. Everyone I know who took this class has come out of it with a more complex, contemplative understanding of our modern day society, and the ideas that you learn are easily and truly applied to everyday life almost subconsciously. Having said this, I attended almost every lecture and did all the readings, and I still had to work my tail off in order to get a good grade. My TA, and from what I hear, the other TA's as well, was a tough grader, and the class requires original insight and and understanding of the concepts; simple memorization or minimal effort will not serve you well. Professor Jacobson is kind of an unorganized lecturer, and he covers a huge amount of material in a very short time, so if you miss a lecture it can be hard to catch up. The readings are supplemental sources and will not aid in learning the concepts. It is definitely a class that requires effort, but, for me, a student who is not usually this enthusiastic, it was genuinely fun and interesting, and I will miss attending the lectures and learning from Professor Jacobson.",
    "Amazing class. If you're at all interested in cultural history you'll get a lot out of it. It made me reevaluate the music, television, and film that I've been exposed to throughout my life.",
    "ForMac is one of those classes every one should take. I highly recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's great!",
    "It's SO good. It's definitely changed the way I think about things that surround us in every day life.Also, if you're interested in learning US History, but most history classes don't really do it for you, ForMAC is fantastic. I learned and retained so much more history by looking at everything from a cultural perspective than I ever did in a traditional US History course.Basically, take it.",
    "It's a class that makes you think in really interesting ways about American culture and realize things. Sometimes it's sort of annoyingly obvious, or feels like a stretch, or like you could say anything and it would be right. But the work is definitely manageable.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone. Whether you are interested in American Studies or not this is a class that will interest you because everyone is effected by the development of American Culture. Profesor Jacobson is an amazing lecturer and will have you thinking about everything from commercials to Presidential speeches in a whole new way.",
    "Take this class, regardless of your major or academic interests. This may be the best class I have taken in my life.",
    "ForMAC is an awesome class! It makes you rethink every cultural icon, looking at influences back to the 1920s. You have to go to lecture and section, but both are definitely worth it. Lecture with MJ is fun and will keep you awake, and section will allow you to review and analyze those books you have to read every week.... The books aren't too bad -- time consuming, but you don't necessarily have to read the whole thing. There are 2 papers, about 5 pages each. These are actually not bad to write and your TA may let you send drafts in early. One midterm, one final, nothing too crazy. Take it!",
    "I would TOTALLY recommend ForMAC to another student. It was a fun overview of twentieth century cultural history. Professor Jacobson's lectures were fascinating and his powerpoints provided a great combination of images, clips, songs, etc... Each was a multimedia experience and that made lecture a lot of fun. The books we read were good and provided different viewpoints on diverse topics. Some were novels, some photography, some non-fiction, some biographical. Overall it was well-balanced and a fantastic course.",
    "This class was great. Not very difficult (I probably did about 1\/4-1\/2 of the reading, and even that wasn't necessary to do well, although you should do the reading, because it's awesome), and very fun. Where else do you get to analyze Lady Gaga or Bill Cosby academically? Also, Jacobson is a very engaging lecturer- going to lecture was like storytime, with music, dance, movies to watch every time we went. Not the most intellectually engaging of classes, but if you're looking for a chill and fun 5th credit (don't take this class Credit\/D\/Fail, you'll end up with a fine grade as longas you GO TO EVERY LECTURE), this is an excellent choice.",
    "This class is incredibly engaging, largely due to the lecturer, Matthew Jacobson. He makes the material very fun and relevant, tying history into contemporary life. The material taught in class was pretty general,though -- it's more of a broad overview of history from 1914 to present day.",
    "A really great overview if cultural history in the twentieth century. I never took the APs in high school and so the newness of the material may be affecting my opinion, but I thought it was a truly great class. One of the few best I've taken at Yale and always enjoyable because of professor Jacobson. Big recommendation.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload involves a book a week, 1 midterm, 2 papers, and a final. Almost all the readings are interesting and enjoyable to read and the essays are very open ended, so you can pursue what interests you. In all you learn a great deal in this class and is definitely worthwhile.",
    "I have recomended it to friends. I said it was the cultural context of the history of the past one hundred years.",
    "Take it, it will change the way you think about the America\/the world in an interesting and non-scary way.",
    "Yes! Do it if you want to reevaluate how you see yourself in relation to your country.",
    "A wonderful class. Don't leave Yale without taking it as every citizen should know the information presented in class to better understand the world. Professor Jacobson is wonderful. TAKE IT!",
    "A very interesting course in modern American history. A really great class, shouldn't be missed. Not too much work and shouldn't be too difficult to get a good grade in, but if you really want to do 0 work andreading, can take it credit\/D and do absolutely fine.",
    "Wouldn't recommend. Just really got to be kind of boring, no one does the readings (there is too much for a person to reasonably do).",
    "formac is a history class analyzed through cultural texts.",
    "I would recommend another student to take the class, but only if they have some knowledge of modern American history. Without this knowledge, taking the class might be a struggle because it would be hard to order the events chronologically in one's head.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class to a fellow student. The readings are a lot to keep up with but the class is completely worth it. Jacobson incorporates so many different forms of cultural media, some of which I was unfamiliar with, some which I was familiar with but he talked about from a different perspective. This class will really get you thinking about the influences around you. I walked away from this class asking questions of my own experiences that Jacobson would prompt us with in class and essays.",
    "a very basic introduction course. take if you're a fresh\/soph thinking of being an amstud major (or just want an interesting humanities class), or if you are a junior\/senior looking for a very easy amstud class. interesting\/sensationalist\/entertaining, but you won't learn very many new things if you've taken other amstud classes about the 20th century before. also, be prepared to be frustrated with lecture sometimes - jacobson is a smart guy but the way he addressed (or failed to address in nuance) topics like civil rights, women, lgbt\/queer history, aids, etc was infuriating at times.",
    "Great class! Jacobson is super interesting and the lectures are entertaining!",
    "An amazing course, definitely one of those courses that everyone should take.",
    "Great! Take it. Not too hard, interesting material, and hilarious lectures.",
    "Take this class. It's fun, not a ton of work, and really interesting. Jacobson is a really great lecturer too.",
    "No, it just wasn't particularly interesting. The name of the class makes it sound cool but it wasnt",
    "Definitely",
    "HIST 106 is a great course for students who have a background in U.S. history and who wish to learn more about cultural products and analysis. The workload is doable--the course has two five-page papers, a midterm, and a final exam (in-class or open-note take-home) and Professor Jacobson assigns a book a week for reading. Though a book a week may seem difficult, the reading is understandable, enjoyable, and relevant to the material covered in class and offers students with the opportunity to analyze yet another cultural product. The main goal of the course is for students to learn how to perform cultural analysis and in order to succeed, it is important for students to regularly attend sections and complete readings. This will help when they are asked to analyze films, music, etc. in papers, midterms, and the final exam.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. There is some reading to do but it is not really necessary to do. Two short essays which are very easy. The midterm and final are easy too. It is a very interesting and relevant course.",
    "FORMAC is a introduction to the American Studies discipline through the lens of American cultural history. I would definitely recommend it to another student: it will fundamentally change the way you view this country.",
    "Absolutely take it!!! I remember now what it's like to be getting an education, and how sweet it is! I hope to learn from professors like Professor Jacobson for the rest of my life. What a transformative experience. American cultural history is fascinating.",
    "Really fun class. Not too difficult. Prof. Jacobson is a great lecturer too. Makes a great 5th class.",
    "Yes, if you want to take an awesome lecture this is it, especially for people who don't know too much about recent American culture.",
    "Take it! It's fun and not that hard, but you'll learn a lot and reevaluate most things you see on tv.",
    "Maybe.",
    "You take an in depth look at culture since the 1920's (but also before that) and analyze it based on previous historical evidence and the previous, current, and post reactions. I loved this class- I had never before looked at America so in depth and through such a unique lens.",
    "Highly recommend!! I feel so comfortable in my ability to talk about modern American history and the ways that it impacted everything from movies to music to lunchbox designs. Such a cool course, definitely take before you leave.",
    "I\u0092m a science major with very little interest in history, and I thought this was a great course. The first half before the midterm covers a different decade every week and looks at major historical events through a cultural perspective by looking at songs, movie clips, book excerpts, etc. Jacobson\u0092s lectures are interesting, and his powerpoints are very visually engaging thanks to all the clips and such. Make sure you get a chill TA because otherwise your grade will suffer (there are two papers, midterms, and final so they control half your grade). Also, be prepared for the course to stagnate and deteriorate significantly after the midterm. You\u0092ll be stuck covering the 60s and 70s for most of the second half of the course, which can get annoying. Overall though, solid class and not too much work.",
    "This class provided an interesting twist on most American history classes because it looked at each period through elements of pop culture. Prof. Jacobson has the best multimedia slides that I have seen at Yale--every session had a mix of film clips and songs. However, it was this mix of media and lack of reliance on traditional textbooks that also made this class frustrating at times. The reading towards the end of the semester seemed random, although having a book per week wasn't bad because they weren't dry academic books. It was hard to prepare for exams because so many film images and clips were presented during the semester that it was hard to know what to prioritize. I'm not sure that I learned much more about American history in terms of raw information, but I do feel like I know about some more pieces of pop culture.",
    "Take a ForMAC before you leave Yale. This one was good, but I hear Agnew's is better.",
    "Take it. Its interesting and a good introduction. If you want depth, or if you've taken a number of courses in American Studies, remember this is a INTRODUCTORY SURVEY CLASS and you're going to get a very light dusting of new knowledge if you have past experience in the major.",
    "I would recommend this if you want an easy lecture class in cultural studies. It will either change how you think about the world or give you fun bits of trivia.",
    "Take this class. It's beyond worth it.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Formac is a really interesting survey of important societal trends from the 1920s on. It focuses on how culture can be used to understand these trends and how it influences them. I would highly recommend this course because, while at some points it can seem far-fetched, it really does change the way you look at and understand the world.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. it's a great class for freshmen.",
    "This is a class which analyzes the formation of American culture starting on the eve of the 20th century. You learn everything (well, almost everything) that happened in the 20th Century. It's a great class to take if you want to learn about American history and pop culture - we discussed the depression AND Lady Gaga. What other class can do that?!",
    "It's a great class that if you attend the lectures (which is a MUST - the powerpoints online offer NO information) you will easily do well in.",
    "If you love learning to look at the world you interact with in a different light, take this course! Professor Jacobson is an excellent professor, and he always has something interesting, intriguing, and insightful to say. Be warned, though - you will never see your world the same way again. After taking AMST 191, you'll start to notice the different cultural contexts in which our world is situated and the discrimination and exclusion that often goes along with it. Overall, take this course if you love watching movies, listening to music, reading awesome books and you truly want to learn!",
    "It's a course that looks at a comprehensive American history of the early twentieth century to the present, most specifically looking at the ways that cultural and artistic modes of expression can illuminate that history. I would, and have, recommend this to everyone at Yale. I think as far as lecture courses go it is one of the best options at the school, and is relevant and potentially fulfilling and entertaining for any student in America today.",
    "A survey of major themes in American history from the 1920s on, AMST 191 focuses on a few specific (yet important) recurring\/overarching ideas and pushes them throughout. Jacobson is a great lecturer and although he always has an agenda, it is usually an interesting and worthwhile agenda. Not at all a hard class, and the reading list is interesting."
