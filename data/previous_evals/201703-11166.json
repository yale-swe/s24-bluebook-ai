   "comments": [
    "The course offered a comprehensive introduction to the vocabulary, syntax, and grammatical features of Old French, namely through close-reading of Yale ms. 229. The seminar focused on reading proficiency, while supplementing our work with the original manuscript with grammatical overviews (both from the textbook, and weekly handouts).",
    "Now I can read Old French and I learned a little about medieval France.",
    "I learned to read Old French prose as well as the rudiments of verse. I learned quite a bit about the traditions of romance and fabliaux literature. It was also good practice for reading Gothic handwriting in medieval manuscripts.",
    "I learned the basic grammar and orthography of Old French, granting me the skills to sufficiently bridge Modern French to the Latin from which it filiated.",
    "A grounding in reading Old French and a working knowledge of medieval French literary genres and themes.",
    "I gained the ability to read and comprehend medieval French and improved my ability to decipher older styles of script and lettering. The course also provided me with many insights into the linguistic, cultural, and literary history of France in the middle ages.",
    "As this was the first class I have taken on Old French, I acquired vocabulary and grammar I had not previously possessed, including an understanding of the irregularity of Old French, which is absent from modern French. I also gained a familiarity with the script in Old French manuscripts, which I expect will allow me to read similar styles of writing in future research. I learned about courtly love and its literary conventions, the Fabliaux, and 13th-century conventions of copying manuscripts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course was excellent; my one suggestion might be to foreground the materiality of the La Mort Artu manuscript itself, perhaps with a trip to the Beinecke.",
    "All the brief moments of teaching from professor were so interesting. I wish they had come more often.",
    "I think that the greatest strength of the course is its in-depth study of a text, since the students were able to learn the style of a single author very well and thus develop a facility with the language. However, its greatest weakness is probably the lack of diversity of texts studied, as every class but one focused on the one text. Students might benefit from reading somewhat smaller selections of a few different, but related, texts. That way language study can continue in a steady but challenging fashion while also introducing students to different styles of writing Old French or the different dialects used, even within the same genre. I think that the class would also benefit from reading the Old French text aloud individually before translating it, rather than Professor Bloch always reading the Old French. That being said, I felt that the course was a very good introduction to the Old French language and its literature.",
    "The strength of the course is also its weakness. The professor puts students on the spot, having them sight-read a manuscript whose orthography is quite hard to decipher. This isn't bad, but it is a bit insensitive to students who do not like being the center of attention.",
    "There was perhaps too much focus on translation--it would have been nice to spend more time on literary context and history.",
    "I would enjoy more opportunities to discuss the literary aspects (structure, narrative, etc) of the text we are examining, in addition to working on translating it.",
    "I found this course very straightforward. The goal was to acquire knowledge of Old French and I successfully did so. I walk away from this course with enough knowledge to interpret unfamiliar Old French texts and with vocabulary that has already proven useful in reading 16th-century French poetry. It might have been useful to look at and translate more examples of Old French manuscripts in order to have a richer knowledge of the manuscripts that existed alongside La Mort Artu and the Fabliaux and to become better practiced in reading different handwriting."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes-- regardless of your period of specialization, reading knowledge of Old French and a diachronic understanding of the language is crucial.",
    "If they needed to learn Old French, sure.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student who is interested in medieval literature in general or in medieval romance and fabliaux in particular, whether or not they are a student of French. I believe in the importance of reading literature in its original language if at all possible. Even someone who is interested in other genres, such as Old French song lyrics or poetry, would find this course to be of use. I would not recommend it to a student who does not have any background in French or a closely related Romance language, however, as the learning curve would be very steep.",
    "I would, although I personally took the course to satisfy a distribution requirement.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot, and the professor is brilliant.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student seeking an introduction to Old French."
