   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, but make sure they knew that it would entail a lot of hard work and dedication. It won't be easy, but if you try to get help and work with your fellow students it'll work out well.",
    "I would recommend the mathematics 120 course for a student who either loves math or needs it for a distributional requirement. It may be me personally, but I don't really enjoy this type of class..",
    "I heard a lot of bad things about intro math classes at Yale, and I found this one to be much more bearable than I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d been led to believe. I took it after not having taken math for a while (I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a junior, and took BC calculus my senior year of high school). That definitely made it more difficult, but if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in the same boat as I was and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to re-take the concepts you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve already learned, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be scared to start in 120. You can always drop down if it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work out. Lots of resources available for help \u00e2\u0080\u0094 use them \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and Slava was a good teacher, in the scheme of what I saw during shopping period. Bear in mind that, for this semester at least, he gave weekly quizzes on Friday which were very hard. He also tends to pull out some crazy-seeming concepts that other professors don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go over, but they often eventually proved useful.",
    "Math 120 was a good course for those who like math for the sake of solving math problems\/applying algorithms, but it was a bit lacking in visible practical application. I would recommend Math 120 for a student who lives and breathes mathematics, but I would hesitate to recommend it for a student who, like me, has simply liked math for all of his\/her life and hoped to continue an interest in math. That being said, it could have just been my teacher in particular that somewhat negatively affected my experience.",
    "YES! Great class. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is taking\/going to take physics. It would be also more interesting for someone going to continue studying maths or sciences."
