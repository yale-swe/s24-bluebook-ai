   "comments": [
    "If you're a musician without theory knowledge, take it. It won't be too difficult and you'll get a lot out of it.If you have never read music before, this is going to be fast-paced and a lot of work.The class goes over a little bit of a broad range of topics including ear training\/aural skills\/basic dictation as well as written theory.",
    "Music 110 should be taken by students that have some knowledge in reading music (played clarinet in middle school band etc). You don't have to know how to sing or play an instrument currently. We basically learn about scales, major and minor, and inversions. How to recognize what you're listening to. It's a great class, I'm glad I took it.",
    "MUSI 110 is your bread and butter for music. It covers all the basics, from reading music, identifying pitch, and simple rhythmic and melodic dictation, to an introduction of elements of more formal theory, such as roman numeral analysis and modulation. I would definitely recommend this class if you have any interest in music theory, or basic knowledge about music in general. It's a lot of fun, not a lot of work, and you learn tons! TAKE THIS CLASS! You don't every really need to study for tests, and it really helps improve your musicianship.",
    "It really is a beginner's intro course to music. It covers from the very basics of music--how to draw a treble clef, how to read the notations, etc--to harder topics like harmonies, Roman numeral analysis, minor scales, etc. Take this course if you want to read music or know how music basically works. In the end, we get to compose a simple form of music. For me, other students in my class were pretty experienced in music so we all composed quite sophisticated and nice-sounding pieces.",
    "This class discusses the foundation of music theory. I would recommend it to any student who wants to learn about the technical side of music, whether or not they are a musician.",
    "MUSI 110 is a good class, introducing you to music with theory, composition, and listening exercises. Erin is fantastic--if you can, take it with her! One word of warning: if you already have played an instrument for a while, as I have, and know inversions and intervals, it might be a good idea to try to place into 205 so that you don't get bored."
