Having her host a tutorial session was very beneficial to my learning, as this was my first time experimenting with the LCA software. It would have been nice for the TAs to be more engaged with the students on a regular basis. For example, there were many times that assignments were due in class that weren't mentioned by the professors and it would have been helpful for the TAs to send out a reminder."

    "I think the link between professional practice and industrial ecology theory needs to be bridged. However, overall, the class is a great introduction to industrial ecology, and I hope I can work to build that bridge to professional practice myself.",

    "I hope to learn more comprehensive in LCA.",
    "I guess my only comment would be regarding field trips. It's a real shame we don't have any during the whole course. I believe it could be really interesting to sum up some field trips that are related to the topics that are covered along the course.",
    "I feel there was a disconnect in this class between the lectures and the out of class assignments. Rarely was a reminder given regarding an assignment's upcoming due date, and there never seemed to be much of a follow up discussion for the majority of assignments. For example, the only mention of the five page research project update assignment came at the very beginning of the class when all assignments were being outlined. When the actual due date rolled around, it had never been mentioned again in class, and the only place it could be found was buried in the syllabus. Most of the teams discovered the assignment was due only a day or so before the due date, and by the time we received feedback on what we turned in, we had already needed to move forward with the project the way we had outlined in the assignment. For the MFA assignment additional instruction was required by nearly every student in the class, yet the response from the teaching team was inadequate. After spending over ten hours on the assignment, I don't feel much more capable of utilizing the spreadsheet that was provided or performing an MFA than when I started the assignment."

    "Discuss the class-exercises\/homework after completion.",
    "The assignments for the course could have been better integrated to allow for deeper learning. For example, the in-class debates were interesting, but they would have been more beneficial and interesting if the lecture following the debate picked up the threads from the debate, or if the instructors provided feedback on the content of the debates during class to foster class-wide discussion. In terms of the other assignments, the critical review assignments I felt were somewhat pointless; the Material Flows Analysis assignment was interesting but did not give students a real grasp of how to conduct an MFA from scratch; the LCA assignment was too basic to give students any sense of what a real LCA is like; the data analysis assignments were cancelled for whatever reason. I feel the assignments should try to give students more deliverable skills, with more guidance on the part of the instructors.",

    "Great idea, but the commitment from client should be more clearly understood prior to the start of the project. In fact, starting the project earlier than currently would be the best way, because these projects are huge endeavors.",
    "The group was unevenly allocated. I was in charge of most of LCA part, which I think other members shall also be given a chance to practice with. There is also a communication issue and hard to balance everyone's opinion.",
    "The class project was amazing, and I learned so much from doing the project (as much as the class lectures, if not more). It was an incredible experience to work with a real-life waste management company and observing how things work on the ground. Some disadvantages were that at times it was not clear what exact value we would bring to the client other than act as market researchers, and how we would apply industrial ecology concepts.",
    "I enjoy group work generally, but my group was very small (3 people) and I ended up doing a disproportionate amount of the work. This is by no fault of the instructors, however maybe there should be a process for checking in on individual efforts.",
    "It's been a great experience to work with amazing colleagues. The only issue is the difficulty we have in setting a time to meet, since we are always very busy.",
