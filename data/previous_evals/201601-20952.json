    "Since you have to take it for the major, make sure that you are going to office hours for pointers on problem sets and exam study. It will help you focus on the relevant material (not all of it is necessary for the exam). Lack of materials to help study can be a pain, so office hours are your only tool (no problem set solutions posted, no study guides, no practice questions or exams, and textbook has no solutions or answers to problems). It may seem like an overwhelming amount of material at times, but once you can get it all together its fairly simple and all relatable.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the topic.",
    "1 ASTR 310 is a wonderful class! Prof. Kenney is a great lecturer (a few people disliked him, but they all agreed that he is a good lecturer). If you are a major, take it because you have to. If not, it is reasonably advanced, but I would take it as -say- a Physics elective. NOT a gut Science credit, in case you are wondering. HOMEWORK -- weekly-ish psets that were helpful and doable. Not longer than a few hours per week. Also, grading is fair. EXAMS -- both the midterm and the final covered very well the course, so they were both long and fair. Study your notes, the psets and the slides and you will be fine. LECTURES -- I personally found them very interesting. The course covers so many things, from formation of galaxies to AGN to timescales of clusters and stars, that you will be glad you took it.",
    "ASTR 310 is full of content you will learn a ton about the composition, evolution, chemistry, morphology, kinematics, and interactions of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Kenney is a fair and good professor, and has a knack for explaining concepts in an understandable way. My main complaint was the book, which was nowhere near rigorous or specific enough and made the otherwise-simple p-set problems hard to even start. Yet even working around the book, if you go to lecture its not too hard to get a hold of the concepts and equations you need for the course."
