   "comments": [
    "Systematic look at the components that shape agriculture, from ecological components (soil science, hydrology, plant physiology, climate change) to social science components (ag policy, supply chain actors, alternative ag systems).",
    "Some technical background on science related to agriculture",
    "-I built more comfort (though certainly not complete comfort) with reading technical agricultural literature. -I built a more informed understanding and critique of the role of technical science in agricultural practices and the food system. -I built an in depth understanding of my choice for my local geography project - The San Francisco San Joaquin Delta Region, which was fascinating!",
    "introductory knowledge into supply chains, intro to how environmental non-profits work.",
    "During the course I gained much knowledge of agricultural science and built a holistic image of the factors in the agricultural system. I also practiced skills in specific geography analysis and offering advice for NGOs.",
    "Two general areas: 1. biophysical\/chemical scientific background, especially of soils & plants, which was new for me; and 2. the experience of 'going back to basics' and learning as much as I could about new (to me) subjects straight away. While my knowledge is still very basic, I think I did learn quite a lot, in a range of areas, and the work of figuring out how to jump in to content so different than what I've been focusing on was a good and enlightening challenge. One thing I really loved was seeing connections between processes happening in this course, and things I have been learning about in my coursework at the Div school -- reflected especially in how we talk about science\/how we read or consume scientific publications.",
    "This course covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time. We learned about the various aspects of agriculture systems and also considered alternate knowledge systems and approaches to ag. One of the skills developed in this course was synthesis. Writing the weekly precis on an aspect of ag required an intense amount of synthesis, and I really appreciated that about this course.",
    "A better sense of the landscape of how scientific literature plays into agricultural work. Better understanding of some of the theoretical landscape for thinking about food systems. Experience working on client projects.",
    "The first half of the course focused on the more technical issues with agriculture's impact on the environment. The second half explored supply chains and the role of institutions and scientific knowledge. Our individual assignment enabled us to explore the course material in a specific location. The group project was somewhat of a consulting arrangement with a nonprofit and provided some useful, real-world experience.",
    "Scientific literacy into the multi-disciplinary field of agriculture and environment - modules included water, plant physiology, soils, supply chain, etc. Very useful for being able to understand specific issues in those fields, and to be able to talk to the specialists in those fields.",
    "Some technical knowledge.",
    "Good basic overview of different scientific concepts that exist in the space Good overview of actors Good chance to acknowledge the complexity of a system",
    "Basics of agriculture and the environmental implications of it - Technical knowledge on soils, plant physiology, crops, etc. - Knowledge of agriculture in one specific region - Climate interactions with agriculture - Social and political implications and relations to agriculture",
    "A more technical understanding of different forms of agricultural processes in the 21st century."

   "comments": [
    "Closely",
    "Somewhat, but would have liked more hands-on opportunities to look at soils and analyze different growing systems",
    "Pretty well",
    "eh, thought we would learn a little more about agricultural production and supply chains. It was more so a very broad surface overview of many topics, not deep enough.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class was same as my expectations.",
    "My expectations were exceeded. I had come into this course mostly with a sense of curiosity, kind of expecting that if I learned more about the world from a natural sciences perspective (and learned more about learning in new ways), I would deepen and broaden the insights and learning in the religion & ecology coursework (which is often primarily philosophical\/reflective, more than physical or concrete). This certainly occurred, but I received much more than I expected, too. The range of backgrounds and interests represented in the room made for good discussions which, while they were sometimes contentious, I felt were highly appropriate to the educational experience I was seeking.",
    "Very well.",
    "It fit well with my expectations overall. The type of grounding in agricultural science I wanted more or less lined up with how it went was presented in class. I was also glad to work on the client project.",
    "I did not expect this class to focus so heavily on abstract concepts like the role of science and institutions. I also thought that we would learn more about existing solutions or approaches to environmental problems in the agricultural sector. Instead we focused on the problems and how we might manage them.",
    "Very well - the above is what the course was described as, and its what we got.",
    "Low",
    "Pretty well, could've used less theoretical arguments on discussions in the agricultural world",
    "Medium level",
    "I wasn't really sure what to expect, but found myself with more knowledge about tile drainage than I ever expected to have."

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Instructors (Prof Mark Bradford and Stephen Wood) were very open and willing to receive feedback along the way and tweak aspects of the course that weren't working as well. Weaknesses: Instructions for the individual geographic projects was often unclear, particularly in the beginning of the semester for the first few weekly assignments and the in the end of the semester for the final assignment.",
    "I would have liked to do something more hands-on on Wednesdays related to what we learned about on Mondays (ex: analyzing a soil sample or modeling a hydrological flow). It felt a bit abstract sometimes, and I wanted to learn more about how to apply the material we learned. Maybe a case study applying the ideas we learned about. I appreciated the scope of what we covered, including the social aspects of power. This was an important aspect to include with technical material, and I think in most FES classes these issues are segregated. Lectures were useful and interesting.",
    "Strengths: -Professors open to feedback and change -Relevant guest speakers from Yale sharing different perspectives and expertise -The local geography project as a way to integrate technical knowledge -In the second half of the semester, we had some really great discussions. Weaknesses: The local geography project ended abruptly after we put a lot of work into it. I think it would be great to integrate this into the group project, or to create some kind of final recommendation based on the work we've done. Perhaps this could be due before spring break so as not to overlap with the group project.",
    "I think the instructors did a greta job in reframing the course during the mid term evaluation. I believe the list of concepts was too ambitious for the format and that this course could have been divided in two 2-credit courses, one focused on natural science and one on social-political science.",
    "dove too deep into scientific articles that 1 day was not enough time to digest and fully understand before discussing it.",
    "Strengths: very clear expectations & organization, engaging lectures on a wide range of topics all set up to be accessible to intro-level students (me!), welcoming of non-FES students (also me!). The value-framework material toward the end of the semester was, in my opinion, extremely relevant and well-placed. I don't know where else FES students get to talk about those issues, but I was glad they came up here. Weaknesses: I felt like the organization broke down a little bit near the end of the term, just regarding the group project expectations. I'm not sure what would have been better -- maybe if we had made time for each small group to check in with professor(s)? It's hard to say about weaknesses because I was happy to learn everything that was coming up in the course, even though I'm sure there's also a ton of other things we could have talked about. I didn't have an issue with how the course was being run before the mid-semester feedback opportunity, but I appreciated how the professors responded to & integrated that feedback in the second half of the course. I guess one thought is: I sometimes felt like the course was trying to cover too much ground for the time it had, once the group projects began taking more space. I think the group projects could probably be organized a little differently to flow better within the course -- that said, again, I thought it was all valuable, even when things were frustrating or not seeming to work easily.",
    "Individual projects were great - I thought the format was well-designed, I loved writing a bit each week about a topic I cared about that cumulatively created a legitimate work product. Many of the reading assignments were often overly technical to the point of being unhelpful. Wednesday discussions were overly structured and forced and required someone in the group to get up and present information - nobody wants to report-out on a group discussion in a \"presentation\" format - it's not a great way to practice public speaking skills, and the students don't like doing it. Wednesday discussions were always a drag. Group projects were a disaster. Make small groups (of 2-3, self-chosen) or let people submit something individually. Group work is really tedious in graduate school, it's really hard to coordinate, and nobody has anything enough on the line to make deliverables really count for anything valid. Working with other people can be really challenging, and a huge hurdle for learning. Also TNC is notorious for not engaging with students - our engagement with TNC during this project was a 60 minute video-conference with some pompous man with a beard and long hair who basically just pedantically described the summary of everything he knew about the subject. No clear direction. It was comically obvious how much this person liked the sound of his voice and the thought of lecturing a group of grad students about the kinds of work he does all day. Good projects need strong leadership and management - that certainly didn't come from TNC, it didn't come from Mark or Steve or Rachel (don't think it's their responsibility), and nobody in the group wants to be that person or has the authority to do it.",
    "The Wednesday role play during the first half of the semester was not useful. I appreciated that the instructors took the mid-term evaluations into account and didn't continue that for the second half. The client projects also could've benefitted from some additional oversight.",
    "As we've discussed throughout the semester, I struggled some with the discussion format for the first half of the semester. I liked the more instructor-led discussions in the second half of the semester better, and also thought the ones that focused on a specific real-world case study went well. Lectures were a strength overall, both from instructors and guests. Some of the guests got a little specific in their field of study and could have used a bit more contextualization with the rest of their field.",
    "I think this is perhaps two interrelated courses. The first half of the course could have easily been explored in more depth for a whole semester. The second half of the course was a little too nebulous for me although it did challenge my perspective and introduce a few new concepts. I enjoyed the lectures and individual assignment in the first half of the course. The in class activity changed halfway through the semester in response to student feedback and ended up just being discussion. We had some interesting discussions about complex issues, but I felt like these weren't structured well enough to prevent students from proselytizing and talking in circles. The group project had a lot of potential, especially because we were able to work with real organizations, but it was not well organized and we didn't have enough time. We also didn't get any guidance on how to work with our groups, engage with the client, and write our reports.",
    "does not deep dive into topics, only glances over them as weekly lectures have to cover the broad subject range",
    "Strengths - making you use the information from the scientific papers in exercises, even though we didn't 100% understand them fully. But I do think that's a realistic representation of what goes on in the real world - scrambling to read a paper, then trying to make use of it. Weaknesses - the evolving nature of the course. The structure kept changing throughout the semester, mostly for the better, but it was sometimes hard to adapt.",
    "We started learning a lot of techincal aspects on ag but quickly deviated from that into confusing discussions.",
    "Strengths: Mark Bradford, opportunities for professor-led discussion, systems thinking approach, HW schedule with readings after the first learning day (avoided the problem of class just being a reiteration of readings), client project Weakness: Steve, geographical assignment in combination with client project and weekly readings (didn't allow for enough time for depth into each part)",
    "Very interesting content but sometimes it was assumed certain level of previous understanding of the topic. It would be good to create a strategy to cover first the basics. Sometimes the topics got really technical that the main point of the lecture-discussion was lost.",
    "I thought the intention was wonderful: provide a more robust technical understanding of agricultural processes in a school where most students are familiar with the social dimensions. Even still, conversations trended towards power more often than I thought was helpful. I could see both Mark and Steve listening very hard to student feedback, and doing their best to cater the experience to these voices. However, I would have almost liked them to listen less and tell us more about what they were thinking about what they know."

    "If you're interested in agriculture on any level, I recommend taking this course. There are few ag classes at FES so take advantage of this one.",
    "Good overview of important science related to agriculture. Not a food systems course, as it doesn't address issues of distribution or access. A good blend of technical and social aspects of growing food with an opportunity to get client-facing experience.",
    "If you are interested in agriculture and are willing to dig into the technical literature even if that's not your thing, I think you will get a lot out of this course.",
    "have quite a bit experience in Environmental NGOS",
    "To a Div student I would say, try not to silence yourself in this course -- it's designed to be accessible even if your background doesn't already include these topic areas, & your perspectives and questions, while they may seem out of place or overly basic to you, still are legit (and probably give voice to underrepresented perspectives in these fields anyway, esp. in classroom settings). Don't be afraid to let this (communication especially) be part of the same work you're doing up the hill.",
    "Worth taking if you would like to gain more detail on how to apply science to agriculture.",
    "This class provides a good overview of environmental problems in the agricultural sector. It is a new course, only taught twice, so the professors are still working out the best way to structure the content and assignments. They are responsive to student feedback.",
    "Take this if you want to gain scientific literacy into the food, agriculture, and environment world.",
    "Make sure they are better organized.",
    "This was the first time this class was given, and there is a lot to improve but it was a very good class. The professors are very open about feedback, so if you take the class give constructive comments.",
    "Pick a very specific agricultural region early and commit if they are still doing individual projects."
