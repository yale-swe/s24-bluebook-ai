    "Time in class was usually fun, even if the readings were often boring. I took the class because I thought an English major ought to know how the novel evolved from its beginning, but it doesn't really make sense to have a class about the 18th century British novel without reading any Fielding. Fielding kept coming up in conversation, too, but we hadn't read any and thus couldn't say anything about him. But Wendy Lee is engaging and tells great stories and is pretty smart. She's one of the better teachers I've had at Yale, actually, in the way she runs class discussions. I just wished at times that they focused a bit less on rehashing the plot. The workload for this class is weird: There are basically no assignments (just a fairly short and not terribly involved final paper) except for the reading, which is heavy. On the whole, I don't regret taking the class at all, even if most of the readings besides Austen were not so thrilling.",
    "The course was wonderful. It is a lot of reading, but the books were really great and Professor Lee tries very hard to keep in mind that we are busy students taking other classes; she never gives more reading than she thinks she really needs to. And at the same time, we only had two essays for the entire course, so the bulk of your work is reading. You learn a lot and move through 100 years of literature in England and it gives you a wonderful picture of how the novel developed over that time. But you really won't get much out of the course if you aren't prepared to read an entire 400 page 18th century novel over 3 classes.",
    "There's a lot of reading, but you don't really need to do all of it. I'd recommend taking this course if for no other reason than Professor Lee. She really is the best.",
    "Definitely take it. It's a great pre 1800 and you'll learn to care about books you thought were irrelevant\/boring.",
    "If you like to read, definitely take this class.There is not very much writing, just a lot of reading. However, Wendy Lee is fantastic and makes the seminar a lot of fun.It is a great pre-18 course in the English major as well because it focuses on novels as opposed to verse.",
    "Take it. One thing to note is that you won't actually read much Austen in the class, which disappointed me. The other stuff is fun to read though.",
    "I really can't recommend this course highly enough. I'm pretty sure it has changed (for the better) how I read and think about everything. Wendy Lee is the coolest. The 18th century novel is so important. Just take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It's the discussions and Wendy Lee who make it very fun and interesting. Sometimes the reading isn't spectacular, but you learn a lot about how to find significance in these earlier, pre-novels by Richardson, Burney, and Ann Radcliffe. The best part is when Wendy Lee \"re-enacts\" the scene - she's so funny and knows the novels well!",
    "I think this class could also be called, \"Creepy Guys, Secrets, and Awkward Carriage Rides,\" so definitely take it.",
    "This course will give you a good rundown not so much on the 18th century novel in general as on the \"chick lit\" (BUT NOT REALLY) of the 18th century - it could sort of be subtitled \"How did Austen become Austen, and why is this important?\" The readings are fun, or when they aren't fun (Pamela, Clarissa), the class has fun complaining about them together and then Professor Lee makes you understand why they're still relevant and important. Great discussion, good professor, take it. Excellent pre-1800 option!",
    "Yes -- if you are interested in the development of the novel or of how relationships between men and women are discussed in literature, take this class.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Lots of reading, long long books, but totally worth it. It's amazing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course. For the most part, it has a fun reading list, and Professor Lee's personality allows you to appreciate the material even more."
