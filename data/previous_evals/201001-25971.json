    "Really a fantastic class. Definitely recommended. Barbara Mundy is the best teacher I've had at Yale, the material is really interesting, and you will learn a lot about a culture and world very different from our own and very rarely given the attention and praise it deserves.The four day trip to Mexico City also really made the class great, you get to see everything you've studied and explore an awesome city. All and all, one of the best classes at Yale hands down.",
    "I couldn't recommend this seminar more highly. It is a shame that Professor Mundy was only here teaching this course for one semester.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would strongly urge another student to take this class. What began as a course to meet my outside field requirement became a new interest I plan on pursuing further, as well as my minor field for my orals (hopefully). It was empowering to learn an entirely new field, and to work so harmoniously with other students."
