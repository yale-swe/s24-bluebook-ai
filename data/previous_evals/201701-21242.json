    "I entered this course wanting to better my photography skills and left with so much more. I found my love for photography again, challenged myself creatively, and grew personally. I couldn't have asked for more.",
    "This class really expanded my photographic eye, reintroduced me to pushing the limits of my skillset, and exposed me to incredible photographers, exhibits and opportunities to engage in the art world. This class is really different every semester depending on the incredible visiting artists and exhibitions that we go see. The biggest highlight was going to Haas to see the portfolios of past MFA students.",
    "I further developed my technical photography skills, experimenting with medium format and becoming stronger at printing. The real growth I made was in developing and discovering my own aesthetic, both in my own work and in the work of others.",
    "I feel my eye and my ability to talk about my work have really improved while taking this course.",
    "I learned to see, to really see. I think we often assume the visual medium is self-explanatory, but there's a lot of value in learning to analyse photographs, to think about how to frame reality.",
    "I was able to learn a lot in this class. We learned to use a variety of medium format cameras. We also learned how to scan film. We able to study a variety of photographers from modern times and history, and were able to create consistent personal projects with guidance from Lisa and our TA."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this course and have feel it is exactly what I needed and wanted it to be.",
    "I really enjoy the critiques and the hands-on learning. A large part of the course is both developing and discussing our opinions about photography. I enjoyed using the medium format. I might have liked a workshop on long exposures but that's easy enough to figure out on my own. Class time always felt useful and valuable.",
    "Really great class, no big changes, except maybe make the first crit earlier",
    "This class is that it is as hard as you make it. While even the minimum amount of work requires a lot of time in the darkroom, the looser class structure means that you can do as much are as little as you want. The class had a wide range of how hard people were working and the type of work produced. A strength of this course was the variety of class material. We did everything from look at graduate portfolios to attend weird lectures. This loose structure made it easier for everyone to get what they wanted out of the class. That said, it would be nice if Lisa was a little stricter on when class started. That way we would have more time for class."

   "comments": [
    "YES!",
    "If you are committed to being pushed to work harder than you ever have in photography I would take this class! You cannot just skate along with it. Its really important to be dialed in at all times.",
    "If you are interested in photography and in pursuing it more seriously, I would highly recommend it. I found the entire experience to be very fulfilling and rewarding.",
    "Absolutely and without reservations. Lisa is the best.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I got so close to my classmates, I got to meet amazing artists, and visit a bunch of different places on campus like the film studies center, the study gallery at the YUAG, and the MFA photo books.",
    "Yes! This is a great class that lets you build on the basics of photo 1 and explore different types of photography in a new way."
