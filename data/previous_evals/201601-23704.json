    "Absolutely if your arabic is good enough.",
    "I would summarize Arabic 161 as an awesome learning experience and a great way to gain a deeper understanding of Arabic literature. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's interested in an advanced Arabic course. Professor Aziz is great and he makes the class really interesting. It was an overall positive experience and helped me become an even better Arabic reader and a more sophisticated writer.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. I thought that the material would be too much for me, as a non-native speaker, but Professor Aziz is patient and we ended up reading an entire Arabic novel, which is not something I felt like I had the capacity to do before taking this class.",
    "A reasonable amount of reading in Arabic, and a lot of religious allegory. If your want to improve your Arabic reading skills tremendously, but are not afraid to put in some hard work, this is a very rewarding course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend ARBC 161.",
    "A very solid Yale Arabic course. The workload is challenging (50 pages a week) and the final paper is difficult, but class discussions are generally fun, and you do end up reading an entire novel in Arabic, which is pretty cool.",
    "This course was interesting and helped me gain an appreciation for Arabic literature. Professor Aziz teaches from the heart and adds to the material from his own knowledge. It was very informative and helpful to have him expand on the various stories we were reading-- he would teach us grammar, culture, idioms, etc. that were related to what we were studying.",
    "It's a cool course because you get to actually read an entire novel in Arabic, which I think is a pretty awesome feat, but the seminar meetings were really a drag. We never discussed the book as much as I wanted, and spent a lot of time on pretty low-level plot description and vocabulary."
