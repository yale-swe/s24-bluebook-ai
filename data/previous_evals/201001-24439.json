    "Of course you should take it if you get in; Crowley is brilliant and tons of fun, and it's a great chance to write for an audience, which is rare at Yale. Your experience with the class will largely depend on who else is in your class, as so much of it is workshop-based, but it's definitely worth taking, and I definitely think I've improved as a writer throughout the semester.",
    "Intro to Fiction is basically a standard short-story workshop. Your work is split two ways:1) Writing Short Stories of Your Own: Over the course of the term, you are expected to write at least three new short stories. You can write about anything you want, any way you want, even any time you want (you get to decide which weeks you want to volunteer a piece for class discussion). Crowley doesn't specify how he long he expects your stories to be, but he does say, \"the longer, better.\" By that, he doesn't mean longer stories are superior to shorter ones; he is just saying that the more content you produce, the better a writer you will eventually become.2) Reading Your Classmates' Stories and Providing Written Comments: Each week, three or four people will submit stories to be discussed by the class. They post those stories on the Classes v2 server a few days before class. Everyone else reads the stories and provides written comments as a \"reply\" to the posted story.Every now and then, John Crowley assigns famous stories to be read for class, or gives out short little exercises. These are fun, and not much work.On the whole, this class is great. First, you get to meet other writers, which isn't always so easy to do. Second, you get to write and have it count as schoolwork! Since John Crowley doesn't place any creative restrictions on you, you can really apply all of your creativity to your work, without having to worry about satisfying some sort of rubric.",
    "This class is amazing. I would recommend it to anybody. Even if you think you can't write stories, this experience will elicit them from you if anything can.",
    "In ENGL 140, students spend most of each weekly class session discussing their classmates' writing. Prof. Crowley also discusses a few important concepts in writing fiction. I recommend the course. Everyone's writing improves perceptibly over the three stories you write in the semester, and most likely some of your classmates will be writing great stuff. Also, although Prof. Crowley discusses terms you first learned in junior high, his observations are always unexpected. He is a thoughtful writer, and he has really insightful things to say about both theory and practice in fiction.",
    "This is a very good introduction to crafting short stories.",
    "Absolutely yes. If you can manage to get into a writing seminar at Yale, specifically one with John Crowley, then take it.",
    "This is a workshop class, so much depends on the quality of the other students. The application process, however, exists to ensure that those students are talented and it succeeded admirably for my class.This class can be really wonderful if you dedicate yourself to it, and put thought into it, and try to make sure that you aren't cranking out stories the night before they are due on very little sleep.Ultimately, the effort you put in determines how much you will get out, so the most I can say is that there really is something to get, and it really is worth investing.Also, pay attention to Professor Crowley's comments. He is very perceptive."
