   "comments": [
    "It's a science credit. You probably won't enjoy it.",
    "Silly class, not actually \"an issues approach\" for the most part either, but not too hard.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in how biology and society interact.",
    "Very interesting class and doesn't get too sciencey until the third part. Speaking of the third part, it was very different from the first two. Lectures were presented differently and the exam was harder. But other than that, I really did enjoy the class and the material. Good overview of science without getting too much inthe detail",
    "This is a good class for non science majors who need a science credit.",
    "Do it if you want a light work load, science credit that really provides you the flexibility to engage with new and interesting topics. Issues is better than Natty D.",
    "For a non Science major this is the way to go.",
    "OK, not great.",
    "Really glad I took it- it covers current issues you should probably know about (agricultural biotech, genetics, infectious diseases). Make sure to go to lecture and pay attention and you will do well.",
    "Good easy science course. Not much work, midterms are easy, and the final paper was simple enough.",
    "Yes! I was reminded of my high school biology and also learned about how these big issues, like global agricultural or specific global epidemics, affect society. We also learned of some solutions. It is a great science course for social science or humanities majors.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially to people who are interested in biological issues that have environmental and global effects. The professors are all really engaging and the readings are interesting.",
    "Take this course. Not difficult, not too much work and there's actually interesting material to be learned.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they needed a science credit because it is an extremely interesting class, especially if one has an interest in biology. The work is extremely manageable, and you learn things that are highly applicable to everyday life. Overall a good course.",
    "Its a goodclass if you need a science credit. I do not think there is a better class out there for non-science majors.",
    "I would recommend it if the topics in the syllabus interest you. If you actually put effort into it, you will understand the three modules, but if they are not of interest to you, it'll be a waste of an opportunity to dabble in the sciences."
