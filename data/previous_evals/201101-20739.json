    "I would strongly recommend CHEM 564. It was a very interesting course and a great change of pace from other classes. Learning about engines, how to weld, how to repair an engine, and how to employ other machining techniques was very rewarding.",
    "After taking Chem 564, you will be able to glue metal effortlessly together, construct with steel like its paper and glue, and look at broken engines as toys instead of disasters. It's awesome. Have fun!",
    "This is a great class. The structure varies from year to year, but from what I can gather the approach to working on an engine is pretty much the same. You learn how to solve problems that can occur in an everyday work environment that pertains to working with heavy machinery, and you gain a sense of what it's really like to work with your hands. I recommend this course to anyone who asks about it."

    "I use the techniques I learned in Dave's classes on a regular basis. As an Engineer, prototyping is a key part of my work, and I learned much of the required techniques from Dave. Because these techniques are not a part of the standard undergraduate curriculum, I often find myself the fabrication goto guy in Engineering projects. In all modesty, without this class and the preceding one, my capabilities would have been severely diminished and so, by extension, would my teams' capabilities have been."
