    "A wonderful intersection between psychology and law. Definitely recommend",
    "Extremely interesting class if you are interested in law and the psychology behind criminals and the processes and phenomenons that take place in our justice system. Not too much work and the class lectures are very interesting.",
    "Its a cool course and you'll learn a lot of interesting stuff about the criminal justice system and it's relation to psychology.It feels a little general and directionless at times -- like you're just learning a bunch of kind of cool trivia -- but at other times it actually has some really good material that makes you question a lot of stuff we currently do in the justice system",
    "Interesting stuff but not presented in a very capturing\/intriguing way",
    "Definitely take it! It's a really eye-opening course that really makes you take another look at the legal system and helps you see how applicable psych is to is. Dr. Lockhart is a fantastic lecturer! She's very enthusiastic and explains things in a very matter-of-fact way that makes them interesting and easier to understand. The coursework is not hard, the readings are for the most part, VERY interesting. Two papers, and two tests and you get all the possible questions for the test in advance.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. DO NOT BE DECEIVED - LECTURE IS BORING, EXAMS ARE GRADED HARSHLY - NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS MADE OUT TO BE DURING SHOPPING PERIOD!!! BEWARE!",
    "It is a great class and i've learned so much from it!",
    "You should take it if you're interested in the legal system. However, it is predominately a psychology class if anything.",
    "Phenomenal course content and definitely changed my understanding of our justice system. That being said, exams were really frustrating to study for. Questions handed out ahead of time so it seemed like if you put in the time you would be fine, but it turned out there were very particular answers the professor was looking for and it was hard to mind-read what these would be. Was my favorite class this semester but unfortunately will be a sore thumb grade-wise.",
    "Good Psych class that doesn't require a lot of work. As long as you study hard for the tests you will do well.",
    "An interesting class for those wondering how psychology can be applied to high stakes scenarios. They expect a lot out of you, though, so be prepared to work hard.",
    "I would recommend it to psych majors and those expecting to go into law",
    "If it's a lecture again...only if you're really interested in the material.",
    "PSYC330 is a survey of psychological topics used in both legal proceedings and in identifying and detaining criminals. The studies and topics are all really interesting, and show just how prevalent psychology is in our everyday lives. If you're interested in psychology, law, forensics, or all three, definitely take this class. The reading's completely (or near completely) optional as well.",
    "Very interesting. Tests covered A LOT of material.",
    "Psychology 330 provided a very interesting lens through which to look at the legal system and the role of various psychological factors.The course covered many areas, from juvenile justice and child witnesses, to psychopaths and patients with mental disorders. The work load was very manageable, and the two papers were very interesting and enjoyable to write. One paper involved going to the New Haven Court and was a very interesting experience. The midterm and final both required a lot of preparation because you had the questions in advance, but this meant that there were no surprises on the actual exam. Although the lectures could get a little repetitive and boring at times, and felt somewhat disorganized, the class was overall interesting and worthwhile.",
    "Terrible class, don't take.",
    "This is a GREAT class--not too stressful, fascinating material that will really make you more critically examine our legal system, and really fun lectures. I highly recommend this course--you can't lose! It's amazing!",
    "Do not take this class. It is interesting subject matter taught incredibly poorly and inappropriately.",
    "Cool topic. But Idk if I would recommend it - Maybe?",
    "yes very interesting material. exams are difficult but working on cases is interesting, worthwile. work in a group and prepare a lot in advance.",
    "There are both positive and negative aspects to this class. First the positives: It was such an interesting class. I took this for the sake of getting a social science credit and I really enjoyed what I learned in this class. Professor Lockhart is a great lecturer and knows how to make her lectures entertaining so that everyone stays focused to some degree. Also, there are only 2 papers, a midterm, and a final, meaning this class only takes up time outside of lecture a few times during the semester. However, with that comes the negative aspect of this class. The papers themselves are manageable, but the midterm and final are incredibly unreasonable. You are given a set of questions, half of which will randomly show up on the exam, and you have a week to answer the questions and memorize their answers in order to prepare to answer them on the exam. Each of those questions took hours to answer because it was difficult to find the material in the readings to answer them, and even then the answers themselves were really long. On top of that, you barely have enough time during the exam to write everything you need to in order to get full credit. So be warned, this class is great except for the midterm and final, which are just too time-consuming to prepare for in the midst of other midterms and exams that you would also have to study for.",
    "It is a very interesting course!!!! Just be prepared to keep up with all of the readings.",
    "Harsh grading for midterms good class besides that.",
    "Yes!",
    "This class was perfect: fascinating, held real-world implcations that I saw in the news media every day, and a very reasonable courseload. NOt too much reading, tow short writing assignments. The only issues were the midterm and final; they were very fair, since Kristi gave us all the possible questions ahead of time, but they both involved a hel of a lot of writing. Perhaps too much for one sitting.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in learning more about the criminal justice system and how psychology comes into play. I would highly recommend! The midterm and final were kind of hard, but we got the questions in advance. Lectures are interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes. You must take this course if you want to understand anything about society.",
    "Psych and law is an extremely interesting course, and will change the way you look at the legal system. Professor Lockhart is an engaging and enthusiastic lecturer who makes class enjoyable. The course has a few flaws, though. You get the essay questions for the midterm and final a week in advance, but they are extremely long, and it basically comes down to who can regurgitate their answers the fastest on the day of the exam. The period around midterms and finals is very stressful but the rest of the course is enjoyable. Go to the courthouse for your final paper! It's a great experience.",
    "The midterm and final are brutal. Be advised. Incredibly interesting class though.",
    "I would definitely recommend Psychology 330 to another student. I found the lectures engaging, the exams and papers enjoyable, and the material highly relevant and interesting. The exams took the form of issue spotters, a common formula on law exams, but often unfamiliar for undergrads. Be sure to talk to the professor or your TA before the exam so you know what they're expecting as a lot of students did not realize what they wanted from the exam. On the whole it was an excellent class.",
    "Good content but not a great class. 2 five-page papers, one midterm and one final. The material isn't hard, but heavily based off of lecture. The lecture is often unorganized and redundant. The cases and studies are interesting, but presented in a very obvious way. This class was probably better as a seminar. Take it if you are a psych major and need a fifth class.",
    "A very interesting course integrating psychological concepts with the justice system--I'd recommend it for everyone as the knowledge is applicable to all! The course is not too heavy and extremely rewarding and entertaining. That said, it's not exactly an easy course and there is significant work required, especially for the exams, but this reinforces the material you learn and it is definitely worth it looking back.",
    "Fun and interesting course material. Easy to follow with straightforward papers and exams.",
    "Keep in mind that in Fall 2013 this was a 119 person lecture course in Davies-- the format of this class changes from year to year.The professor is fantastic and class is enjoyable. The material is usually very interesting. The assignments (papers) are great and not too lengthy. I went to the New Haven court house and got to see a murder case. Mixed feelings about the exams; the essay questions are given to you a week ahead of time, but take a considerably long time to prepare and memorize. There are basically cases or situations that you have to analyze and answer questions based on what you learned inthe class. Thus, readings are somewhat optional although apparently pretty interesting. Overall, a very solid course.",
    "Interesting but overall worthless. Content-wise it would be a great credit d, but the structure of the class makes it difficult to rationalize, since you need to write the papers and prepare responses for the midterm and final. The grading was surprisingly strict. It's not a ton of work, but for the amount you learn it's way too much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It covers lots of interesting topics in-depth that are only mentioned in passing in related news reports (e.g. racial weapons bias).",
    "This is one of my favorite courses out of the ones I've taken at Yale because of the comprehensive assignments, engaging professor, clear lectures, relevant material, and overall quality. You do need to study for the tests if you want a decent grade, but luckily the test questions are given out before the test. Success is entirely dependent on the amount of preparation one is willing to do. I sincerely enjoyed this class and I learned a lot about the American justice system (both how it functions and its history) and about American society (how both facts of human psychology and societal factors like racism and definitions of justice affect how the law is carried out.",
    "PSYC 330 is a great class on the ways in whih psychology plays a role in law. It was exactly what I had expected, and subject matter that I loved. If you are interested in criminal justice at all, or just want a fun class, take it. It is not, however, an easy class. You have to go to lectures.",
    "Not much work till the final where you are expected to memorize every single detail you've learned and spit it out in essay form...good class but if you need an elective take a seminar instead",
    "Prof Lockhart is nice and entertaining and the material is cool and interesting but hopefully she figures out how to teach it lecture style. Right now there's just TOO MUCH MATERIAL to memorize for the midterm and final. This was the first year as a lecture. Hopefully she will respond to evaluations and it will be as great as it was as a seminar again.",
    "An interesting class that ends up being a lot more work than it is made out to be. The exams don't seem to be too difficult, but end up involving an overwhelming amount of memorization. Some aspects of the class are interesting (you get to visit a courthouse), but lectures tend to be on the dry side. If you know you would enjoy learning about psychology in the context of criminal law, feel free to take it, but if you were like me and trying to learn more about fields that you don't know much about, think twice before taking this course.",
    "My favorite course of the semester!!!",
    "It's a barrel of alright. Take it if you want.",
    "Yes, this class is interesting and informative! The grading was changed this year, however, so that there are two writing assignments, a midterm, and a final. I found grading to be tough (though a generous curve was given on the midterm). And be warned- the final requires LOADS of memorization and is entirely essays.",
    "This is a great course. Both the lectures and the readings are really interesting. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in psychology.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot from PSYC 330 and Prof. Lockhart was quite entertaining, but the lectures were so rushed that it was quite unpleasant at times. Prof. Lockhart tried to cram in way too much information in way too little time, and the course suffered as a result. By the time the final came around, the course had been reduced to an increasingly long list of court cases and key terms to memorize.",
    "I personally found the course content to be pretty interesting, although the lectures did sometimes get a little dry. But overall, Professor Lockhart is a solid lecturer - she knows her stuff and makes an effort to keep the class relatively lively\/animated. I really liked the style of the midterm and final exam. You get a set of questions\/essay prompts from which she chooses half to be on the exam so you can prepare responses beforehand. If you actually put effort into preparing\/memorizing your answers, then you'll do well on the exams. There were also two writing assignments that were pretty straightforward - for one of them you have the option of visiting the courthouse and observing real trials which turned out to be a really cool experience. I would definitely recommend the course, especially to any psych majors.",
    "The material was great, but there was a lot of mis-communication about grading. The whole course was really frustrating. I almost wish I had just bought the text book.",
    "Yes. It is an interesting class",
    "This class isn't difficult, but it isn't exactly a gut. The questions on the midterm and final are handed out in advance, which sounds nice on paper ... but, looking back, I would've much preferred a more traditional test. The questions take hours and hours to prepare, and the level of detail expected is quite high. You'll probably be writing for the full time-allotment of both tests. At least the course material isn't gutty, either -- it's surprisingly interesting, and professor Lockhart is a good lecturer.",
    "If you need a psych credit, it is a departure from many of the same topics that you learn about in psych classes, but there is a lot of specific information that you have to learn.",
    "Psych and the Law was a very enjoyable course. I loved going to lecture. It's exactly what it sounds like: applications of psychology in the legal system. Topics covered include psychopaths, [racial]profiling, eyewitnesses, memory, and a LOT of Supreme Court cases and case studies. I would recommend this class to others. When I was shopping this class, a lot of reviews said that the course was a gut, and while that is not while I took it, I was confused because it most certainly was not. While there are very few assessments in the course (only a midterm, final, and 2 papers), there is a lot of information covered and the assessments fall at very busy points in the semester (the first paper and midterm are during midterm season and the other two right in the middle of finals period), so they were very time consuming. Also, the TFs and Prof Lockhart expect a lot out of you for the midterm\/final because the questions are given beforehand, but they seem to forget that no matter how much we actually might know about the topic, there IS a time limit still. Grading is not the best, honestly, but not bad either. I'd say give it a shot. I do not regret taking the course at all.",
    "Yes I would. Course material is interesting and relevant.",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "More psych than law. I didn't like the course for most of the semester but eventually realized that psych actually does have a lot to say about how messed up our justice system is. I'm glad I took it.",
    "A very interesting class to take regardless of your major.",
    "Even though I'm not a psych major, this was my favourite class this semester. Professor Lockhart is a fantastic lecturer. A bit fast at times in her style, but incredibly engaging and the material is simply fascinating. The workload was completely manageable and the tests were very straight forward. Overall, I loved the course and would highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in criminology or psych.",
    "This was probably the worst classes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken at Yale, and I'm a senior, not because the subject matter was uninteresting (in fact, most of the readings are quite enjoyable, and the two writing assignments were not bad at all), but because of the Professor's teaching style. If you take this class, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good chance you will become the topic of future classes after going insane and committing terrible crimes. I am going to list some of what you have to look forward to, in detail, because I'm sure most of the other reviews will be incomprehensibly positive:1.Graphic, completely unnecessary descriptions of sex crimes against children and women, and a bunch of disturbing reenactments of interrogations or studies that Prof. Lockhart seems to just make up on the spot by putting herself in someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position and talking on their behalf with ridiculous voices \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the worst is when she tries to act out children talking about sexual abuse. Seriously, I cannot believe this woman is\/was a practicing psychiatrist, for a number of classes I was cringing in my seat at her crassness and inconsideration for anyone who might have experienced abuse. This class should come with a trigger warning.2.Rhetorical questions thrown out on a regular basis to a 100 person lecture, to which apparently Lockhart expects answers. \u00e2\u0080\u009cDid any of you play mousetrap when you were a kid?\u00e2\u0080\u009d (no one vocalizes a response, people nod) \u00e2\u0080\u009cWhat?! I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe it! You know, that game with the *struggles to define the game mousetrap* wow, you guys..\u00e2\u0080\u009d3.The midterm and final. I cannot even explain how terrible they are. You think, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOh, we get the questions ahead of time? This is gonna be a breeze!\u00e2\u0080\u009d THINK AGAIN. Each of the questions is a page-long combo of scenario and then about 4 sub-questions, each of which has 3-4 questions. So really, 8 questions is about 100 for the midterm, and 16 questions is about 200 for the final. And these aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t simple questions like, \u00e2\u0080\u009cdefine this thing.\u00e2\u0080\u009d They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re like \u00e2\u0080\u009clist off ALL the factors that could have affected this jury, including the characteristics of the jurors, witnesses, defendant, and attorneys.\u00e2\u0080\u009d When I wrote out the answers to each of these questions ahead of time, they took up approximately 2 single-spaced typed pages each, and somehow we are supposed to memorize all of this and write it out in 20 mins each. There was absolutely no time on the midterm or final to give legitimate answers. The midterm class average was about a 50, some people got 20s and 30s. I went to all of the classes and did all of the readings and still struggled SO much with both of these exams. Clearly the problem here is the testing method, not the students, but (this brings me to part 4):4.THE WORST PART OF ALL is that Lockhart is totally oblivious to the difficulty of these tests. She literally chides people in class, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI gave you the questions ahead of time! You should have no problem, if you did the reading.\u00e2\u0080\u009d FALSE FALSE FALSE. She clearly does not understand \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if you ask people to answer dozens of in-depth questions in 1.25 hours, you are not going to get reasonable responses. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cfinal review\u00e2\u0080\u009d which she said she wanted to make \u00e2\u0080\u009cmaximally useful,\u00e2\u0080\u009d was literally her choosing like one sub-sub-part of each of the midterm questions and saying angrily to a classroom of people, \u00e2\u0080\u009cYou have to read THIS! You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get this question without reading THIS!\u00e2\u0080\u009d in disbelief. As someone who did all of the readings and studied my butt off and still struggled with the tests, I found this behavior UNBELIEVABLY infuriating and insulting.Unbelievably, some people actually enjoy this class and Lockhart\u00e2\u0080\u0099steaching style. Every class I felt like I was dying. I wish someone had warned me about the insanity that lay ahead. Subject matter is interesting, but SO not worth 2.5 hours of bitterness every week.",
    "It's an interesting course that discusses law and the criminal justice system and uses psychology to highlight important findings that affect the effectiveness and fairness of the system. I would recommend this course as it's manageable workload and really interesting.",
    "It was basically just a course that went over how psychology and law intersect. This goes for pleas for insanity, the jury, and even psychopathy.",
    "Interesting and enjoyable until the final exam (you prep 16 essays given to you ahead of time and the exam has 8 of them). Studying for the final will make you cry.",
    "I thought I would be a fan of this course at the beginning. The strengths include the very interesting course material and the essay assignments. However, professor tries to cram too much material into each lecture. She rushes and goes over time every lecture. In addition, you do not get enough time for the exam questions. The exams are rote memorization, but you don't even know if you're getting all the right information because you are not allowed to ask questions once you get the questions in advance. I think this course would be better in the original seminar format and would recommend it as such.",
    "This course has great material if you want a superficial study of how psychology plays into the American justice system. However, this was one of the worst classes I have ever taken at Yale. The professor's teaching style was not what I have come to expect from the Psych department, and I would not do it over again if I could. Overall, all of the readings are very manageable, and there's not too much work involved except for midterm and final preparation, but all of this material would have been much more digestible without the repetitive lecture presentations. The midterm and final questions are given ahead of time, and a few are chosen for the tests, but even though you can\/should prepare ahead of time, the professor has ridiculous expectations as to how much information can be written in a class period and during the three hour final exam period.If I were you, I would simply do the readings outside of class and save yourself a terrible semester.",
    "A fascinating overview of psychology findings that are relevant to the legal system - the integrity of processes such as juror selection and deliberation, the psychological factors that affect eyewitness testimony and lead to racial bias in the justice system, etc. Also gets into how the mentally ill are treated under the law, pleading not guilty for reasons of insanity, etc. It's a psychology class, not a class on legal proceedings, but I felt like I got a good introduction to trials\/law in the process. There's a midterm and final (essay questions) and two papers - one about news articles related to class material and one where you go observe a trial or interview someone involved in the justice system and then write about it. Kristi Lockhart is an eccentric lecturer - she's not very organized, but she knows a lot about this field and gives you a lot of important issues to think about. Lectures are very thorough, and readings mostly review the cases covered in class in more detail, so you honestly don't have to keep up with the outside reading and can just use it for reference when writing the papers.",
    "This was an interesting class! The work load wasn't too heavy, and the material is interesting.",
    "Absolutely recommend taking this course. It was the most interesting course I have taken at Yale",
    "I enjoyed the subject matter of this course immensely, but it was taught in a manner that made comprehending the material difficult. I think that this course needs reformatting before it is taught as a lecture again. My main qualm was with the exams, which tested speed writing ability more than comprehension of the material. They were also graded harshly according to a strict key. Also, Professor Lockhart's lectures are somewhat confusing as her slides are disorganized and it's hard to glean main concepts and ideas from class. I would recommend this course to another student as the content is incredibly interesting and important, but only if it is extensively adapted and changed."
