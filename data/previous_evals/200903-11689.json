   "comments": [
    "If you have a chance to do independent research, don't pass it up! Taking this class has taught me more about lab work, scientific thinking, speaking, and writing than any lecture course ever could.",
    "Great course to take if you have an established relationship with a PI and want to do research in their lab.",
    "MB&B 470 is a great opportunity to be involved in research at Yale. The course is largely student directed - students chose a lab that interests them and work directly with the principle investigator to determine the project. The workload is appropriate and helps students learn about writing scientific papers and presentations and take responsibility for their work. Make sure you find a lab that you enjoy because you will spend a good amount of time with the people. If you have a good lab, you will find this course very fulfilling and learn your project at a high level.",
    "It's a research course so much of course depends on your mentor and project. My experience was positive - it was hard to balance the labwork and to get a lot done in one semester while taking other classes, but I got the hang of it eventuallyOne missing resource is having past final research papers (good and not as good) as examples to use when writing your own research paper, which would have helped with understanding how to fulfill the expected format and requirements.",
    "Great way to get credit for you work during the school year. You'll spend much more time in lab than the credit you receive, but you would have done this work no matter what. Your experience will vary with the lab, so pick well."
