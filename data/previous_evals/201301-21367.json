    "It is both a survey of key early modern ethical texts and an in depth story about the emergence of the characteristically modern idea of obligation. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This was an excellent seminar. The professor is erudite, kind, and engaged. He was accommodating to non-philosophers on many levels.",
    "I would recommending, but I would warn him\/her that it's a very tough course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class to another student. The material was intrinsically interesting and wonderfully presented.",
    "I'd recommend it.",
    "This course was very much a survey course. I sometimes found it frustrating that so much reading was assigned and then only small bits were discussed.",
    "This is a strong course that provides the material necessary to achieve a broad understanding of the history of modern ethics. I would recommend it to someone interested in that area."

    "It was really an introduction to most of the texts for me, but it really helped my research in giving me a better understanding of the history that gave rise to current moral thinking.",
    "This course was a historical overview of leading figures in modern philosophy. It significantly deepened\/broadened my knowledge of this period. This is only tangentially related to my field, but it added a valuable perspective.",
    "Primary source readings of key texts in an important period in the history of ethics."
