   "comments": [
    "Strengths- you cover a wide range of material and a lot of great secondary sources on it weakness- could have a gone more in depth on some of the texts but natural that this isn't possible when trying to cover the entire century",
    "I loved that Jinyi made us write reading responses, and his attention to every one of them. They were extremely helpful memos for the exam! I also loved the versification reform exercise- it was a super fun way to teach a really technical and dull material. The division into presentation was also excellent.",
    "The course was a low key survey, which was good in that I could have an overview of an important topic in the field, but it inevitably could not deal with all the topics in depth."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you are interested in 18th century literature then this course will give you a great background to then apply your knowledge on the topic in more depth. Overall, a nice class with a great professor",
    "Since this is a mandatory course we all have to take it. Yet, I think that anyone interested in Russian culture, should have some knowledge about this formative period. Thus, I will recommend it even for those who don't have to take the course."
