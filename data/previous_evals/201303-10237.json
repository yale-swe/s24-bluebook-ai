    "I would not recommend Mathematics 115 to another student unless that student absolutely must take it to cover a distributional requirement or requirement of their major. It's a course in an area of math that involves mainly tricks used to solve problems rather than higher-order thinking and worthwhile problem-solving,",
    "Take it, but stay ahead on your work, you will be thankful for it.",
    "Yes, the course is a basic BC calculus course that I think most people should take just to learn the math.",
    "Math 115 is definitely a tough course, but it's still manageable. Peng Zhao is an awesome professor. He's really good at explaining the concepts, and he's very helpful during office hours. Be sure to go to office hours for help with the PSETs or concepts you're struggling with.",
    "If you are going to take this class, you must be confident in your abilities to do the work. I would not take it again.",
    "MATH 115 is definitely a challenging course. It covered a lot of material. The PSETs are great for practice and test preparation. Professor Zhao is great! The exams were challenging, but test you on the material that is covered in class and on the syllabus.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to challenge themselves in math.",
    "Many of the students in this class have already taken Calc BC, making it difficult for those who have not. It is possible to do well in this class even without having taken BC, but it takes a lot of work and focus on this course in particular. Be prepared for very difficult midterms, but relatively easy problem sets that can be finished in a couple of hours.",
    "You're either looking at this because you are majoring in math or it's a requirement. If not then don't take it",
    "It's a standard Calculus 2 class that moves at a fair pace. The problem sets sometimes can have a few difficult application problems. The exams are ok. Make sure to try the practice exams before every exam since they are good indicators of how difficult the actual exam will be. If you can, take it with Professor Zhao. He is good at explaining the material, covers the material at a good pace, and he's always available by office hours or email if you need help.",
    "It's a math class, just like any other math class you've taken in the past. It's pretty dry and challenging, but Peng Zhao is really great--although a little hard to understand at first, you get used to him quickly. He's always very willing to answer any\/all questions.",
    "I would recommend this class for students. It is not too difficult and not too hard. It can be boring, but it is a basic calculus course and I felt that I learned a lot by the end of the course.",
    "It is a good class for someone who is looking for a review and a continuation on calc bc and a difficult class for someone coming from calc ab",
    "A class with a lot of work and self study.",
    "I would summarize the class as a good continuation of calculus ideas, covering topics such as methods of integration, applications of integration, parametric and polar equations, and the calculus of sequences and series. If this class needs to be taken, I would recommend Prof. Zhao, because he is a good instructor and clearly conveys the topics of calculus."
