    "I would definitely recommend this class. Like all languages, it is a lot of work. However, that being said, Giulia is great. Her energy and enthusiasm make almost every class interesting and enjoyable. She can relate to students, and she will go out of her way to help struggling students.",
    "Italian 110 is an introduction to the Italian language both written and spoken. I would definitely recommend Italian 110 to another student because Italian is a beautiful language. You'll be amazed at how much you can say after just 3 months of study.",
    "This class was great- Giulia was always very helpful whenever we had problems, and we managed to have a lot of fun while learning the language. It can be intimidating at first- I had come from taking Latin, so speaking a second language was new to me- but afterthe first week or so, you really get the hang of it. 50 minutes a day is also just the right amount, so it doesn't feel like that much. Don't get me wrong, it is a good deal of work if you want to stay on top of things and solidify all the concepts, but that's what learning a new language should be."
