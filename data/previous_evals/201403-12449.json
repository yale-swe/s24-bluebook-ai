   "comments": [
    "TAKE IT. It's the perfect balance between rigorous and chill. You learn a lot and you learn a lot fast, but it doesn't require that much time outside of class compared to a lot of language classes. Plus, Etem is great.",
    "This course is not too demanding at all, but you do find yourself really picking up on the language. Although the structure of Turkish is completely different than English, Professor Etem is able to clearly describe how and why the Turkish structure differs.",
    "I would definitely recommend L1 Turkish to a fellow student. It is an enjoyable, fun experience in which you learn the language and about the culture. It is not too much work, but enough so that you actually learn the material covered in class.",
    "Take it. Awesome class. awesome teacher, awesome language.",
    "I recommend this class! It was a great experience all around. Etem is approachable and an exciting professor. The material is clear. The workload is very manageable. Each lesson was fun and engaging!",
    "Turkish is great! If you're looking to actually learn a language, this class will give you that. Turkish is very different from English, so it is a bit slow, especially at first. Etem is a great professor- he's very funny and an understanding, reasonable teacher. The assessments are very fair and kindly graded.",
    "This is a great course for an enjoyable introduction to a language. Prof. Erol makes the class a pleasure, the workload is very reasonable, and Turkish is an intuitive language to learn.",
    "Take it! Turkish is a really cool language and you learn a lot over the semester. Classes with Etem are never boring."
