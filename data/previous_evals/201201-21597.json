    "Crash course in Behavior Modification",
    "Absolutely. Great senior seminar for psych. Really gives you a crash course in evidence based treatments - and very useful. Also, I think I'll be a better parent someday for having taken this class.",
    "This is a phenomenal course. You will learn about therapies from a behavioral standpoint that is super interesting and in which Prof. Kazdin is an expert. If you take this course for no other reason, take it for Prof. Kazdin. He is hilarious and engaging, and you will never be bored.",
    "Yes",
    "Take this class if you can- preregister, do whatever it takes. The behavior modification project was probably the most fun assignment I have ever done for a class. The material I learned will help me become a better friend, parent, and leader. Professor Kazdin is fantastic.",
    "An interesting class. Professor Kazdin is very energetic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - it's one of the classes I've taken at Yale that has actually changed how I live and how I understand other people's behavior. The behavior change project alone is a sufficient reason to sign up.Professor Kazdin has a corny, old-school sense of humor. He's approachable and knowledgeable. He was also president of the APA, which is pretty cool (he doesn't talk about that though).Work-wise, it's very manageable for a seminar. Usually a 30 page chapter of a textbook each week, plus the behavior change project.",
    "Great seminar. Take if if you can get in. Very fair assignments and light to moderate workload, and very useful and applicable information to take away!!!",
    "This is a decent class. You cover a pretty narrow range of material, but what you do go over will be thoroughly drilled into your head. The work wasn't overwhelming, although Professor Kazdin has a way of talking about assignments that tended to stress me out over nothing. I never felt like my time was getting wasted while I was in class. I'd recommend it, especially if you need a seminar to fulfill your senior requirement.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar to other sr psych majors because you'll learn a ton and alot of the material is applicable to everyday life. Pr Kazdin is fantastic and the style of the seminar is more lecture based than interactive, which I quite liked. The two tests were very fair and the two papers totalling 20 pages were painless. The one project\/ paper requires you to create your own intervention program where you change the behaviour of a friend or relative which is really cool.",
    "This is a unique course. Kazdin is a world-class expert in behavior therapy and speaks with authority from personal experience. The course encourages you to think about human behavior as most people have never done before - as something governed (at least in part) by laws that can be known and manipulated strategically to change behavior in desired ways, even in complex circumstances. The course involves a practical component where behavioral principles studied in class are applied to change a friend's behavior - this is fascinating, fun, and exciting. Know that the course isn't really taught as a seminar - there is little discussion. But Kazdin is an engaging lecturer - his unusual sense of humor is a delight. I highly recommend this course.",
    "This class is great, but it is more like a lecture than a seminar. The papers have clear guidelines and the tests are reasonable. Take it!",
    "Yes! You learn how to change behavior as opposed to just learning about what therapies are used for behavioral problems."
