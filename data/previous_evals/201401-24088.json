    "I would certainly recommend PHIL 458 to another student. For EP&E students, this felt like a way to experience the best of the major.",
    "A very good seminar which first introduced, and then delved deep into, Hannah Arendt's thought using a combination of primary writings and secondary source essays. I don't know if the Arendt seminar is going to come back in future years, but: if you have any interest in politics, philosophy, or political philosophy at all, you should seek out the next course offered by Seyla Benhabib, posthaste. She usually assumes a DS-level (or at minimum MoFoPo-level) familiarity with the basics of Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, etc. but if you want to learn a TON more political theory, and seriously critique every idea you hold about what society is and how it ought to be structured, I strongly recommend both her seminars and her European Political Thought lecture. Benhabib's ability to select interesting readings is impeccable and she pushes her students to rise to the challenge, be they philosophers, poli sci folks, EP&E people, historians, grad students, or undergrads.",
    "Yes, take it. Arendt is a fascinating thinker, and the opportunity to study her work with Seyla Benhabib is truly special.",
    "The political philosophy of Hannah Arendt traces her work for people with a bit of a foundation in The Human Condition and Origins of Totalitarianism. By engaging with other interpretations of Arendt, we try to go deep into her own thought and its implications. Tracing how she engaged the same topics and categories again and again throughout her lifetime, we also studied how her method and philosophy helped her and us understand some of the major problems of the twentieth century.",
    "This course was absolutely fantastatic! One of the best seminars I have ever taken at Yale! Professor Benhabib is one of the world's foremost experts on Hannah Arendt, don't miss the chance to study with her if you get to!",
    "Lots of reading and minimal writing. Poli sci seminar vibe, but definitely worth it to take a class with Benhabib.",
    "Great course for anyone interested in political theory",
    "Heavier on the politics than the philosophy, but a great biographical survey of one mind in twentieth-century political theory. A background in some of Arendt's own sources (chiefly classical and continental philosophy) will give depth to your reading of her own writings.",
    "Hannah Arendt is an interesting and important philosophical voice who defies easy categorization. Her work on Totalitarianism is well known, but this class is a good introduction to her later and lesser-known work on \"judgment\" and on American politics, as well as an opportunity to intensively study her concept of the \"right to have rights.\" Professor Benhabib is as brilliant as her scholarly reputation suggests, and the main reason to take the class is to listen to her speak for a good portion of the two-hour session. Although there were consistently class discussions, they were generally student-initiated, so be prepared to get out of the discussion only as much as you are willing to bring."
