    "An easy pre-1800s requirement-- and interesting if you're curious about what came before all the poets in ENGL 125 and 126. I liked it overall and learned a good bit about Old English. That being said, if you're looking for a really engaging or challenging seminar, this is not that class. Professor Frank is very sweet, but teaches the class more like a lecture than a seminar.",
    "Good class! I took it as a pre-1800, and I think it's good for that if you're looking to study a new branch of literature.",
    "This class surveys Old English literature in translation. Your enjoyment is going to depend a lot on how interested you are to begin with - it's a corpus with lots of unanswered questions, and it's very foreign culturally and aesthetically. If you're interested, though, there's so much here to learn about where the English language came from. So, yes, recommend, but in a qualified sense. It's not for everyone, but it might open up a wonderful new world for you if it strikes your fancy.",
    "It was a relatively easy class to take that completes some of the requirements for the English major. It isn't very taxing and you learn a lot, nobody has really any real background in the subject so everyone is on equal footing relatively which is also really nice and you get to learn a bit about religion."
