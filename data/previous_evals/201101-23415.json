    "This class allowed us to explore the history of a very neglected area in the world, Central America. We were able to focus on different themes in each of the five countries of Central America while also discussing general themes in the region. The readings for each week were focused and challenging, yet the incredible quality of the class motivated me to do the reading so that I could really get the most out of each seminar session.",
    "Only take if you have an extensive and comprehensive view of Central American History because you cannot hope to learn that from this class. This class focuses on minutia from individual accounts that provide little information about the broader period or themes in question.",
    "An okay seminar on Central America. It attempts to cover quick a bit and may leave you with a lot of good anecdotes about the histories of certain countries, but no complete overview. The final paper provides a good overview to use primary source material. It's great there's a course on this subject, but it tries to tackle more than it can handle.",
    "It's a really interesting class that covers an area of history that is very exciting. The twenty-page paper scared me off a bit, and I wish I would have started it earlier, but overall good class where you are just expected to do weekly reading. The midterm is fairly simple, 5-7 pages.",
    "Take it with a different professor.",
    "I recommend this class. It's a great deal of reading, but they tend to bring an interesting perspective. Carmen was a wonderful teacher. If you have any interest in Latin American history, Central American history is often overlooked and follows a fascinating historical trajectory. Very happy this course was offered and executed so well.",
    "Great class with a great reading list. Lots of juicy material here for Latin American history fans. Carmen is a very helpful professor who does a nice job at leading discussion. All the kids in the seminar got a long pretty well which is always nice. Definitely recommend if it's taught again."
