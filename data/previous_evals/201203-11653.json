    "I recommend it. There's a lot of work to do but it's very rewarding.",
    "Chinese 150 is a good class, but you should first consider seriously if you truly want to continue to study Chinese or not. There is a lot of work (like other levels in Chinese), and this class emphasizes the memorization of characters, whereas your speaking and listening skills might be forgotten a little bit. Take this class if you want to continue to learn Chinese and meet great Professors (yes they are great!), but be prepared to spend many hours studying characters.",
    "If you are serious about learning Chinese it is a good way to keep up your skills during the semester.",
    "If you've come back from Light then this course will go unbelievably slower and you will feel like your speaking abilities will go down. This is inevitable because you don't practice it as much as over the summer and not immersed in the Chinese culture. I would recommend it if you need another semester (if you were like me and forgot to apply for credit) for your language requirement. If not, it depends on you. If you want to continue your Chinese, it's a lot of work every week and if you feel like you would rather spend your time doing other things, you probably should. The amount of work will not make up for the minimal improvement. On the other hand, the Li and Wang are really great teachers and know what they're doing. It's a good course if you want to continue Chinese, but slightly painful if you did Light.",
    "If you are taking CHNS150 either you took a summer program, are continuing from L4, or have a good background in Chinese from high school, whichever category you fall under I recommend taking it for the sakeof keeping up your Chinese. You will learn a lot of new characters and vocabulary, but the grammar structures are very colloquial which weren't very appealing. In learning every language you have to memorize a ton of vocabulary and this is what this class mainly does. It is hard to do this class with a heavy course load, but if you don't use your Chinese, you will lose it. You just have to come into the class with a tough skin. Wang laoshi is really nice about errors and mistakes you make, but Li laoshi not so much."
