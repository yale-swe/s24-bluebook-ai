    "Yes! If you have any interest in Latin America - the films were great, the discusssions from Profesora Tortora even better.",
    "Spanish through Film is an L5 spanish course with the intention of improving the students Spanish skills through interaction with Latin American film. This class remains very much a language class and not a Humanities course - do not expect conversations and discussions like those you might find in a Film Studies course, unless you and your entire class is fluent, I suppose. This won't happen though, because L5 at Yale can mean many, many things (anywhere from native speaker to people who got a 5 on the the AP junior year of high school and haven't heard a word of Spanish since). Besides this minor setback, this class is EXTREMELY well taught - with care, enthusiasm, etc. Prof. Tortora makes clear to all students that Latin American film is her passion, and it shows everyday. Over the course of the semester, Tortora will expose you to the amazing world that is Latin American film, and it will only make you want to watch more movies, travel, and take a Latin American history course. It's a fantastic introduction to the field, esp. given the various film makers that Tortora brings almost EVERY WEEK from Latin America. Really, this sort of thing is why you came to Yale. I can't describe how illuminating it was to meet a different filmmaker almost every week. That said, this course is a MAJOR time commitment, though not very heavy on the workload front. You will have, on avg., 2 film screenings per week, + two 1hr and 15min sections per week. The joke with my friends was that this class was like a needy girlfriend... BUT DON'T LET THIS DISCOURAGE YOU. The films you will watch are worth it, along with the people you will meet and the world you will be exposed to. There is a short film critique of 500 words for 12 of the movies you watch (about 25 total), a midterm of two 3 pg essays and a ID in-class test, and a final movie project or final paper of 8-10pgs.",
    "SPAN 223 is an introduction to cinema in which you will learn a lot about film, get the chance to see movies, many of them controversial, of contemporary filmmakers, and enjoy a wonderful professor!",
    "This is an amazing class! I learned so much about cinema but also about Latin American history and culture too! The movies come from such a wide variety of places that you really get the full spectrum, which is amazing because many of the countries from which we watched movies have very small movie industries. Profesora Tortora is an amazing resource because she not only knows so much about Latin American cinema from the entire region but is also a really interesting person and knows everyone who is anyone in the business. I feel so lucky to have had the opportunity to meet so many directors and actors from so many different countries. The only downside is that it is a lot of work, but you don't have to do most of it to still be ok in the class. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and one that I think will have the most impact on my future life because I will continue to seek out Latin American movies and because I learned so much. T\u00f3mela!",
    "An introduction to Latin film, taught in fluid spanish, complemented by discussions of the political and cultural motivation behind the material and chances to meet with real movers and shakers in the film world.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend SPAN 223.Sign-up for the course initially to watch an incredible collection of Latin American films and stay for the opportunity to interact with professional Latin American directors, participate in fascinating discussions about Latin American history and politics, and learn from the brilliant, enthusiastic, and warm Profesora Tortora. Her laughter is dramatic, constant, and contagious.However, my recommendation is based in part upon the fact that the reading was optional in-practice during my seminar. If the reading had been required and a more central aspect of seminar, then the class would have been more difficult and time-consuming and I would not have enjoyed it as much."
