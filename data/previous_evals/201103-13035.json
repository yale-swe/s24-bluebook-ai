    "Spanish 150 was basically a great class; ours was really fun because we had an interesting combination of personalities, the likes of which may never occur again. Sonia loved it, and as a result our discussions were always hilarious. I would absolutely recommend this class, it's a pretty easy way to knock out the language rec. My spanish didn't really improve though, think it got worse actually.",
    "great class to pass your language requirements. get Professor Valle if possible",
    "Its only 3 days a week and it doesn't have that much work. Easy way to get the language requirement. Only part that sucks is the novel at the end (if only there was a way to avoid it).",
    "It's a pretty good way to take a language class because its only 3 days a week and since it's mainly conversational there isn't that much written work. If you are pretty comfortable with the language I would recommend taking this course.",
    "yes, especially if you wan to continue using spanish in the future, then it is a must",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course.",
    "Spanish 150 is a very good course that challenges you to actively participate in class and not be afraid to vocalize your ideas. Since the majority of the class is based upon communication, participation is a crucial part of improving. Some of the readings may take a while to read, since they are laden with more elaborate Spanish vocabulary; nevertheless, they are certainly a great means of improving one's vocabulary and considering a wide array of ideas on various controversial topics.I would definitely recommend this course to other students. After taking this course, I noticed a great improvement in my fluency and my comfort level, and I believe that this course can do the same for other students as well.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 150 to another student. Each day you discuss the readings in a small group or as a whole class. There are two debates and two role playing exercises. There are six written homework assignments throughout the semester and three quizes. For the midterm and final you have to speak for roughly half an hour about a given topic. Your ability to speak Spanish improves a lot throughout the course.",
    "Take it if you want to improve your conversational skills and really get a grasp on the language",
    "If you're just looking to fulfill a requirement, I would recommend this class.",
    "Short reading assignments, discussions\/debates in class, some written work and a few quizzes. Very manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 150 to anyone who got a 5 on the AP in high school. It has a very manageable workload, and your conversational Spanish skills improve greatly. Se\u00f1ora Valle was a fantastic professor, and this course is a great way to start off Spanish at Yale (if you want to take more Spanish courses) or easily get your 1-semester requirement out of the way."
