    "I've gained a better historical understanding of how Latin America's political systems developed, and why they are the way they are currently. I've also gained a better understanding of how Latin America's economic systems developed and\/or were hindered by colonialism, international events, etc.",
    "I gained a comprehensive understanding of Politics in Latin America, with many different themes and topics covered. A well structured course content wise.",
    "I learned a broad outline of Latin American political\/economic history which will allow me to fill in with greater detail the smaller parts while appreciating the big picture. Also, a very good exposure to lots of different parts of political science.",
    "As my intrroduction to political science, I gained a lot of insight into the challenges of democracy and presidentialism, party systems and the general political history of Latin America. I now know so much more about the region than I did before the class.",
    "This was a great survey of Latin American politics and history. I developed comparative analysis skills and a lot about a tumultuous and growing region.",
    "I got a crash course in post-independence Latin American history, buffered by trends in economic and political development. We covered most of the region - minus the Guianas and a lot of the Caribbean islands - and put a lot of the case studies into comparison with each other within the foundation frameworks of definitions that we learned about in class. Functions of government and governmental policies were a huge component of the second half of the course, which allowed us to see what actually works and doesn't work in the region. History was always kept in mind, to not forget about the recent past and the rapid developments that have occurred in the last century."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Guest speakers were effective and added great perspective Weaknesses: The reading load for this course is quite heavy. A section would have been nice in order to get a better grasp on the core themes from the readings. In addition, the lectures sometimes felt a little disorganized. It was sometimes hard to pull the main points from what was being said. However, that being said, by the end of the course it was much easier to see how all the lectures connected and the progression in thought. Essentially, the lectures follow the economic progression of Latin America. It would have been easier to follow if there were more summaries of main points throughout the lectures.",
    "Excellent overview. Just not detailed enough or focused on specific moments of history. Almost became an economic history.",
    "I loved it! The way Professor Stokes teaches the material is very engaging.",
    "Strengths : - Interesting subject matter - Comprehensive Weaknesses : - Would have benefited from a better structure, with a section as well as an essay component instead of a final. - The exam based tests did not allow for a closer examination and application of the context.",
    "The course was pretty bare bones--not even a section. I know that Professor Stokes wanted a section and couldn't have one because of some administrative problem, but I personally had a very hard time engaging with just 2 lectures a week and readings that had no feedback pretty much ever. On the other hand, the readings are very good, and I felt like the course was structured in a way that made a lot of sense. Even with my subpar engagement, I learned a lot.",
    "The course material for this class was, in my opinion, very interesting. Lectures were informative and Professor Stokes genuinely cares about her students' learning and participation, even though it was set up as a small lecture. I think that finding a way to incorporate a section for this class would have been very rewarding as it would have provided a means for discussing the many readings (and indeed encouraged students to spend more time doing them). Overall a very informative class.",
    "The class was small enough to have been a seminar style course which could have been more effective than a small lecture, particularly in the absence of teaching sections.",
    "The lectures were all straightforward, which was nice, but there could have been more in-class engagement with the readings, instead of just asking what the author said or argued. It felt like not all of the readings had to be read for class. The exams and the map quiz were also straightforward. The course could definitely use some more interactive features in class, to get students to participate more."

   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in Latin America, you will enjoy this course much more than you would otherwise. The lectures are not incredibly engaging. In addition, there is a lot of reading to keep up with. The exams ask about the readings, so you will need to keep up with them. You will come away from this course with a solid understanding of how economic and political systems developed in Latin America, and what factors influenced Latin America's current development. You don't need any Spanish knowledge for this course.",
    "Unless you know nothing about Latin America, don't bother. It's too difficult to be a gut but not difficult enough to actually be a challenge. I felt bored and frustrated by the seemingly uninterested group of people who formed the class.",
    "I would recommend it for the content, but only if the format is changed because I think a section or seminar style would allow for better discussion and application.",
    "It's a pretty standard lecture course, but if you find the material interesting, well worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for people interested in a broad understanding of 20th Century Latin American history and a great survey of political science topics. The guest lectures were wonderful and informative and Professor Stokes is very knowledgeable and loves interacting with her students. Worth the 9am wake up!",
    "I recommend this course. It's a combo history-and-politics course of post-independence Latin America, with a focus on developments in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. I thought that the course was accessible for someone with little knowledge of economics and politics. Getting up to be in class at 9am is rough (you should go to all the lectures), but the material was interesting. Professor Stokes is nice and well-intentioned."
