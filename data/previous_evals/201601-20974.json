    "I would recommend MMES 282 to other students, but only if they had a solid background on the Middle East. I think the analysis can only be useful if students are already familiar with the history of the countries being studied.",
    "For the most part -- it revolves around some recurring concepts, such as state \"space\" and methods of state control, but each set of readings felt somewhat disparate.",
    "State Building in the Middle East examines the problems that face the Middle East in the present through a historical, geographical, and political lens. To understand the modern Middle East, it is necessary to have this critical perspective, and one way to obtain it is by taking this class. If one is interested in the Middle East or the politics of warfare in the 21st century at all, I absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Good course, provides a lot of interesting context and a great lens to view contemporary issues in the region. Sometimes odd balance between history and political theory, and there is a LOT of info being thrown at you. Definitely need to know some Middle Eastern history before hand for you to really make the most out of this class. T.A. wasn't great. take this class if u love maps",
    "MMES 282 is a class that teaches students about how political organization is formed, using the Middle East and North Africa as a source of case studies to study the formation of these political entities. Specifically, students analysis how geography, imperialism, ideology, and other factors influence how states are built, starting from the 19th century and ending as recently as 2014. While the historical context is always given, the class does not focus on history. I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in the politics or history of the Middle East and\/or North Africa, or statebuilding theory in general. While some knowledge of Middle Eastern history would be helpful, it is not required to get a lot out of the class."
