    "I'm not sure how useful it is for learning about science, but it was overall a fun experience and a good introduction to the department, and it wasn't very much work.",
    "I will say it is a good guide for freshmen and will recommend it to other first-years.",
    "I would describe as a very broadly applicable and highly variable lecture class with occasion discussion. I likely would not recommend the class to other students, but it is a requirement for the degree, so it is a must. If changes were made to realign the course's goals, I would TOTALLY recommend this class to others, but the class has somewhat waned from its original intent and description, in my opinion."

    "It gave me some broadening knowledge about EEB (as a subject in general, and also as a department). I think it made me better equipped to understand departmental seminars I have attended this semester and to talk to my classmates in other labs about their work. It didn't really contribute at all to my dissertation\/research, but it probably made me a better colleague.",

    "I learned about myriad topics and resources I have to ask research questions within and tangentially to our department, which is super helpful.",
    "This course helped broaden my idea of the types of research possible in biology and made me think more about interdisciplinary research. It also exposed me to the many resources available at Yale, which will be critical to my dissertation.",
    "This course exposed me to the research of the faculty in our department, which is extremely helpful when considering lab rotations, collaborations, and faculty members as a source of knowledge and help when conducting our research."
