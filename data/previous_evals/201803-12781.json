   "comments": [
    "So much new information on relationships between the class subjects, but also a greater framework for thinking about topics and challenging topics from a broad yet nuanced way.",
    "I learned about the complex, critically important and remarkably understudied relationships between climate change, humans and animals. The course was a fascinating and highly original look at the intersection of animal welfare, environmentalism, food policy, and climate change.",
    "This class was a fascinating exploration into the intersection between two topics that are often viewed as being opposed to each other. We had the benefit of writing a paper that will be distributed to the wider environmental community, and I certainly learned a great deal from the experience of writing this paper. I feel I've come out of the class with a thorough understanding of how animals and climate change are interrelated, and in which ways we can change policy to better reflect this relationship.",
    "Better understanding of climate impacts on animals through extensive research for our class report; deeper understanding of less obvious climate impacts like those on captive animals; more knowledge about the laws and policies in place (or not in place) to protect animals",
    "I learned a new way of thinking about the climate crisis, through the lens of animal welfare. I gained insights into how climate advocates and animal welfare advocates could learn from each other and work together. I also learned about greenhouse gas emissions associated with animal agriculture and the potential for reductions in this sector."

   "comments": [
    "This course was beyond what I expected on levels of nuance and challenge around new topics.",
    "This was a fantastic class, taught by two of the finest instructors at Yale. The knowledge, skills and insights I gained in this class both aligned with and exceeded my expectations. I very much hope that YLS and FES have Doug and Jon to teach more courses together again in the future. They are an extraordinary team, and it was a privilege to be part of this course's inaugural run.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations. I was not necessarily seeking to gain particular skills, but more of a working knowledge on the topics covered by the class. Since the class is part of a pioneering effort by the professors to make the themes of the course more relevant in the policy space, I feel like my classmates and I are well prepared to incorporate this effort into our own work.",
    "Aligned well!",
    "The knowledge I gained in the class aligned well with my expectations, though I went into the class not knowing what to expect but very willing to learn and expand my perspective."

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Dialogue style with the two professors and class. Conversations flowed well and were interesting.",
    "This was a fantastic class, taught by two of the finest teachers at Yale. Doug and Jon are profoundly gifted teachers. They are both the rare combination of being exceedingly knowledgable rockstars in their fields and being captivating, skilled instructors in the classroom. In addition to being informative and thought-provoking, the class discussions were repeatedly inspiring, exciting, and moving. It was a great privilege to be a part of the course. I very much hope YLS will offer many more courses taught by Doug and Jon going forward. I learned a lot about the complex, critically important and remarkably understudied relationships between climate change, humans and animals. Jon and Doug's approach to the class was a fascinating and highly original look at this important intersection.",
    "The class discussions were compelling, especially given the genuine and insightful contributions from both professors. The amount of reading seemed appropriate and the material itself was engaging while including diverse perspectives. Retrospectively, the role-playing class activity was very helpful as a reference to how these issues are playing out in the real world.",
    "I know it's not an animal law class, but one session that covers the most important components of animal law could be helpful. I loved the opportunity to talk about animals and climate change with a group of students and two professors who are really passionate about these issues. Even if some of the material we covered wasn't new to me, I was able to learn a lot and think about things through our conversations. I think that was driven by the presence of students from various schools in the class and two professors who came at the material from slightly different angles.",
    "A strength of the course was its structure, which allowed students to voice their thoughts any time during class and for others to respond. I really enjoyed the insight that both professors had at the beginning of most classes, which would then fuel our discussion for the rest of the class. The assigned readings were also a strength- some of the readings changed my perspective on topics and some brought up things I hadn't ever considered before. The paper was a good chance to research topics that are not often considered. Though I know the paper is not something that had done before, it could be improved to be less open-ended."

    "Take it!",
    "I highly recommend this class (and any class taught by Doug and Jon)! This was a fantastic class, taught by two of the finest teachers at Yale. Doug and Jon are profoundly gifted teachers. They are both the rare combination of being exceedingly knowledgable rockstars in their fields and being captivating, skilled instructors in the classroom. They make a wonderful team. In addition to being informative and thought-provoking, the class discussions were repeatedly inspiring, exciting, and moving. It was a privilege to be a part of the course. Through the course, I learned a lot about the complex, critically important and remarkably understudied relationships between climate change, humans and animals. Jon and Doug's approach to the class was a fascinating and highly original look at this important intersection.",
    "This is absolutely the best course I have taken at Yale. The professors are incredible and the class discussions were exactly the kind of intellectual debates\/explorations that I have been looking for in graduate school. Take this class if you can.",
    "I would start early on the paper and solicit the professors for as much feedback as possible. Obviously, it is very important to do the readings because class participation is a major component of how the course is structured.",
    "If you are passionate about animals, this class is so fun to attend every week and doesn't really feel like work, just an opportunity to talk with classmates and 2 experts for two hours. The readings selected are interesting and not very law heavy, so very approachable for all students.",
    "This class was an opportunity to think critically about the climate crisis through a new lens with two really knowledgable professors. The class structure encouraged students to participate and voice any thoughts they had, and sometimes the discussions were philosophical and some were applicable and I appreciated how they made my mind stretch. I would definitely recommend taking this course if you're interested in getting a new perspective on climate change and thinking critically about the problems the world is facing in a new light."
