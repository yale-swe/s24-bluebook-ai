   "comments": [
    "I would certainly recommend African Studies. Students should be aware that many of the students in the class - in part because there were a number of grad students - had background knowledge in the subjects, but it is certainly possible to participate without this knowledge.",
    "This is a class about post-colonial issues. It is a fairly wonderful class because it covers such a gamut of different issues - development, settler colonialism, neo-colonialism, processes of de-colonisation, and because it uses such interesting texts. However, don't take it unless you intend to make it your primary focus for the semester. There is aheavy reading load, weekly two page response papers, and the issues will consume your thoughts. That said, they are issues that are worth being consumed by, and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is interested - it is well worth the stress and effort.",
    "A great opportunity to learn about parts of African history and discuss what culture, modernity, progress means to you.",
    "An absolutely incredible seminar. It examines Africa's postcolonial experience through an unbelievably diverse collection of stories - novels, films, memoirs, photography, anthropological studies, and so on. Prof. Magaziner is brilliant - he provides deft guidance both in the seminar and at office hours. Weekly reading responses are actually quite helpful in stimulating the week's discussion, and the final paper is entirely open-ended to provide for individual students to pursue their own interests. Take it, no doubt about it.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this course or any other class taught by Daniel Magaziner. He is fantastic!",
    "With this course, I appreciated being able to learn about a region of the world about which I knew very little beforehand. Every few weeks we studied a different region or country in Africa. I enjoyed the varied list of assigned readings, from anthropological works to memoirs to novels, and the workload was not too demanding (just a 1-2 page reading response every week and a final paper). My one major complaint of the course was that Magaziner barely spoke during class. Each week a pair of students would lead the class discussion for the entire period, and Magaziner would only chime in every so often. I was able to learn a lot from the fellow students in the class, but I wish I could have learned more from the professor! I would recommend going to office hours, then, because Magaziner is a really cool, interesting professor, but you would hardly know that from sitting through the seminar.",
    "YES",
    "This class was fantastic. I took it originally to fulfill a 'rest of the world' requirement, and it became my favorite class of the semester, partially due to how terrible my other ones were, but also because Magaziner was fantastic. I've taken twelve seminars (three history junior seminars) during my time at Yale, and he was by far the best seminar leader. The readings were fascinating, intellectually challenging, and controversial enough for vigorous discussion. I wish he were around in the next three semesters, as I'd definitely like to take another course with him.",
    "Take this class. Whether or not you know anything about Africa, whether or not you are a history major. This is the only seminar I have taken in which every week without fail the class had engaging conversations with barely a moment of silence. The readings are focused enough to give some depth and detail to the course but the syllabus considers enough different case studies that it does not feel narrow. Readings range from postcolonial theory to social history to cultural anthropology to literature. Magaziner alone is reason to take the class: he is brilliant and insightful and is the sort of professor whom you strive to please. And be prepared to work--the readings are not inconsiderable, and the weekly reading response is a short essay (2 pp) with a thesis (which means everyone comes to class with thoughts on the readings)."
