   "comments": [
    "The teaching method in class is a good way to engage everyone and convey the concept, though sometimes would be a little bit hard to follow, especially for students who do not have R experience or statistics course experience or both before. The HW and exam is in a very reasonable difficulty and amount. Might allow more engaging if there is a mini project during the semester so students can collaborate and work on a small real problem??",
    "Weakness: There's only one weakness, I think at least one of the exams should be a time-limiting project-based exam. This could substantially improve our real-time data experience. Strengths: 1. Insanely responsive instructor! Susan is doing really good on providing feedback on almost every student! This is incredible~! 2. Piazza made it wonderful to communicate with fellow students, Susan, and teaching assistants. Making it a very interactive class. 3. Very helpful homework problem sets. 4. Well-designed and -organized canvas tabs and lectures.",
    "Lectures are clear and well-organized. Some contents are overlapped with other basic statistic courses.",
    "More focus on theoretical points are needed.",
    "The content and the data sets are very interesting. However, I think the couse can be better by including individual projects.",
    "Strengths: purposeful classes and kind, intelligent instructor. Weaknesses: homework was a bit copy paste heavy from classwork, so I think less learning was gained from assignments than desired.",
    "Strengths: 1) Very interactive. 2) Homework is well-designed that helps our understanding of the statistical concepts better. Weaknesses: 1) More contents could be included into the syllabus.",
    "Strengths: A good overview of data analysis methods and tools that will help you keep learning on your own. Professor was excellent. Weaknesses: Professor wanted to cover too much material and went by a little fast for my preference. I felt there was too much material and too little time. The class before the exams should be dedicated to reviews and QandAs.",
    "Strength: Instructor was so clear in teaching Weakness: Once you miss something in class, its almost impossible to catch back up so you are lost for the rest of the class period.",
    "Very clear and efficient",
    "I found this class to teach concepts that were very practical for use outside of the classroom. I think I will use tools I learned from this class for a long time.",
    "Very wel taught and organized, homework and lectures were useful and interesting. No major complaints, though exam review sessions could have been better.",
    "Strength: It was taught for kinesthetic and visual learners. Weakness: It often moved too fast during the lecture to keep up."
