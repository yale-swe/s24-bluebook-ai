    "Great first class in Zulu. It's not the most well organized class there is, but you learn a lot. UThisha (Professor Sandra Sanneh) is a lovely person. She's very caring and understanding of when you might not be able to submit work on time or when you need more help regarding certain topics. I learnt to do some cool clicks, something that uThisha will emphasize especially at the beginning of the semester and with time you get a hang of how to do them.",
    "Very good understanding of the South African culture and history. The teacher did not move very fast with the syllabus, which helped understand it better because it is a very unique language. I liked the fact that we learned a lot about the country itself and how to communicate if you were by any chance on a trip there.",
    "I gained an understanding of the fundamentals of the language along with a much better understanding of South Africa and its culture.",
    "New strategies to use in learning a new language.",
    "The obvious skill I developed was the language skill. However, I also learned a lot about South African history, the culture, the people, the food, the music and the sports. So although this class is formally a Language credit, I informally obtained humanities and social science credits.",
    "I learned how to speak a basic level of Zulu as well as learn about the culture and history"

    "This is the best course I've ever taken at Yale by far",
    "Great professor, great language.",
    "I think that it is a very good course providing knowledge about a language that is very unique and interesting. I like the fact that the teacher is very passionate about this class and makes us be passionate too. I do wish that there was a more clear structure of the grading in this class.",
    "Thisha is the strongest element of the course. She genuinely cares about the students and their learning. Also, the emphasis on history and culture is a strength.",
    "Was a joy to go to everyday",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I've taken other language classes before and what I really loved about this class was that we got to learn a lot more about South Africa and its history. We also got to dive into the culture and this really helped with putting what we were learning into context."

    "100%",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the class. As with every language, you should get in some practice whenever you get the chance if you want to improve. UThisha is wonderful! The language is interesting and fun to learn as well. You get to make some new and cool sounds with your mouth, throat and nose, it's great! It's wonderful to look back at the end of the semester and realise just how much you have learned.",
    "I would recommend it as a very interesting and fun class which will also help improve one's grade too.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. One of the more interesting language classes you can take.",
    "Yes learn new information you would not know regardless",
    "YES! YES! YES! YES! TAKE IT! TAKE IT! I wasn't going to take this class at first and basically shopped it towards the end of shopping period. I had not heard of it before so I was a bit unsure. After taking it I now rank this class in the top 3 classes I have taken at Yale for 3 simple reasons. Firstly, it felt like more than just a class but more of a family. Due to the nature of the class, we all developed close bonds with one another. I've gotten to know my classmates quite well and even meet up with some of them outside class to grab meals together. Secondly, I really liked the teaching approach the teacher used. It wasn't just her lecturing and asking us questions but we had the opportunity to engage in language games. These were not only fun but very helpful in learning the material. As we meet every day, I always looked forward to going to class. Thirdly, the professor, or as we call her \"thisha\", is simply amazing. I don't think I can describe in words what an awesome professor she is so you simply have to meet her for yourself. If you're doubting whether to take this class or not, I'd say TAKE IT. You won't regret it. My only regret is not taking this class in my first year.",
    "Yes, Thisha is great and the course is interesting and fun while remaining engaging mentally."
