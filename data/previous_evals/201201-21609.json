   "comments": [
    "It is a good intro physics course for someone who has taken AP physics. I would recommend it to someone who is interested in physics (including modern physics) and isn't sure they have the math background to take Physics 260.",
    "Take it if you are prepared, do not if you are not. Don't schedule it into a heavy schedule.",
    "If you want a great foundation on how the world around you works and operates, then thisis the class to take. Most of the material, especially in quantum mechanics, GR, and cosmology, was very interesting and enjoyable to study and work with. Professor Tipton is great, and his enthusiastic yet relaxed nature made the class all the more enjoyable. Great class.",
    "Definitely take this if you have any interest in physics.",
    "PHYS201 was great. After PHYS200 I was less interested in continuing physics, but after 201 I am seriously considering taking more physics next year. Electricity and Magnetism were two of my least favorite physics subjects in high school, and I was honestly dreading a whole semester of deriving equations of E fields and electric potential. But now I feel like I really understand those topics, and the course builds from those onto much more interesting things like light. Towards the end, 201 covers quantum mechanics (very interesting!) and general relativity \/ cosmology - also very interesting and a very active field of research. Overall incredibly satisfying. Recommended even if you're less interested in physics after 200.",
    "take it if you enjoy physics.",
    "If you took Physics 200, I think you should stick with it and take the second half of the course. The E\/M half of the course is fairly interesting, particularly toward the end of the course when you get introduced to some of the big problems in modern physics. Exams are in general very fair and help is available if you need it.",
    "This is a good course with a combination of old and new materials. If you have taken AP Physics before, you will have seen all the electricity and magnetism topics and optics. However the problems that this class dealt with is harder than you have seen before. The modern physics involving quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology are very intriguing. Since these new topics are taught at a very basic level, the work involved with those topics are not hard at all. I recommend this class for not only physics majors but anyone who might want to know how the world works.",
    "I wouldn't recommend Physics 201 unless it was required for a major. If as a physics major you know anough to take 260, do that instead.",
    "This is a good physics class on introductory level for people who have an average level of knowledge about physics and math.",
    "I thought E+M was a lot more interesting than mechanics. I also thought it happened to be easier, but maybe that was just the tests for our year...",
    "Not that bad, and not much work. It's cool how you cover modern physics and a little quantum mechanics at the end.",
    "Physics 201 is a standard program of physics following 200. Of special note is the section on basic quantum mechanics. Some calculus is required",
    "I would recommend this class. I love physics more than anything. The material in this class was thrilling. Professor Tipton is kind and funny, but does not always explain things well. Sometimes I would sit in lecture and not be able to follow him at all. I had to teach myself the material later. However, his class notes allow you to teach yourself and review material easily.",
    "Exams and problems sets were very fair and manageable. Study hall was EXTREMELY helpful. The TAs are a great resource and are patient and supportive. Professor Tipton is a great orator and is quite witty. I would recommend this course for students who have an interest in quantum mechanics and modern physics. For students who are only interested in electrostatics and magnetism, this course delves pretty far into other areas so be prepared.",
    "Yes, I recommend it. But probably only if you've seen E&M before and are pretty ok with learning stuff on your own. If so, it's not that hard.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to; I learned a lot, but definitely didn't have fun doing it. Tipton is not a great lecturer and is very reliant on slides with complicated derivations. Also, the material after the second midterm is mostly Quantum Mechanics, which is very difficult to understand without a background in Linear Algebra. I ended up teaching myself a lot of math for this one - Math 120 is really not enough. If you do need to take this class for a major, be sure to go to study halls and use the TA's and peer tutors as much as possible. They were really amazing and pulled me through the class.",
    "Very manageable class. I took this class without any background in electromagnetism and didn't have too much trouble keeping up with the class. Tipton is a solid lecturer and posts his notes online which is extremely helpful. I recommend shopping Tipton when choosing with Physics class to take.",
    "I actually ended up enjoying this class despite myself. In addition to useful E&M, you learn a lot of cool stuff about cosmology and quantum mechanics... I now feel versed enough in these topics to understand the climate of modern physics. Psets are more challenging than exams, so definitely take advantage of help from TFs and your peers at study halls. Tipton is overall a fair (and reasonably entertaining) professor.",
    "Second semester to 200. It isn't quite as scary as I anticipated. I took AP Physics B in high school w\/ an excellent teacher prior to 200\/201. While some of the abstract concepts are still a bit unclear in my head, final\/problem sets are more based off of problem solving. The Study Hall\/TAs are really helpful in explaining how to approach problems and the physics theory behind the solutions. I found it helpful that I was taking ENAS 194 at the same time, as it made the math proofs that Tipton attempted to explain in class actually make sense.",
    "I don't know what the new professor will be like, but Prof. Tipton always gave the funniest descriptions of historical physicists, so I'll miss that. However, there's always the OYC lectures as a good resource. The modern physics at the end is really interesting.",
    "I recommend this class. If you have a decent amount of math class under your belt and want to learn an in-dept concepts of electromagnetism and modern physics, it's a good place to start.",
    "Physics 201 is basically like Physics 200. Problem sets are all pretty manageable, but class is really boring.",
    "If you have made it this far, you have probably already taken 200. If 200 was a problem for you, 201 will likely be worse.",
    "It's easy.",
    "Yes, I would. It's a great physics course and good science credit.",
    "Definitely take it if you've had some background in E&M (just concept level is fine). Good for getting a handle on quantum mechanics and other modern physics, too.",
    "Physics 201 is a great course for students that have had a little introduction to E&M before. You learn a lot more (both breadth and depth) than in Physics 181 and go more in depth than Physics 261. I would fully recommend this course if you really want to get a good mastery of physics.",
    "It's a good course! Take it if you are interested in physics!",
    "More difficult than 200, but interesting. Take it if you have an interest in physics, and a light-ish workload.",
    "Yes; it is a solid class. But I would caution that the professor does have a big say in shaping the experience. This year, it was a little boring and sometimes hard to due to lack of explanation.",
    "Loved it! Perfect intro physics. Also Shankar's online videos are very helpful!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in learning calculus based physics. The class covers E&M and QM. If you're interested in learning about GR and have sufficient math background then I would recommend that you take PHYS261.The class is well curved and is supposedly better than PHYS181 at this. The two midterms and a final are all very fair. My roommate dropped down from PHYS200 to PHYS181 and from him I learned that their exams were difficult and very long such that many people were unable to finish them in the allocated time.",
    "I feel like this class was a great way to be caught up to date on a lot of the basics of modern physics. Many of the instruments used in my other classes are significantly less mystical now.",
    "It is a good second semester physics course, you need to know multivariable to take it. There is a fair amount of work but you learn a huge amount from the course. I would recommend it to prospective physicists, engineers,and science majors.If you take the class I would really recommend going to the problem sessions they are extremely helpful",
    "If you plan on becoming a physics major but have not taken multivariable before coming to college, I highly recommend this course.",
    "If you took 200, you will obviously take this. I would not recommend it if you were not in PHYS 200.",
    "PHYS201 is an overview of E&M, cosmology and other interesting topics. I have never taken E&M before and I found the pace of the class fast enough so it was interesting and manageable. Professor Tipton posts all the powerpoints so missing class or not understanding topics in lecture is fine. The workload is not that much (The problem sets usually don't take more than 3-4 hours a week and if you need help, there is an excellent support system of peer tutors for PHYS201). The test are also easy in comparison to the material taught in lecture and the problem sets. Professor Tipton is such a caring teacher. He can be a bit dry some time, but he is super helpful outside of class and nice. I would definitely recommend this class if you haven't taken physics before but have taken MATH120 (or even if you haven't taken MATH120). Compared to PHYS181 this semester, this is A LOT less work and you do more mathematical questions instead of conceptual ones. Compared to PHYS261, this went over fewer topics but I would not recommend PHYS261 if you don't have a solid background in E&M.",
    "The information can be hard to understand but also really interesting if you approach it with an attitude that is ready to take on the challenge.",
    "Electricity, electromagnetism, light, quantum mecanics, some general relativity and cosmology.First part of the course is tedious and very difficult. But learning those basis pays off and last part is a great deal of fun. Revising for midterms and finals is rewarding because it all comes together.To enjoy course, you need to understand the material and learn it on a regular basis.Use all possible ressources avaliable.Hold on, even if it is very difficult at first.",
    "TAKE IT PHYSICS IS AWESOME.",
    "A basic, large (close to 200 people) lecture intro physics course. I took AP physics B and finally started learning new things (as opposed to PHYS200 which seemed to repeat the AP class). I feel solidly prepared for upper level physics and science courses. The room (SPL 57) sucked but it will be renovated for the 12-13 year. Professor Tipton was fun, but not great at explaining things.",
    "I would recommend 201. It is not the easiest class but it gives you a solid understanding of critical concepts for physics. You are given the chance to learn more than most introductory physics class. You are never surprised by the problem sets and all in all it is very doable if you are willing to work.",
    "If you don't need to take this class for either a major or pre-med, then don't take it. If you're pre-med and looking for an easy physics class.. good luck. I heard 180 isn't particularly well taught either, and do NOT take 170, so 200 and 201 are about all you have left."
