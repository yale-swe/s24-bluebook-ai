    "YES! Take it if you're thinking about or involved in any form of philanthropy. Or if you want to meet some 20 students and 10+ important people in the philanthropic sector and let everyone and everything about this class open your eyes.",
    "Being empowered to give away a large sum of money is an amazing experience, though the class is also very stressful, mostly because much is not determined until the very last minute. It's an exercise in negotiating and compromising with people who have differing preferences. The assigned reading was far too much and barely discussed in class, especially toward the end. The three components of the course -- reading\/discussion of philanthropy; interviews with philanthropists; and deciding how to give away the money -- seemed to be a bit too much crammed into one course. But I have absolutely no regrets. Prof. Thorne is a bit of a character. His opinions\/biases show up in class a lot, though they did not unfairly influence our final funding decision at all. The writing assignments are not particularly demanding, but I think this is good because it allows more time to be spent on research of organizations, which is definitely the most important part of the course. If you're ready to put your heart into figuring out how to give away a bunch of money, while being stressed and interviewing really cool celebrities, then I highly recommend the course.",
    "The course is a novel and exciting approach to experiential learning. Strengths of the course include all of the hands-on components - interviews, giving away the money, etc. Given that this was the first time the course has been taught, there was a lot of experimenting with class structure and assignments. If the extra time spent out of class is made into a lab section for the course next year, this will streamline the course greatly. The chance to meet with major philanthropists and give away money as a class is not one to be missed. That being said, as our class was the first time the class was offered, there were times when it was difficult to figure out how things would be run - from how much time should be spent in addition to class time to how to actually decide upon a process to give away the money. However, in subsequent iterations of this class, these issues should be resolved, and the class will likely be greatly improved structurally. It can be difficult to balance learning through books and assignments with the actual hands-on learning and application of the course, so understand that there will be some adjustments made in this area in the coming semesters. Prof. Thorne is engaging and energetic and has interesting insights to bring to the class. I definitely recommend you to apply for the class and take it if you are admitted.",
    "Make sure you know what you're getting into. Things I did not expect: (1) The class takes a lot of time outside of the regular class hours (interviews that do not always fall in the class time, meetings about deliberations, etc.). (2) You wing it... A LOT. It is emotionally stressful as you build connections with organizations but find yourself unable to provide them with concrete explanations of how the group will ultimately make its decisions. (3) The readings are put on the back burnerfor most of the semester, and the focus is placed on the decision-making process.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to any student who has an interest in philanthropy and wants to have the amazing opportunity to gain a broader perspective on giving.",
    "Take it. You are not going to get another chance at Yale or likely in life to have a similar experience. However, if you are not willing to put quite a bit of time into the optional sessions and meetings outside of class hours, let someone else take it instead.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar, not as a class, but as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. The high-profile guests, ability to maintain close contact with potential grantees (name your favorite nonprofit organization!), and amazing group of students who Professor Thorne assembles are all quite worth your time.That being said, it will use a lot of your time. Not necessarily for assignments, but for meetings related to class (interviews and dinners with guests, site-visits to organization(s), conference calls with potential grantees). The time is well-spent, but you have to plan for it....Oh, and you get to give away a small fortune and perhaps make a (or multiple) catalyticgrant(s) that will change certain organizations, and in that small way change the world.",
    "I am a rising senior and this was possibly the most memorable course I have ever taken at Yale. The final product at the end of the semester was not just yet another addition to academia, but made a real, tangible, important difference in the world. There is nothing better than that. It will take over your life but it's so worth it in the end.",
    "The class offered some pretty unique opportunities and was fun to talk about with people outside the class. The class organization suffered because it was the first time it was taught; hopefully that will be improved. I'd take it if you think the advertised experiences - giving away a substantial donation and learning from a number of guest speakers - excites you. However, some people found the chaos too off-putting and that colored the whole experience.",
    "This is one of the only courses at Yale that is based on a practical and hands-on approach. Be warned that there will be a lot of optional sessions (guest speaker interviews, 6-hour call conferences etc), but if you are passionate about the subject, you'll find them enjoyable and inspiring. Maxim also allows students free reign to come up with the entire decision-making framework for giving out the $100,000. This can be frustrating at first when nobody knows what to expect or what to do, but it ends up being very interesting and fulfilling and we were able to truly take ownership of our work.",
    "Shop with caution. On the one hand, there's nothing quite like a class discussion when there are thousands of dollars on the line. On the other hand, in its current form this class is kind of a logistical mess. If I could describe it in two words, they would be: memorable and frustrating.",
    "This is a crazy course. Take it. It's a once-in-a-Yale lifetime experience. You get to give away a huge sum of money to organizations and you get to engage with a lot of successful and famous philanthropists and entrepreneurs. However, the course is also often frustrating - this was the first time it was taught and there were many logistical issues. The readings were very demanding but weren't always discussed in the class. The directions for the papers were also confusing. We were expected to attend events and interviews outside of the normal class time and class would also often run over. I expect that these logistical issues will be solved for next semester, but be aware that this was a problem. The leader of the course, Maxim Thorne, is also very interesting and has a wealth of knowledge and experience to share. He will be quite demanding buthe is also very nice and approachable. Just know what you're talking about so you don't waste people's time in class, but this goes for any other class really.",
    "YESSSS!!!! Definitely take it if you get in. Friday afternoon seminars were really tough to get to, but it was well worth it to attend.",
    "If you are truly interested in learning more about philanthropy and how charitable organizations work, I would highly recommend this course. It requires a lot of out of class work and initiative to get the most from it, but it really is fascinating. It gives you an unparalleled opportunity to look at the inner-workings of the non-profit world, and you will find that most of the organizations you interact with and the interviewees are very open and willing to help. It's a great opportunity, take the course if you can.",
    "Don't let the big names and money overshadow the classroom elements of this course. While Philanthropy in Action has the potential to be an important course at Yale, I\u0092m very concerned that the high profile speakers and philanthropic donation of the course overshadow essential requirements of quality Yale courses and sound pedagogy.I believe many of the problems of the course occurred because the course tried to achieve too many objectives, but did not focus thoroughly on any one objective (meeting philanthropists, thoroughly discussing current reading of philanthropy, deciding how to give away $100,000, researching current social impact organizations, writing about philanthropy)on one hand, phil in action gives you great opportunities to really get involved and take an active role in the class, meet an incredible network of people, and practice philanthropy first hand -- unmatched by any course at yale. The speakers are awesome and really wise.But on the other hand, there were aspects of the pedagogy and the administration of this class that frustrated me a great deal. Communication with the professor was often difficult and inconsistent. We didn't receive ANY grades in the course until the second to last week of the semester and had no models\/rubric for how we would be graded. Class consistently ran over an hour or more on fridays and we were expected to arrive early and be at events during the week outside of class. We were assigned 2-3 books a week, but only talked about them a little bit -- often in a scattered way with infrequent depth or focus. We didn't determine the process of how to allocate our money until the last week of class, which meant we had a lot of inefficient and unproductive conversations and weren't able to really do due diligence when selecting our funding allocations. I often left the class feeling very frustrated about our conversations and lack of clear goals or progress.I suggest going to the first day of class, and seeing if you like it. Professor Thorne cares about this a lot -- but tries to do too much with the course in my opinion. He's really experienced in the world of philanthropy, but hasn't had a lot of experience teaching. If you like the first day of the class, go with it, but know it will be unlike any yale course you've taken and flexibility will be key."
