   "comments": [
    "This course would be greatly improved if the professors stopped talking over students. It would be better if they gave time for students to pause and reflect on questions, or ask questions that didn't require rote memorization. The professors would ask a question and immediately go into long and detailed answers. This left little room for student input. I did however, appreciate when professors gave practical advice when reading the papers. Those \"side remarks\" were actually the most useful part of the class, and I appreciated the advice. I think the best solution to the awkward silences and ratio of professor:student input would be to ask more critical thinking questions where we try to better understand the methodology in papers. It might even help to have TA's lead discussion and have professors just be available for clarification.",
    "minor point, but several hundred sheets of paper were potentially wasted by printing out the assigned readings for us. I personally never used the hard copies.",
    "I think a lot of the students were pretty introverted\/ afraid to ask silly questions\/ say the wrong thing; something that helped in a different seminar class was having notecards with people's names on them to decide who answers next\/ talks about the next figure so it doesn't fall into a common pattern. I think the variety of subjects covered was definitely a strength!"

    "since our class was small, it was basically a weekly journal club with 3 professors. discussion of the assigned papers was thorough and taken seriously, but otherwise the environment was laid back.",
    "Yes, I think this course is a great way to learn about current topics in cell biology."
