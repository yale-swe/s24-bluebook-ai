    "This course was very useful to learn effective methods for reading the literature.",
    "This course was very helpful for gaining in depth knowledge on some of the rarer, more cutting edge aspects of chemical biology. Not only that, but by having the students lead the majority of the course, it required us to be very familiar with a specific subfield and practice our lecturing skills."

    "Strength: a good class with interesting topics and great way to learn to present in an academic setting. Improve: It will be better if students are paired in groups of two for the presentation.",
    "I overall enjoyed the format of student presentations!",
    "I felt like there were no stakes in this course because every week was a student led presentation. You could do your presentation and then mentally check out for the rest of the class. However, the material was always really interesting, which keeps a lot of people engaged.",
    "I enjoyed the course format with students presenting the lecture each week.",
    "I really liked how it was mostly student taught. I think it was overall a fantastic course. I don't think I have any suggestions to improve it."

    "I would recommend this to someone who is self-motivated, has taken the first chem bio course, and really like chemical biology\/is planning on a career in chemical biology. This course gets you up to speed on a lot of the main on-going research areas in the field which is really good if you want to work in this field one day.",
    "Yes, it was an interesting selection of topics across the field.",
    "Yes. If students are interested in grasping practical and recent advances in chemical biology, this course is a great option."
