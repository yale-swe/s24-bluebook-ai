   "comments": [
    "I would recommend Physics 206 as a physics lab. The experiments, while challenging, can be very interesting. You feel like you are doing actual experiments rather than the high-school stuff of 205. There are many resources provided for 206. For example, you usually have a room to yourself for the experiment. The lab reports aren't too bad, as long as you follow the handout procedure. Be careful which labs you choose though, that will make or break this course!",
    "Much much much better than 205. Simply the fact that you can write up the labs at home makes it infinitely better. The experiments are more interesting as well, and you get to choose which ones you want to do. Try to avoid experiments involving oscilloscopes, as those machines are unreliable. The Nuclear Scattering and Reactions experiment is by far the best if only for the reason that you get to use a particle accelerator.",
    "I liked 206L better than 205L because you get to pick the labs you do. I did C1, B3, H1, H3, H4, J3, E1, and E3 which weren't too stressful in comparison to other labs and labs I would recommend if physics isn't your strongest subject like me. The lab reports are probably the worst thing about the class and require 5-7 hours each, J3 requires a bit more, however, they do allow you better control of your grade than in 205L.",
    "Physics 206L is an absolutely wonderful laboratory course. Since you only have to take data during the lab itself and have an entire week to synthesize your observations, it's much less painful than P205L. Many of the experiments are quite fun, and allow you to measure fundamental constants to a great degree of accuracy. I particularly recommend the labs that examine the electron q\/m ratio, nuclear scattering and reactions, superconductivity, and XRD. Consult your friends for additional ideas. Also, pick a fun lab partner ;) Overall, this is a great course. I most wholeheartedly recommend it.",
    "Take it if you need it for your major - the lab reports do take a while. But it is a really good class.",
    "This course is far more enjoyable than 205, so in that sense I would recommend it. However, if you are taking this course, it is likely that it is for a requirement.",
    "Physics 206L is tough to recommend. The labs are interesting and you'll learn a decent amount, but you must recognize that it's a pretty big time commitment. Even though it's only half a credit, you should expect to spend about 3.5 hours in the lab every week, and probably 4 or 5 on the writeup (if you want to do it right). I took it on a Friday, and I just found it miserable when I occasionally had to be at lab until 5:30 or 6:00 on Friday night.",
    "Its a typical lab. Nothing too earth shattering.",
    "If it's require, take it. If it's not, don't. The lab reports are really annoying; get started on them early.",
    "206 is an ok lab class, probably better than the alternatives. Weekly lab reports (usually came out to 5-6 pages) were a lot of work, but it was nice to choose your experiments. Nuclear scattering was fun--electric field plotting was not.",
    "Physics 206L is a fun and interesting course. It is a welcome break from 205L, which is rather dry, but it is also a LOT more work. Where 205L has no out-of-class work (which has its own issues), 206L has a lab report every week. The lab reports are rather time intensive, and shouldn't be taken lightly (shouldn't be taken last minute).The labs tend to be extremely interesting (e.g. playing with superconductors and SPL's particle accelerator), but some of them are rather broken, outdated, and just plain frustrating (the D-circuit labs that involve amplifiers or power supplies). These should be avoided at all costs. Talk to past students for advice on which labs work and which one's don't.Review error propagation too, or talk to your TA about it, as it will come up in almost all of your lab reports. It is the most frustrating and time consuming thing in all of your lab reports.Just be prepared for the occasional lab that doesn't work as expected.",
    "This semester is more fun by far than Physics 205L. Key to your experience is your choice of lab partner, so pick carefully if you can; taking the class with a friend can make the painful parts, often lab reports if you put them off, much less stressful. The amount of freedom afforded students in this class is high, as you can pick which labs you would like to do - it can be very helpful to consult friends who have taken this class for their suggestions if you are looking for easy, fun, or challenging labs, depending on your taste. Your TF can also make the class much better, depending on his\/her strictness in grading or regarding handing in the lab reports.",
    "If you're a physics major take it",
    "You choose some experiments to do, you find some constants or properties, and you write up what you found with uncertainty.",
    "Its more interesting thatn 205.",
    "It's required for the major, so you might not have much of a choice. But it's much more interesting than 205, and provided you pick the right labs, the workload isn't too bad.",
    "Take this class only if it's required. It's a lot of work - too much error analysis - and not very fulfilling. I'd recommend choosing Acoustic Resonance, Coupled Oscillations, Digital Logic, E-Field Plotting, Superconductivity, Physical Pendulum, and whatever else looks interesting to you.",
    "Yes. It is much more interesting than the 181 version.",
    "better than 205. more interesting but more work. don't do the power supply lab, but the acoustic waves, digital logic, proton accelerator were good.",
    "I would recommend Physics 206L to another student. The writeups can be time consuming, but the experiments are very interesting and it is fun to redo many of the classic experiments.",
    "The experiments here are definitely more interesting than the labs in 205. If you so choose, you get to play with toys from superconductors to particle accelerators to x-rays. The lab reports can be a bit tough, especially since it's not always clear what the reports are looking for, but your TA is super helpful in clarifying those points for you.",
    "If you took 205, this is not a very big jump. You already no what you are getting into. There is nothing more I can say."
