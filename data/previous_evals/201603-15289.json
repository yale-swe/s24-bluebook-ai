   "comments": [
    "For someone who has never taken an art history course, I learned how to write an art history paper. Overall a good experience.",
    "I learned how to analyze art and then tie what I see to history. A very useful skill indeed, to be a able to analyze an object and uncover so many pieces of history that have direct relevance.",
    "This course gave me a better understanding of Mexican history, going in to the various motivations for the revolution and the role of art and culture in post-revolutionary Mexico. In general, this course has taught me to better visually analyze artwork. Because of this course, I will continue to think about the relationship between nationalism and culture in my studies.",
    "Close looking at art, particularly photography. Carefully structuring essays to support a clear thesis. Balancing historical, political, and visual analysis when considering art movements. Connecting literary, film, and visual art movements. Avoiding the pitfalls of looking at everything from an \"American\" perspective and instead balancing primary and secondary sources to become immersed in contemporary Mexican perspectives.",
    "I developed knowledge all about the Mexican Renaissance and how Europe and America influenced the Mexican people and vice versa. I learned all about the tres los grandes and how they developed inspirational murals to be showcased around the globe and sent important messages.",
    "I learned to look at art in a critical way. More importantly, this class taught me how to break down the elements of an image in order to analyze it's artistic\/historical context."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I thought there were subjects in this time period we could've delved deeper into and not give so much time to Diego Rivera.",
    "This class did a good job, had a good balance of group work, whole class discussion, lecture talk, and engaging with the material. Sometimes the class would not want to talk so much in discussion so if that is the case maybe switching it up and having the class contribute in a different way.",
    "This course successfully blends art history, history, and cultural studies. I appreciated the interdisciplinary approach and the range of students that take the course. Professor Bravo uses the seminar format to create small group activities and presentations that really helped me learn new material. One aspect that could be improved is the structure of readings and themes each week. Sometimes I did not quite understand the progression from week to week.",
    "This was a truly excellent course! I appreciated the balance between primary and secondary sources, and thought there was a healthy and carefully planned balance between visual analysis and historical context. The variety of thinkers, artists, and sources helped us to develop a textured and varied approach to the revolution and its aftermath. We were never dictated what or who to believe, but experienced a variety of perspectives. Professor Bravo carefully planned each session to be engaging and different from previous ones, with productive debates, group activities, lectures, and traditional seminar discussions. I can't think of many improvements to be made. I guess at the beginning we did a fair amount of summarizing the readings, which was sometimes helpful for getting oriented to the material, but I'm glad we did less of that as the course went on and spent more time debating and discussing the course content. I'm glad we used more images at the end of the course, and would recommend doing that more in the first half of the course next time.",
    "The strengths were the really incredible readings and insightful discussions in class. I really liked going to the Art Gallery as well. The weaknesses of the class were that I thought the class could be a bit more cohesive as group."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes!!! This class was awesome, really interesting material, great professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to Art History students because it is a good way to engage with art that is not the usual canonical art that everyone talks about. I also recommend it to students interested in Mexican history.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in art history, Mexican history, or cultural history in general. Professor Bravo is an incredible teacher. I looked forward to coming to class each week! She provides many different ways to engage and structures class differently each week so that it is not monotonous. With written work, she is very accessible and provides helpful feedback.",
    "YES. This course had an usually well-balanced workload of artistic and historic sources, which made it possible to holistically evaluate the revolution and develop independent opinions and ideas about it. I absolutely loved the variety of class sessions, especially the outings to museums. I appreciated the high level of course discussion and engagement, and felt it was a model that challenged and valued the different academic backgrounds (history, polisci, art, art history, ER&M) of all the students in the course. I looked forward to this course every week, found the readings very cool (even though I had no background in some of the material), and enjoyed the positive and challenging class environment. I even made friends in the class!",
    "Yes! You don't really have to have a background or specific interest in Mexican history to enjoy this class. It is a bit more writing intensive than I thought it would be, but Professor Bravo is a always willing to help her students out if they find themselves struggling with that aspect of the class.",
    "An excellent overview of the history of La Revolucin through the lens of arts history. As someone who hadn't taken a course in either history or arts history, the class provided a safe space to begin processes such as art analysis and anthropological studies. There's a LOT of material and it's pretty cumulative, so don't fall behind. Having the opportunity to go to museums was definitely a plus!"
