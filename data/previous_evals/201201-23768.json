    "Great class. Interesting material, low workload. It has a decent amount of crossover with CPSC365. Basic micro\/game theory concepts will help but are not needed. Unlike most of the foreign professors in the economics department, Dubey has an excellent grasp of the English language.",
    "Great course! Prof. Dubey is one of the world's leading game theorists, but he makes this course quite accessible and enjoyable.",
    "If you liked Game Theory, I would definitely recommend this course. It delves deeper mathematically, but the real world applications of the material are far more interesting.",
    "Great class! Math heavy but Professor Dubey makes it manageable. He is also a fantastic lecturer and his explanations are phenomenal. Workload is standard. This is a must take class if you are interested in game theory."
