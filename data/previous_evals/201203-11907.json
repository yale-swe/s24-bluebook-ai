   "comments": [
    "I took this class having never taken linguistics before and I got a lot out of it. It's not too much work, and the professor was very clear. You'll think a bit differently about language after it. The assignments are not too long and enjoyable.",
    "Syntax is exactly what it sounds like--a class on Syntax. If you like problem solving with trees and getting into the real nitty gritty of sentence structure, you will enjoy this class. I had a fun time with the topic itself. The class had a really slow start focusing on philosophy of syntax which was tough to get through, but then once we got into the actual trees and rules and stuff, it was enjoyable. Dennis is a pretty good instructor. He has good slides and explains stuff well, very approachable. It's clear that he's a bit uncomfortable being in front of a classroom, he can't quite answer questions and respond to students in the moment successfully and he's not the most stimulating lecturer. But the material kind of works for itself so if you're interested in the subject, you can get through the class and enjoy yourself. We had problem sets every week that got more and more difficult: at first, really easily done in 1 night, later probably should've spread it out over more than 1. In the end, only the top 10 of 12 psets counted, which was nice. There was 1 take home midterm and 1 take home final, difficult but doable. Good stuff for the linguistics nerds.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH DENNIS. I don't mean to scare you away from the class itself, but I urge you to strongly consider who is teaching. Take it with Raffaella - I've heard she's wonderful! Dennis... is not. Any love for syntax I had going into the course evaporated within the first few weeks. Class is incredibly dry and basically consists of him reading the slides and making unpleasantly sarcastic comments. His grading policies were also unclear. He waited several weeks into the semester to tell us we could drop our 3 or 4 lowest problem sets (which would have been nice to know from the beginning). However, a few weeks after that, he announced that we could only drop one problem set. Also, don't schedule anything immediately after class, because it ran overtime every single day.",
    "I would recommend Syntax I to a fellow linguistics student without hesitation. The class was well organized, lectures were worthwhile, and homework assignments were difficult but not overwhelming. The overall workload for the course was a perfect balance between theoretical readings and problem sets, and the option for an essay as opposed to the final take home exam was a gracious option. Prof. Storoshenko was an engaging lecturer who was consistently available outside of class for further discussion or practice. In sum, Syntax I was an excellent course and met all expectations."
