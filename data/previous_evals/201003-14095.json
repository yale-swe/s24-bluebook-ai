   "comments": [
    "It's kind of boring, but if you feel like you need to review Spanish grammar before taking a literature or more advanced\/intensive course, I would definitely recommend it. If it's the last class you think you'll ever take in Spanish, I would recommend Advanced Conversational.",
    "This is a class for students who have a good grasp of Spanish, but want to refine their skills. It would be a good class to take (perhaps in addition to Conversational) for people who want to reach an L5 proficiency and feel confident in the language. After the class, immersion or further study would still be needed to really reach fluency.",
    "This course is not ideal for an \"easy\" fourth or fifth credit. If you shop the class and feel like the material is simply review, be forewarned that it gets more difficult and rigorous as the semester progresses. That being said, as long as you put time into doing all the homework thoughtfully, it's completely doable. And, honestly, I feel more fluent in conversation after taking this class than I did after taking Advanced Spanish Conversation \u0097 the confidence that comes from a solid understanding of grammar goes a long way!",
    "If you are interested in improving your Spanish Grammar, you should definitely take this course. The work load is greater than that of Advanced Conversational Spanish. This course might not help you improve your spoken very much though. If that's what you want to do, than you'd rather take conversational Spanish.",
    "Recommend if you want more practice writing and re-writing with a close, grammatical eye. Do not recommend if you have studied abroad, and would like to keep up your speaking.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Professor Seymour is the best.",
    "If you want to improve your Spanish grammar, ( to speak read and write better), take it. There is a lot of work, but it pays off. If you just want to fulfill your L5 the easiest way possible, I wouldn't recommend taking it. But if you are actually interested in improving your spanish, you should definitely take it."
