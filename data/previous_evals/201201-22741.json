    "Unfortunately, shopping period is a bit misguiding and doesn't show you what exactly this class will be like. After shopping period, the class gets very theoretical and Prof. Pogge stops using slides and classes become a bit unorganized and difficult to follow.Section was a great experience though! I didn't drop the class only because our discussions in section were always so insightful!",
    "I would recommend this course. It explores issues of geopolitical politics in a new, introspective light.",
    "This class has you grappling with international ethics and what we as privileged citizens of a developed country can do to help alleviate the problems of the world. This class gives you a great background in ethics, has you thinking about utilitarianism and consequentialism and makes you question some of your beliefs. I thought the course was great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants to be challenged to defend their point of view and potentially change their mind on how countries can alleviate the problems of the world.",
    "Heavy heavy workload. Be prepare to work really hard if you decide to take this class but if you are committed then you will get a very good sample of all the important issues on international affairs.",
    "I am very confused as to why this course has so many good reviews. Don't be fooled like I was! The lectures are appalling. Pogge is boring and disorganized, but Lindlauer is in a league of his own. Totally incompetent. The reading is interesting at times, but really, if you want to learn about this stuff just buy the books (or better yet, use Google, all the good essays are on line). The lectures add nothing, the midterm is a frustrating test of your writing speed (50 minutes to answer six short questions and two essay questions), and the other students are terrible at philosophy. Maybe take this as a freshman who wants a philosophy class but can't get into something better. Otherwise, stay the hell away.",
    "If you're really interested in international\/global affairs, from a philosophical standpoint, this class is interesting. Be prepared to put a lot of time into it with the readings.",
    "Yes, this is a great course that really makes you think about how the world operates, the ethicality of the systems we take for granted, and our roles in supporting that system and our responsibilities toward others in our own countries and in the rest of the world. There's plenty of practical, real world application to the philosophical conclusions drawn from this course.",
    "This is a course that teaches you to consider different, contradictory moral approaches to issues of global importance like poverty, environmental change, public health, war, and other issues. I would certainly recommend the course. It teaches students how to go beyond practicality and consider ethicality, something that students don't necessarily always do unprompted. The class has changed the way I'll view any policy decisions - I'll be much more wary of their moral implications and their effect on others besides myself.",
    "Be prepared for a philosophy course and nothing else - not political science and not international studies. Pogge is obviously very renowned in the field and has a lot of interesting ideas but there is also a lot to do throughout the semester- section, a midterm, a final, and two papers.",
    "Yes",
    "I would highly recommend this class, but only as an introductory course. I took it after having taken many higher-level seminars, and I found the pace a bit slow. Pogge is great and hugely influential, but a little dry. Take a seminar with him, instead.",
    "Good course if you're interested in philosophy and international affairs. The lectures are basically explanations and opinions on the readings. If you're not interested in this, DON'T take it!",
    "If you do not like philosophy but want a poli sci class, DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS. It is focused heavily on philosophical frameworks and not real world problems.",
    "recommend",
    "While the course material leans very liberal (with a focus on poverty, equality, and human rights as international issues) and realists\/nationalists should prepare to be outnumbered, the course focuses on how to construct and articulate a strong philosophical argument rather than telling you what to think. Extremely interesting introduction to the ethical roots of international affairs, with a bearable workload.",
    "Sure, if you like Philosophy. If you're looking to learn a little about a little political theory, take it Credit\/D like me!",
    "A interesting and unique class in political philosophy. If you can handle the dry lectures, then its worth taking.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course! IF Gilad is still a TF, definitely be in his he's the best!",
    "It's an introduction to a huge number of philosophic concepts. It is a little overwhelming and sometimes boring but I do feel like I came away from the class with new perspectives on a few contentious, modern-day issues.",
    "Fascinating course. Definitely changed my perspective on issues like aid, climate, and trade. Take it!",
    "This class is a fantastic exposure to the issue of global poverty and the scholarly thought surrounding it. I am not a philosophy major, so the focus on applied ethics in this course made it feel much more important and relevant than some other pie-in-the-sky philosophy courses I have taken in the past. Thomas Pogge is a big deal, and his class is worth the hype. The readings can be a bit much at times, but it's not necessary to do all of them, and overall the class is only slightly above average difficulty for a Yale course.This course fundamentally changed my view of the world and my own place in it, and made global poverty feel morally relevant to me in a way that I had never before realized. Every Yale student should be required to take this course. An understanding of these issues is so critical to being an informed citizen and a decent human being.",
    "Take it, but understand what you're getting yourself into. It's a philosophy course that goes over liberal theories of international affairs in a pretty comprehensive way. So each week, you read dense but fascinating philosophers talk about just war and foreign aid and the like, then hear Thomas Pogge explain them in more manageable terms.You'll never get a non-liberal perspective, but you will get a rare opportunity to dig in deep on a certain way of thinking about the world in order to refine what you think and why about how to approach the world. Personally, the course has caused me to have a temporary lapse in faith at the power of philosophy to deal with any of this shit, but it was a fine ride anyway.",
    "The material of this course is extremely interesting and important. Students gain a truly comprehensive understanding of real-world challenges of immigration, third-world poverty, climate change from an ethical framework. That said, I think the class could be improved by changing its format to a seminar. I gained most from our discussion section. Unfortunately these were only once a week and too brief to cover every topic on the syllabus -- in fact, we only covered approximately one half of the class material in section. The group project element of the class has potential, but certainly needs further thought as those involved students often lacked guidance and direction in their work.",
    "Ethics and International Affairs provides an interesting opportunity to discuss the philosophy behind current international issues. Professor Pogge is a good lecturer and the TAs were very helpful. The topics covered (global poverty, war, immigration etc.) are interesting and important, but most of the readings and lectures are focused on theory rather than real world examples, which can get a bit frustrating at times."
