    "I learned how to develop my eye as a photographytake pictures that I ordinarily would not take that pushed my sense of artistryand how to edit photos. Editing photos and printing them was a huge part of this class.",
    "Better understanding of camera basics and photoshop",
    "By taking this class, the student learns the mechanics of how to make a picture and edit a picture on photoshop and print the photo that the artist wants to print. I also learned how to make a photograph, what process goes through an artists mind when making a photograph and how to best communicate through the means of photography. This class also teaches students how to analyze an critique a photograph both for subject matter and form. I left this class better able to critically analyze visual media. I also now know many of the most influential photographers, what their contributions were and how they fit into a larger history of photography."

   "comments": [
    "This course was well suited toward developing knowledge on what photography can be or how photography can influence our mode of seeing. This course was strong in teaching about the artistry of photography. Where I think it could be improved is the pacing of the course. Often in editing sessions, it seemed like the steps for how to do a particular thing in Photoshop was rushed; I found myself watching the professor take all these minute steps in order to edit a photo to remember what she did rather than following along.",
    "A safe place to explore art yet sometimes photoshop lessons were rushed"

    "This course is a lot of work. Be prepared to spend several hours at a time in the DMCA or out with your camera because that is what is required of this course in order to get the full value. I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking for a challenge and is willing to express their point of view in larger social issues through photography.",
    "Yes",
    "Yeah if your trying to improve your photography skills or develope in a supportive yet critical artistic environment this is the class for you.",
    "Yes I would most definitely recommend this class particularly when taught by Ka-Man. She is a wonderful professor who really listens to and cares about the learning process of her students. This class was a lot of work but also an incredible amount of fun. We take so many photographs on a daily basis, this class is a wonderful opportunity to more deeply engage with photography as a medium; its limits and its power."
