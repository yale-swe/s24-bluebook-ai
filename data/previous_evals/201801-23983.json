   "comments": [
    "It was okay, not super interesting but not totally boring.",
    "I was excited for this course because the content is interesting and useful. However, I do not feel I gained additional knowledge by the end of this course.",
    "Strengths: -High level \/ zoomed out perspective of the foundations of health systems and how they function in local contexts -Great teaching!",
    "Overall great, would've been nice to discuss more cases.",
    "Couldve been more in-depth",
    "The course has a very interesting topic with a lot of potential. Assignments and workload were fair and well paced. I really wish the class was a little more engaging, and especially that the lectures\/slides had more gripping real-life examples rather than having a textbook-feel. It made lectures a little less interesting than I had expected they would be, and I think could be easily approved upon with a more real life rather than abstract focus.",
    "More time could be spent discussing cases - more regular assignments could make learning the content have greater continuity.",
    "Fantastic course. Very interactive. You will emerge with a solid foundation of main types of health systems, and an understanding of the strengths and weakness of each.",
    "Very good content. Felt redundant at times though.",
    "The class was disorganized and lectures were fragmented and slides didnt differ at all from the textbook. The class would benefit from a restructuring, perhaps with each week being a different countrys healthcare system.",
    "Fantastic course, although at times it felt too high level to be actionable. Got some great insights on what to do as I think about healthcare in the US moving forward.",
    "Very comprehensive overview of components that comprise a health system, as well as examples of health systems across the world.",
    "Great course!",
    "better if reflect more reading material in class. otherwise there is not a strong motivation to do the reading"

    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Informative and kind.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is kind, easy to talk to, and knowledgeable. Although the class was very discussion based, I was frustrated when the instructor was asked an opinion or stance on an issue and it was usually met with an \"it depends\" or non-definitive answer that did not help further my learning.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Fun lecturer - engages students well. Kind. Passionate and knowledgable about subject matter. Uses different exercises (break-out groups, small activities, etc.) to keep lectures interesting.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Great teaching ability and enthusiasm for the subject.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima is clearly an incredible person to know and a delight to speak to. It did not seem that his heart was in teaching the class this semester, perhaps. With more dedication and commitment to the class I think it would be greatly improved.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0I really like the instructor and his teaching style.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Fantastic! Friendly, knowledgeable and encouraging. I learned a lot from Professor Ndumele.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0A cool professor, shared a good rapport with the students and keeps things interesting in class.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Super nice but didnt plan the lectures much ahead of time",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0I really enjoyed his teaching style. I think professors who challenge students on their ideas, especially within an industry like healthcare where trade offs are necessary, was refreshing.",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0strengths: -good at keeping students engaged through open discussion during lecture weaknesses: -Each lecture was WAY too packed, could either remove details of some topics or better organize lectures to make them less dense, as some weeks it felt as though the instructor sacrificed organization for the sake of keeping on top of the schedule",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0Chima was one of the most dynamic instructors of my time in YSPH! He was engaging and made sure students thought critically about health systems structure and care delivery. He made the class a great balance of lecture and small group discussions. He was also very open to student feedback and suggestions!",
    "Instructor: Chimaeze Ndumele \u00a0excellent"

    "I probably would not recommend it because it was quite boring at times.",
