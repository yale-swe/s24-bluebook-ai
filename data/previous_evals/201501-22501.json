   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommended! Lots of work at times, less at other times, but all very useful and a great way to learn Arabic.",
    "Take this course if you are willing to commit a LOT of your time, and are genuinely interested in studying arabic. It is challenging, but rewarding if you stick it out! ONLY take it with Sarab, NOT with Professor Aziz- he is painfully disorganized and a frustratingly bad teacher. You'd be better off just reading a textbook than taking arabic with Professor Aziz. Sarab, though, is an OUTSTANDING teacher! she is engaging, exciting, and challenging all at once!",
    "It's a simple, good course that is very rewarding for Arabic progression.",
    "Obviously, people only take Arabic 120 after doing 110 and are intending to continue at least until 130, etc etc. The course works as designed: you learn to read, write, and speak Arabic. The class can be really great, but it really depends on which teacher you end up with - I lucked out and got the good teacher, so I a) have had fun in class and b) can actually speak Arabic. I'm not exaggerating when I say that my class (aka the \"good\" class) is miles ahead of the classes taught by the other professor. Also, they recently redid the curriculum, so section in a dialect (Shaami, we don't get a decision) is required - which, frankly, is pretty stupid. It's hard enough learning Modern Standard Arabic, and then we're supposed to memorize an entirely different way of communicating before we can even speak in MSA! Not a fan of that aspect, for sure.",
    "I would recommend it if you take it with this Professor. I had Mohammed Aziz last semester and it was not a good experience. He doesn't know where we are at with our language abilities and he was not nearly as prepared for class or prepared to answer student questions. Arabic is a beautiful language, and Sarab's class will teach it to you. I recommend that for sure, but only if students know they're getting themselves into a huge time commitment!",
    "This class was very difficult for me, but quite worthwhile. I recommend getting a tutor if you're doing badly because they're free and are very helpful. One saved my grade.",
    "Great class! If you get Professor Al Ani you're set! It's a lot of work, but definitely worth it.",
    "You'll most likely be taking this if you took 110. It's more of the same material with a bit more grammar and speaking practice but overall not too much that's new. Sarab is a great professor, and if you're willing to put in the work, I highly recommend the class.",
    "120 is a continuation of 110. Grammar and vocabulary continue to be introduced at a high rate, but naturally this class is slightly less difficult than L1 because of the learning curve of languages. My workload went down a bit from first semester (still quite high) but that is not to say the class has lower expectations; I just got better at Arabic. Like 110 it is a great class but you need to be committed to doing what it takes to master the material if you are to get anything out of it.",
    "ARBC 120 is challenging, but with Sarab's help and a lot of hours of homework per week, it is very manageable. I would recommend it to anyone who has enough of a passion (or a mission) to be willing to ask for help in addition to be willing to put in the effort. Remember, Sarab is key.",
    "I would summarize it as a difficult course, but worth taking.",
    "Definitely take this class with Sarab if you want to actually learn arabic while you'e at Yale. She's an amazing professor, and my impression was that you learn much more in her class than from other professors teaching at the same level in the department.",
    "It's a difficult class, but if you're up to the challenge it's well worth it."
