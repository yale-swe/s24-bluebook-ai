   "comments": [
    "I would strongly encourage fellow students to take this class, if they can handle spending many hours on insane loop integrals. It's the kind of class where you really have to put in quite a lot of effort to fully understand what's going on, but if you're interested in fundamental physics, it's absolutely worthwhile.",
    "hard course. but your mind will be blown.",
    "QFT2 is essential for understanding the underpinnings of the standard model. However, QFT is a very large field, and there are many techniques that must be learned before any details of the SM can even be addressed. It is a wonderful course if this matches your expectations."

   "comments": [
    "As a graduate student conducting research on experimental BSM physics, my primary interest was in understanding how our knowledge of the symmetries of nature constrains the kind of fields and interactions we can add to the standard model. This is crucial to fully appreciating the motivation behind my experiment, and will doubtless be helpful in writing the introduction to my thesis.",
    "some ideas (renormalization) are useful i suppose.",
    "This course exposed me to many modern research questions, and going forward as a particle experimentalist, it provided a strong base of knowledge. I feel that I now have a decent general framework of particle physics, and I plan to keep building on my understanding."
