   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wants to take an L5 class but doesn't want to do too much work. For someone who wants to actually learn more Spanish, however, you should take a different class.",
    "SPAN 150 is the class you take if you are wan to \"warm-up\" your Spanish before taking more difficult classes. Your Spanish won't improve. It'll stay at its current level. Take this class for that and an easy, nice grade, but for nothing more.",
    "Spanish 150 is a relatively low-key class for improving conversational Spanish skills. It's pretty easy, although the oral exams take a bit of work.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone who honestly cares about Spanish or wants to improve their speaking skills. The class is entirely too big and for that reason it is a joke. Only the most out-spoken students will have an opportunity to speak in class (because they will dominate the conversation) and those who are meeker will not speak very much.When the class is broken into smaller groups to speak, there is very little correction by the teacher. Therefore, the only other format of the class proves to be ineffective.Simplyput, if you just want to take the easiest L5 Spanish course and get your language requirements fulfilled, take this course. However, if you actually care about the Spanish language or want to improve\/maintain your speaking skills, this is not the course for you. Unless you can find a class that has about 10 people in it.",
    "This was a good course because it kept me in practice speaking Spanish, but I'm honestly not sure if it made me much better at Spanish. We covered many interesting topics and class was usually pretty enjoyable although sometimes the professor would start talking for long periods of time.",
    "I would recommend it if the student wants to improve their speaking skills and\/or fulfill their language requirement. But don't think it's an easy course. I took it to fulfill my requirement and I ended up spending lots of time on homework assignments and preparing for oral exams. It's not easy but probably worthwhile.",
    "This is course is alright for practicing your spanish and there is minimal work. You are in the class to speak spanish, not to learn about grammar. In my spanish section, the teacher did not allow you to speak enough, so I would not suggest taking it with her. This is a good class, the teacher is critical to how good it is though.",
    "The course gives you a place to practice your Spanish. There is not the same rigorous memorization that you may have seen in earlier Spanish classes. There is nothing particularly exciting about it, but nothing particularly bad either.",
    "Supposed to help you speak spanish, but effectiveness is limited because of the weird framework of the class. the course doesnt seem to be serious about getting people talking, focusing instead on an odd patchwork of units and readings. could be good with the right teacher though.",
    "I think that before taking this class you should think really hard about what you want to get out of a spanish class. If you feel really solid in your grammatical concepts but get nervous when speaking, or feel like you get tongue-tied, then definitely take this class. It's fairly non-strenuous, the professor is very relaxed and supportive and doesn't criticize you if you say something wrong, and the class is very casual in its style. It might feel like you're not really learning anything, since you just do readings and then discuss them in class, but looking back on it, my spoken spanish has really improved. And more than that, it's just a really really great setting to lose the fear of speaking -no one is judging you, so you stop being so nervous and holding yourself back, which is really the point of the class. If that's what you're looking for, then this class is phenomenal.",
    "Take this class if you're looking for a way to maintain your Spanish. I didn't feel like I improved a lot from the class, but it's an easier L5 course and Profesora Tortora is fun to talk to and a pretty fair grader.",
    "The name of this class says it all. If you want to work on your conversational skills and become more comfortable speaking in a one-on-one or group setting, take it. And take it with Tortora! She is a great person and teacher.",
    "It is a course completely based on speaking Spanish with fellow students of approximately the same Spanish level.",
    "Spanish 150 is the natural next step after L4. I would recommend it if you want to learn obscure vocabulary, but given the chance, I would probably pick a different L5 level class.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student."
