   "comments": [
    "This course was great in terms of getting more comfortable with formal writing. Please take it with Professor Johnston Gordon if you do. However, if you do take the \"Faking it\" course, then be weary that it will be more about art than con men and counterfeiting etc. There are 4 papers (3 lighter papers and 1 research paper) which are very doable.",
    "\"Faking it\" is great because it's such a broad topic you can adapt it to your interests and it leaves you viewing the world in a different way.",
    "I would recommend this course but it is not easy. Other english sections will have easier grading and you might be very frustrated. You will have fun in this section though.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. Over the semester I watched as my writing vastly improved. That said, there is a great deal of work, so do not take that lightly. There are writing assignments due for each class in addition to the four papers which you will work on rather intensively. If you want to see where you stand in terms of writing ability or would like to improve your skills then this is your course. If you want an easy WR credit then look elsewhere.",
    "This class is great for learning how to better your academic writing skills. What you learn in this class will be helpful for more than the semester than you are taking it.",
    "A great way to learn how to properly write an essay with an interesting topic.",
    "Seminar class that teaches you how to be critical of your own writing and others' writing. It does this so that you can learn how to formulate an effective academic argument."
