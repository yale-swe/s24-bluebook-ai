    "Yes, I would recommend it if you are interested in the Earth sciences science. It is a broad overview of everything you should know, but through the essays\/paper presentations you get to explore your favorite part about Earth science.",
    "Fantastic class. Two papers (one medium, one long) on topics of your choice. Nightly reading. Amazing, must take. Wow.",
    "Earth System Science was an amazingly interesting course; the material was very relevant and students were given the freedom to explore the material and channel it into whatever they were interested in.",
    "This was a great class despite being early and far away. I would definitely recommend it, especially to anyone looking for a science credit that's manageable without being a gut. It was really interesting, the professor was great, and I felt like I learned a lot!",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course, both for G&G majors and non-science majors. If you're looking to just get a science credit out of the way, I recommend it, because earth science is the coolest science.",
    "Take it!",
    "Would recommend; better than a lecture where you're anonymous and have to cram for exams. It's great to be able to ask questions directly when in class.",
    "This is a great class for science and non-science majors. Professor Park is engaging and funny, and class discussions can be great if everyone participates. The midterm and final paper are challenging but rewarding if you pick a topic that really interests you.",
    "Earth system dynamics is a very relaxed, fun class mostly because of Professor Park's casual style. There are scientific articles to read and present (you need to present six a semester) that cover a broad range of topics in earth science and environmental science, so everyone seems to find at least some of the topics very interesting. Two essays, no tests. Textbook is actually worth reading."
