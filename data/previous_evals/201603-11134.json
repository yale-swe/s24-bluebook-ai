    "This class is an excellent overview of Shakespeare's body of work, influences, and cultural significance. In particular, however, studying Shakespeare with Dr. Bloom is very enlightening with regard to what truly dedicated lifelong scholarship means. In light of that, I would say that, although the more explicit subject matter of the course definitely delivered, the real point of the class is to get to know Dr. Bloom.",
    "An amazing opportunity to approach Shakespeare's plays from a character-centric perspective, and to learn what (and how) Prof. Bloom thinks about the evolution of Shakespeare's dramatic powers.",
    "This course offers a very specific insight into Shakespeare: Harold Bloom's reading of the Bard, and in particular how many different ways he can find to relate Falstaff to each play. That being said, learning about Harold Bloom's reading of the Bard is obviously one of the most world-class ways you can learn about Shakespeare, so each class was fascinating and intellectually stimulating, even if it differed from how I personally might have interpreted the play."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: well-curated syllabus. Dr. Bloom knows each work inside and out. Weaknesses: Dr. Bloom is not in good health, and discussion can suffer on behalf of that. Unfortunately, there is nothing to be done about this except to encourage the students to carry through discussions more deliberately.",
    "An incredible experience overall. I am truly grateful for the opportunity.",
    "The only weakness of this course is that if your reading of a certain play differs from Professor Bloom's, it's not likely to be entertained -- especially if your reading has a feminist or postcolonial spin, for example. But if you want to learn about an absolutely brilliant, erudite reading of specific plays -- and then engage with that interpretation on your own or with your classmates -- then this is a terrific class. Professor Bloom is obviously not to be missed."

   "comments": [
    "It is absolutely worthwhile to take any course with Harold Bloom, and learning Shakespeare at the same time is a great package deal. This may be the highlight of my Yale academic career.",
    "It's Shakespeare, with Harold Bloom. If that's not reason enough to take this course, what is?",
    "Yes! You simply must take this course if you get in. A once-in-a-lifetime experience. Prof. Bloom is an incredible instructor and really cares for his students. He'll inspire you in a number of ways.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about Harold Bloom's take on Shakespeare and no other. But, of course, Harold Bloom's take on Shakespeare is one of the most influential in the world. So it's quite worth learning.",
    "Bloom is a legend and it's a privilege to learn from him class discussion, which he mainly dominates, is always fascinating and never goes the way you'd expect. He asks students to come to office hours on the weekends pretty much every week. But he gets tired pretty quickly, so if you catch him on a bad week, class might be cut short."
