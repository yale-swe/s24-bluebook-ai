   "comments": [
    "Very chill professor, interesting reading list.Two five-page reading responses, two ten-page papers. All on whatever you want, which is pretty fun.Discussions were sometimes slow because our class size was small, but that could easily change.",
    "This class is basically just a book club. Or maybe that's just how english classes work...The books are interesting, but class doesn't add anything. The grade is basically just the papers (2 4pg and 2 10 pg) and Berger is very into helping with them (and handing out A's if you let him guide you). There's a good deal of reading, but it's enjoyable and a great way to procrastinate other classes. Class was small, only 6 or 7 people.",
    "Overall it was a great experience! It was more than just a class on \"end times\" but also brought to light different issues and consequences of the apocalypse. I would definitely recommend this class to other students as it was an interesting experience and wasn't too demanding for a seminar.",
    "I'd recommend it if students have an affinity for the material covered. I would say it was a very manageable workload and fairly engaging."
