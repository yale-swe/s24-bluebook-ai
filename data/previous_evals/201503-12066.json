   "comments": [
    "French 309 is a good introduction to French theories of consumerism. Cadieu always makes her explanations clear and assigns reasonable amounts of readings, and she makes a lot of effort giving comments on papers. Nevertheless, this is a writing class, and it's important to question whether one's writing actually develops. There are very limited choices in terms of topics to write about: there are only 2 or 3 options, or sometimes just 1, for each paper. Sometimes the passage to be analyzed is picked out in advance, giving students little autonomy to explore specific areas which they're interested in. The goal of each paper is \"close reading\", which may differ from what you understand that term to be in other English classes--it often seems to be just stating the obvious at great length in this class. You may find yourself wishing that the class offered an opportunity to explore a concept in greater detail instead of doing a close analysis of sentences and passages in each essay.",
    "An interesting course of French consumerist culture studied in the context of 4 novels and a variety of scholarly text from Marx to Benjamin to Barthes. I would recommend it to anyone whose interested in economics but also enjoys close reading of literature.",
    "If you can get over the fact that you'll be close-reading texts in translation (and that close-reading will be the main focus of most of your own work in the course), this might be the class for you. I would say this class is about 40% literature, 30% theory and 20% film. It's a broad look at consumerism and capitalist culture in France since the industrial revolution. Though some of the writing exercises are a bit unnecessary, you'll gain an exposure of everyone from Agnes Varda and Annie Ernaux to Barthes and Baudrillard. Of course, Prof. Cadieu is brilliant and very helpful don't hesitate to talk to her at any point!",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The reading is interesting for the most part and the writing is not too heavy if you are looking for a writing credit. It is an interesting topic to consider and not something we think a lot about in other classes. I would definitely recommend! I loved the novels we read.",
    "You learn a lot of textual devises, which can be interesting as an art form. The reading is interesting, though sometimes superfluous."
