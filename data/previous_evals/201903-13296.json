    "I learned to speak eloquently about social forces, modernity, cultural relativism, structural privilege, key philosophers, and the problem of social order.",
    "It's a great introduction to sociological theory and what exactly sociology assesses.",
    "Intro to Sociology taught me a completely different perspective on how to analyze society and its forces upon the individual. I learned a massive amount of intro-level information about the basics of sociology, which I imagine will be extremely useful should I take any more sociology courses in the future. This class introduces key sociological thinkers, theories, key terms, and research methods that will benefit anyone in their academic experience at Yale.",
    "foundations of sociology how to read a sociological paper and understand the methods etc",
    "A wide variety of topics covered in sociology; a great intro for someone who has never taken sociology before",
    "I strengthened my basic understandings of Sociology. I learned a great deal about important thinkers and their theories.",
    "I learned the basics of sociology-- methods, topics, and how to write a paper.",
    "I think I got a good background knowledge of the classic sociologists. A good intro to writing sociologically.",
    "I learned about many theories and theorists of sociology, I can analyze behaviors of groups of people on a deeper level, and I have a better understanding of the reasons cultures and societies act, think, and function the way they do today.",
    "I honed in my ability to read academic papers, and I also learned how to write an academic paper. Sociology also taught me a lot about how to think critically about the world.",
    "Intro to sociology and basic research methods",
    "I learned how social factors play a role in not just individual decision making but also in symbolic interactions.",
    "I learned facts through rote memorization.",
    "I learned a large breadth of knowledge about the sociological field. I felt like I was learning a completely different topic each day, yet there were strings that connected them all. I also developed skills in reading journal articles and using them in my writing.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: scope of topics, applicability\/universality of material Weaknesses: 1. presentation slides 2. examinations (I felt they prompted us a little too much to simply memorize and regurgitate rather than engage creatively with our take-aways)",
    "Highly informative, very engaging, overall great course. My only complaint is that the first essay assignment was a bit difficult to understand.",
    "This course is highly engaging. I found all of the lectures interesting, and section was very helpful as well. The readings always felt relevant to the content covered in lecture, which made it easier to get through a sometimes heavy workload. The only drawback is that it is very memorization-heavy, but if this is something you're good at then this course is for you.",
    "strengths: professor was very engaging, the information was very interesting and most of the readings were. the professors and TFs were awesome in helping us with everything. overall loved this class weaknesses: it wouldve helped to have some notes or something sent out or the powerpoints shared with us to help us. he had to talk really fast in class to get through all the info (not necessarily his fault), but it was hard to keep up sometimes. also wouldve helped to have a little more guidance on the midterm paper in terms of what they were looking for - they explained it but i did not understand the overall point of the response paper very well.",
    "Reading material was great, lectures super interesting",
    "Strengths: professor and TFs are very committed to the class and are very nice. Weaknesses: --Too much information. We were significantly behind every lecture. Half the class was the previous lecture and the other half was the lecture we were supposed to be on. This made it hard to connect the content of a single lecture together. There was also a ton of information covered. I understand that they wanted to cover as much of basic sociology as possible, but I think spending more time explaining a few concepts would be better than spending 30 seconds on 100 concepts. There is a lot to memorize and try to understand which makes the class not so fun to be in. --Presentation. The powerpoint slides did not have much on them and were not posted on canvas. There were usually very few slides per lecture but we spent a lot of time on each slide. The slides only really contained random words, so it was sometimes hard to know what part of the slide the professor was talking about. My notes constantly had gaps in them from going too fast and not knowing what bullet point we would be on and there is no way to check what I've missed because the slides don't get posted. The presentations also had no pictures or videos or anything to illustrate points and make things more interesting. I am a visual learner and the presentations made understanding the information extremely difficult. --Assignments. I truly don't understand why the grades were broken down the way they were. For midterm (10%), there was an exam AND a paper (20%) due relatively close to each other. This was okay--annoyingly close to each other and the midterm was worth a very small percentage of the grade for some reason. The bulk of the grade is from the final paper and final exam...... The final paper (38%) was due at the end or reading period and then the cumulative final exam was a few days later (25%). Over 60% of your grade is determined within a week. This is cruel. We also completed reading questions each week that weren't graded, but would have been nice if they had been to ensure that we answered them correctly. --Exams. The exams were all written. The revision guide posted probably has over 100 questions. There is a ton of memorization, but the exam questions require a pretty in-depth understanding of the questions. I like that there is some choice involved in the questions, but I wish there was more guidance on what we should be focusing on while studying. I don't think the professor understands that there is still a need for memorization, even when just 'hitting the talking points'. I also don't understand how the exams were graded. I had points taken off without indication of what was wrong.",
    "I loved this class. I feel as if the material was excellent. I do feel as if the first midterm could have been written better so that the students had enough time to prove their retention of the information, rather than how fast they can scribble the answers.",
    "The homework was reading two sociology papers per week, which was much better than a textbook. A good distribution of topics.",
    "The course covered a lot but was stronger when it came to any topics in sociology that had to do with white male figures. A good background in the classic teaching of sociology but was very weak whenever race or inequality were introduced. Lectures on race, stratification and poverty, education, and social movements could sometimes be really awkward because the professor didn't know as much and would make incorrect and sometimes ignorant statements.",
    "The content was very interesting, but lectures felt a bit disorganized and hasty. The powerpoints did not make much sense, which made it more difficult to follow along. The essays, exam questions, and grading seemed very arbitrary and expectations were often unclear.",
    "One weakness was that the material went quickly in class, and as such, it could be difficult to follow.",
    "It was very interesting material, but the classes felt scattered and it was hard to connect all of the people and ideas to make it all feel like one class. Additionally, I wish the class had been structured so that most of the grade was not all determined by the last 2 weeks of class, it was a lot to have both a final paper and full length final exam.",
    "Every lecture was very engaging and I enjoyed sitting in class. Sometimes the lectures stretched over the given time frame and we were cut for time.",
    "The reading guides were all over the place and sometimes could be completed by reading the first three pages of the reading. Another weakness is the lack of POC thinkers, for a survey course you think it would be possible for us to discuss more than the same five white guys.",
    "The course had many strengths. The lectures were very interesting. The homework was not busy work. One weakness was that I think the final paper was weighted too heavily (40%) compared to the final test (25%) or midterm test (10%).",
    "the professor was very engaging and the material was interesting. The sections were well run. I believe that we could have covered less topics to get into greater depth with each one.",
    "Interesting content."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Such an integral course, even just to be an informed and self-cognizant human being. People don't take a look in the mirror nor consider the extent of their socialization enough.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is remotely interested in the many facets of our society",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning new perspectives about the nature of society. Even non-sociology majors can gain valuable insights that will be useful to future learning.",
    "I would. It was very interesting and i think in the future now that its been taught once it will be even better. the only things i didn't like were that the readings sometimes took a long time, but once you get how to skim them and get all the info it becomes a lot better. The only work was weekly readings you discuss at section and a midterm and final exam and paper, which was all very manageable, especially if you take good notes (esp on readings as they happen) and just start things ahead of time. There were a lot of names and stuff that you have to know which is hard to memorize, but doable.",
    "Yes! Professor Smith and the TFs are very knowledgeable and always have something interesting to cover. They specialize in very interesting fields and give clear feedback",
    "This was the first time teaching the course, so I'm sure there will be some changes in the future. I would definitely shop it because it is interesting content, but there were a lot of problems that need to be addressed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. The philosophers we learned about in this class are ones that are very helpful to know going forward at Yale and in engaging in intelligent conversation.",
    "I would be hesitant to recommend the course to someone who wants a well rounded introduction to sociology because it was so lopsided knowledgewise. If the course was stronger on race and inequality I would whole-heartedly recommend it but unfortunately the blatant lack of caring\/knowledge when it came to any topic that had to do with race and inequality makes it hard to recommend.",
    "If you want to see what sociology is like, take it. It is a little monotonous, but the content is interesting and you will be able to look at cultures and societies in new and interesting ways. There is a solid amount of reading and memorizing the the exams, but if you are willing to do that then this course can be rewarding for you.",
    "Yes! It was my favorite class, and really teaches you a lot about the world, and gives you the answer to they \"why\" behind many questions. Also, Professor Smith is absolutely great--I was always engaged in the class.",
    "Yes I would, but I would warn them about the structure of the grades in the course.",
    "Yes it was a great course and you learn a lot.",
    "Sometimes the instructor made weird comments (once joking about pedophelia), misgendered an author a few times, and could not speak on race if his life depended on it. So no.",
    "I would recommend this course. I feel like I learned more in this course than I did in all my other courses combined. It was incredibly interesting, but not too difficult.",
    "Yes if they want to better understand the field of sociology.",
    "Yes. I enjoyed sections with both TFs and I enjoyed writing assignments."
