    "Math 115 is exactly what it advertises itself as. I wouldn't rave about it to another student, but I definitely wouldn't discourage him or her from taking it. Don't be afraid to shop around the sections, find someone whose grading policies are fair and whom you can really understand. There's no point in taking a math course if you think you might walk out more confused than when you walked in.",
    "Youtube math videos make this class so much easier, not even kidding.",
    "If you have to take a calculus class for your major, take 112, even if you've already done AP Cal BC in high school. Seriously.",
    "You have to find a good TA if you want to get anything out of the course and don't want to end up teaching yourself. Final is really hard. Generally fair class.",
    "If Miriam Logan is teaching it, you must definitely take it!",
    "Take it if you really like calculus or if you have to.",
    "Make sure you get a good TA. Shop around.",
    "Math 115 is challenging. I took BC in high school and wish I had decided to take 120 at Yale. Problem sets are hard and tests are not easy, so you might as well struggle through 120 because even if you took BC in high school you will not think the class is easy.",
    "standard math class at Yale. If you do the problem sets and go to class you should be fine.",
    "As a math class it is fine. My TA (MIriam logan) was absolutely great. If you need it as a pre-req or just want a QR I would recommend it not too hard or time consuming, although be careful because it gets hard at the very end - you need to work hard to understand it right away cause the final which counts for 50% will have a lot of that material.",
    "This is a pretty boring class in terms of material. Try not to choose a 9AM section; you will get sleepy in class...",
    "Math 115 is a good course for learning single variable calculus and I would definitely recommend it. The only hang up is that it is imperative that one find a good section leader.",
    "It's possible, but not probable, that you will enjoy this class. For me, it was my least favorite of the semester. But I did feel I was able to learn the material eventually, so if you've looked at the syllabus and decided that the material is important to you and your college career, then yes, I would recommend it.",
    "Math 115 was a great class, it was well taught and the material was interesting it is a good quantitative reasoning credit. I would definitely recommend.",
    "I would say only take it if it is required. That being said, I'm not personally a math person. Low level math and science courses are generally not very enjoyable.",
    "Not bad if you have a good professor. Miriam Logan is a great instructor - she's extremely sweet, helpful, and ALWAYS willing to explain one-on-one (no matter how lost you are). Final is HARD.",
    "If you take this, take it with Miriam Logan - her lessons are great, and she's super helpful outside of class. Math 115 is basically derivatives in the beginning and series at the end, so it certainly gets harder as you go on - if you took AB in high school, this is where you should start. It's challenging, but if you need a math credit, definitely take 115.",
    "Basic calculus class dealing with integration and series if you are premed take the section that excludes limits if you can."
