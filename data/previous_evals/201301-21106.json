   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take the course. This course prepares you for any lab you may eventually join, the material is super relavent and very interesting, you will be surprised how much new things you will learn even if you have had experience with this material already.",
    "This class teaches students an in depth look at eukaryotic molecular biology from replication to transcription and finally at translation. Both the function and regulation of each topic is taught in this course. I would not recommend this course to another student because a lot of material is covered and instructed poorly. There is very little interaction between the professor and the student.",
    "It is challenging and demanding, but the information that I learned is useful in research. I didn't have a strong background in molecular biology coming in, I only had the basics. This was a great class to really dig into the material. I would recommend it.",
    "Great class if looking to get a background in molecular biology",
    "Workload isn't terrible but you MUST study well in advance for tests. MUST hone ability to design and understand experiments, since that is where all the points are on the test.",
    "Great class that will challenge you to understand the mechanistic aspects of eukaryotic cellular function. I would definitely recommend this class if you are interesting in understanding the key aspects of regulation in biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend it for those interested in seeing primary data related to MolBio, and reading relevant papers within the field.",
    "The class is definitely an advanced treatment of a lot of topics and moves pretty fast to cover everything. Exams were difficult but overall it was a good challenge and a good opportunity to learn a lot of things.",
    "This is a great course to take to learn about DNA replication, transcription, and translation processes that occur in all eukaryotic cells. It is well presented and organized, and it allows students to understand the science behind how discoveries in these areas were made.",
    "I would recommend to take the class; the class is great for inspiring thoughts on projects, and the grant proposal is an excellent exercise in this respect."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided all the necessary details and background that one needs to enter any lab as well as for their qualifying exam.",
    "Very useful to have discussion sections for reading papers. Great for understanding experiments and figures.",
    "Yes, this class helped me understand methods and ideas that will be aplicable throughout my research.",
    "It was very applicable, and I will be using a lot of the data from Mark's lectures in my research. It was my first course in MolBio, and I found it easy to follow yet rich in information.",
    "The course covered a wide variety of topics, many which were of interest to me.",
    "I think this was a great course to help me understand the biological processes fundamental to eukaryotic cells, something that I was not comfortable with prior to taking this course. This class has definitely helped prepare me for my research and discipline.",
    "Obviously, this is very germane to what I plan to be researching in the lab over the next few years..."
