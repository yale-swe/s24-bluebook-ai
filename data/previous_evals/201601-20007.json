   "comments": [
    "Katie created a safe and hospitable space for our practicum meetings, allowing us to bring our challenges and difficulties and receive support and suggestions. She prioritized discussion of \"real-time\" situations that individuals in our group were facing over the pre-written case studies. While both offered rich material for learning, it was most helpful to our group to support each other in dealing with current issues in our ministries, which also allowed us to learn from what others were facing.",
    "Tracy did a great job.",
    "He was a good listener and had a lot of experience and wisdom to share. I really enjoyed speaking with him.",
    "No weaknesses -- she was a fantastic leader, authentic and organized. She made possible rich conversation and relationships.",
    "Katie is AMAZING!!! I Could not ask for a better practicum instructor and mentor. She truly cares about her students at a level rarely seen at YDS. She was always available and went above and beyond to help us all out. Seriously she is the best and I will miss her practicum next year.",
    "See my answer in part b.",
    "Wonderful listener, great encourager, an advocate for student, cogent, salient feedback (oral), a true friend, a trust worthy companion on the path.",
    "Bill was phenomenal! He asked very thought-provoking and engaging questions applicable to real world ministry. He was great at engaging us helping us to dig deeper.",
    "Her genuine love and care for our group. Ms. Byrnes practiced pastoral care, which I welcomed.",
    "Pastor Bill is a good facilitator and leader. He encouraged the students in the practicum to share honestly and courageously. I recommend Pastor Bill's continued involvement in the supervised ministry practicum.",
    "Rabbi Brockman was excellent at leading discussions and allowing the students authority over where discussions go and what we cover in each class. However, Rabbi Brockman would sometimes be disappointed in students who were not present in class, which he would unintentionally take out on the students who were present.",
    "Ron has experience as a pastor and as a conference minister. As such he was able to bring significant knowledge and insights to our weekly meetings. He encouraged independence, self reflection, and creativity during my time at the church. He also encouraged me to push myself to engage with the congregation when leading prayers and giving sermons. He is an excellent resource for students and YDS.",
    "Kyle is kind, accommodating, and an excellent facilitator.",
    "Katie was a wonderful, pastoral presence in our practicum meetings. She was knowledgeable, helpful, and fun. She allowed us students to carry conversation when we we moving strongly, but knew when to step in and provide guidance. She is a spectacular practicum leader.",
    "I really appreciated the ways that Shepard crafted a space where we each could share about our weeks and become a support for one another. I would have liked more structure within the practicum group. While I appreciated that we were given the opportunity to share about our weeks, I would have liked doing case studies earlier, and would have liked case studies already being prepared that helped us engage across areas of race, gender, class, and different theological positions and approaches. I think that my practicum group was a really amazing group of individuals. While the group became a nice haven for each of us, I don't feel like I walked away with many new perspectives and ideas and I think we would have had really fruitful and thought provoking conversations about some challenging and thought provoking issues.",
    "He was kind and humble in his character. I learned a lot from him.",
    "Kyle was explicit about shaping the classroom time around our group's agreed learning goals. This made for an experienced customized to our own challenges, experiences, and goals. It is challenging to do this without devolving into chaos, and Kyle managed to do so while keeping us on target and making it look effortless.",
    "He was enthusiastic and supportive. His passion for his own ministry was inspiring and he was committed to facilitating interesting discussions and challenging and affirming us as appropriate."
