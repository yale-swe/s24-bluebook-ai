   "comments": [
    "A continuation of the fall's examination of history and political thought in the western canon, with an emphasis on political theory (less historical narrative). Extremely exciting and interesting discussions onsocial contract theory, human nature and how we got to civil society, inequality, and the path of history--if there is one. Great lectures, great books (Machiavelli, Rousseau, Marx, Nietzsche, among others) and really great discussions.If you get Slanski, don't switch out! Slanski is a tough grader but very approachable for help and has very valuable advice and criticism on papers. This coming from a student who enjoyed writing all three papers, was frustrated that she never quite pulled off a solid one, but still felt that she gained a lot from the criticism and experience of writing. Great section overall.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. I really enjoyed both semesters of DS History\/Politics. There are a lot of interesting works that force you to think critically about politics.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone with an interest in History or Political Science.",
    "Perhaps the most interesting material in all of DS, as it's information that has formed your innermost conceptions and understandings of history and politics without you knowing it. This class is full of awakenings, connections, etc. 3 papers, lecture once a week, two sections, final exam.",
    "Take this class with Professor Slanski. She will make you understand why DS is great. She will make you realize what it means to ACTUALLY have a good teacher, to ACTUALLY be in a class that challenges and stimulates you.",
    "H&P is a great part of the overview of the Western tradition that is Directed Studies. Reading the texts from Machiavelli to Arendt not only shows us what theories of politics have looked like in the past, but helps us analyze and deal with the world we live in, which is profoundly shaped by those texts and their (mis)interpreters to this very day. If you're interested in history, politics, rights, the state, the economy, rebellion\/revolution, religion, democracy, progress, and whether we will ever actually break out of the cycle we seem to have caught ourselves in (anacyclosis - look it up, it's Polybius's term), you should take this course along with the rest of DS. It will enlighten you and (towards the end, with Nietzsche and Arendt) shatter you to the core.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, in spite of the large work load (it's worth it).",
    "The second semester of Directed Studies: History&Politics covers a solid selection of incredible thinkers in a short amount of time. The amount of reading is challenging, but ultimately worth it. The weekly lectures complement small group discussion incredibly well.",
    "You read the canonical texts of the Western tradition in historical and political thought. The course is neither strictly history nor philosophy. You read the texts with more a view to how the author does history, the relationship between history and politics, the author's relationship to the canon, etc. than to the events described. I would absolutely recommend DS to another student. I learned so much this year. It was also great to be in seminars with professors and to have three classes with ~120 other students and get to know them better."
