   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, yes. You have to be willing to go to all the outside events. The writing aspect is not as demanding as other writing classes. We had a good group of people to talk to in the class, it could be difficult if you did not get along well.",
    "I really enjoyed myself in this class because I felt like it really helped to sharpen my writing skills. The writing itself is more creative in nature than I expected, and Prof. Spillane is the wonderful, quirky kind of professor you'd want to be teaching a class on writing about the performing arts. However, you really get thrown into the review RIGHT AWAY, with little instruction on what makes a review, so if you're considering this class, you should read some published reviews to get started.",
    "Only if you're really passionate about the performing arts. You can't just like them... you have to really love them and want to write about them.",
    "One of the most annoying classes I've ever taken at Yale. Mistake to take as a senior. Spillane has lots of ridiculous requirements that suit her needs, plus a very unclear syllabus that never really gets cleared up as the semester goes on. You also have to turn in an essay every Saturday by 3pm under the door to her office in Pierson. One of the most disruptive things to a weekend ever. Just imagine never being able to have fun on a Thursday and\/or Friday night all term because you always had an essay due on Saturday. Also gets very uptight about missing any event, but then comes 10-15 minutes late to class every time. Double standard.",
    "Yes. Esp if considering Journalism. Spillane has a great perspective on the career.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to anyone curious about writing about the performing arts for a publication, or just anyone interested in working their creative writing muscle. It was a great opportunity to write and think about performance in a way that is not otherwise formally encouraged. You also are encouraged\/required to see performances you otherwise might not seek out.",
    "A good intro writing course, especially if you are interested in the arts - taking advantage of Yale's vibrant art culture as well as interacting with other students who are interested in the arts. As this is a writing seminar, it has a pretty regular course load - weekly writing assignments, readings, course blog etc. - but I don't think it became overwhelming at any point."
