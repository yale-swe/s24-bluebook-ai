   "comments": [
    "Probably necessary if you're taking it, but the work is very manageable and labs don't usually last the full four hours. If your TA is chill, your time in lab will be chill and rewarding.",
    "Orgo lab: You've gotta take it. This class is taught well, and is good even for inexperienced lab students. If you put the time into it, you will get a lot out of it.",
    "A good lab course (WOW! REALLY?!?!). I am like maaayyybe premed and took it and don't regret it at all. You definitely won't be there for four hours every week. The expectations are reasonable considering that it's a 0.5 credit class.",
    "Compared to the labs for general chemistry, Chem 222L is a welcome departure from hours and hours of lab reports. Here, you learn techniques that feel relevant to chemistry in the real world. Ultimately, though this class will gradually make you somewhat more equipped to perform real chemistry, 222L is not intimidating nor unfair on the whole. Approach this class with optimism, and you will likely even enjoy it.",
    "Don't take this if it's not required for your major. But if it is, rest assured that this is 100 times better than gen chem lab. The lab is so much nicer, the lab reports are easier and there are only 4 of them, the prelab lecture takes 5 minutes instead of an hour, there are no quizzes, and (at least for me) the grading was extremely reasonable. If you put a decent amount of work in, you'll hardly get any points taken off throughout the semester. The final exam was a bit tough though, even with the exam study questions in the manual.",
    "Great lab course! Fun, challenging, and follows well with the material taught it lecture. Dr. DiMeglio is approachable and engaging, and sets a positive, constructive tone in lab. Not a class to be avoided; if you need the credit, take it!",
    "This class is just about as hard as the lecture. If the lab were a full credit, I would definitely recommend the class to a friend. However, seeing how labs are only half a credit and usually just as much if not more work than the lecture, I simply cannot recommend this class.",
    "If you have to take it, there are worse things. It was not that long and the workload wasn't that bad.",
    "Easy lab.",
    "The lab is actually pleasant to take and is not another cause for concern. The experiments are relaxed for the most part and the workload is manageable.",
    "Typical lab for a chemistry course, but overall it was much better than gen chem lab."
