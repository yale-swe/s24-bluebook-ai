    "Yes.",
    "If you are a musician and have limited music theory knowledge, I would recommend MUSI 218 to someone looking to learn the basic principles of music theory without taking a full credit music theory course. It is a fun, interesting, and informative class.",
    "Meh. This semester the two sections taught by the regular professors were not enough to accommodate enrollment interest so Prof Quinn (DUS) was asked to teach a third section. I was placed in this section, and he wasn't prepared to teach it. He's super nice and funny, like way nicer and funnier than you. But he didn't take the class as seriously as the other two teachers, and thus it was easier and we didn't learn as much. Take with profs who are committed to teaching ear training.",
    "This course is extremely helpful for being able to pick out melodies and chord progressions, and your dictation skills will improve dramatically. Assignments seem to vary a great deal by professor, my section barely had any. The curriculum seemed rather on the fly, but that didn't stop Me from learning a ton. This course should not be docketed as introductory. You need a fairly solid musical Background in theory as well a decent ear to get anywhere in this class. Fun and low commitment for someone who wants to improve their musical abilities and has good experience already.",
    "I recommend this course to any student wishing to move through to the music department's more advanced courses in music theory."
