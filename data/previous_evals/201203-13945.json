   "comments": [
    "Interesting class about escalation. When I took this, students chose the readings, so if this class is still student-led, be aware about whether or not you like that format. I have mixed feelings about it. Sometimes the quality of the material felt lower than other classes because students, rather than the professor, had picked it out. I took this class the first time Professor Dafoe taught it during his first semester at Yale, so I imagine the class will definitely improve next time around.",
    "You would probably get more out of the class if you already have a strong academic background in international security. Having taken game theory or statistics definitely helps. Otherwise, it's still a decent course but you wouldn't be able to get as much out of it.",
    "Don't take it. You learn very little about escalation and a little about game theory. The entire thing needs to be revamped. Don't be next year's guinea pig.",
    "I really enjoyed PLSC 131, and definitely recommend it to other students. Although it probably involves more math than the description lets on, don't let this fact stop you from taking the course. It doesn't require any prerequisites, and Professor Dafoe is really good at explaining the key concepts that you need to know to understand the material discussed. However, I think that having some very basic game theory background could make the course more interesting.In terms of work, each student presents one class of the seminar and writes a memo on the readings for that class. There's also a somewhat lengthy final paper, but Professor Dafoe is good at guiding you to finding a topic early. There's about 100 pages of reading a week.",
    "This was a six person seminar (it started as seven people, and one dropped halfway through the semester). Since people rarely did the reading and the professor never lectured, our meetings got incredibly boring. I would not recommend this class to another student - there are so many better courses out there and I'm disappointed that I wasted a credit hour on this class. Professor Dafoe is nice enough but he takes himself quite seriously and ran the most tedious course I have taken, which also happened to be at 9:25 on Thursday morning."
