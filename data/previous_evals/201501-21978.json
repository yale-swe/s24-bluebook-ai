    "An overview of the second half of the English poets. I would suggest it for the English major.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course and I would definitely recommend Professor Kramnick. He is very engaging and adds a real ease to the class. The work is fair - it never felt like too much, which allowed me to be able to actually do it. I really enjoyed the discussions. We would read books or cantos, and then he would point us to passages that he felt were particularly important and we would have a very free conversion. He is open to ideas and isn't afraid to support an unconventional point of view. I think this class is one in which the professor will make the largest difference, and for me, Professor Kramnick's style was what made the class extremely enjoyable.",
    "An overview of important English poems, tough but rewarding, probably really relevant to all future English classes. I would recommend it , as long as the person knew it would require a lot of work and would be not at all a gut! As long as they understood, I would highly recommend, especially if taken with Professor Kramnick.",
    "It is a poetry course, so I wouldn't take it if you don't like poetry. Almost all of the poets are pre-modern so if you're taking this class be prepared for stuff closer in context to Shakespeare than to Frost. Often interesting, Paradise Lost is a classic, and a lot of the other epics are also very cool to get inside of, the reading is still time consuming, and not exactly fun."
