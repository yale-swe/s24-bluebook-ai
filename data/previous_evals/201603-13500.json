    "I learned a significant amount of material about the Peabody museum as well as specific technical writing skills that would be useful for future scientific journalism. Professor Conniff was extremely helpful for developing ideas that would be interesting to me, and I was exposed to many new topics that I had not previously explored.",
    "I learned about the history of Yale and the history of natural science. The course exposed me to parts of natural history I'd never encountered, and also helped me be a better writer.",

   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of the course is in the numerous guest lectures and demonstrations that Professor Conniff organized. Being able to hear from such a wide array of voices from people at the Peabody was incredibly eye-opening, especially as someone who had not been very interested in geology or ecology in the past. In addition, the two term papers were very interesting and allowed for detailed exploration of the topic. Unfortunately, the course did not feel very organized and some of the requirements seemed quite unclear. It would have been nice if there were more common threads throughout the course. In addition, it would have been really nice if the course could have been a writing credit (with 30 pages of writing through essays), a social science credit, or a humanity credit. Instead, it was no skills or distribution credits at all, which was a bit of a disappointment. Still, I do not regret for one moment in taking the course, because it was such a great experience to be with Professor Conniff and the people at the Peabody.",
    "I really loved having the guest speakers every week. It ran too long sometimes.",
    "What I learned from this course cannot be attained anywhere else. Passionated professor and guests from the Peabody museum motivated me a lot. There can be more discussions."

    "If this course is ever offered again, LEAP AT THE OPPORTUNITY. The original fossil prototype for the Velociraptors in Jurassic Park was briefly in my hands, as were original documents by Benjamin Silliman, James Dwight Dana, and O. C. Marsh. Professor Conniff is genuinely invested into this topic and he makes an excellent guide for the exploration of these new ideas.",
    "Yes, if the material interests you.",
    "I highly recommend this course. It would be really sad if you graduated without knowing the precious history of the Peabody Museum.",
    "Yes; highly recommend"
