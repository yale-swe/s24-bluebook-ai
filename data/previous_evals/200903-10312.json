    "It's a good class to take as you're third, since it's not too hard, and overall is useful.",
    "Yes, its is a good class about key concepts in Physical Organic Chemistry.",
    "I would suggest Chem 518 to other students as a first semester course. It is relatively easy to identify important information and there are only a few exams and no homeworks. It will mostly be a review but you may learn some new, interesting stuff as well. I think it was a good class to start with",
    "A very boring lecture class. No homework. Two exams. If you've learned the material before, or can get a sense of what's important material for exams, then you're golden.",
    "This class definitely was the least rigorous of the courses I took this semester. The lectures often consisted of topics that were of interest to Prof. Jorgensen. Depending on whom you ask, this is either the reason to take this course or the reason not to take this course."

   "comments": [
    "The class covered topics that will be helpful to me for my research.",
    "There is little overlap between my future dissertation work and this course. I am primarily biologically based. The course was mostly an overview of chemistry concepts so it didn't deepen my knowledge substantially but there was some new knowledge that was interesting",
    "I picked up little bits here and there that I hadn't seen before. I had very limited biology in undergrad., so the unit on DNA base pairs and binding was especially helpful for me. Also as a synthetic organic chemist, the unit on solvation effects directly applies to my research and I will take this into account when running reactions.",
    "Other than making me memorize the nucleotide bases, this class did not present any material that was new, or could not have been covered much more quickly."
