    "Learned a lot of Spanish!",
    "really improved my spanish speaking and writing skills",
    "I developed my speaking and listening skills by taking this course.",
    "Increased speaking, writing, reading, and comprehension ability.",
    "This course augmented my speaking and comprehension abilities most of all. Prior to taking this course, I had a poor accent and struggled to understand the main idea of large passages of Spanish text. However, Profesora Reymundi did an excellent job at making sure we all understood what was going on in class and in our readings every single day of class. Even when I didn't understand every word in our readings, I was able to recite and write detailed summaries about the occurrences in the passage. I also improved my fluidity in translating my thoughts into understandable Spanish.",
    "I developed more confidence in my Spanish-speaking abilities through daily activities that encouraged collaborative participation. The grammar that we learned has cleared up some of my confusions from previous courses in high school and definitely made writing in Spanish come more naturally as well.",
    "Speaking skills, grammar skills, reading skills.",
    "I learned a lot of Spanish grammar that will really benefit my overall Spanish",
    "spanish vocab, grammar, and literature",
    "- I learned to speak Spanish with more fluidity and I learned to listen and read better"

   "comments": [
    "Course is certainly a lot of work, but you do learn a ton. Enjoyed it much more than I expected.",
    "strengths: really clear, lots of resources available weaknesses: sometimes overwhelming amount of resources and information. some of the readings were very challenging and was hard to get through",
    "This was a really helpful course, I learned so much and my Spanish improved greatly.",
    "The weight of some assignments is a little too high for some and a little too low for others, and the online homework isn't really helpful. Overall, however, the course is very well-structured and well-paced.",
    "The strengths of the course are that conversation was initiated easily with such a small class size, there were always plenty of examples of grammar lessons to refer back to when I was confused, and the class encouraged us to learn more about the outside world and culture. There were no weaknesses that I can think of.",
    "Strengths- many opportunities to converse in a stress-free manner with partners in class. As I became reacquainted with Spanish after a year without being in a class, I found that it was extremely helpful to just give it my best shot to answer a question because even if my answer wasn't correct, my classmates and professor were eager to help me and happy to see me try! I also really liked the variety of activities\/ways of learning that we experienced because sometimes I was pushed out of my comfort zone (for example, with listening activities) and other times I felt more comfortable and could learn more by helping others. Weaknesses- I believe it would be helpful to have more writing practice outside of the 3 main essay assignments. There are some phrases\/expressions\/idioms that don't translate perfectly following general grammar rules (as is expected), but sometimes I felt afraid to try and see what is correct because I wanted to be \"safe\" when working on an assignment that counts for a good portion of my grade. It would be nice to have some practice essay-writing possibly once a week in which we can \"test out\" phrases we would like to add to our vocabulary for the future, and receive feedback without a big grade to restrict us.",
    "Less supersite, not very effective in learning.",
    "There was a lot of engagement with the texts that I found to be very helpful.",
    "- the class was very well taught, she had a great structure to all her lessons and often added bits of wisdom about who to acquire this language and other languages outside the classroom"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Professor Reymundi is fantastic--take it with her if you can. Very much enjoyed the course even though it was a fair amount of work.",
    "Yes, if they need language. otherwise, too much work to take for fun unless you have a lot of extra time",
    "Yes. This course is crucial in developing a solid foundation in intermediate Spanish.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. When I was in high school, even as an AP Spanish student, I struggled to understand Spanish I heard on TV or on the radio. After taking this course, I can now comprehend what native speakers are saying, even when they talk at a fast pace, and I can sing to Spanish songs and understand Spanish on TV. This is just one example of how the class has altered my language learning practices and how I have seen it effect my every day life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student that wants to become more comfortable\/confident in Spanish. The daily assignments are manageable and help to keep you on a schedule and make Spanish feel more natural.",
    "Yes, this is a great course to improve your Spanish.",
    "Yes if they had an interest in learning Spanish.",
    "-Yes absolutely, I could really feel how much my spanish improved from since I began my semester"
