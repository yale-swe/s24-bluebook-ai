    "This course does an excellent job navigating the complex and interrelated systems of the human body. I especially loved the emphasis on the similarities in form and function, which made it much easier to synthesize information. No weaknesses in my opinion!",
    "I loved this course! It was great taking a class where you could apply concepts we were learning in class to your own research interests. In my opinion, there were not any weaknesses in the course.",
    "The lecture slides and her teachings are very informative and help students to apply physiological knowledge to relevant public health issues.",
    "This course is well-designed and taught for deep conceptual understanding. Each week, we learn about a new system of the body, often referring back to previous systems and applying our knowledge through integrative write ups. The lectures are dense in content, but Professor Yeckel does a great job of making it understandable.",
    "Excellent approach to physiology. I highly enjoyed the integrative component of the course, as (instead of normal physiology courses that would teach each chapter or system separately), each system in this course was highly integrated with the other. We were taught to look at the system as a whole, which I think is critical in public health.",
    "This course is a great way to get your feet wet in the world of physiology for public health. Because each system is only given a day, we fly through the material but it is accessible and understandable.",
    "I really enjoyed this class and had the opportunity to understand public health issues from a physiological standpoint; a different perspective than my other courses."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine Yeckel is the most caring professor I have ever had at this university. She is an absolute gem.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Simply put, Dr. Yeckel is one of the most intelligent and engaging professors I have had. She is personable, informative, very approachable, and truly cares about her students. She took time to get to know each of us and I really enjoyed learning from her.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is incredibly passionate and a very engaging professor. I learned a great deal from her and had a great time doing so!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel was excellent! A very engaging professor who really tried to to tailor class discussions to students' interests.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is very willing to help students to fully understand what she is teaching in class. Also, I liked how we could write the weekly write ups based on our personal interests, which allowed me to focus on applying what we learned in class to my research interests.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel is one of the most pleasant and engaging professors at Yale. She often draws from her own professional experience to help enhance lectures and she radiates a sense of passion and excitement towards the course material that truly draws in her students. Professor Yeckel changed the way I think about the systems of the body, appreciating \"the beautiful and elegant anatomy\" that makes us function as humans.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Prof Yeckel was an incredible professor and lecturer! She was so passionate and engaging throughout the entire course, wanting us to understand each slide as well as the integrative components. Professor Yeckel's joy translated into her teaching and it made the course so much more enjoyable. I appreciated her thorough feedback and opportunities for further research through the abstracts that she provided with each write-up.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is AMAZING. She is incredibly knowledgeable and presents the material in a clear manner. She goes above and beyond to ensure you understand what is going on in class and makes sure to keep you engaged and interested.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine is great and really wants people to learn. She also does a good job of meeting different students, with varying familiarity in the subject matter, where they're at."
