    "I would, as long as the student is aware of the time investment, especially in the first couple of weeks.",
    "Arabic is exceptionally challenging, yet there is no other way to develop the skills needed in such a short period of time. Difficult, yet essential.",
    "I would recommend the class heartily though I would warn them that they must be dedicated to learning arabic and be able to handle a large workload in order to excel in the course.",
    "An exceptionally well-taught introduction to the Arabic language. The course is demanding -- they are not joking when they say that you will be doing two hours or so of homework each night -- but the instructors are really excellent, and the course itself is definitely worthwhile."
