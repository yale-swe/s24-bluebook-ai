    "Yes, but beware that this is not really a philosophical\/theoretical class. Instead of reading arguments for democracy, be prepared for discussions about new policy proposals. The most theoretically interesting week in terms of the reading is definitely the first week. The group paper at the end (instead of individual papers or an exam) was an interesting twist. Some of our group discussions were helpful and edifying, but as is to be expected perhaps, roughly 75% of the work on that paper fell on two or three individuals.",
    "It's an investigation of alternatives institutional arrangements for better society and government. It's pretty broad but really interesting. For anyone interested in alternative political arrangements but also reforming the economy and the firm, this is a great class. The class raises important issues regarding what the main aim of government and democracy is and what values do we most believe in as a society. I would recommend this class to a student interested in the topic and ready to put in the time to do well. Otherwise, you won't get much out of it.",
    "If you are interested in thinking about some democratic innovations and have never taken a political science class, this is a good course. If you are interested in learning more about representative democracy and challenging the conception of it you should also take this course. The problem with the seminar is that not many people participated. If more people participated it would have been better.",
    "Recommended if you are interested in thinking-outside-the-box-type discussions. Have to be prepared for every class--she will call you out if you aren't participating. Don't take it if you dislike working in large groups."
