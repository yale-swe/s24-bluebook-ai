    "Yes! It's a fantastic class, and a unique opportunity to work closely with a teacher as skilled and knowledgeable as James Bundy. The course is very-hands on; every Friday you present a piece that you've been preparing (a sonnet, monologue, scene, etc.) in front of the whole class, and work it on the floor for twenty minutes (forty if it's a scene). This can be intimidating, as every week you're performing and taking criticism before an audience, but (a) that's acting for you, and (b) the work you do is extremely helpful and will leave you much more comfortable with Shakespeare and better positioned to create something honest and exciting out of the text. Also, the final character workshop, in which you get to pick a character from the canon and devise an original ten-minute piece using that character's lines, is a lot of fun and wonderful way to integrate everything you've learned over the course of the semester.",
    "If you're really serious about theater, take it. But expect a challenge. You won't be coddled.",
    "If you're reading this, and you're an actor, take this class. It's the best decision you'll make here.",
    "If you get in you take the class. That simple. Then you prioritize it so that it is the number one thing that you are doing that semester. Working with James Bundy on Shakespeare for four hours once a week is an opportunity very few people get in their lives so don't short change yourself by tacking it on to an already busy schedule. If you commit and give 100% you will get SO much out of it. It's the best experience I ever had as a undergraduate actor.",
    "Amazing! This was the best kind of course: an incredible class that offers tremendous challenge for tremendous reward. It was a very fast-paced course with a lot of material given to us at once, but conquering that obstacle and producing a successful product was a \"win\" in and of itself. I feel I have a better understanding of how Shakespeare crafted his texts with cues for the actor and how the text should be acted. We started with sonnets of our own choice and then monologue and scenes selected by James. We had two weeks in class to work on each of these assignments. You also turn in a scansion and line-by-line paraphrase of your sonnet and monologue. The class ends with a 10-12 minute Character Workshop with a Shakespeare character of your choice. That was the most rewarding part of the course, by far. Every week, you also meet with the TF for half an hour (or a full hour for your partner scenes) to try out your pieces and receive feedback before class. It's a tremendous resource and allows a second voice on your work. Rehearsal on your own is SO important for this class. That's where a lot of the growth happens. Don't neglect it. In fact, I would go as far as to consider it an extra credit in your schedule in and of itself. Consider this when shaping your schedule and extracurricular commitments that semester. This may sound intimidating, but it is worth it in the end. Truly.",
    "I would absolutely encourage actors to take this class, even if they are not interested in focusing on Shakespeare! I learned so much about what it is to mean what you say as a actor, which is valuable in all theatrical settings. More than anything, this is a class about figuring out how to use the language given to you, which is the base of all acting.",
    "As long as you have the chance to take an acting class with James Bundy you would be a fool to decline. Break a leg."
