    "This course is one of the truly unique experiences at FES, and Paul Lussier is a unique experience as an instructor, not to be missed. He fills the course with incredible intensity. He stimulates constant questions and discussion from students. He is always available to talk, inside or outside of class. The course material - humanistic communications as applied to climate change science - is difficult to grasp if you have never encountered it before, but it is crucial for understanding climate change deniers and how to effectively move the political and business establishments in the world forward in dealing with climate change. Do not miss taking this course.",
    "I find the in-class discussions very rich, and I learn a lot by debating and discussing the narratives we read in class. That being said, it would be helpful to have a concrete understanding of the backbones of the tools of humanistic, values congruent communications. Paul talks about these different kinds of narratives- engagement, advocate, etc and the different climate change stories that are being told, but I still dont feel like I have a clear framework for how to use the things we have learned in class (and maybe this is coming later). I know it is just Pauls teaching style, but it would be helpful to put some structure on the class so we have some tangible humanistic communication strategies. I feel like we need concrete tools and theories that we can apply to our work and instead I feel like were just analyzing different narratives (which helps students understand these issues to a certain extent).",
    "I think it will take me some time to fully digest everything I learned in Paul's class; there was a lot to think through, and it was all very relevant to working in the climate change arena. I walked in to the course with one concept of reality and best practices, but left with quite a bit of new perspective. Paul himself is animated, passionate, and determined. Class was always exciting.",
    "Question 4: The course tried to cover a greater range of content in support of its key idea that was practical in a single semester. This led to a rushed feeling when the class wanted to focus on a particular topic of interest. Question 8: Paul did a good job providing examples of the concepts he was teaching in application, but glossed over clear explication of the foundational ideas behind those applications. Question 9: Paul's commitment to addressing student questions was variable. Generally, it seemed like Paul was most interested in convincing students that his ideas were correct, rather than encouraging and nurturing their critical thinking skills. Question 12: This is a useful class for students interested in science communication. But, students should enter the class with a clear idea of their own interests and confident in their critical thinking abilities. It is important to be able to take Paul with a grain of salt sometimes.",
    "The professor's knowledge, energy, passion, and attention to student learning was breathtaking. I've never had such a devoted teacher and mentor, and his revolutionary approach to humanities-informed climate solutions completely transformed the way I approach addressing climate issues and the direction of my career path. It was probably one of the most extraordinary classes I've ever taken and totally reinforced my career passion and purpose.",
    "It was sometimes frustrating that we didn't stick to the syllabus and our discussions would extend for multiple days on one topic."

    "The lectures and in-person class discussions.",
    "Group project and going to Paris with fellow students.",
    "Project work is a great opportunity to apply concepts learned in class.",
    "I really enjoyed class and the theoretical conversations we had throughout the semester. I appreciated that Paul carried concepts through the entire semester (\"it's not what you can do to address climate change; it's what addressing climate change can do for you!\"), and the extent to which he responded to students questions. His attention to individual queries was definitely what enabled to me to get as much out of the semester as I did. I also enjoyed the project component of the course, which was challenging but ultimately rewarding.",
    "The group project was really useful as a chance to develop team-work skills. It could have been improved with more careful attention from the instructor and the TAs to helping students make concrete applications of humanistic communications in their work with their clients.",
    "The readings were superb and really changed the way I approached communicating and approaching solutions to climate impacts. However, the lectures and client project were absolutely phenomenal. The discussions we engaged in really walked us though how to identify different values, world views, and interests and how a values-congruent scientifically sound approach to climate communication can accelerate the most impactful solutions. I was astounded every class about the challenges of communicating the science, but also by the fact that most other entities don't approach climate communication in this revolutionary way. The client project gave me incredible experience working for a highly regarding organization and I got to practice how to practice these communication and engagement strategies in the real world.",
    "Opportunity to work with high-level stakeholders on important projects and working with Paul - who cares so much for his students and teaching.",
    "Paul's class was spectacular. He assigned interesting insightful readings, which forced me to evaluate climate change issues from different perspectives. He created a space for open discussion and discourse in class and was very receptive to students' ideas, even if they challenged his own. He challenged my thinking in countless ways and helped me grasp concepts that I was struggling with. He was also a great mentor to me: he helped me get funding and a badge to present our work in Paris and gave me great professional advice. All in all, an excellent class taught by an excellent professor.",
    "I enjoyed how Paul began each class with a recap from the last one.",
    "I enjoyed the class component of the course as it provides insightful ways to rethink how communications is done. The readings and discussions were engaging and provoking. Paul is an excellent teacher in this aspect."

   "comments": [
    "Ensuring projects are really ready for a communications strategy before a group is assigned to the project.",
    "Structuring the group project. Making abstract concepts more structured during class. Paul needs to be on time (meaning 10min early)",
    "Paul is notorious for going extending conversations and straying from the syllabus. This comes from a place of good intention: he really wants to make sure all students are on the same page and that no rock goes unturned in terms of questions and debate. Because of this, I think the syllabus should definitely be shorter. The religion lecture, for example, was rushed toward the end and left me feeling very dissatisfied. Rather than cut things short, I think the class should just cover fewer topics, but go into more detail for each segment. I also wish we'd had more guidance in the final project. I appreciated that Paul gave us the opportunity to submit a post-project reflection paper, and will therefore sum up as follows: I felt that at times, it was very difficult to relate what we learned in class to my project. I feel my group could have used more guidance in this regard. I also felt like the project we were working on was in it's very nascent stages, and we thus lacked guidance throughout the design\/development of our deliverable.",
    "Better teaching on the very basic concepts behind humanistic communication (what is a value, operationally speaking? How do you identify stakeholder values?) would improve the course. Paul could strengthen his teaching by distancing himself from the goal of getting student buy-in to his ideas, and focusing on facilitating student understanding and critique.",
    "I would love to hear from guest speakers, particularly the authors that we read, if the professor facilitates a class dialogue and discussion with them. I learned so much from the class discussions that I'm sure this would enrich dialogue further.",
    "It could have used a bit more organization in terms of reading assignments\/class structure.",
    "The lack of clarity of readings and assignments was tough. I think Paul needs to stick to the syllabus and presentations more. I bought all of the books in the first week based on the syllabus and all of the readings ended up being posted- that was a waste of my money and time. Lectures also felt unstructured and like a diatribe or stream of consciousness. Also, the course is really not advertised appropriately from: 1. The title- instead of communicating \"science\" it should be communicating \"climate change.\" 2. The fact that the class is really half designed as a clinic. However, the clinic portion of the course needs the most work. The clinic aspect of the course needs improvement. I think many of us (definitely my clinic group) were confused and stressed about our clinic projects because of lack of clarity, lack of face time with Paul, and because of Paul's harried\/frenzied style and change of direction. Paul is clearly brilliant, but it wasn't always well transferred or taught, especially through his vision for our clinic project.",
    "The project portion of the class requires much improvement in its organisation. There was no clear direction of what is expected for the project and the deliverable were not set til late in the semester. Students could have contributed more if there were clear deliverable set by mid term."

    "Partially. This course was interesting, but stronger on theory than application (even though we had stakeholder projects, not a whole lot of attention was given to teaching concrete approaches to applying concepts from the course in that work). I left with a good overview of the philosophy behind humanistic communications and a good understanding of Paul's conviction that this framework is key to changing the world, but with less training in its application that I'd have liked.",
    "The knowledge I gained from the course far exceeded my expectations. The concepts I learned not only completely shifted the way I approach communicating and facilitating scientifically-informed actions, but I was also able to put these concepts into action through the client project. I gained a lot of professional experience through the client project and I experienced monumental shifts in my worldview every single class!",
    "It far exceeded my expectations. I thought this class would help my refine my communication skills, but it helped me reframe the very question I was working on. Paul's ideas challenge the current paradigm of climate communications and I was\/am exciting to be at the forefront of that movement. He truly cares about his students and went above and beyond to ensure maximum learning and that his students were getting the projects\/skills they wanted. He carved out an adaptation project for me because I told him I was interested in climate adaptation. Working with him and learning from him has been an incredible, eye-opening experience and I look forward to taking many more classes with him.",
