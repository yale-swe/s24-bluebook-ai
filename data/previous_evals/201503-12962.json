   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class if you are a serious singer: you will emerge from this course with improved singing ability and performance skills. The repertoire is interesting, fun, and challenging, and the master class structure is great. You need to be prepared and know your music since you will perform frequently. Professor Lalli is incredibly knowledgeable and gives insightful comments, and you also have free weekly coachings with Sara Kohane, an amazing accompanist.",
    "A great course for performers who want to train and develop. The workload is not large, but individuals are quite accountable to do their part for each class. The repertoire changes term by term, but I am sure Prof. Lalli's selections in future terms will be very enjoyable.",
    "I think 222 can vary a lot from semester to semester, but my experience was really positive. I ended up being the only instrumentalist in a class of all singers, so mostly I was way out of my depth and had to put in a lot more time and effort to figure out how to do things that were easy for the rest of the class. That said, everyoneespecially Professor Lalliwas really supportive and kind, and I was glad I took the class. Evening classes can be tough, but I really enjoyed 222. A few listening assignments take way too long; a few quizzes in class are easy. Concert in Sudler, house concert (really fun, with dinner!), and reading-week concert in WHC. Overall not too much work, but a class that deserves enough attention for you to get something out of it.",
    "I recommend this course to all musicians. The repertoire and experience obtained through this course is a unique and refreshing change from the usual Yale grind.",
    "Take it! Your learn great repertoire, important singer skills, get good coaching and a bunch of performance opportunities.",
    "Learn about and perform music from a myriad of different composers. Improve your singing technique and broaden your repertoire by miles.",
    "Definitely take it, great class!"
