    "Getting a framework for how to think about movement of groundwater and water flows and a framework for thinking about nutrient transfer, etc.",
    "Knowledge of the processes used to compute stream discharge and other technical aspects of river and groundwater flow. Knowledge of biological processes and nutrient cycling in river systems.",
    "A broad understanding of watershed dynamics, hydrology and biogeochemical processes as they pertain to watersheds.",
    "I learned about watersheds and the different processes that occur in the watershed",
    "The complexity of the subject makes it difficult to summarize into one semester. Jim and Pete, however, did a really good job doing just that. I feel like I learned a lot about the biotic and abiotic processes that form watersheds.",
    "I learned about a range of topics related to watersheds, including nutrient cycling, flow regimes, chemical processes, trophic cascades, restoration, modeling, etc.",
    "Great overview of the biogeochemistry and hydrology involved in watersheds",
    "General understanding of watersheds and riverine ecosystems.",
    "Better understanding of the hydrologic systems and its interactions with land and atmosphere processes",
    "I learned how watersheds, river systems, and the water cycle works hydrologically, biologically, and ecologically. I gained some insights into water system management.",
    "I learned a great deal about specific stream and river processes such as nutrient cycles groundwater flows, and a little bit about applied watershed management. We also learned a little bit about river restoration from Jim Macbroom's guest lectures which was really cool."

   "comments": [
    "Fairly low. I expected to have a better understanding of watersheds but I mostly learned about rivers\/lakes. There was a lot that I had hoped to learn that wasn't included at all",
    "They were moderately aligned with my expectations. I was expecting a larger scale approach to watershed management. I was hoping to gain more knowledge about how to manage a watershed to meet different management goals.",
    "Quite well",
    "Had no expectations since this is my first water class, so learned about things I never would have even known to expect.",
    "They aligned well.",
    "Reasonably well, although the topics felt a bit random at times and could have been organized into a more cohesive class.",
    "Fairly well - I initially expected a much deeper dive into the science (ex. chemistry) involved, but in hindsight it was never presented as a rigerous scientific course but rather as a survey",
    "It met my expectations",
    "I learned a little less than I would have hoped.",
    "very well",
    "I gained a basic understanding of watersheds, which was what I expected.",
    "As an MF, I wish we had learned more about the bigger picture of watersheds and applied watershed management. It also would have been cool to dive deeper into river restoration."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course feels too focused on what's going on in water bodies and less on what actually influences them. The homeworks were also a bit ridiculous. They'd introduce an equation in class and then expect us to be able to do it on our own in the homework. In addition, there was an expectation that we had to go to the TF office hours to even do them in the first place which is very unfair",
    "Strengths include a technical foundation to calculate river and stream processes. A weakness is that little emphasis is given towards larger scale management, including how to think about managing a watershed or how to work towards restoring river function. I wish more thought and care were given to these important aspect of managing watersheds.",
    "The co-teaching of the class makes the class not flow well. We would talk about the water budgets, move onto nutrient cycling, pick right back up with water budgets, and then pick right back up with nutrient cycling. I think more planning would have been helpful to make the information on nutrient cycling flow into the information on water budgets and vice versa. There really wasn't any time that these two themes were brought together into a cohesive view of a watershed.",
    "There were numerous strengths, as I feel that I learned a lot. I wish there were more smaller homework problem sets.",
    "Strengths: -the breadth of topics covered -the mix of qualitative and quantitative information -the workload was appropriate and the homework assignments helped us understand important topics for the midterm and final Weaknesses: -we had varying levels of prior knowledge on water, chemistry, etc and while it was mostly accounted for there could have been more background reading provided on basic skills relevant to the course -the topics and organization of the class did not always feel very cohesive -next year I recommend assigning the final hw assignment earlier since it took time away from my other classes' finals studying",
    "Alternating professors and topics kept it interesting. Giving out notes was helpful so I could pay attention in class. Pete's diagram of watershed modifiers\/impacts was especially helpful. Homework feedback could have been given quicker.",
    "Reasonable structure with expectations clearly laid out The two professor structure was helpful since both had drastically different areas of expertise I found the guest lecture to be far less useful and informative than the lectures by the professors, but appeared to be in the minority in this area",
    "The course material was fairly disjointed between the professors. There was not a concise flow of topics and no topic was covered very in depth. I felt like we were getting half the story,",
    "Both Jim and Pete brought a world of knowledge to the course but this class needs more organization and streamlining of the course topics. We should also have more practice problem sets",
    "There was a lot of material in lectures. I wish some of the slides had been broken down more with examples. The large homework sets often seemed daunting. It would be nice if there were more, smaller homework sets.",
    "One of the main weaknesses that happened this semester was the fact that we had a problem set due right before we took our midterm, and did not receive the problem set back before taking the midterm. This made studying for the midterm very difficult, both due to the time constraints and lack of corrected problem set. As a result, a lot of folks did very poorly on the midterm and it did not serve as a learning experience. I also thought that the team teaching by Jim and Pete made for a disjoint learning experience, as Jim definitely brings a lot more enthusiasm to his lectures."

   "comments": [
    "Review the syllabus so that your expectations are clear with what's being provided",
    "Strongly consider what type of knowledge you hope to gain about hydrology. This class provides you with technical fundamentals to help you think about specific values related to stream function and what they mean from a management perspective. Specific emphasis is placed on how to compute values for different processes and less on how to manage a watershed for different objectives.",
    "Great introductory survey, but don't expect much real science",
    "If you have any experience at all with watersheds, this course will be repetitive and not add very much to your knowledge base.",
    "I struggled with the homework problems and didn't feel like I always had the tools to get the homework done effectively. I would recommend starting early and going to office hours to get help.",
    "If you already have an undergrad background studying rivers, hydrology, or groundwater, this class might not be for you."
