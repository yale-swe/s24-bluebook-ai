   "comments": [
    "The course materials provided a broad overview of the latest computational methods in the growing field of unsupervised learning. However, the problem sets and grading are not very well organized.",
    "It is a graduate computational biology course so it is not designed for those without a lot of coding experience. The homework assignments were intense for most (I switched to an audit but asked classmates throughout the course). The course was very helpful for me to understand what skills I could use to analyze my data.",
    "The organization of the topics might be able to be improved.",
    "This course covered a lot of material in machine learning with plenty of examples to biological data. Throughout the class, many of the techniques appeared immediately applicable to my research. In fact, a section of a research paper I was writing that semester was based on applying some of the deep learning skills I learned doing the third homework assignment. The assignments, in general, really helped to solidify the lectures, however; they could be incredibly time consuming. I think some parts of the homework were a little repetitive at times and while it was good to explore the data and the techniques, reporting all of those different changes in a document for a homework assignment was very time consuming and not that helpful. The homework could instead ask the student to try these different parameters and then report in words the effect, instead of including the corresponding plots. Additionally, some of the homework was unclear as to what we were supposed to try on our own and what to actually report in the document. For example, the instructions often included questions, but then a set of questions was also given, so it was unclear if those questions in the instructions were just for us to think about or actually to respond in the assignment to. The homework also wasn't graded until after the final exam, probably due to the fact that homework that takes a long time to do, takes a long time to grade. It would have helped to have feedback on the homework throughout the class.",
    "The strengths are that the class is well-suited to learn about tools from the Krishnaswamy lab, that it introduces a variety of concepts in unsupervised learning, and that it offers several opportunities to explore at your own speed or interest. The weaknesses are that the class does not often introduce modern tools or frameworks outside of the Krishnaswamy lab, it is framed as \"Machine Learning for Biology\" but sticks to strictly unsupervised learning and is only related to biology through cursory applications, and, perhaps most critically, the homeworks are written up in a way that makes them very confusing and difficult where they shouldn't be."

    "Yes. The courses help students gain an intuitive understanding of various computational methods that can be applied to high dimensional data and is very relevant to research in computational biology.",

    "Yes, especially if you have interest in the Krishnaswamy lab and their research."
