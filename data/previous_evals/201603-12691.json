    "I really appreciated getting a survey of the history of science canon, but then having a chance to discuss their relevance and applicability to present issues.",
    "I learned how to analyze not only the problems within the history of science and the problems that have arisen while documenting the history of science, but also the problems with the field over all.",
    "This course was a useful introduction to the canon of the History of Science, with lots of effort made to ensure the canon felt relevant to our own work and questions. I took away, most fundamentally, a sense of the questions that have animated the field.",
    "This was a great introduction to some of the canonical works of history of science.",
    "A familiarity with canonical scholarship in history of science; ability to evaluate scholars' work in relation to key debates in the field; ability to analyze critically arguments both historically and theoretically.",
    "This course provided an excellent and in-depth introduction to the conventional historiographical 'canon' of the history of science. It was also structured to prompt us to connect this work to present-day issues."

   "comments": [
    "I honestly wouldn't change it. It was exactly what I wanted.",
    "Strengths: small seminar, engaged students, important (if slightly boring) syllabus that provides an incredible groundwork for further study in HSHM. Cowles is also just a great professor capable of synthesizing lofty, complicated conversations into articulate points and arguments.",
    "Henry is a wonderful facilitator, and he was able to draw us into engaged discussion about works that often Initially seemed dry or distant. I found the weekly student-led presentations to be useful, as a way into the texts, and I appreciated the effort Henry made to connect each week's reading to the weeks prior.",
    "Good selection of books, especially given the breadth of time\/content that had to be covered. Discussion was usually lively although sometimes difficult to get going. I wish we had spent more time discussing how these classic works were applicable to both more recent scholarly conversations and to the role of history of science in the world at large.",
    "The format of the course, in which we were asked to provide 500-word responses to each work ahead of time on Canvas (as opposed to emailing them in) was, I thought, particularly conducive both to a productive in-class discussion, and to a thorough reading of and engagement with each particular work. The public responses forced me to clarify and distill my own thoughts on each book ahead of class, and adequately tackle its content in order to do so. I also learned a great deal from the responses and reactions of fellow students. I also valued the flexibility built into the seminar discussion, allowing us to spend more or less class time on more contemporary-minded reflections on the book, as necessary. \"Problems\", despite its name, was entirely a delight!"

    "If you're in history of science, then this is essential. If you're not, it's a good intro to some of the big ideas in the field.",

    "Yes",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, certainly, and not just those in the HSHM track."
