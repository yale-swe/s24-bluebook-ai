    "I learned a lot about South Africa and the #RhodesMustFall and #FeesMustFall movements. I also gained a very critical understanding of how student activists can work to transform their institutions and their nations.",
    "This class has helped me expand my perspective on many topics. My writing skills have also improved a lot!",
    "How universities have built and continue to enforce systems that perpetuate racism, sexism, heteronormativity, homophobia and alienation; what are the ways marginalized populations attempt to make space for their epistemologies and the institutional changes needed to push such changes through.",
    "AMAZING class discussion about decolonizing knowledge and the academy. The very long title of this class really summarizes everything this class is about, and you will come out of it with enriched understandings of how universities function and how power circulates through academia.",
    "critical reasoning skills, lots of considering scholarly sources but also the situation here at Yale and at South African institutions. This was a really useful course for considering questions not often posed in other classes, and for being critical about academia and higher ed institutions."

    "I think this course is wonderful--it is very critical, well-suited to the seminar style, and covers interesting material. I can't think of much in the way of improvement.",
    "Wonderful course, loved every second and would take it again!",
    "strengths: it drew a lot on the experiences of students in the class.The course materials were good, especially when we watched short films. We also had the chance to talk with some of the students featured in a short film we watched (over skype) and that was really valuable. In some ways the course seemed unstructured, but the instructor was extremely responsive to our feedback and made the second half more structured and gave us good feedback on our work."

    "If this course is offered again (or if Zethu returns to teach another course), I would take it in a heartbeat and you should too. Zethu is a wonderful, compassionate instructor. She's brilliant and keenly critical of academia (both in South Africa and in general).",
    "I have learned a lot about the demands and needs for a different kind of society and education in institutions in some African countries, especially South Africa; and it has been great to draw parallels to Yale in order to assess the hardships of marginalized individuals on this campus, and the kinds of environments that we find ourselves in and how they affect our education. I have also learned a lot about the ways that different African cultures and colonization have affected education and scholarship in the continent and how difficult it is to decolonized universities in Africa when powerful western institutions are idolized. TAKE THIS CLASS IF ZETHU EVER TEACHES IT AGAIN! THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE SO FAR. I have loved every second of the course; I am always fascinated by the readings, looking forward to seminar, and discussing some of the materials with friends who arent even taking the class. I love how engaged my peers are with the course, they have tremendously contributed to my wonderful experience with the class. I have very much appreciated learning so much from everyone; the interactive environment has made it easy for everyone to share their experiences, evaluate the Yale education, and engage with and critique the readings extensively.",
    "Absolutely!! If Zethu returns, this is a must take for all students who want to truly understand how Yale works (both for the normative and marginalized individual). Zethu taught me a great deal about asking questions, fighting for answers, and finding ways to make the institution work better.",
    "Yes! Not sure that this will never be offered again because Zethu is a visiting professor or that any other professor could do the subject justice like Zethu does, but the readings are interesting and up-to-date.",
    "The professor was a visiting instructor which is too bad because it was an excellent course. It's also really refreshing to have a course not centered on the US that was also very applicable to the work students and activists do at Yale. It was also incredibly refreshing to have a course taught on Africa actually taught by a South African professor. I learned a lot and about issues I might not have otherwise."
