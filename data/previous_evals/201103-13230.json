    "The discussion in the class was great and everyone in the class was engaged and participated. The set up of the class was the perfect balance between lecture, participation and other activities. I thought the homework assignments were really great too!",
    "This was a great class. Very interesting and relavent! A good balance between lecture or instruction from professor and discussion among students.",
    "The course is well organized and there are clear connections between the concepts of the course. Very useful and I learned a ton!",
    "This course was one of the best I have taken at YSPH. The material is interesting, and the workload is manageable. It was a pleasure to come to class every week.",
    "This was my absolute favorite class this semester. It is a class full of meaningful discussion as well as lecture which is one half of the class. I walked away from this class with a much better understanding of public health and how it relates to mental health. GREAT CLASS!",
    "Really wonderful - the readings\/topics were right on, and the mix of student presentations, active participation and lecture made the course engaging and fun. Although this is my area of study by choice, I thought this course went above and beyond most others, pushing me to consider aspects of MH care I had not even thought of before.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The readings, lecutres, and student presentations were all thought provoking and stimulated a lot of very thoughtful discussion. More than any other course this semester, this course really made me think and analyze about some very difficult topics.",
    "The class gave an excellent overview of social\/cultural factors in mental health epidemiology, but could have delved a little deeper into some of the reasons for many disparities.",
    "It was an excellent course as we got to hear about a topic from mental health from a student in combination with the professor giving lecture.",
    "The course is very well-run. Readings plus class discussions and occasional writing assignments with a final paper at the end. There were no weaknesses. If I had to find something, I'd say that sometimes the readings were dry, but that's with any class. This was one of the best courses I've taken at YSPH.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester. We covered very interesting material and had engaging discussions.",
    "EXCELLENT CLASS. By far my favorite class of the semester. The readings were informative, and class discussion was always engaging.",
    "The course overall was great. Strengths: a lot of class participation, interesting and relevant readings, the instructor was very interested in the students' ideas, manageable workload.Weaknesses: the classes were not always organized in the best way. The guest speakers cancelled, so some things were taught out of order.",
    "Strengths:- very interesting readings- variety in class structure (films, group work, presentations, etc.)Weaknesses:- would have like to hear guest speakers",
    "This is a great course!! The assignments were thought provoking and flexible. The professor organized different activities (watching documentaries, student presentations, group dynamics) so we learned about mental health from many different perspectives. Her lectures were very interesting and I could easily pay attention during the whole class. It was also easy to feel comfortable enough to participate during her class. The readings were straightforward and adequate for people that had no prior background in mental health."

    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Dr. Smith did a great job of lecturing and really encouraged us to think about the concepts we were discussing. She is obviously very knowledgeable and brought a lot of interesting points to each class. The lecture was very informative, yet presented in a way that was very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0She was extremely nice and helpful and provided good feedback.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Professor Smith is absolutely the best professor I've had so far. She's responsive and smart and so patient. The atmosphere of the class is thoughtful and honest. She pushed us to think critically without us getting off topic. It's a shame it's only one day a week. Those 2 hours always fly by.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Professor Smith was a fantastic instructor. She covers a lot of material in a short amount of time, and she is excellent at promoting in-class discussions. She is also extremely approachable and caring about students.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Dr. Megan Smith was an extremely motivating and inspiring professor. She was always available to meet with us and discuss our presentations. She always gave positive and constructive feedback about our work as well. She really liked to hear our ideas an opinions about mental health and what our experiences were. She also lead great discussions and created interesting group exercises for class. She was very kind and considerate to her students.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Wonderful! Dr. Smith is engaging, obviously quite knowledgeable, and a really wonderful mentor. She pushed us to really think during the course, but was also quite kind and provided really great feedback.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Dr. Smith was a wonderful instructor. Over the 2 hours of class each week, she lectured, we had discussion, and a student presented on a unique topic. I really liked this use of the class time (most other instructors tend to just lecture for the entire 2 hours). I gained a lot from the assigned readings, and Dr. Smith always posed a number of though provoking questions regarding the readings and some difficult topics related to mental health.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan was perfect!",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Dr. Smith was an amazing person and instructor. She was so quick to respond to emails and has structured the course in an enjoyable way. There are no weaknesses for the course.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan Smith was a wonderful instructor! Her class basically ran itself. She prepared for class every week, and her lectures were engaging and very detailed. You could tell she spent a lot of time preparing her lectures, and the students really appreciated that. She was also great at facilitating discussions after her lectures--knowing just how to stimulate discussion without injecting her opinion into it. She also provided constructive feedback on all writing assignments that we turned in. (Something a lot of YSPH professor don't do.) Additionally, she was very welcoming to students who needed to speak with her during office hours. I never felt like I was being \"rushed\" out of her office. Megan's one of the best professors at YSPH. After taking her course, I really feel like I have a grasp on current mental health issues and the factors that influence mental health diagnosis and treatment.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Dr. Smith is an amazing professor. She is extremely approchable, and encourages active participation",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Megan is a tremendous teacher, and person. She is extremely smart, and knows how to lecture to keep students engaged for a ~2 hr time slot (not easy). I would say she is one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0Strength: Very approachable, interested in the students, good at getting back to students with email, fun, a good facilitator of discussionsWeaknesses: wasn't always so organized",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0- great presenter, very engaging- creative approach to some very sensitive topics",
    "Instructor: Megan Veenema Smith \u00a0She is amazing! She is very knowledgeable about social and cultural factors despite the fact that she is a psychiatrist. She is easily accessible for students and very encouraging. She was very flexible with all the assignments so we could focus on the things we were most interested in. She provided adequate feedback before and on the assignments."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to all other students. I think it really shows how important mental health is in public health and it is able to connect to all other concepts.",
    "Take it! You'll learn so much. It's the best.",
    "If you are interested in mental health even a bit, I would recommend this class. As I said before, you learn a lot in a short period of time, and Professor Smith is great.",
    "I highly recommend this class! Very rewarding and thought-provoking.",
    "It is a great course I would recommend to anyone interested in mental health or even to someone who has not had many courses in mental health. The workload was not heavy and the class discussions were really interesting.",
    "This course gives an overview of various topics in mental health and how we as public health individuals can intervene. Her course was the best that I have taken so far at YSPH. Dr. Smith is a great professor, this course should be required to take for all public health students as mental health is such an unrecognized field.",
    "This course can be a wonderful experience if everyone in the class participates and does the readings. Each week there are about 4-5 readings to complete in order to be prepared for the class discussion. Megan really relies on the fact that her students will be prepared for each class, so if you don't like to read or aren't truly interested in the subject, don't take the class because you won't be engaged during each session. The paper at the end of the course requires a lot of work, so don't save it til the last week. If you want a great professor who truly likes to teach, take this class. You'll be rewwarded greatly.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It involves very interesting material, fun class activities, great discussion, and an excellent professor.",
    "Highly, highly recommend if you are interested in Mental Health at all. You will learn a ton, and have a great time.",
    "This course is about the social and cultural factors that contribute to mental illness. I would recommend itto a friend because it is a fun class, taught by an interesting and fun instructor with much experience in the field.",
    "Wonderful opportunity to learn about the history of and current practices in mental health care across the life course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! This was my favorite course during this semester."
