   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class for people who are interested in PolySci and have taken class in this department before.",
    "An easy polisci class.",
    "This is a great course if you have a post-conflict country or region that you're already interested in. The readings wee a bit repetitive sometimes but, overall, they are interesting and worthwhile. I'd recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you are interested in the topic. If you don't have an interest in conflict nations, then the class can become dull very quickly. However, I did like that we got to pick a post-conflict nation and evaluate it from the momento it ended conflict to evaluting the prospect of its sustainable peace.",
    "An amazing course! Professor Simon lectures very well on theory and case studies, but the real draw factor for me was the aspect of choosing a country of responsibility. Students have the same country for the entire semester and get to study it in depth to prepare one presentation and three papers regarding the country. It made the lecture feel almost like a seminar and was a really great way to see how post-conflict politics have played out in a country.",
    "Good class if you're interested in the material, not too much work at all!",
    "Introduction to post-conflict politics.",
    "Yes, if you're interested in gaining an introductory understanding to post-conflict politics.",
    "PLSC347 as seen from the course syllabus is supposed to teach relevant material that will give you a much better understanding of the international climate today. Unfortunately, Professor Simon's execution of the syllabus was more than disappointing. You will not learn anything from the course, unless you were already planning to 100% self teach. Three papers are required on a country for which you are assigned responsibility at the beginning of term, and you actually will learn more about your country from those--but that's only a single country. Until another professor decides to take this course over, I cannot recommend it for any student actually wanting to learn about post-conflict environments.",
    "A great course that provides an extensive background on post-conflict issues in a number of different countries. The class covers a wide range of topics applicable to everyday life including peace-building, transitional justice, truth and reconciliation. The syllabus contains very insightful readings. You have the opportunity to focus research on a country of your choosing.",
    "I would recommend it especially for those interest in post-conflict states. The lectures may be a lil' bit boring but the content should keep you interested if you are keen on the topic.",
    "Political Science 347 01 is a course that focuses on methods of peace within the post-conflict framework.If a student is interested in international relations and the UN this course is for them. I would recommend this course."
