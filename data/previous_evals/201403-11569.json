Even though we knew it would take a long time to get client-specific data, no one really had any idea how long that process would actually take. I learned so much about their processes during those conversations, but it took over a month just to get them started. Another project-specific homework (perhaps in the first or second week) would be extremely helpful.",

    "Advantage: It's nice to work with a real world client and work on practical projects. Disadvantage: My teammate does not do ANY work! He is very good at talking, but he doesn't do ANY work!",
    "I did not enjoy group work as part of this class. I think some projects and the modeling work that goes with it just does not fit group settings well, especially when no one has the same schedule, or the same way of working. Lots of time is wasted just talking about what so and so did or did not do and what we should do or not do in the future, with endless discussions about the structure of the model. In addition, putting a lot of work in a project while others don't necessarily, and ending up with a mediocre result is frustrating and counterproductive. I don't know whether it is possible, but maybe having people try a group out with shorter assignments before delving into a semester long project would help? Or maybe letting people work on solo projects?",
    "Advantages: working with a client and developing a working relationship with my class team. Disadvantages: didn't need to participate in all parts of the project i.e. do all the SimaPro modelling. Just be familiar with the process or do some of it. Sharing SimaPro files was very difficult and time consuming! The educational license is not sufficient to do this, or better explanation of sharing SimaPro database is needed.",
    "It was great to learn from my peers, but it's tough to work on a project in which multiple people need access to one model. It might be better for projects to be smaller in scope in future semesters, with just 2 people per team.",
    "See my response to Question 19.",
    "pro: ability to draw from different expertise cons: lack of a process for team members to evaluate each other",
    "Our group was productive and effective at times, but our dynamic could have been better during final deadline times.",
    "Advantages - different perspectives and strengths contributed to a stronger project. Disadvantages - when building the SimaPro model and doing sensitivity analysis it was time consuming to keep each person in the group up to speed when model changes could not be done together."
