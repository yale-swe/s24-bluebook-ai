    "This course definitely expanded my Spanish vocabulary and gave me a much better understanding of Spanish grammar. I now have a working knowledge of a few verb tenses and other key grammatical elements. I feel like I could partake in a simple Spanish conversation after this course.",
    "I learned the basics of Spanish vocabulary and grammar.",
    "Ability to speak and write Spanish at an elementary level.",
    "Basic Spanish",
    "I learned a basic understanding of Spanish in the present and preterite tense.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, I would say this course is very well designed. It's not too difficult for those who have never taken Spanish before. Because the material becomes increasingly difficult, it encourages students to retain the knowledge they've already learned, which I think is important for any language class. The only criticism I have of the course is that I think there could be a few more listening and speaking exercises throughout it, but really, that's about it.",
    "The professor was amazing. He showed such an interest in the subject that all of the students were engaged. The expectations were clearly posted and homework helped us practice what we were learning. Also, the tests were an accurate reflection of the information that was presented.",
    "Strengths were the individual focus on each student, the practice activities in class, and laid-back yet productive class environment.",
    "Use of the workbook was minimal. I wish that it could be uploaded to Canvas instead of having to purchase it at Tyco.",
    "The compositions leave some room for improvement. You can keep it very basic and fill up the page with grammar you already know, but I think docking for trying to figure out grammar we havent learned yet should be kept to a minimum. I dont think its a huge problem though because we got corrections for the first two papers.",
    "Strengths: The grammar was taught in a good order. Improvements: The online homework was difficult to complete as it marked us off for mistakes that we could not know (for example: complicated names or spellings)."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. First of all, Spanish is just a very practical language to know. Beyond that, as long as you keep up with the material (and the class moves at a manageable pace), you should be able to hold a basic conversation or write a basic, short composition in Spanish with relative ease by the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in Spanish. It did move a little quickly, but it was still manageable.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot in just one semester.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. It moves pretty quickly and is a lot of work if you have no prior experience in the language, but its a good class.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to anyone who is wanting to learn Spanish. It was well organized and I learned much more than I could have predicted."
