    "Only take if you're prepared for a seminar that is very unstructured. A lot of days it seemed like she didn't have anything actually prepared, but rather just went off of whatever tangents we produced. That said, it's a fairly easy class and not unenjoyable. Feels like it's taught by a TA though.",
    "This class had a rather heavy workload but comprehensively covered many different aspects of sexuality, race, and religion. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, as long as they are willing to do the amount of work and are truly interested in the subject matter.",
