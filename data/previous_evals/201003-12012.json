   "comments": [
    "This class was a really interesting and eye opening introduction to the growth of cities and societies in Southern Asia. The professor is a WONDERFUL lecturer and I seriously enjoyed every single class.",
    "This class is GREAT. Mina is a fantastic teacher, the material is very interesting, and you look at lots of pretty pictures. The workload isn't bad, and you're usually interested in doing it--this semester, it was always the reading I did first.",
    "If the class is still available in the Fall, I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in urbanism and architecture and specifically interested in looking at a region that is very rarely discussed at Yale.",
    "If you have any interest in South Asia or Urban Studies, this course is work taking!",
    "Absolutely, if the student is interested in the material.",
    "yes, by all means",
    "Great Course. I loved how we integrated other concepts of sociology, economics, and political science into a course that was initially seemed to be just about architecture.",
    "A very interesting lecture course that, due to small class size, bordered on a seminar format. This course did a wonderful job of integrating architecture, political history, and social theory on South Asia and urbanism in general."
