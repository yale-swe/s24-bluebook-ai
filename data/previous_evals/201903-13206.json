   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "Some advanced finance knowledge",
    "I developed a thorough understanding of arbitrage concepts, bond and credit default swap math, and many other qualitative aspects of hedge funds. You really cover a lot in this course, and it helps to have some background (e.g. ECON 255). In addition to the more straightforward concepts, Pascutti discusses a variety of papers on subjects relating to arbitrage, hedge funds, and investor activism which are really interesting and carefully chosen for this course.",
    "Learned about the professors experiences in the field of finance and his current analyses of the markets today.",
    "Learn a number of different hedge fund strategies and the math behind them. Also a good overview of different financial instruments and applications in the real world. Very 50\/50 finance math and qualitative issues in finance",
    "I learned about the key financial instruments (bonds, options, CDS) and corporate governance and common arbitrage strategies. I can understand most of financial news, and the intuition behind the pricing of these instruments.",
    "Too much to even begin to list here. This is one of the most important classes at Yale and is unique among Yale classes because of the direct usefulness of its material. I would argue that the students in this class receive a huge advantage over other students entering the same industries (investment banking, consulting, etc.) just for having taken this class.",
    "I became better acquainted with hedge funds in the context of the financial environment. Investment management became less of a black box to me.",
    "The course instructs one on the trades and strategies employed by hedge funds, as well as provides good information regarding important parts of the financial system (funds, equity and debt markets, as well as the Fed and interest rates). The class also dives well into options and touches on CDS."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One of the few finance classes at Yale, but taught by the best structure",
    "The course is highly organized, very interesting, and uses frequent assessments that allow you to track your progress. Pascutti has clearly developed this course over the years, and I would not suggest any changes for improvement.",
    "Strengths are the professor are knowledgable and engaging. Weaknesses are the structure is not very clear and the lectures can be repetitive.",
    "Strengths: Pascutti really has a passion for teaching that comes through in all of his lectures. He's incredibly well-spoken and a very good explainer of things. I like the quiz\/final structure because it's much less work week-to-week and they were fairly comprehensive of the material covered in class. They were also difficult enough that the class ended up with a nice curve and you didn't need to be a perfectionist. Weaknesses: The weekly emails could definitely be done better. I never received any response to any of the emails I sent and as a result started putting less and less effort into them each week. The reading response might better be done as addressing a particular aspect of the reading (ie. in this article, what factors did the author find to predict ____). Might also be better incorporated into problem sets than as their own assignment. As for the class feedback, some sort of survey or response to suggestions would help improve that part of the class. The problem sets also felt long and repetitive at times.",
    "Strength: Very engaging lectures, problem sets are pass\/fail so you don't have to spend too much time on it. Weakness: While the 4 quizzes were great checkpoints for learning and made studying for the final very easy, they were high-weightage (10% each) and made the class slightly more stressful than other classes.",
    "Not much could be improved. This is one of the most interesting, engaging, and fairly assessed courses at Yale.",
    "The course benefits from the excellent instruction of Professor Michael Pascutti, along with his energy and enthusiasm for the subject and for markets. Other strengths are interesting and beneficial readings assigned to supplement Professor Pascutti's instruction. A number of guest lecturers from the industry came to speak on their work, which I found to be interesting and very insightful. The course could be improved by providing more practice materials for quizzes and the final exam.",
    "Quizzes are incredibly difficult to prepare for and available materials are not helpful for studying"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Maybe, it depends on the students background. The student needs to already have a strong finance background. Otherwise, it is not well organized for learning and the professor does not provide good feedback either. The TA is not able to teach concepts one is confused with either in office hours.",
    "Yes - Pascutti is an incredibly engaging professor, and in addition to covering financial theory, discusses a number of real-world trades that are incredibly amusing. It's always great to learn from someone who spent years in the industry.",
    "I would really recommend this course to a student who is willing to put in the work. It is very rewarding and interesting, provided you have the proper background.",
    "I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a more quantitative introduction to some interesting and complex topics within finance. A lot of the material (option pricing, CDS, bond math) overlapped with Gary Gorton's Capital Markets class, but Pascutti adds a lot of color to lecture with examples from current and historical events. Pascutti himself is a really engaging lecturer and designs the class such that if you show up to class and do the problem sets, you can do well on the quizzes (which are very difficult). Wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wouldn't show up to class but if this stuff interests you and you put in a little work just for the assessments then it's a good low workload class where you learn a lot.",
    "Absolutely! This class actually teaches you financial knowledge that you can directly apply to either a hedge fund or just financial news. Professor Pascutti is an industry expert who also has a PhD, so he'll give you a combination of practical and academic knowledge.",
    "Absolutely. The way of thinking about the efficiency of markets from this class will hopefully stay with the students into their careers and help them navigate the financial world. It is also generally a fascinating class with plenty of real world examples to keep the material fresh.",
    "Professor Pascutti is great, and the material is very interesting. I would definitely recommend at least one of Pascutti's courses to any Yale Econ major interested in finance.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone interested in hedge funds and relative value trading. Further, Professor Michael Pascutti is an excellent instructor, bringing a lot of industry knowledge and energy to class, and I recommend everyone take at least one of his classes during their time at Yale. Professor Pascutti also invited a number of guest lecturers from the industry to speak on their work, all of whom were interesting and very insightful."
