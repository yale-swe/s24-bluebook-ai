    "I don't believe the course will be taught by Professor Beals again, so this is somewhat moot, but Prof. Beals is wonderful. A very kind man who has been around the block many times and really can contextualize the material in an effective way. I would personally have benefitted from there being more assignments, as it would have forced me to study the material more regularly, but I still took away a great deal from the course, and am more likely to pursue subjects in complex analysis down the road.",
    "Professor Beals is a great lecturer he is always extremely well prepared and he is always ready to answer any questions or just chat about math it anything related.",
    "One of the strengths is that the material to be covered is flexibly chosen by the students, so the material is always interesting and pertinent to learn. One weakness, however, is that because of that, there wasn't as large a continuity between different sections, which made the content feel somewhat detached. This can be improved by highlighting important similarities between different chapters and actively referencing previous techniques\/skills over the course of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I would. Complex analysis is beautiful. Your decision should largely hinge on who is teaching the course, in my opinion. If it's Professor Beals, I would recommend the course without question; just know that you will have to force yourself to sit down and work through the material if you really want to master it, as there aren't many required assignments. With that said, Prof. Beals supplied us with more optional exercises than one could ever hope for, so all of the pieces are there for your taking.",
    "Yes absolutely! very fun and interesting advanced math course"
