   "comments": [
    "It teaches a lot of interesting things I'd never really thought about before, and I enjoyed it a lot. Highly recommended, a lot of fun.",
    "Yes -- take it if you're interested in a practical engineering course that isn't too mathy. Definitely take it if Dufresne's teaching it again.",
    "IT\"S AWESOME! It's going to be a lot of work at times, but it's mostly a fairly chill class (for an engineering class). And it's incredibly fun and engaging. Only take it if it is with Prof. Dufresne--he made the class.",
    "This course is all about structures. Bridges, cantilevers, towers. It makes you feel like an engineer to speak this language and use inches and pounds (psets had a mixture of that and SI). Dufresne's infectious enthusiasm for everything is enough to make me recommend the class, even though the material wasn't thrilling.",
    "If it's with Dufresne, take it with him.",
    "If you are a Mechanical Engineer, you have to take it. Dufresne is an awesome teacher, so even if he isn't teaching this class in the future, you should make a point of taking a class with him.",
    "A fun way to learn some conceptually difficult material. The homework is manageable and Professor Dufresne is fantastic and reasonable and supplied chips for \"experimental evaluation\". Experimental assignments take more time than you'd expect, but are very good applications of the material covered in class.",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course for anyone that has taken an intro physics course and is curious about how objects handle (or don't handle) outside forces. It was a very fun and interesting course but would be difficult without prerequisite physics.",
    "Professor Dufresne is the best professor I've ever had at Yale. He makes the material absurdly engaging and understandable. Take it with him.",
    "I'm not an engineering major but this class was very engaging and approachable, I'd definitely recommend it even if you're not doing math\/science. We go over very everyday phenomena, like trusses, compression and bending of beams, and stuff that is easy to visualize and relate to. I got the feeling that if you're not too experienced with basic math and physics, it definitely takes a while to get the intuition for how to approach some problems. Dufresne is also a great teacher and makes the class a lot of fun. It's also definitely less work than I thought it would be.",
    "very different than years past since it is taught by Dufresne but he is a great teacher. not too hard and his tests always have the same format",
    "Professor Dufresne is awesome. The class isn't too hard either.",
    "One of the core engineering courses taught by a fun professor. The textbook is pretty interesting because it's new and provides a lot of applications that connect to the concepts we study and presents new perspectives. Classes are fun because professor dufresne has us do activities that relate to what we're learning, often in a simple and easily understandable way. Cool class",
    "A great class in the mechanical engineering department. If you have any interest in building things, or statics, or bending stuff, you should definitely take it. I would recommend it to anyone who has a physics background and an interest in the subject area.",
    "This semester Dufresne taught the class because Jan was away. This was his first year so he was sort of learning some of the material along with us. I doubt he will ever teach this course again so you should probably read the Jan reviews. Otherwise this class is basically just the statics unit from physics but more in depth. Chances are you are taking this course because you have to anyway.",
    "Really great when taught by Dufresne. Dufresne is very fair in tests, grading and homeworks and the class itself is engaging.",
    "A good introduction to strength of materials, including truss diagrams, bending, buckling, and fracturing. Professor Dufresne focuses less on empirically derived results that can be looked up but rather the intuition behind the concepts.",
    "YesIf you want to be a Mechanical Engineer you will have to take this and you will learn a lot, just be prepared for the tests",
    "If Professor Dufresne is taking it, I would recommend this class even if you are not a mechanical engineering major. However, I can see the potential for this material to be very confusing and the class to be miserable if another professor teaches it.",
    "You pretty much have to take it even if you don't like statics. Don't worry most of the class is on beams and trusses which is much more interesting.",
    "Professor Dufresne is the man. I loved how he made an effort to learn every student's name (and that he did a pretty good job of it, too!). The midterms and final were challenging but very fair.",
    "If you're taking this course, it's probably because you're a mechanical engineering major, so you have to. Even if you aren't though, this course is still really fun and informative. It's a really cool application of pretty basic physics principles to the real world, going through statics and force balancing, and then into how loads are applied and distributed through objects, and into how things deform. I would recommend taking it with materials science at the same time, as the two classes have a bit of overlap, and they compliment each other nicely (i.e. in 280 you learn how things deform, and in materials science you learn why).",
    "Professor Dufresne is arguably the most committed professor in the MechE department, and take the class with him. One caveat: the exam style was rather inconsistent.",
    "This was an enjoyable class. The psets are reasonable and some times are replaced by activities in the CEID. Dufresne is a great professor who makes the class engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone interested in more mechanics. The teacher is great.",
    "Take this class for Meche major. Good introduction into structures. I will take anything Dufresne teaches",
    "The class is exactly what you'd expect. It's a class about the static relationships of materials and members in structures. There's a lot of math involved, but it doesn't get very complicated.",
    "good course, the physics of how stuff breaks or almost breaks. really interesting material, practical math and physics, especially cool when you get to test it in some of the hands on activities.i would definitely recommend it if you're the stem type (if you're considering taking it you probably are. you'll like it)."
