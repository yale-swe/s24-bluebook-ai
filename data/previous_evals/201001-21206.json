    "In addition to its thematic and substantive depth, the course also debates ontological and methodological issues in social science. The empirical focus in the latter half of the course is immensely helpful for thinking about research strategies for dissertation writing.",
    "This was my first exposure to the topic of nationalism. I found it highly relevant to a couple different projects that I'm working on (and that seemed, at the outset, totally unrelated), and I'm hoping to pursue my paper for the course in future semesters."
