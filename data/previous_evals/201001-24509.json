    "If you'd do the reading anyway, take it. Why not?",
    "Highly recommended! Professor Benhabib is an excellent and highly knowledgeable lecturer. The readings were skillfully chosen.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for a good overview of European political theory in the 20th century.",
    "TAKE IT! This class is amazing.",
    "This course was my first exposure to many of the thoughts in recent continental philosophy and I thought some of the ideas were difficult to grasp, but it was a rewarding experience coming to understand them. It opens up a different way of thinking and though the reading was fairly intense at times, I am glad I took the course.",
    "This class has a fantastic syllabus, one of the best in the philosophy department. Seyla is a good lecturer--not the greatest Yale has to offer, but a very good one--and both Peter and Luke are fantastic TAs.Very thorough overview of Weber, the Frankfurt School, Heidegger, Schmitt, Arendt, Habermas, Foucault and Derrida. I learned quite a lot about all these philosophers. Very dense reading and difficult papers, especially the last one. Also I found a lot of very smart and well read people in this class, which was terrific.But that also made it hard, so take this knowing it'll be a weighty addition to your load.",
    "Don't expect to delve deeply into any of the thinkers, but you can expect a general overview on continental political thought from weber to derrida. emphasis on habermas. papers are manageable and graded fairly. lots of reading.",
    "This is a difficult course, the reading for which can seem completely inaccessible at points. I would only take it after, as the syllabus says, having had some prior exposure to modern philosophy (Hegel, Nietzsche, Kant, etc.) There is much prior knowledge assumed.",
    "I would recommend the course highly-a great introduction to some really tough works of political philosophy.Just be prepared for lots of work!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants a solid background on 20th c political philosophy. The reading can be too abstract and the class is challenging, but it is definitely worth it.",
    "Great class, but pre-reqs are listed for a reason. You can get through the class without the background, for sure, but you simply won't get a much out of it.",
    "The lectures are great, and the sections are fine, but unfortunately too short to delve into the massive amount of reading we're given on a meaningful level.If you're really interested in continental philosophy and have some background (either through DS or additional coursework) it might be worth trying to get into the \"graduate seminar\" part of the course, which is the same except you have your section with Professor Benhabib rather than a TA. I don't actually know if this is at all possible as an undergrad (it would no doubt depend on the willingness of Professor Benhabib), and it would add work to an already very demanding course. Nevertheless, the discussion section would probably be more in depth and would have a greater coherence with the lectures.",
    "PHIL 328 has about five different names, but whatever you call it, it's an amazing class. Professor Benhabib is a star in the philosophy department and, being an important continental philosopher in her own right, is extremely qualified to teach an introduction to the 20th century European tradition.Although this class is meant to be an introduction to the thinkers on the syllabus, it is definitely an advanced class, and I would not recommend it for those who have not completed the prerequisites. For those with a good knowledge of ancient and early modern political thought though (especially DSers!), this class will be very rewarding. The readings are not too long, but very interesting. The papers aren't too long but the grading is quite tough. The section leaders are usually outstanding.A couple words of warning, though: the secondary readings are usually not helpful or useful to the class. Also, the class focuses heavily on the German tradition (the Frankfurt school, Habermas, and Arendt) while spending almost no time on thinkers like Foucault and Derrida. Finally, be sure to make an effort to seek out Professor Benhabib, since it can be difficult to get a chance to interact with her."
