    "This course is significantly more challenging than any math class I had taken at Yale. The material covers a number of algebraic objects at an abstract level. I had trouble developing any intuitive understanding of the material, and I would have appreciated more guidance here.",
    "The strength of this course is the psets. While they are entirely optional, they are excellent for learning. This prevented me from getting killed by missed psets when I got sick, but at the same time gave me such good challenges when I was able to complete them."

    "Commutative algebra is a must if you want to continue on to higher mathematics. It opens the door to many more advanced fields like algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory. Furthermore, this class may likely be your first exposure to homological algebra and category theory which, whether you like it or not, are inevitable in higher mathematics. Thus, if you are serious about mathematics, you really should take this course. However, the immensely terse textbook by Atiyah and MacDonald does a fantastic job of making you feel like an idiot. The textbook doesn't really motivate any of the material, doesn't do full-fledged examples, and often leaves proofs as exercises to the reader. That said, despite feeling stupid the majority of the semester, once I went back and reviewed Atiyah and MacDonald at the end of the term after having had some time to let the ideas soak it, it was, well, actually pretty enjoyable. Throughout this course as the abstract nonsense piled higher and higher, I just kept telling myself that the things being taught were surely good for something even if I would have to wait until a future course to find out exactly what that something was. In my opinion, the most difficult chapter of the book is the second one (on modules), which can be a bit demoralizing, but if you power through you ultimately get to learn some interesting theory such as primary decomposition, the nullstellensatz, and dimension theory. Prof. Smilga essentially just follows the textbook to a T and has a similar habit of leaving important parts of proofs as exercises for the reader. Thus to a large extent to get a lot out of this class, you really need to read through A&M carefully, filling all the details of the proofs if you can, and just keep telling yourself that it will all be worth it when you finally get to take a course in algebraic geometry.",
    "Yes, it is a must for a Math major, and Ilia pays a lot of attention to teaching this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in algebra or algebraic geometry. This class was probably my favorite math class in my time at Yale so far."
