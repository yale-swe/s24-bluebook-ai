   "comments": [
    "Good course organization. Definitely hard knowing what to expect on the third class of every module as the difficulty varied. In addition, some professors did a better job than other emphasizing the most important part of their module.",
    "Some modules and professors were really cool (Bailyn, Emerson, Schultes, Schutenmaur ??), some were hard (Baltay, Kankel) and some made me want to never come to class again (Prober)",
    "The strength of this course is that we get to learn about various topics but the weakness could be that sometimes we don't get too deep about one topic.",
    "The course is well-organized with 3-week-long modules for each science topic. Every professor is very knowledgeable in their own field and presented interesting intro lectures during their module. The course benefits from a seminar setting but could be more engaging.",
    "This course could be improved upon by streamlining information between the instructor(s) and the students. The use of canvas is minimal by some of the guest lecturers, and it's hard to keep track with their expectations because we switch modules so often.",
    "Great Course, can't think of any improvements!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes maybe to a first-year who is looking to fulfill a science credit. Modules are fairly applicable, some being more interesting than others.",
    "If you need a SC, this is hands down probably one of the easiest. You really only need to worry about it like 1 hour a week, if that.",
    "Yes, because you get to learn about science topics that you may not be familiar with.",
    "This class is a good and easy science credit.",
    "Yes if you're interested in exploring different sciences but do not wish to study them in depth at the moment.",
    "As a fifth class, yes! But material is only covered three days (since one meeting each week), so not too in depth.",
    "I would recommend this course to students unaware of many scientific fields or looking to pursue non-science-related fields. It's great at introducing many topics, but if students are interested in a specific topic, they may be bored with the constant changing in course materials.",
    "Yes, it has great pacing, excellent gust speakers, a very accessible professor, and a ton of fun learning about so many various things!"
