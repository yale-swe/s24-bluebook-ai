    "I have acquired basic grammar level (Present, past tenses), learnt a lot of vocabulary, understanding of Spanish from different speakers, speaking skills - ability to keep basic conversions going.",
    "A solid foundation in Spanish grammar and vocabulary that has given me a way to start learning this language. Also helped to get me comfortable speaking (or at least trying to) speak in Spanish which is something I have never done before.",
    "I have a basic working knowledge of Spanish grammar and common vocab",
    "I learned an incredible amount of Spanish vocab and grammar, in addition to improving and practicing my fluency.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class moves fairly quickly, but exams are fair. Homework and class activities really help reinforce topics learned.",
    "Little wiggle room for profs. lots of standardization, ultimately this is a hard feature to get rid of because of the sheer amount of L1 Spanish classes there are. The strengths of the course are multifold, engagement was great, there were several different ways in which material was reviewed and presented, small class size facilitated and consistent learning environment, and the textbook supplemented the course well.",
    "The course could be improved if it slowed down just a little bit (perhaps getting only through Ch 1-8 instead of also Ch 9, because Ch 9 felt extremely rushed). I felt we were going through too fast and I was not being able to practice each topic as much as was necessary to fully absorb it. We should also review the Supersite homework in class.",
    "The biggest strength is that course meets everyday and in that way you don't lose your Spanish. All the listening practices definitely helped, but they did not reflect the format of the actual listening exam in the end of the course. The course is really well structured.",
    "Meeting everyday was definitely a strong strength of this class and helped us get comfortable with Spanish. Sonia is also the greatest part of this class. She is helpful, so kind, fun, and a wonderful professor. She made this class great.",
    "It was amazing. The beginning was scary when my professor started only speaking in Spanish, but as the course went on it got easier.",
    "Overall, really good! Very fast paced which was good in general but sometimes was too much so.",
    "Strengths: the homework was useful for consistent practice and the in class practice was immersive and helpful Weaknesses: I felt like there could have been more practice dedicated to listening because that was the exam I felt least prepared for compared to the others",
    "The online assignments felt very parallel to the course. It's not that they weren't helpful, and there was very well-timed correlation between what we did in class and the questions asked online, but sometimes the questions needed clarification."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. It was a good introductory class. I loved seeing my growth from not being able to speak the language at all to being able to hold a conversation.",
    "Yes, taught very well a very good language to learn.",
    "Yes! My teacher (Sonia Valle) was absolutely wonderful and I looked forward to going to class every day. Sonia made the class fun while also being very informative and a great teacher.",
    "Yes!! Great course for true beginners (I haven't studied any Spanish before taking it). You develop basic language skills that you need in any language over a very short period of time. Workload is not that big compared to some other language courses.",
    "Absolutely! It was the best Spanish class I have ever had, and I actually felt like I was starting to learn Spanish and could see the progression into future classes.",
    "Yes! If you want to be fluent in Spanish, this is a great course! They throw you into the deep end, and you have to sink or swim.",
    "Yes. If someone is interested in Spanish it is the only way to learn it.",
    "Definitely! Professor was great and I learned a lot. Hard but worth it.",
    "Absolutely. If you want to learn Spanish, this course is consistent, intense, and will make you enjoy learning the language, which is very important."
