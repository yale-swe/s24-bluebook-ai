   "comments": [
    "Econ 450 is a course in which you will examine the issues that face an institutional investment manager. With numerous guest speakers and relevant readings, this course teaches in a way that a textbook can't, and gives the student true insight into a field that is not easy to understand from the outset. I would absolutely, 100% recommend this course to anyone who has the slightest interest in the subject matter, as I am confident that whatever you lack in interest can be overcome by the phenomenal teaching. A+.",
    "It is a class that teaches a person how to think of money management, and especially endowment management. It teaches one about the pitfalls of some of the strategies out thier to normal investors, and how relationships with some firms are not always beneficial. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who can get into it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Definitely competitive to get into, and almost every student worked in finance the previous summer (and plans to after college). While a strong finance background is definitely not necessary, I would recommend this class moreso to students with experience in the field. We learned about a wide variety of asset classes and methods to structure portfolios for a variety of investors. This was an extremely rewarding class.",
    "The course has good material on asset management and invites great guest speakers.",
    "Yes, it exposes you to a lot of interesting guest speakers who are at the top of their field.",
    "This is a truly special class. You will come to every class in great anticipation and will leave with goosebumps. Regardless of your background in finance, if you get in, take it. Dave and Dean make the material accessible, such that a student in any major would be fine (with that said, most of the students in the class study economics \/ finance, and of the entire class, only 4 students will not be working at a bulge bracket bank next year).Also, I would recommend to spend time on the application. The application sheet says to only write a few sentences but write as much as you want. The competition is tough so really let them know how you feel.",
    "This is by far one of my favorite classes at Yale. Professor Swensen and Takahashi are awesome and my classmates are all really smart. Would definitely recommend this seminar.",
    "Incredibly class - a must take if you get in. Swensen and Takahashi lead great discussions and give interesting insights to institutional investing. Guest lecturers are amazing.",
    "The workload is ok, so take it if you need a seminar credit. Don't think I leant much though.",
    "Great class if you are interested in the topic.",
    "Great class! The assignments are time-consuming, but it's well worth it."
