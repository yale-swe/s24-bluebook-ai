    "I really like the topics and papers chosen to cover in this course. However, sometimes I feel that our extra papers assigned are too long\/irrelevant. I would not complain about long papers if they were very valuable and really added something to the original papers, but many of them did not and we really only have limited time with all our other coursework. I was very disappointed in the level of engagement from the other students in my section: these are concepts I would really love to have conversations about with my classmate and to discuss the biochemistry and medical and research applications, but it is hard to do that when many students clearly did not read the papers and get away with it week after week. It got a bit better once we started assigning students questions to answer, but I still got the impression they really only worked to prepare that one question. I understand people are busy, but we really could have gotten a lot out of the discussions. I also wish that Dr. Konigsberg did a bit more to get conversation going and to encourage other students to speak up. It definitely got better throughout the fall, but I was in general disappointed as I would have loved more discussion from classmates.",
    "Goes well with the medical school curriculum, facilitates biochemical and molecular aspect of it Workload can be a lot during some weeks when there are several assigned readings"

    "I really enjoyed engaging with the papers and applying the concepts to what we were learning in class and to future research project ideas, but I would have appreciated more open discussion from classmates. Instead, the same people were answering questions and trying to get the conversation going every time.",
    "A lovely course that complemented well with the medical school curriculum -- providing an insight into the biochemical basis of disease and creative approaches.",
    "Yes, goes along well with the medical school curriculum, while at the same time looking at the molecular and biochemical aspect part of it",
    "Yes I would recommend."
