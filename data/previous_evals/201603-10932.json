    "I was able to improve my understanding and knowledge of German and German culture through every-day classroom discussions and learning in German.",
    "I improved my reading, speaking, and listening ability in German.",
    "learned a great deal about german cities, and interesting points about german culture, a refreshing change form GMAN 110 and 120",
    "I got better at speaking, writing, and understanding German. Some grammar and some vocab and a little bit of history and culture. What you'd expect, really.",
    "I improved my German skills considerably, achieving a B1 level of proficiency by the end of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "I think the class was good in exposing me to details of German culture and revieweing some aspects I learned last year. However, I found that we did not do enough grammar work nor did we have activities to use the vocabulary we were learning in writing. I was also often discouraged by some activities.",
    "Frankly, I was not up to the level of the course, and it moved too fast for me to keep up. I would have preferred less work and more attention devoted to each assignment and in-class activity, but it seemed like most students in the class were able to keep up with the pace.",
    "Too much busy work to the point of hurting my engagement with the class.",
    "Thorsten (course lecturer) was definitely a strength, a very nice guy!",
    "I thought that the strong emphasis on speaking in class was very good, but there was not enough listening practice in class, which made the listening comprehension on the exams very difficult.",
    "Strengths - interactive classroom discussion, broad range of assignments that developed many different areas of skill, efficient planning of assignment and test dates, cooking event was a great success! Weaknesses - the email exchange became a bit tedious, especially when my German exchange partner stopped responding to the emails",
    "I wish there was more traditional drilling on grammar and speaking. Like grammar workbooks. I think it would have helped me develop my speaking skills.",
    "It was a pretty effective class at improving our German in a fairly interesting and culturally relevant way. Some of the cultural topics were bizarre and could be dispensed with, but that's more the textbook's fault. The real problem was timing and advance notice for assignments. EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON THE SYLLABUS! If a week says we only have a test and Quia homework, that should be all we have - not also a surprise oral presentation for the next day. We need to be able to plan our weeks. Also, there shouldn't be major essays\/homework\/presentations due the day before a test. >. It would also be nice if there were opportunities for extra credit, and there should be some way to avoid giving one grade for a four-person group project with weaker and stronger members. We're not in high school anymore. The system with handing in drafts is good, though -- keep that. It's probably a pain to grade but we learn a lot more from it.",
    "Pros were the fact that we were very engaged in the language. Having the class every morning and having to do lots of assignments greatly helped to improve my German skills. Cons maybe we didn't get enough speaking practice in class. We had a debate once and we were all rushing to speak and have our say in German. If we did that more often it would've been great speaking practice. Also, if we got our mistakes while speaking pointed out a little bit more it would've been helpful. Obviously every mistake can't be corrected, but identifying errors would've helped."

    "i think that L3 German discouraged me from wanting to move forward with the language. i would be hesitant to recommend the course.",
    "Absolutely, particularly with Professor Wilhelm.",
    "It's a ton of busy work. Get a good instructor.",
    "If you are taking German as your foreign language requirement, you pretty much have to take this class. I would recommend it - it's fun and the workload is manageable.",
    "Yes, if you're deciding between German and another language, I would recommend German, especially if you can get Prof Wilhelm!",
    "Only if you have a lot of time outside of class to practice and improve. Maybe even if you have native speakers to talk to!",
    "I mean, some of the activities suck, group projects are a huge bummer, and sometimes it's boring, but you'll definitely learn some German, which was the goal."
