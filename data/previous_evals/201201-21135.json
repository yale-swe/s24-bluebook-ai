    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another person. I would summarize it as a course that meets twice weekly, once for a lecture on a topic and once for a discussion based on questions from the students and instructor. Although the topics are all unrelated, the breadth of information covered is excellent and there is a lot of thought provoking discussion that occurs.",
    "I highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, an excellent class, sometimes difficult if you are not familiar with the topic (depending on the prof).",
    "Useful and important class to take. Yes I would recommend it.",
    "It was an excellent course. I would definitely recommend it to others.",
    "Yes, I will. You can learn a lot of recent controversial issues beyond fundamental discoveries in this course."
