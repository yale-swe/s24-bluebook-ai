   "comments": [
    "Less time on algebraic details behind the hydrogen atom and more time on p-theory and other important concepts, please! Otherwise fantastic course. Though some of the psets were purely algebraic and not at all instructional. Nagai is a super sweetheart.",
    "I didn't really enjoy the material. First few weeks were interesting, but once we started doing perturbation theory on the hydrogen atom I got really bored. You spend a lot of time calculating scalars, which aren't particularly interesting. Teaching was okay. Test difficulty exhibited great variance: easy midterm, much harder final.",
    "if you're taking phys 441 you are probs a physics major. this class is definitely doable following APHY 439 from the applied physics department. you really go in depth, so you don't cover a lot of griffiths chapters, but you do all the derivations. which some people may not like. the work is manageable for a physics class, with only 9 psets.",
    "Yes, I recommend. The material is important and Nagai provides as cogent a presentation of it as you're likely to find anywhere. He's very professional and his lectures were always clear and coherent. Particularly given that most of his work is in astronomy, I was impressed at how well he was able to answer questions on the fly.",
    "I struggled with this course. I took 440 last semester, and while it was not very well taught, I liked some of the topics and did well enough in the course. Comparing 440 with 441 (in reviews), many students said it was about more interesting material and was better taught. I thought this class was going to be good or even great. Wrong. At the beginning of the semester, each class I would pay attention, take notes, try to be engaged and ask questions, but at the end I could not summarize what I learned. The textbook, Griffiths Quantum Mechanics, was no better than the lectures, and was actually far worse this semester than it was for 440. The opaque or non-existant explanations of important topics are far more frustrating because the material is more complicated and less intuitive. The problem sets are poor. Most problems are taken directly from griffiths. They are difficult and time consuming yet I almost never felt like I learned or accomplished much after finishing one because of how griffith's problems necessitate copying equations and plugging them into each other until you prove whatever complicated and apparently meaningless result was the aim of the problem. At the end of the semester, we all completed presentations in groups of two or three students. This was probably my favorite part of the course because the topics were varied and interesting and at an appropriate level. However the presentation only counted for 5% of the course grade, so compared to all of the other end of semester work it could not be a high priority and it certainly was not going to help make up for some poor Pset grades. As is typical for Yale courses, I have little idea what my letter grade will look like, but what I have heard the \"curve\" (or map) will be very harsh--IE need a 92% for an A. I think this is a mistake and is harsh because the course is only taken by about 15 students who are mostly intensive physics majors. Grade inflation in higher education might be a problem, but its a not a good idea to try to fix it one class at a time. Perhaps I have learned a good lesson this. I'm not cut out for this kind of stuff and I should work on something I enjoy and am good at. Think hard about why you are taking this class before you sign up.",
    "Overall, 441 was one of the best (if not the best) physics course I've taken at Yale so far. I thought the course was extremely well organized (I probably never had such an organized physics course at Yale) and I really enjoyed it. Sometimes calculating all of the possible corrections to the hydrogen atom gets boring, but I feel like I learned a lot more in 441 than in 440 (but I took 440 with McKinsey, which was horribly taught). Nagai is an extremely dedicated professor and cares a lot about his students. Not rarely, he would make time for students to guide them through all of their doubts and concerns about the material. His notes are super well organized (it's very impressive) and he's a very clear lecturer. Josh, the TA, was also very helpful and always responded very quickly to students' doubts. I think the professor and the TA made the class even though the material was not the most exciting. I felt very comfortable about what I was learning, because the class was so well taught and the TA was so dedicated to answering our questions. I wish the final project was worth a little more than 5% of the grade though, because it definitely takes a little bit more of time than a problem set. The workload is not absurd for a physics class, and you still feel like you're learning quite a bit.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. PHYS 441 was my favorite course this semester. I really enjoyed the class and learned a great deal about important material including the solution to the Schrodinger equation for the Hydrogen atom, the mathematical interpretation and relevant phenomena associated with electron spin, fine structure (including relativistic corrections and spin-orbit coupling), shifts in energy levels due to external fields, the variational principle with associated applications to the helium atom and hydrogen molecule, and multi-particle and multi-electron wavefunctions including symmetrization of spin and orbital components. Professor Nagais lectures were extremely clear, organized, and engaging, and the problem sets were both comprehensive in reinforcing the material and also at a reasonable level of difficulty that was never excessive. The pace of the lectures and course overall was also extremely manageable, and (unlike my experience in many math and physics classes) I was almost always able to follow Professor Nagais entire lecture all the way through. (You can expect that hell follow the relevant sections in Griffiths pretty closely.) Professor Nagai is also extremely caring and approachable. Id highly recommend taking the class with him if you can.",
    "You focus on the hydrogen atom, developing widely applicable tools along the way. Lots of work. Midterm and final were long and difficult, make sure you study hard for those.",
    "Take it if you have to, otherwise there's cooler stuff out there. This course is everything you ever wanted to know about the hydrogen atom, and a lot more about the hydrogen atom. The first half of the course focuses on 3D quantum mechanics, spherical harmonics, angular momentum and spin. The second half focuses on computational methods such as perturbation theory and the variation principle, and features long and tedious problem sets where you compute small corrections to the energy levels due to various effects. Final exam was insanely time pressured, with the majority of us leaving questions blank."
