   "comments": [
    "In general my expectations were met in this studio. I found the first half of the semester a little frustrating because so much of it was devoted to precedent studies and I think our masterplan design may have suffered from it. I also felt that the group work for the studio was not evenly distributed and left much of the responsibility to a few people.",
    "I expected to work through a masterplanning and building scale project on a lake site in Jaipur, developing and reinforcing an urban idea and working up in scale to produce a building. As Professor Porphyrios acknowledged during our final review discussion, the semester took on too much in attempting an extensive precedent study, large masterplan, and corresponding hotel or resort plan containing a worked out single building.The studio would have produced much stronger work either by leaving out the masterplan and moving from precedent analysis to a rather large and well worked out building or by leaving out the precedent analysis and working up in scale from a masterplan to a fitting individual building.The studio's methodology of transposition from fort\/palace type to the similar resort\/hotel type was problematic. These two programs are too analogous and encouraged a straightforward space-planning and recomposition exercise. As a result, the studio's remained far too attached to the precedents and did not engage with contemporary urban, tectonic, or spatial ideas. The studio's projects would have gotten past the low, familiar, courtyard hotel type and been far more spatially imaginative and evocative with one of the following approaches:1. Take an exceptional Indian type (stepwell, floating palace, hill tower etc.) and rationalize it to generate a hotel.2. Take the fort\/palace type and produce from it a fundamentally different program, like a museum.Abstinence from physical modeling as a working technique allowed us to put aside issues of mass and volume and reinforced the studio as a planographic compositional and functional problem. This came out at the final review, where discussion often remained on issues of access and adjacencies and did not always progress to spatial conditions.The biggest disappointment overall was to blocked from testing out radical urban ideas. For many of us graduating, this would have been the last chance to think more freely about alternative and extreme and extreme images and organizations of urban space. There is a basis for alien\/meteorite\/misfit urbanism today, and a basis for the hybrid. It is essential these discussions be able to be broached even in a studio concerned with the normative and familiar. Professor Porphyrios's comment during the final review that architecture today is simply intellectual masturbation and students need not do anything more than copy existing spaces, need not in fact even THINK, in unacceptable at a serious and professional school of architecture.",
    "Too much time was spent on 'precedent studies'. To the extent that there was not enough time to utilize what was gleaned from the precedents.",
    "I expected this studio to be one based in the contemporary reinterpretation of precedents, and the studio met that expectation.One suggestion I have is that I would have liked a bit more freedom in both presentation formatting and design. In terms of design, while I appreciated the concept of using precedents, I would have liked to take that transformative aspect one step further. I would have liked to explore the role of traditional forms in contemporary architecture, and how these forms can be altered and adapted to fit modern needs.I also would've liked to explore elevations and details more fully, as we focused most of our attention to the planning aspect for a great portion of the semester.",
    "My expectation for the studio was to gain a rich understanding of Indian architecture and I feel that this expectation was met. It would have been ideal if there was more time to explore the principles that were presented in the precedent studies in our own work.",
    "I was not quite sure what to expect from the studio and tried to come into the studio with an open mind. As the semester went on, it became clear that there was really no room for discussion or deviation from the architectural style. The precedent study was valuable but we spend half of the semester doing it. It really was way too much time spent on that since we did not even analyze the buildings. We were tracing images and drawings for quite a long time.I think the scheduling of the semesterwas also unfortunate in that we barely had any time to work on designing our individual buildings."

    "The resources available were adequate for this studio.",
    "All resources were up to par. Printers remained online and 3D printers kept toschedule.",
    "Yes, materials were available. However, in the future if this studio will 3D print models, I would suggest having a meeting with DM and having them outline the process\/guidelines.",
    "We were required to 3D print models of our precedent buildings (and not of our own work). Because of this, it was unrealistic for us to all use the same 3D printer for the assignment. This should be better planned. Also, it was frustrating that we were required to print such expensive models."

   "comments": [
    "I found individual crits with both Demetri and George most helpful. In the future it would be helpful to find time to do more models and to have Demetri visit more often later in the semester.",
    "The studio as a whole needed more visits from Professor Porphyrios. We met with him about three times, excluding opening studio presentations and travel week.I did not assemble the precedent book myself, but I fervently believe no student should be asked to do this concurrently with studio work. Any booklet produced for any studio should be produced as paid work beginning no sooner than the semester's end.",
    "I found the most effective aspects to be individual pin ups and desk crits. I especially thought that after midterm, these individual meetings were more valuable to me than group meetings.I also very much appreciated the variety of jury members selected for the final jury. I thought each person offered and interesting point of view, and the conversation between critics, and with students was valuable and informative.",
    "It would have been beneficial to have more individual desk-crits with Professor Porphyrios, especially regarding the hotel design, whenever he was in New Haven.",
    "Most of the pin-up times were spent talking about requirements and color-schemes.... not productive at all. I think the studio would have benefited from providing more individual feedback and spending less time in group discussions about requirements.Also, the consideration of scale in the studio requirements was not very well thought out. We spent our time building a site model that was at an unrealistic scale and in the end we didn't even end up using it because the scale of the models was changed.We did not build enough models in the studio. And it was frustrating that there was nothing to building a model of. We really weren't designing space, we were simply shuffling plans around because we were literally told to take the precedent drawings. I have never been so bored in a studio."
