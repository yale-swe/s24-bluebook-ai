   "comments": [
    "Its a great begginer math course here that moves at a managable pace.",
    "I would recommend it. If you are good at math, an A is well within reach and the work load isn't overbearing.",
    "Great class, definitely take it if you need any calc for econ or another major.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "Intro calc is never going to be thrilling, but this is as good as it's going to get. Be prepared for a fairly immature crowd",
    "It's a good class if you want a pretty easy QR. There's a decent amount of work, but it's all straightforward. You could definitely put in less work in a different class if you don't care about grades.",
    "Math 112 is very much like AP Calculus AB. It starts with functions and it ends with integrals. The course is taught like a standard math course: The professor (grad student, in some cases) stands at the board, presents a problem, answers our questions, presents another problem, answers our questions, presents another problem, and so on and on. If you're looking for something familiar, this is the course for you. There are no surprises in this course.Also, make sure that you can do every problem on the problem set. They pick the toughest problems from the textbook, so if you can do them, you'll be set for the in-class quizzes and the final.",
    "Math 112 gives a good overview of the basics of calculus, but is also a good course to refresh calculus skills that were taught during high school."
