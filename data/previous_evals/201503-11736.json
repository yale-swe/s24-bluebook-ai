   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to my fellow student.",
    "It's an extremely rewarding language class, and it is so with the expectation that you keep up with everything that's stipulated (which is quite a lot, to say the least). But if you are interested in picking up Japanese at all (or even any challenging, useful language), I definitely (x100) recommend it.",
    "It's a great course! The lessons focus a lot on speaking in Japanese with a lot of scenario-playing, and it is quite helpful in improving your grasp of the language. It's very intense but you'll get a lot out of it if you put in the effort. The instructors are all terrific, extremely enthusiastic and committed to their teaching.",
    "Very recommendable for anyone who wants to learn Japanese. Learning is very quick and clear.",
    "REALLY TOUGH, but REALLY FUN. Don't take this as a gut. Don't take this if you don't care about languages. (Maybe take this if you already know Chinese or Korean.) Be prepared to put in the work--but it's an absolute blast.",
    "Such an obscene amount of homework would naturally require an exceptionally rewarding experience, which JAPN 110 provides. This course is only for the passionate and strong, but it comes highly recommended."
