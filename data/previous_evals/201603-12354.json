    "EP&E 492 gives me the flexibility to write my senior essay in an independent study structure.",
    "Though Beth was phenomenally helpful in giving us feedback on our proposals, EP&E really needs to have a seminar style class with small piece meal assignments due (potentially using the Sociology senior seminar as a model). It is too hands off right now, and I think all students could really benefit from having more assignments due from the major and to have a once a week seminar that encourages students to turn in a proposal, literature review, preliminary methods, and a timeline."

    "I would recommend this course to another EP&E student if the student wants to write a full-year essay and\/or if there does not appear to be a suitable seminar in which the student would like to write his or her essay.",
    "As other students have said in the past, you have to be very self-motivated if you want to write a senior thesis in this department. While other departments will give you a seminar style class with assignments due, EP&E gives you one research proposal workshop and a proposal due and that's all you have to keep yourself accountable. Find good advisors and create deadlines with them because you're not going to be able to get that level of accountability from this \"course\"."
