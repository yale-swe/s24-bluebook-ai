   "comments": [
    "I would say the class takes a decent amount of time to understand, but it is very doable if you put the work into it. Sometimes it takes a lot of work to put the concepts and math together to have it make sense. I would recommend it if you want to take the time to understand it and do well.",
    "I would recommend taking Econ 110 only if you have Tolga, because the curve sucks. Overall, I liked this course.",
    "This class provides a very good introduction to microeconomics. I would recommend it to any student that wants to have a more involved classroom experience with econ than students in a lecture class might receive.",
    "I would recommend Econ 110. I took AP Micro in high school and thought this was a step up in terms of content (especially in the latter part of the course), but also keep in mind that there is virtually no calculus used here (just same basic derivatives). The textbook is useful for going further in-depth than class. Tolga keeps the class fun, but it's also not a seminar--just a scaled-down version of lectures. Psets are more in-depth than what we go over in class, which is useful for tests--which I think were pretty fair.",
    "The course is thought really well and it's easy to find help whenever you need it after-class or during office-hours. The course material is very interesting and the ideas learnt are applicable. However if you are mathematically inclined, you might feel discontent and find the details highly specific and unnecessarily complicated due to lack of mathematical sophistication.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend it. Though the curve is tough, students learn a lot in lecture and through the psets, and the additional knowledge and comprehension more than makes up for the difficulty.",
    "If you are interested in an economics major and you get accepted into the seminar, I would highly recommend that you take it. You will learn significantly more than in the lecture.",
    "Take this course only if you're considering Econ as a major; it will make or break that decision. Tolga is a great professor to have, but you will have to put in a good amount of effort if you're not naturally talented in Economics.",
    "I would recommend it strongly. Having econ as a seminar instead of a lecture made it much easier to connect to the teacher and to fellow students. It also made it much harder to not pay attention: Tolga challenged us and made us work hard, which made the class worthwhile.",
    "ECON 110 is obviously a harder curve than ECON 115, but if you take the course with Tolga it is well worth it. I definitely felt like I learned and understood the material well through the seminar format and Tolga's great sense of humor and his incredible lexicon of knowledge made the class periods interesting. Don't be afraid of ECON 110, it is a tough class, but it is manageable and it is a great way to begin studying economics in college.",
    "I would summarize this class as a comprehensive overview of Microeconomics. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "The course is a great base for economics as a whole. I recommend it for anyone looking to go into an econ field.",
    "I would not recommend it because it was hard and the curve in the lecture was much better",
    "An intimate gathering for the discussion of economics. Definitely would recommend it to other freshman, especially in the seminar version as you get the information and the direct support you might need.",
    "I would say that econ is a great way to challenge yourself mentally, and that it is a very rewarding class when you do understand the material. I would recommend this class to another student if they were interested in the topic, but it is a challenging course and I would stress that.",
    "Q: Do you want a good grade? Take the lecture. Q: Would you rather learn the material as well as possible? Tolga is your man."
