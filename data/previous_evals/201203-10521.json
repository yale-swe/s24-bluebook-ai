    "This class is a good introductory class into the fundamental concepts of organometallic chemistry.",
    "Good introduction to organometallic chemistry with good examples of how they can be applied to various areas.Yes, definitely recommended for organic and inorganic students.",
    "This class moves very quickly, since the whole textbook is covered. As such, you are not required to learn any of the topics in-depth for the exams. You just need to be familiar with the general concepts to do well. If you are interested in organometallic chemistry, this class may be for you, although the scope is very broad and you probably won't be interested in all aspects of the subject.",
    "Good introductory course for organometallics.",
    "- good introduction into organometallics- helps understanding organometallic coupling reactions in organic chemistry",
    "I would recommend it to any student willing to work in Inorganic Chemistry area.",
    "This class is a very good introduction to this interesting field, covering a large scope of principles and applications which can give the student an appreciation of the subject. I would recommend this class to anyone seriously interested in chemistry",
    "Nice course. Will prepare you if you want to do organometallics\/coordination chemistry in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student highly. The material is challenging, but manageable, and it is my opinion that Dr. Crabtree's historical impact on the field of organometallic chemistry makes him one of the highest authorities on the subject."

    "Good refresher for organometallic chemistry. It has helped me build my foundations for the topic and exposed me to interesting areas of research to explore. I'll probably be using transition metals in my research, so the course has been very useful.",
    "Since it's my first time to study organometallics, the class gave me basic idea about the field. To those who want more advanced knowledge, the class might not be so helpful.",
    "A lot was review, but nonetheless very helpful. It was very insightful to hear the material from Prof. Crabtree's point of view.",
    "It made me understand the organometallic reaction mechanisms.",
    "Helps prepare for related research.",
    "Although I don't foresee this material being much use to me in my chosen area of organic synthesis, I understand how general knowledge of organometallic vocabulary and mechanism may be important.",
    "This course provided me with a deeper knowledge of organometallic chemistry and its applications. I found that this class was also highly applicable to my other courses this semester. Undoubtedly this knowledge will also be highly useful throughout my PhD study."
