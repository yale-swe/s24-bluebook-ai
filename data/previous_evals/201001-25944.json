   "comments": [
    "I would take this class if you're genuinely interested in the topic and are interested by the readings, which were phenomenal. Be prepared for a 2 hour discussion that will inevitably be dominated by 1 or 2 people though.",
    "If you're looking for legitimately a very, very interesting class to take, take this one.",
    "It's a pretty specific subject, so take it if you want to know about it. Great if you're interested in it, but I could imagine it being tough\/boring if you are just taking it for kicks.",
    "Definitely. You'll learn a lot about many different Islamic social movements, and have an excellent base of knowledge to understand the Middle East.I would especially recommend this class to non-Sociology or MMES majors. There's not too much academic jargon, and it's very accessible subject matter.",
    "Take it if it seems interesting - it's a great course.",
    "Recommended to anyone who wants to learn more about what the US considers to be \"terrorist organizations.\"",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar for anyone interested in social studies, history, political science, or the Middle East.",
    "It's a really good survey course of the major Islamic social movements of the twentieth and twenty-first century",
    "Even if you think you know a lot about the Middle East, I suggest you take this course--I promise that you'll learn a lot and also from a completely different lens! The title encapsulates everything--you'll be learning about Islamic social movements!"
