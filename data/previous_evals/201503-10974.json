   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Really good for developing conceptual understanding and getting real context for the problems of econometrics. Would be more helpful if we were doing more STATA work...",
    "Introduction to econometrics, with a heavy focus on the underlying intuition and math.",
    "I think it's a great introduction to econometrics.",
    "The course is very difficult and you should be prepared for a lot of hard work and for very difficult exams. However, the course is great for anyone who wants to understand statistics and regressions and how to solve and spot problems when running regressions. Definitely recommended.",
    "very helpful course for me who have not much experience with metrics",
    "No I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it. There are far better metrics courses at Yale in other departments. PLSC 500 and 503 would be a much better fit if you are not an IDE student.",
    "Mandatory requirement for IDE.",
    "Excellent overview of the fundamentals of econometrics--particularly for those interested in development economics. While the course can be challenging, an excessive amount of prior mathematical preparation is not assumed, and I would highly recommend this course for any students wanting a rigorous introduction to econometric techniques.",
    "Econ 558 is a great course to understand fundamental concept in econometrics and to learn about various manners they could be applied in Development Economics. I would definitely recommend the course to other students.",
    "Developmental econometrics for sure - lots of focus on RCT measurements",
    "Good introduction to statistics and econometrics, again little material that you won't have seen before but it will just be covered much more in-depth and made much more challenging than at undergraduate.",
    "It purports to focus on application of econometrics, which is true to a certain extent. The first half of the course however, covers basic statistics, which could be helpful in understanding but results in much less time to go through things like regressions and different statistical tools and techniques.",
    "Yes.",
    "After a review of relevant concepts in probability and statistics, the course discusses econometric approaches and is great in that it focusses on concepts rather than mechanics. The course is interesting for students who already have some background in statistics and econometrics.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course if the student has already taken previous rigorous econometrics courses.",
    "A very well presented overview of the mechanics of applied econometrics. Not applied in the \"crunch data\" sense, but applied in the \"I know how to use this and what it means when other people use it\" sense.",
    "This was highly tilted towards application of econometrics. If you are looking for a more mathematical course, you could take some other econometric course."

   "comments": [
    "gave a good foundation of econometric theory that will be helpful for jobs",
    "Definitely gave me a deeper understanding of the econometric concepts I had been introduced to previously.",
    "I now understand the intuition of econometrics and the math that forms the discipline.",
    "This course gave me insight into some of the more nuanced, intuitive aspects of the field. In the past I sort of just knew how to do the math, but now I feel like I understand the concepts a bit more deeply.",
    "sure",
    "Somewhat deepened my understanding and knowledge. Of actually relevant material that I think I will use in future, I haven't learnt a whole lot beyond what I knew at undergrad, this has been more of a refresher. Anyway, I feel much more confident in the knowledge than i did coming out of undergrad, so hopefully it should stick.",
    "It gave me a more comprehensive understanding of basic Econometrics.",
    "The course highlighted different areas of econometrics that are particularly useful in the field of development economics.",
    "The course conveys essential knowledge of econometric analysis and is helpful in deepening one's understanding of quantitative approaches.",
    "It taught the entire maths for randomised control trials which is very useful to me as I am planning to go into research in similar area."
