   "comments": [
    "I whole-heartedly recommend this course to other students. The course is about the biggest genocides of the twentieth century but as the material proves even in such issues not everything is black or white. The course offers different perspectives on the issues discussed in class.",
    "Great course. I learned a ton, definitely take it if you're interested in the material or just want a solid background of the issues relating to genocide and ethnic conflict. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is cross-listed in a number of majors, so you get a variety of perspectives. However, it is a really depressing subject, so if you can't handle talking about widespread murder each week this may not be the right class for you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was a great class. I learned a lot and was able to pursue many different areas in the field of genocide studies.",
    "The course is a valuable introduction to the study of genocide. It's a politicized field and seems a little fluffy at times, but Dean B does her best to welcome students of all opinions. The discussions were sometimes too free-flowing for my taste, but Dean B's combination of academic studies, memoirs, and documentaries help give you accounts of genocide from a variety of perspectives.",
    "This was a great class. It's a topic that everyone should know about, and while it was really depressing to talk about genocide every week, I felt like I really learned a lot. The readings and discussions were interesting, and the professor is great. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I don't think I'd recommend this class. The readings are usually interesting and the material is inherently fascinating, but class time was consistently wasted watching movies or entertaining guests who contributed extremely little. Discussion, in the rare times it did occur, was usually directionless and never engaged the readings as well as it could have. That said, it's interesting material, Dean B is great, and writing the paper is fun.",
    "Yes, but be warned you will not learn a lot about any one genocide, just kind of have some knowledge of each.",
    "Great introduction to the history of genocide in the world. Final paper at the end of the semester is flexible and you are able to focus on the areas of the course that you feel passionate about. There are also flexible reading responses and there is a fair amount of reading for the class but it is all great and stuff that you will want to read. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.",
    "It's a great class to learn about the issues inherent with genocide and the course of events that came with the genocides of Rwanda, Bosnia-Herzegovia, Cambodia, and the Holocaust. There is a mix of personal narratives and academic readings. The course, however, doesn't realistically deal with how to combat and prevent genocide. I ended up being frustrated with the inefficacy of the prosecution and prevention of genocide. The quality of the seminar really depends on the other students in the class.",
    "In Genocide& Ethnic Conflict you look at case studies such as Cambodia, Rwanda, and the Former Yugoslavia. The readings range from first-hand accounts of the atrocities to academic analysis. Each student has to complete 6 reading responses by the end of the semester, as well as a term paper on whichever subject they choose. There are not enough people with sufficient understanding of the many genocides and ethnic conflicts that have taken and are taking place throughout the world. Anyone who has the slightest interest in the material should take the course and spread the word. It is a great, though emotionally draining, course.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. If you are looking for something easy and know very little about the subject matter then take it, I suppose. If you want a challenging seminar that will change the way you think or open up new ways of thinking for you, then I wouldn't recommend it."
