    "It's not like anything else you've taken--this could either be wonderful or terrible depending on your personality type. I'd say flexibility is key, but it's really not much work, just 3, seven page, very open ended papers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for anyone interested in film and who doesn't mind having a 3 hour seminar.",
    "This is a watch-and-discuss type of class on comedy films. We start with Charlie Chaplin and go through more modern movies, like Woody Allen. It was cool watching these movies, especially the older ones that most people don't have access to. We discuss the films afterwards. For our class, we had to write three papers throughout the semester discussing why a certain movie made us laugh. We had to use some social theory.",
    "Definitely recommend this class. Get to watch the movie during seminar which is great and allows for immediate discussion. Was my favorite of the semester by far. Fun and low stress while also learning a lot.",
    "a survey of early comedy and a look at what makes us laugh - 3 papers the whole time.",
    "If there are interesting people in the class to contribute to discussion, that this class would probably be a dream. However, if there's one or more confrontational dominant rando in the class, then it's awful. Though the course requires little work, the meetings themselves are generally discussion-based, which can be painful if working with a less than stellar group.",
    "You watch a movie every class and then talk about it. First half of the class is Charlie Chaplin. Michael roemer is awesome if not a little depressing. You only have to write three 7-page papers so it's pretty chill.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is interesting and different than most other courses."
