   "comments": [
    "This question makes no sense since this class is required for some and barred to all others.In terms of summary, I would say that History 500 is essentially a crash course in twentieth century styles of historiography in the Anglo-American academy.",
    "History 500 covers a lot of the important historical methods and important historians of the past decades. There's no need to recommend it because (a) a history grad student has to take it and (b) nobody else can.",
    "It's a good introduction to the profession of academic history. I would recommend it.",
    "It's an important course, but sometimes the readings are terribly boring... but since it's obligatory, they'll have no choice but to take it (so go ahead and make the best of it).",
    "I had very low expectations, having had some terrible methods courses at other institutions, but this was everything a methods\/theory course should be. Highly recommended.",
    "A tour of the horizon of different methodological, theoretical, and political approaches to the practice of history. I was thankful that this course was required for my cohort."

   "comments": [
    "This course did not contribute to my research at all, but I don't think it was supposed to. It did, however, cause me to think much more about the discipline of history, which I believe was the point.",
    "I got a better handle on what it is that everyone else in the cohort does and the different methods available out there to do history.",
    "It gave me an introduction to some methods of approaching history which I had not previously thought about.",
    "On the first question, it deepened my knowledge tremendously. That the instructor was not an Americanist was even more helpful. On the second, only time will tell...",
    "Great overview of the larger historiographical trends -- a bird's eye view that I think is very helpful when deciding where to focus on the dissertation. It also provided some excellent models in various fields of how to approach historical questions.",
    "Definitely gave me a better appreciation of the field as a whole and the work that others historians are doing.",
    "The class provided both a grounding in the profession, and helped to unforeclose ways of thinking about or engaging history which will be useful for future pursuits. The final paper was a useful as a way to start grappling with questions of how our areas of interest fit into the greater historiographical landscape."
