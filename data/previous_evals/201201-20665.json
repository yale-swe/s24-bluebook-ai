    "Astro 518 covers topics of (mostly non-collisional) stellar dynamics. It gives mathematical framework for theoretical studies, but focuses on how to use dynamics as a tool for measuring galaxy properties given a range of observations. I recommend the course to other students not only because I think the subject is interesting, but also because the course is well taught."
