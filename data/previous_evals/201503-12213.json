    "Great lecture class on the history of the early British empire and early American history. Very fast paced lectures that make the material very interesting: very different perspective from high school history classes. Professor is super enthusiastic and knowledgeable, can answer any question. Definitely worth taking, one of the best history lectures at Yale, taught by a total leader in his field!",
    "Yes if you are interested in empires at all, will make you more critical of postcolonial nationalism, so very relevant for ppl from many backgrounds. For American students- Will give you a different perspective on American history as well and make you realize how narrow the history we study in K-12 is without an understanding of British imperial politics.",
    "Origins of the British Empire is a really good lecture class, if a little bit repetitive at times. Prof. Pincus has strong opinions on the subject (political economy is bae!), and you get a great overview of a political-economic theory of the British Empire, from the English Civil War to the American Revolution. It's much more heavy on British history itself than the other half of this series (Semmel's post-1776 class), and can get bogged down in the \"cast of characters\" for every event (but none of these obscure people end up on the exams so you don't need to stress about that). The reading can be quite heavy, but it's also not necessary (strictly speaking) to do it all. Take it if you're into imperial history; it's a rather different way of looking at it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a friend given its fascinating material and the time period it focuses on. However, I would not recommend it in its current form - its heavy, heavy reliance on primary sources and its expectation of identification of them in the midterm and final makes it highly unattractive to a student who has three or four other courses who is expecting to take an intro level history lecture and not have to peruse complicated primary sources without having enough secondary sources to give a clear narrative.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I learned a lot from this class -- it was one of the few lectures from which I feel that I have gained A LOT of information about what was happening in a given region politically over a certain period. Professor Pincus is at the forefront of research in this area so any opportunity to study with him is special. Really a great class -- demanding, undoubtedly -- and very doable. Would recommend! One of my better history lectures (especially if you like political history).",
    "Absolutely! Must-take important history class that really explains so much of why the way things are now, by, for example, providing a revisionist (but I think accurate!) view of why America had a revolution etc. Pincus is a star in the field, and this course is really fun.",
    "A chock-full history of the British Empire up until 1776. Pincus is absolutely brilliant and gives lectures that are absolutely packed with information--leaving you amazed by how much you learn in each class. I loved this class, but be prepared to study a lot for the midterm and final due to the amount of material you cover.",
    "Great class- definitely take if you want a relatively difficult class that covers a lot of material on the origins of colonial america and imperial britain. Pincus is excellent",
    "Take it if you are interested in this period of history",
    "The argument the course makes is really interesting, and Pincus is pushing against centuries of British historiography. The material is dense and the paper is too difficult for a lecture course, but I would recommend the class, even if you don't know much about British history.",
    "A thought-provoking course in which every lecture revolves around an interesting, unorthodox argument. It focuses on high politics and economic policy in the early British Empire, so admittedly it's not always extremely thrilling. But I certainly recommend it for history majors and non-history majors alike (though it will be easier to follow if you have some background in British or early colonial history) because it covers an important period and will challenge the way you think about governing in both the past and present.",
    "Great class to learn about the British Empire and dispel some of the tradition notions of the empire.",
    "Definitely recommend this for any Yale student remotely interested in imperial history and how Yale ties into English imperialism.",
    "This is an excellent class for an overview of the British Empire up until 1776. Pincus is an expert in his field and speaks with great enthusiasm about the subject. The course often focuses on the political economy of the British Empire, so if this particularly interests you then you should definitely take it.",
    "An interesting, in-depth look at British history of the 17th-late 18th century imperial history. Very good class if you're interested in Britain or early American history. Also worth it if you're interested in imperialism or colonialism. A break-neck speed of a letter series with great themes and interesting questions. Professor Pincus is great in taking conventional knowledge and reassessing it in context of his scholarship. Lectures are interesting and captivating although Prof. pinches is a bit too quick in covering material at times. Reading are helpful although it would be more helpful to have more information on how to read primary sources and what actually to focus on for class and for exams."
