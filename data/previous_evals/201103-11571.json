   "comments": [
    "Standard, boring intro macroeconomics class... wouldn't take it if it weren't required for the economics major.",
    "Take it because you pretty much have to as a prereq or as a way to try and understand our economy and its problems. But don't expect your mind to be blown.",
    "NoAlthough the subject matter can be interesting and very relevant, Professor Fair is very very dry.Because of his monotone, as well as lectures that move slowly and aren't well designed, it's really hard to pay attention. Literally the only class I've fallen asleep in.The only reason this class was do-able was because the textbook was concise (although written by Fair, and equally monotone and stressless).",
    "Dry but necessary in an educated citizen kind of way. I don't regret taking it, but it definitely wasn't my most stimulating course this semester.",
    "It's a necessary evil. Take it because you have to take it, not because you're looking to develop any sort of long-lasting love of economics.",
    "If you want to major in Econ, take it. Otherwise, only take it if you really, really want to. The lectures are boring. Section is useful though. The work load isn't bad - it's a problem set a week (but I highly recommend you read the book), a midterm, and then a final.",
    "Not particularly difficult. The class follows the textbook very closely (as Professor Fair was one of the authors). The psets didn't take very long (about 1-2 hours max). Also, the midterm followed the practice midterms very closely and had a friendly curve. Overall a class that provides very useful knowledge in understanding the general ins and outs of the economy.",
    "Good introductory course in macroeconomics.",
    "just as an elective on its own I would not recommend but if you want to take other econ courses then get this out of the way early on.",
    "great. very easy and helpful.",
    "This is an incredibly important course for life. For those of you who hated Micro, you will probably prefer Macro. The class itself is not fascinating, but the subject is.",
    "ECON 116 is an overview of macroeconomic principles. The material itself is very interesting and important to understand, so I would recommend the course. However, like many intro economics courses, lectures are not always that interesting, which is a shame because the subject is fascinating and has huge implications.",
    "Typical intro course, take it if you think you'll be interested in econ or if you need it or an so. Not difficult, although the (lack of?) treatment of math is a bit alarming so if you really like math you might feel exasperated. Infinitely more interesting than micro, even with a drier lecturer.",
    "It is a great macroeconomics course. Take it!",
    "I recommend taking this class because it gives you a great systematic understanding of the ,Macroeconomy and all of its parts. Though not the most exciting course, it is solid, informative, interesting, and straightforward. The class doesn't try to trick you--just assess how you can view the interconnected parts of the Macroeconomy. I would say a must take for any major due to its time independent relevance.",
    "This was an interesting and good class. People complain that it can be boring, but it is actually a very straightforward class. If you do the reading and the problem sets, it is not too big of a deal.",
    "If it's for your major.",
    "Study from the problem sets, and memorize the graphs\/models. The lectures are hard to follow since you can't help but fall asleep, so read the book and study from the psets and you should be fine.",
    "Not a bad course. Fair is a solid teacher. His voice is a bit too soothing though...and if you take it in Davies Auditorium, do not be surprised if you fall asleep often. That place is nap heaven.",
    "Its an intro course, therefore expectations will be low anyway. Tis is a very poor course in terms of teaching and content, and unless you are interested in econ or need the credit, do not take this. The only good thing about this course is that it was not very difficult to cram for before the final, but otherwise it is not very enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this course. It was systematically taught and really helped me understand the decisions that our leaders are making about the economy; particularly when it came to the Greek\/Euro crisis and Obama's policy choices.",
    "You learn a lot about how the economy works, which is particularly refreshing if none of your classes at Yale seem to teach you anything particularly relevant with regards to the real world. Lectures are clear and make sense - if you can stay awake. I'd recommend the course if you have a personal interest in learning more about how the world functions economically - it is pretty useful.",
    "Economics is not an exciting subject - so don't expect any classes to be wonderful. Having said that, I definitely think that Prof. Fair is the best professor for Intro Macro. He makes an effort to include current events so that you can better understand\/apply concepts to the real world. Students have complained about his monotonous voice, but he remained engaging nonetheless. Midterm was fine, final was difficult. Read the textbook thoroughly, don't fall behind, pay attention in lectures (particularly to special topics not in the textbook), and you'll be fine.",
    "I really loved this course! Fair turned out to be a great professor. He's really endearing and has a really nice way of explaining economic concepts. The problem sets were completely manageable and the exams were very fair.",
    "It's not a bad intro course but lectures can be extremely dull.",
    "I would recommend this class, both to students that might need it as a prereq and those that just want to learn about the way the world economy works. You actually learn relevant topics in this class.",
    "Despite the often-negative Ray Fair comments, I believe he is wonderful. I am not sure where those comments are grounded. Lecture is not as boring as people make it out to seem. Keep up with the textbook reading and lecture will seem relevant. I would totally recommend that you take this class with Ray Fair. Section is ideal for clarifying lecture, so I would recommend that you go to that as well.",
    "Taught pretty terribly no matter when you take it, I think this is probably the best semester since the textbook is better and you can pretty much get by on the reading alone.Something to tough out early though, as it's a prereq for a lot of things, including just understanding the world. Take it like you would a Tetanus shot.",
    "It is a basic, boring Macro class. You probably have to take it for something. Otherwise, if you are just taking it for \"fun,\" DON'T DO IT!",
    "Great intro econ course. If you're going to take it, TAKE FAIR!!!",
    "Good course for getting a solid foundation in economics but it's hard to pay attention in lecture. Somewhat unstructured and disorganized, but the material you learn is useful. Only take it if you need it for your major",
    "Basic intro class, need to learn on own",
    "This course went much better than microecon for me, partly because I didn't have to suffer under the professorship of Dean Karlan, who was a horrendous teacher. Macro can be very interesting, and though I only studied the day before the final, I think it went okay. I would recommend taking it because it's a good skill set to have, and it's not TOO challenging",
    "Good class, Fair is helpful. Not too much work, gives you helpful framework for understanding current policy debates.",
    "Probably you are taking it because you need to. So, Fair is really not that bad. After taking intro micro with Dean Karlan, I think macro was much more interesting and relevant for my interests. It actually gives you some useful broad knowledge about how economics and economic thinking goes. Psets and exams are fair.",
    "Interesting class that really helps you understand macroeconomics. You will come out of this class understanding the economy and how policy effects it. Lectures can be a little boring, but generally not bad at all. I would recommend this to anyone interested in economics or wanting to understand more about the economy.",
    "It's a decent intro class...take it if you're working towards Econ, PoliSci, EPE, or any other major that needs this as a requirement.",
    "It's a must class if you're moving forward with the economics major. I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone who has no interest in economics, however, I think it is a class that is important for understanding the economy.",
    "It does it what it says: gives you an introduction to macroeconomics and how to think about what's happening in the economy. Ray Fair isn't always the most exciting lecturer but he does a really solid job of explaining the material and even though you don't realize it until the end, you learn a lot over the course of the semester, and the course all builds on itself. The concepts are really cool and minimal math is required.",
    "A good summary of macroeconomics. I would recommend taking it only because I think it's a topic that everyone should have at least a basic understanding of.",
    "A class that you should take just to understand the economy. It might not be the most exciting class, but as a US citizen it should be something you want to understand.",
    "I would only recommend it, if you need to use the class to complete distribution requirements or requirements for your major.",
    "It's ok. Use your TA as a resource when you don't understand things from lecture and stay on top of textbook reading.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you need to take it for your major.",
    "Econ 116 is required, but I would not necessarily recommend it to someone looking for a QR credit because lectures are boring.",
    "It really explains a lot of things going on in the world and it gives you a lot of practicable, applicable skills to explain unemployment, income inequality, etc.",
    "Probably. Lectures are confusing and Professor Fair definitely isn't a great lecturer, but if you keep up with the textbook you'll be fine.",
    "It is useful for understanding the current world economy and develpoing your own opinions on how to fix current world problems.",
    "I think that Macroeconomics was a lot more interesting than Microeconomics, probably because the concepts are more straightforward and easily applicable to real-world situations. The work is manageable and as long as you go to lectures and do the problem sets you should have no problem with the course. I also recommend this class if you don't really have background knowledge in econ, because it's informative, though a bit dry at times.",
    "The lectures of Ray Fair are dull and boring, but luckily I had a good section TF. I went to my section instead of lecture and it wasn't too bad. Unlike a lot of boring professors, Ray Fair actually knows his stuff though. Overall, this was better than Dean Karlan's Intro Micro.",
    "I would take this. Everyone should have a basic understanding of Macro.",
    "Take this class if you want to major in econ or learn more about the economy. I think the things it teaches you about the economy (both national and global) are really important to know, especially now when the topic is widely discussed in the media. It's also good to learn about how banking works. Not the most engaging class, but teaches you very interesting things.",
    "Definitely take it if you want to learn more about the macroeconomy. This course goes above and beyond any other intro to macro class in other colleges, so if you took other macro classes they will not compare to this.",
    "I wish there were a more engaging way to take this class, with a fiery lecturer, but I still think everyone should take this class if they can. The material is so interesting and so relevant right now, that I'm really glad I took it, even if I had to read the book and discuss with friends for most of my information.",
    "This class covers the macroeconomy pretty well, and is not to difficult to grasp. However, some of the material is confusing in its explanation, and I felt sometimes things were explained in an unnecessarily confusing way.",
    "YES TAKE IT. Much more interesting than Intro Micro (which I really didn't like at all)",
    "Take it only if you need it for your major.",
    "Intro macro isn't a bad class, but it also isn't that exciting. You do learn a useful model of how the macroeconomy works, including a model of the open world economy, which is honestly something that everyone should know a little bit about. However, Professor Fair is a monotonous, though kind and knowledgable lecturer who has been teaching this class for years. You may be bored in lecture, but he's clear and precise, and you use his textbook for the class, so there's no conflicting information and everything meshes together well. The weekly problem sets are graded check\/check-minus, which is always helpful, especially since the exams are difficult (though the curve is relatively nice as far as I know). Greg is a great TF if he's available.",
    "Basic intro macro course. Not too hard, if you're the type of person who gets econ.",
    "This is a comprehensive introduction to the macroeconomy, with many many real world examples and applications. This class provides a very useful insight into topics, around which the news is always buzzing (and previous to this class, I did not clearly understand). I would very much recommend this class.While Professor Fair is not the most dynamic, he has great things to say. Keep yourself engaged (and read the text) and this class is very well worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course. Even if you don't plan on being an Econ major or this course is not a part of your requirements, I would suggest that all students take it. It gives a lot of information about the current situation of our economy and I learned things that I believe everyone should have a basic understanding of.",
    "On the whole, take this if:1. You're interested in economics2. You want an easy class that would be easy to skip almost every week3. You like Ray Fair (I don't understand you people)Don't take this if:1. You want to have some initial exposure to econ; take Micro instead!2. You aren't an Econ major and want a QR credit, do micro or a programming classAn easy, boring course on Econ concepts. Try to avoid taking it with Ray Fair; he's really droning and most people (not me, although I kind of regret it now) skipped a lot of classes.Fair is a boring lecturer, who doesn't use anecdotes effectively and talks in a way that makes you want to sleep. The concepts are quite simple but are somewhat interesting. The problem sets are Check\/Check-minus and fairly easy. There is one midterm and one final, both of fair difficulty.You learn:1. What variables go up when other variables go down with respect to variables like Output (GDP), Investment, Consumption, Government Spending, Taxes, Money supply in the IS\/LM AS\/AD theory2. Stuff about unemployment (with respect to variables above) and labour supply3. National currency value and debt issues4. Alternative economic theories",
    "Most people take economics as a required course, so I do not know how much choice is involved. However, I can say the class was quite fair - the problem sets and tests focus on class material, and if you read your book and go to section, you will be fine. Not too much homework, but definitely enough to make you think. I would recommend the class.",
    "Econ 116 was a good basic macro class. It is a very low commitment class and quite easy to understand. I found it quite useful and felt like I learned enough to continue on to higher economics.",
    "Yes. Definitely necessary material for a number of majors.",
    "A good overview of macroeconomic theory, but lectures could be dry at times.",
    "ECON 116 is what you would expect from an intro course on macroecon. I found the material interesting, especially when it came to learning about how the economy functions on a global scale. There were weekly problem sets that were short and not too hard. Grading on the midterm was fair and as long as you study the right things for the midterm and final, you'll be fine. It's one of those classes where many people do not show up. I showed up to every single lecture and while I really like Prof. Fair as a person, it was often very hard to pay attention\/stay awake. However, I think this was mostly a reflection of my own fatigue and not necessarily Prof. Fair. Overall, the course was not to hard, did not involve too much work, and if you can make yourself pay attention in lecture, you'll be fine. Prof. Fair also wrote the textbook, so it complements the course very well and is very clear and helpful.",
    "Macro is not financial theory or markets. The class is interesting in its own way, but you won't be terribly inspired by the lectures. You can learn quite a bit from Fair if you can keep yourself awake and attentive, but chances are, like most people you'll get your understanding of macro from the textbook. Sections are a lot of help. Greg was a pretty good TF.",
    "Provides necessary basic macroeconomic knowledge. Nothing special as far as the professor.",
    "Take it to be conversant in macro or if you're an econ major. Take it credit\/d\/fail if you're not going to need it for your major. EASY class. Way too many A's and B's. Curve is way too kind. Not the weeding out course that Orgo is for pre-meds. Yale Econ needs to break a few more hearts and make the courses a little more difficult - it's churning out way too many econ majors who go off to investment banking and private equity. And I say that as a person with plenty of econ friends that I love as people, but those same friends breezed their way through this and the rest of the major and will be making six figures next year.I'm sure intermediate and upper level econ courses are more rigorous, but the entire progression should be more difficult given the privileged position Yale provides for its numerous econ majors after they graduate.",
    "lectures can actually be pretty important to go to because of very poor notes posted online and questions relating to examples mentioned in class.",
    "Interesting if you are into current events. Having first shopping the seminar first, I would say take the seminar if you want to learn more, take this if you want to have an easier time.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interested in how our economy works. ECON 116 is a quick tutorial on the workings of large economies.",
    "Definitely take the class! It's really fun and provides a great introductory knowledge of macro, its a good foundation especially if considering an econ major.",
    "I enjoyed this course way more than micro. Take it if you want to better understand government policy regarding the economy.",
    "I would recommend Econ 116 because it is a very useful course. Also you don't really need micro for intro macro.",
    "Concise, to the point, useful",
    "Economics 116 01 is an intro microeconomics course. Anyone should be able to complete and understand the course. I would recommend it to anyone because it is important to understand how the government and economy interact with one another. It covers both the closed and open economy. No calculus is used in the course. The exams are fair and the textbook is easy to understand.",
    "Yes! Take Econ 116. Everyone should know this material before they graduate. Also, the book, lectures and the problem sets are very similar so you won\u0092t get confused or stuck. Ray Fair is super smart so makes very interesting observations. He also makes the material relevant by applying it to current events. Don\u0092t miss out on office hours \u0093on the run\u0094!"
