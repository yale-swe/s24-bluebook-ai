   "comments": [
    "Not really a gut. Don't really have to do any of the work but then it comes back to bite you on the midterm and final. No final paper if you attend 10 sections",
    "Good survey course, do not need much prior knowledge",
    "I do reccomend this class to another student. As long as time is budgeted correctly, the workload is very manageable.",
    "Definitely recommended. You learn a lot of information about an important region and time frame (from Alexander to Muhammad - more relevant than you might initially think) and Professor Foster is a delightful and engaging professor.",
    "NELC 101 is a great course for anyone who wish to learn more about Mediterranean history before the rise of Islam. I advise taking it before\/after the other half of this course \"Intro to the Middle East.\"",
    "A history of the period from Alexander the Great to Muhammad. The course also covers the Hellenistic period, the Roman Empire in the Near East, Judaism in the Roman period, the origins and spread of Christianity, magic, monasticism, the Byzantine Empire, and Zoroaster. You learn a tremendous amount about material that is typically not included in the larger narrative of history of the time period which is focused more on Rome and Greece and the Middle Ages. I would definitely recommend this course. Foster is well organized and as long as you keep up with the reading, learn the key terms and start memorizing important dates early--you are good to go. I loved this course.",
    "I definitely recommend this class to anyone who enjoys lectures and different perspectives towards history."
