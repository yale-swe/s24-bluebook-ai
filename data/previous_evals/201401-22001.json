    "Yes, if you need an easy social science or psych requirement, this would be the course to take. Just do the readings and attend lecture, or take this Credit\/D\/Fail if you intend on doing minimal work.",
    "Only 3 multiple choice\/short answer test. Not hard if you've taken other psych classes and do the reading and go to class. No section.",
    "Good CR\/D class.",
    "150 is a course that I feel is extremely applicable to everyone's lives. The course material is extremely interesting (though sometimes intuitive), and John Bargh is an extremely intelligent lecturer. The course essentially picks up where intro psych leaves off, going into detail about many of the parts of psychology that were glossed over in the intro class. Still, it is a survey class and because of that topics are ever changing and various enough to not be too boring. Professor Bargh is known for his stationary lecture style, where he stands at his podium, sipping his pepsi and going over the slides. This seems to bother some others, but I don't particularly care, as the content of the lectures is extremely good. The powerpoints he uses are a bit old, as he just updates them when new information is coming in. However, due to the fact that he has worked in the field for such a long time, he is able to add tons of insight to the information being presented on the slides. The work is pretty minimal, with just 3 non-cumulative midterms (about 60 MC questions 5 short answers) that are graded pretty fairly. The curves are pretty minimal though, since much of the class gets above 90% on the tests. If you're a psych major looking for a List A core, I highly suggest this course. If you're looking for an interesting psych class just for fun, I recommend this course as well. If you want to credit\/D the course and not do the readings, just listening to the lectures for fun, that's probably fine too.",
    "Very easy class to take Cr\/D. Not so easy for a grade - it's easy to do pretty well in the class, but many of the exam questions are ambiguous and not well-worded. I would have been more stressed out if I took it for a grade, but it was zero stress credit\/d.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in social psychology, but not if you've already taken a lot of other psychology courses. You'll end up treating it like a gut, but then when the midterms come around, you'll realize that it's not a gut (and it isn't a gut for no particular reason). Lectures are kind of boring, but if you skip too much, you'll pay for it. Take it Cr\/D if you do decide to take it.",
    "Great class. Doing the assigned readings before class really helps you focus during the lecture.",
    "It's a great class with a great lecturer. The workload is also good enough to handle. Highly recommended.",
    "I would recommend taking it as long as the class became slightly more organized.",
    "If you like psychology, take this class. It may not be the most interesting lecture class, but the subject matter is fascinating.",
    "Only take it Cr\/D- it's hard to do well.",
    "Interesting material, disorganized. Take it if you're into it.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The exams were hard and the classes were boring.",
    "This is a good class to take Cr\/D or as a 5th class, since there are only 3 tests, all of the format 60 multiple choice and 4 or 5 short answer. However, you HAVE to read the book because sometimes the questions are uber-specific. Professor Bargh isn't the best lecturer, but the material is interesting and you will learn a lot. I have changed in how I view not only myself but my relationships and interactions of others. It definitely makes you more cognizant. I would recommend taking this class, just make sure to attend lectures, read the book, and you should be fine once you study.",
    "Yes. Not particularly THRILLING but a decent psych class and a good balance to a heavy schedule.",
    "Social psychology is a good class to take for a social science credit, because it doesn't require much beyond attending lecture and studying a bit for the three tests in the semester. John Bargh is a great lecturer, so studying is mostly just brushing up on key terms.",
    "Don\u2019t take it; there are way better intro level psych courses, which might ACTUALLY teach you something",
    "really easy credit\/d: 3 non-cumulative exams (mainly multiple choice), no paper, no section. but man, bargh is quite a bad lecturer. test curves are also brutal, so beware if taking for letter grade.",
    "Definitely.",
    "This is a very good course for those looking for a psych lecture. I did not take intro psych, which did not negatively impact me in this course. The textbook was very useful, and definitely tested on the exams. THe averages on the exams tended to be high, but the exams were not terribly difficult. I would definitely take this course again.",
    "If you are interested in psychology I think that this is a really cool class to take but you definitely have to put in the effort to do the readings and try to follow along in lecture.",
    "A good class, especially if you're going to be a psych major.",
    "Definitely skip this one. Surprisingly difficult, more than it should be. Professor doesn't care about the course at all and it shows.",
    "Psych 150 is a good but not always exciting lecture course for people interesting in looking a little deeper into a particular field of psychology. Having three exams (no papers or reading responses) determine your grade seemed fine at first, but if you're one of those people who doesn't do well on big psych exams just be aware that you probably won't get the grade you were hoping for. Take it if the material interests you, but if you're looking for a social science gut, look elsewhere.",
    "Only take it if you need it. Otherwise, steer clear.",
    "take it! it's fun and relatively easy while still being interesting. the professor is great so make sure to read his studies and go to class. it's pretty chill and you'll always learn something you want to tell whoever you're having dinner with that night.",
    "Ideal 5th class about the basics of social psychology. Take it if you are interested in learning material that's intuitive, but applicable to the real world. Be sure to do the readings and listen in lecture because there's little overlap between the two.",
    "No",
    "I would recommend PSYC 150 to students who are looking for a broad overview of social psychology and its implications",
    "I would recommend this class-the material is applicable to everyone, especially when thinking about various relationships we have with people.",
    "I wold recommend this class as it changes the way you think about your actions and others' actions in the world. Knowing more about the sources at play in social interactions is always better.",
    "I really liked the material. If you're a psych major, take it. As it fulfills one of the main course requirements. If you're looking for an easy social science class and you aren't a psych major, don't bother.",
    "Good class if you don't want to do a lot of work, good Cr\/D class.",
    "Social Psych is a straight forward psych class. Similar to Intro Psych, there were 3 non-cumulative exams. I thought the information was interesting and particularly enjoyed learning about the different studies.",
    "A student considering this class should read the syllabus. This course is exactly as it appears, a series of powerpoint based lectures and sophomoric readings out of a low-level textbook designed to minimize work for both Bargh and students. I took this as a fifth class distribution credit, and in this capacity this course served admirably. It took up very little time, and I did indeed learn some social psychology. A more dedicated student may find the lack of good readings disappointing, or the multiple choice (likely negatively curved) tests an annoying and probably invalid way to determine grades. But Bargh, despite a slow lecture style, said interesting things and made some nontrivial observations.",
    "Great credit D class. I went to lecture and studied the night before. Lectures were pretty enjoyable, especially at the beginning. The professor is extremely knowledgeable on social psych and is one of the main researchers in the field, so it's cool to hear his point of view.",
    "Overall, I think this is a good course. However, be prepared for your notes to be a bit disorganized as the lecture slides were.",
    "This is a fairly staightforward, vanilla psych class. A bit of overlap with intro psych, although you will learn new things as well. Just three, equally weighted tests, and weekly textbook chapters (with no reading responses), so not too bad. Class is straight lecture, and Professor Bargh doesn't even stop for questions, but you will learn a fair amount, especially if you haven't taken many other psych classes.",
    "do not take this class. there are lots of other psych classes that are more interesting and that are taught by better professors. lecture is very poorly organized and incredibly boring. tests are VERY nitpicky. if you insist on taking the class, start cr\/d if you can and see how you do on the first one. but even aside from the difficulty of the tests, this was a pretty terrible class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it unless you need the credit for a psych major. Even then it was difficult to get a good grade on the midterms, and there weren't many options to meet with TAs",
    "Interesting material, but there is a lot of overlap with Intro Psych.",
    "Take if you need a credit for psych. Not bad at all just boring.",
    "This was a good class- fairly easy material that is applicable to daily life and interesting to know about. Lecture could be a but dry at times, but was usually interesting enough. A lot of the course was covered in Intro Psych and really just builds on that.",
    "This is a fairly average Psych class. The lectures are decent, but tend to involve a lot of rambling about psych studies that don't seem relevant to the current topic. There is not much work at all (3 tests based on lecture and textbook). This being said, be sure to do the textbook readings- the exams tend to be split evenly between lecture and textbook and often contain questions on minor details from both.",
    "PSYC150 is a survey course of all relevant subfields in the big overarching field of Social Psychology. You will cover emotion, prejudice, reasoning, and affection, all in one semester. The course is split into three trimester periods with three midterm-style tests; no finals, papers, or sections. But the class is much harder than you think, and mostly for stupid reasons. Bargh's lecture style is mind-numbingly disorganized and boring, and his tests are designed to trick you. Don't expect to get a great grade unless you put a TON of work into it. Take unless social psychology course over this one, if you can.",
    "This class has great subject matter - interesting (if pretty intuitive). The lectures feel long though; I ended up enjoying the textbook more than class.",
    "Yes, easy way to fulfill a core psych requirement. Interesting material and very straightforward assessment. Three non cumulative finals -most questions were test bank generated so do the reading and you are fine",
    "This is a great class for people of all backgrounds. It presents an interesting and diverse array of topics related to social psychology and its relevance to myriad human interactions both on the individual and group level. While the course is not conceptually difficult, there are a pretty high number of vocab words, concepts and studies presented in each lecture. It is also necessary to do all the readings in order to get all the points on the exams. Without doing the readings, it is probably possible to get an A- or B+.",
    "It is a lot of work in spurts (aka three tests that determine your grade). I would recommend it if you are a good test-taker and also a fast note-taker. If you are dependent on your teacher or TA, I would not take the course because they are not that readily available. The material almost trumps all of these things, though, because it is so interesting. Similarly, the fact that Professor Bargh has done a fifth of the studies we look at is pretty cool.",
    "Social psychology is a good overview of many psychological concepts that form the foundation for most other psychology classes you might take. The class is very straightforward: three exams, each a third of your grade. The exams come from both lecture and textbook material. This is a very manageable 5th class or good introductory psychology course.",
    "Yes, less overall work with peaks of work before each of the tests. Tests are hard though",
    "1 This class is laughably stupid, and it left me wondering how social psychology can continue to exist as a legitimate academic field. If you are a normal person--that can think and talk--then you already have an in depth knowledge of 85% of everything that will be told to you in lecture. If you have a firm mastery of first order logic (ie \u201cIf all pencils are red, then what color is my pencil?\u201d) then in my estimation you are intellectually capable of taking or teaching this course. Bargh\u2019s lectures slides were collages of random, useless facts. Lecture topics like \u201cThe Self and Other\u201d and \u201cThe Unconscious\u201d were so poorly defined that there would be a ton of cross over from topic. The same slide would often be presented in 3 or 4 different lectures, and would be presented as though it was brand new every single time. It was actually comical. Here examples of some typical facts that would each receive 3 to 4 slides of explanation during a lecture: 1. You are more likely to become friends with your roommate than someone who lives faraway. 2. You like attractive people more than ugly people 3. If you are extremely hungry or thirsty, this could influence your mood. If you think you would enjoy spending 75 minutes twice a week learning facts such as these, this class is great for you. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t care about wasting your time on 4th grade-level material in exchange for an easy A, this class would also be good for you. In terms of demographics, the students who take social psych are much less intelligent and much less motivated than students you would encounter in a normal science class. This is the proverbial \u201cbottom of the barrel\u201d. If you are a student used to taking real classes and you have also heard of flash cards, you are guaranteed an A.",
    "Worst class I've ever taken. Don't do this to yourself.",
    "Take this class if you can sit through a relatively boring hour and fifteen minute lecture and if you've done well in other psych classes. There is a ton of overlap from other psych classes you may have taken, including Intro Psych, so it got boring and repetitive at times. I took it only because I needed a class that didn't have a section and it was worth it. If you read the textbook, go to lecture, and study for the tests, you'll be fine. The three tests are all the same format and they make up your entire grade. They aren't extremely hard but you do have to know the information. Prof. Bargh has a very laid back lecture style, and his slides sometimes get confusing and don't make sense. It was an okay class, but only take it if you're interested and willing to put in at least a little time to do well.",
    "Yes. You definitely learn new materials in this class although some materials are the same as that taught in introduction to psychology",
    "Social psychology is an overall interesting class. The material is pretty cool, although sometimes repetitive.",
    "This class is a good introductory class and a good fifth class. It does require a lot of memorization but it only has three midterms so the workload is manageable. I learned a lot about interpersonal relationships and social behavior but recognized that a lot of material had already been covered in PSYC 110.",
    "This course provided a solid overview of social psychology. Enough material was covered to give a good sense of the (quite extensive) field of social psychology; but unlike Intro Psych, which I found overwhelmingly broad, this course felt manageable, and focused enough to feel like I will retain much of what I learned. The grade is based solely on three exams, which is a little intimidating, but the exams were very fair, and you could do well on them if you reviewed the textbook readings and lectures.",
    "Yes. The class is organized and enjoyable",
    "No, unless you have an irrational love of monotone. A friend once described JBargh's lectures as \"similar to the experience of eating dirt.\" Tests were also random AF.",
    "Not really...there are more interesting courses with better organization.",
    "PSYC 150 is a great course if you enjoy dry and boring lectures, unfair and confusing tests, and an extremely difficult curve. There are very few redeeming factors about this course, and I would not recommend it.",
    "Easiest class I've taken at Yale. Fascinating subject matter, presented adequately by Bargh. You will reference things you learned in this class for the rest of your life.",
    "I would recommend it for easy psych credit and some interesting material. Overall it gets a meh",
    "Covers a lot of material, interesting subject. Not demanding at alll, although tests were challenging",
    "I would recommend it only if you are interested in social psychology or do not want a class that is too intensive. It's fairly simple and not that interesting, however I think it varies a lot from person to person",
    "Terrible course. No interesting structure, and no sense of engagement or interest in students from the professor. He just droned on because he had to.",
    "I would recommend EXTREMELY strongly against this course. A lot of psychology gets a bad reputation for being suspect. You will find all of this type of psychology in this course. Without being too personally insulting, a good start for your consideration of this course would simply be to google Professor Bargh and see the recent scrutiny of the field which he essentially founded. Further undermining the legitimacy of the course was the textbook used. One example from the textbook, updated last year, described a Malcolm Gladwell \"finding\" which had since been disproven. If you want to read opinions from people (with no credibility in the field) like Gladwell you are free to do so, but one basic expectation of a college course is that we should be taught credible opinions. This might seem overly harsh for one element of the book, but I assure you there were multiple other disputed fields (including Professor Bargh's) presented in the book as established fact. I'm not a Social Psychology expert, so the fact that I found multiple misleading elements just based on my other study at Yale really concerned me about the support for topics of the book I was less familiar with. If you have any experience with psychology or cognitive science, I would warn you that you may be frustrated by the type of teaching that occurs in this class. And if you're not a major, I would strongly recommend against this course, which from an academic standpoint, at least from my limited experience, is the worst the Yale Psychology department has to offer.",
    "A pretty boring, disorganized lecture on what ought to be a really interesting topic. Do not take it if you just want to learn about social psych for a fun class. Only take it if you really need to take it for your major. The lectures are really disorganized, the professor speaks very quickly and incomprehensibly, the exams way over-emphasize reading from the textbook. Really, there was a lot of bad pedagogy. Lecture should be structured in a way that has given thought to how to break down and organize material for students to learn it. The lectures were totally stream of consciousness and were not on distinct enough topics. Everything melded together, since Bargh made connections all of the time. These connections might have been helpful in a connections-based lecture. But for learning a new topic, you really just need to learn it and get that concept in the head. If you don't understand something yet, it's really confusing to have your professor start rattling about some tangential topic. This class needs to stop being taught by Bargh. He may be a big player in the field, but he really just does not cut it as a professor. I thought he'd be a reason TO take this class; really he's a reason NOT to. Brilliant psychologist (although frankly some of his work has been questioned--he was upfront about this occasionally). Not an easy professor to follow.",
    "PSYC 150 is a good class for people interested in how and why people interact with each other, as well as how emotions and attitudes affect our every day lives and behavior. I would recommend it to someone interested in Social Psych, but not to someone who isn't. I think the material could be dull for people who just want to try it, and that Intro Psych would be a better class for those people to take.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's not a huge workload and it's really interesting",
    "Content is interesting and 3 non-cumulative exams make up your grade. I'd recommend it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it; however, I would tell them that the material can be repetitive and dry and a lot of students didn't pay much attention, which created a kind of poor atmosphere.",
    "Dull, uninformative, poorly taught",
    "If you're looking for an interesting class with very little work, this would be a good pick. Your grade is composed wholly of 3 non-cumulative tests. Lecture gets a bit boring at times, but the content is interesting and the textbook is a pretty easy read. Not a total gut because the tests are actually a little challenging, but as long as you go to lecture, do the readings, and study beforehand, you'll be fine. Would definitely recommend to psychology majors and others who are interested in social psychology.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is a great survey psych course for anyone with an interest in social problems and how people interact.",
    "Not the best class. Wouldn't recommend taking unless you're a psych major. Lectures are dry. Tests are deceptively hard. Don't take unless you plan on doing the reading. Only good part is no section.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Three exams, no final, no paper. Professor Bargh's lectures were interesting but if you read you don't have to go to all of them. It was a great credit\/D class.",
    "You think this class is going to be super easy, because when you sit through lecture, it's like, duh, duh, obviously. And then you take the tests and you're like where the heck did those questions come from. And then you get your test back with mediocre grade, and most of your points were lost in the free response section, but your TA declined to put any comments there.",
    "Regardless of how interested you are in social psychology, prepared to be bored in lecture. It is difficult to follow many of the slides (reading the textbook beforehand may be helpful), and I found myself wanting to fall asleep in many of the lectures. There is a huge overlap with Intro Psychology, and the curriculum itself is repetitive.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "It is an overview of social psychology and the ways it can be applied to life. It was very interesting, a very good credit d class because there were only 3 tests and no other assignments!",
    "Pretty standard class with a good summary of the research in social psychology. Lectures were informative, but Professor Bargh is a bit dry. Exams aren't too hard but they can be tricky sometimes; definitely do the readings for the course, as well as study the lecture slides. If you're not a psych major, I'm not sure if I would recommend this class, but if you're interested in going further with psychology, I'd consider taking it; it's decent and a good course for the major.",
    "Would recommend as a relatively chill psych class. That being said the exams are kind of tricky due to the multiple choice format. Also the lectures are not the most engaging.",
    "A very solid psychology course. Professor was very good lecturer. Textbook was good. Exams were fair. Material was interesting. Great 5th class as there are only three non-cumulative exams and no homework or papers. Therefore, the curve is said to be a little more harsh than a typical Yale curve. Some people say the material can get repetitive, but really enjoyed the material and the course overall. I am very glad I took this course and I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend for all students, not just those majored in psychology.",
    "Pretty chill class although tests harder than you might expect. His lectures are interesting sometimes but always very jumbled, not sure when he is changing topics and his slides don't have a cohesive theme (annoying). Also we got really off track and had to skip some lectures. Overall, interesting but for most psych majors will be total repeat of other classes.",
    "It was interesting and boring at the same time. The material that we covered was fascinating, but the lectures were all the same and frustrating to follow at times because Bargh likes to skip through slides\/go back and forth between slides. Take it for the social science credit, since the only work is reading and 3 tests. But beware: the tests are harder than they will seem.",
    "It was an OK cass. Not too challenging. A good class to take for psych majors.",
    "Only if you've never taken a psych class before, or if your'e looking of something semi-pretty relaxing.",
    "Unless you have to, I wouldn't really recommend it. You don't learn much more new information from intro psych, and the exams are unnecessarily difficult.",
    "Should have bought the textbook and taught myself the material. Bargh is a mildly boring lecturer who repeats himself a lot and is fixated on his pet topics. That said, the content is, although commonsensical, pretty interesting and I definitely feel like I now pay more attention to the way people around me behave, noticing things that were always so obvious that I never felt the need to describe them psychologically. You should still take this class because there are no drawbacks to taking it, well unless you're one of those Yalies who can't accept anything less than an A grade. Exams are easy if you are fine with getting a B. Require large amounts of memorization if you want an A.",
    "If you plan on interacting with people in the future, you should definitely take this course. Actually, even if you don't, but are interested in the interactions of people, you should take it. Really interesting material and easy tests. No final.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! Even if you are not a psychology major, I would recommend the class because the material is interesting and applicable to everyday life. Dr. Bargh does a good job of presenting the material in a way that is accessible to students will little to no background in social psychology.",
    "Social Psychology is a decent course, but if you want an overview of psychology, I would suggest another into psychology course. John Bargh is interesting in that he helped to found the field of social psychology, but the lectures are a bit dry and scattered, and the research that he cites is repetitive.",
    "I came into the class with higher expectations. I was disappointed that the class mainly focused on experiments and experimenters rather than the social implications and application drawn from research.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS CREDIT\/D! The tests are poorly written and lectures are disorganized and random.",
    "The first lecture (where he read the syllabus aloud) was a low point in the course, so don't judge him based on that atrocity. Over the semester, however, I would say the course is characterized by peaks and nadirs of really interesting content punctuated by bouts of painful boredom. The exams aren't as difficult as the varsity athletes would have you believe, but they are marginally harder than the exams in intro psych. The TFs don't do ANYTHING to help, so you really need to be the kind of self-motivated reviewer if you want to get anything out of this. Overall, I enjoyed the course, but I think I'm in a minority. Shop it as long as possible and make your decision based on what you see. Overall: Meh.",
    "It's worth taking. This course gives a very broad overview of the influences of social\/environment conditions on behavior. The lectures move very quickly and can feel disjointed, but have many interesting tidbits. Also, its workload is very light--just 3 midterms, no final.",
    "Three midterms, no other work. Lecture can be boring, but the textbook is great. I definitely do not regret taking this class. I learned a lot, and since it's social psychology, I see the material in everyday life. Take it if you need to, but if you're only going to take one psych class, this isn't the best one Yale has to offer. Good Cr\/D option or fifth class, though.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student -even those not majoring in psych related fields. How people behave socially and the psychology behind it is just a topic that should be generally interesting to all humans. The only real work other than attending class and taking notes is reading the textbook, which is actually very well written and humorous at times.",
    "If you are interested in the psychology major, then you should take the course. If not, I don't think I would recommend it. I found myself skipping lecture often because I could get most of the material from the book. It's a pretty easy class, but if you don't need the credit and are not too interested in the subject, it will get boring.",
    "While the material of Social Psychology is interesting, the class itself was not enjoyable. Professor Bargh is a very weak lecturer and his lectures seemed disorganized\/all over the place. The slides were unclear and he often jumped right in without really presenting the topic for the day. The textbook was actually quite strong and was both engaging and interesting. I would recommend this class to a psychology major to fill the requirements; the material is fairly interesting, and required little effort besides reading the textbook. I would not recommend this class to a student that is interested in taking a psychology course because there are definitely better ones to take.",
    "This class was a bit of a letdown after a year and a half of psych at Yale, if only because I've taken so many psych classes before that this class felt repetitive. It did go more in-depth than previous classes and expanded on previous material, but overall I felt that my time would have been better spent elsewhere. With that in mind, the coursework was light but the test material was unpredictable. It feels harsh to say I do not recommend this course, because it's a good social psych class, but I certainly feel disappointed.",
    "Class that is interesting and makes you think about your own life. It is highly repetitive and deceivingly difficult. Lecture makes everything seem extremely self-explanatory but the tests are unfairly hard.",
    "Oh honey. I know you're thinking you'll be better than these course reviewers. That you'll enjoy the lecture and attend every one and take notes and read the textbook ahead of time and you'll know all the answers to the exam questions. You might. You could be one of the intense people who makes flashcards. OR you could be one of the people who wants to live life and not deal with arbitrary and random questions. If you even think you could be the latter, don't take this course. It's not worth it. I thought it would be, but it was easily one of the worst classes I took at Yale, and definitely the worst one I took in the major. The material is interesting: sit in on the lectures if you'd like. But don't enroll because you will be miserable. I'm not the only one who felt this way. This course if by no means hell, but it is a drag. I wouldn't mind difficult tests if the lectures were at least fun, but they're not. You have a limited number of credits: explore other interests."
