    "MATH 120 is a challenging math course, but I would recommend it to other students. I think it is well taught and useful, especially for physics or math majors. I would say the most important thing about MATH 120 is allowing yourself to swap between sections. There are many teachers and it truly helps to try to switch sections if your original teacher doesn't seem to fit your learning style. A good teacher will make all the difference in this course.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone. The final was a bloodbath and the averages on everything else are extremely high, which means you have ti be perfect to do well.",
    "Go to office hours and do the practice problems and the class is very doable. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.",
    "It is a practical introduction to multivariable calculus. I would recommend it if you want to pursue a STEM field, but be prepared to have kids who know everything beforehand in your class...",
    "yes but only if its required",
    "If you have to take it, do it. If possible take the engineering version, which has a smaller section and therefore a better curve.",
    "Definitely recommend my section for Math 120. If you feel confident in Math, take this course, if you were shaky during BC calc or equivalent, this will be a challenging course.",
    "Math 120 is a difficult calculus class that is very straightforward. I would only recommend it to physics majors as it does not seem to have many other applications.",
    "I would recommend this class to a fellow student as it's important to follow the natural sequence of Calculus. The class also opens up several further courses. But be prepared to put in a lot of work, especially near mid-terms to be able to score well on a tightly curved exams.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Math 120 to another student. It's not easy, but you learn a lot, and if you have a genuine fondness of math then it should be a good overall experience.",
    "Math 120 is one of those classes that fulfills your need if you needed to have taken it but otherwise is bit of a burden. If you need multivariable calculus in your future studies it will give you a solid base. If you're just taking it for fun and general knowledge of math it gets too technical at times. Take it if you need it. I wouldn't particularly recommend it if you're just looking for general advancement of your math skills. The ratio between effort required and fulfillment is questionable."
