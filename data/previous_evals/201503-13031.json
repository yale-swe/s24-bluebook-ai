   "comments": [
    "I required statistics class, which provides a lot of practical skills to new graduate students, although some may find the class more useful than others.",
    "I would tell another student that Psyc 518 is very interactive and engaging, though it can be slightly tedious. The tedious assignments, however, underline key concepts in a way that will make them stick with you for the rest of your research career!",
    "If department requirements were not a factor, I would recommend that another student start with a more advanced stats course. However, this is not an option with current requirements, so I would recommend that they take this course so that they can graduate.",
    "Very good use of statistics for most human-based work in any field of science. Yes, I would recommend.",
    "It was very easy but a lot of work. Too much time spent on homework.",
    "The most useful class. An absolute must if you are doing research!",
    "I would say that if it's useful to have a thorough knowledge of anova this is a great class. Otherwise not so much.",
    "It's an introductory-level statistics course that reviews the fundamentals and spends most of the semester on ANOVA tests. I would recommend it for students who have not taken a stats class and whose research will use this type of study design frequently.",
    "I would recomment PSYC 518 to a fellow student interested in learning basic statistical methods in social psychology. I would NOT recommend it to students interested in stats for neuroscience \/ cognitive neuroscience programs.",
    "I would highly recommend the class for students who want to know how to appropriately report human subjects data (statistics) in papers for publishing.",
    "I would summarize it as a helpful course for introduction to statistical techniques, and I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend the course for a psych student who needs a refresher on introductory statistics.",
    "I would say that the class was rather introductory, but I liked that we started basic and built upon that material. The class itself was awesome and helpful. However, I would not say that the class covered all the material necessary to be a successful graduate student. In other words, students should plan to teach themselves further material or plan on taking additional courses.",
    "I will definitely recommend it to fellow students.",
    "Starting from complete basics, the course was a broad overview of the majority of the sorts of statistics that one would need to know how to do while conducting psychological research. I would recommend it as a starting point, but not if a student's statistical skills were already sufficiently advanced."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It allowed me to practice scientific writing which was useful, but the analyses and style of writing was not always directly applicable to work I would be doing.",
    "Jack presented all statistical texts in the context of what reviewers will be looking for when we complete them on our own. To this extent, Jack's course will be helpful to my dissertation\/research.",
    "It was helpful to learn more stats; stats are needed for research professions and for my dissertation.",
    "Indirectly.",
    "This class was very elementary and too much busy work. Mostly a waste of time.",
    "Essential course. Absolutely needed it.",
    "This did not teach me about the types of analyses I will use with my data.",
    "It's always good to review the basics, but I think students should be offered an opportunity to take a placement exam and depending on performance should be allowed to take a more advanced or better suited stats course.",
    "While this course helped deepen my knowledge of basic statistics, I do not think I will run these analyses in my dissertation research.",
    "This course gave me the skills to report my human subjects data appropriately and have confidence in being able to choose the appropriate statistical test for whatever situation I may face.",
    "It helped me run initial analyses for a research project, and get helpful feedback.",
    "The course helped me practice using statistical analyses, some of which I will use in future research.",
    "I think the final paper was extremely helpful in jumpstarted my efforts in writing a paper.",
    "My lab work require pretty much data analysis, so it is helpful.",
    "Much of the material I was already familiar with, especially the material covered in the earlier months of the course. It was nice to have the practice though, and these are very important skills to develop for a psych grad student."
