    "Discussion of various histories and controversies surrounding civic education in the United States.",
    "Comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of civic education.",
    "I began to appreciate that civic education is not straightforward in theory or in practice. It isn't the type of class where you come out with tangible knowledge or facts, but it definitely motivated me to crystallize my thoughts and ideas on education.",
    "I learned a lot about what debates over civic education reveal about our understanding of democracy, politics, and citizenship.",
    "This course pushed me to consider what it means to be a citizen and what it means to learn out to be a citizen. Some of the most important insights I gained were about my own civic education -- we reflected a lot about who and what has shaped us.",
    "We learned about the purpose and value of civic education, as well as the modern debates surrounding it. We also discussed student government, patriotism, alternative schools, and citizenship.",
    "We learned anything and everything that is civics education. Also, we touched on politics and political behavior. The course truly stood at the intersection of education studies and political science."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Wonderful survey of the literature on this topic.",
    "Strengths - interesting readings. covered different material every class. good discussion Weaknesses - variation in amount of reading each weak was large (some weeks not much, some a lot)",
    "Strengths: Professor Fairdosi is a fun and engaging seminar leader. He does a good job of making the class approachable but still incisive. Weaknesses: The 'theory' readings were more outdated opinions than they were philosophical. They also were not super-well integrated into the discussions on practice. I think the class would've benefitted from more, philosophical theory on the purpose of education (Barber, Dewey, Freire, Benjamin Rush, etc..)",
    "Strengths: Great community of students, a manageable workload, interesting topics, natural presentation structure, field trip, Amir's magic tricks! :) Weaknesses: None that I can think of! Personally, I probably would have preferred to do more of the later topics suggested for the syllabus and remove a week or two of the earlier theory, but I understand that the pedagogical foundation was necessary for us to get there",
    "Strengths -- the readings fueled the discussion, but I liked how much freedom we had in the discussion. If something was particularly interesting, Amir would allow us to run with it. Weaknesses -- could have more visual aid.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material, captivating discussions, manageable workload Weaknesses: Somewhat disorganized",
    "Strengths: Professor Fairdosi is so sweet and approachable. Class discussion was very active, lively, fun, and professor Fairdosi does a great job facilitating that. I usually dislike theory, but the theoretical\/historical\/rhetorical readings were very thought-provoking and interesting to read. The field trip was really neat. Weaknesses: I thought the course lacked a critical perspective when approaching the relationship between education and democracy. I would have liked to spend more time on how race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexuality, etc. affect this relationship, as well as how this relationship treats these socially marginalized groups.",
    "One strength is that the professor allowed the students to lead about half of the class, and he would lead the other half. We reached a good balance. In addition, the syllabus was truly living and breathing; students were allowed to vote on what to learn (very meta of a civics class). The professor also gives lengthy feedback beyond what is required, which is good. The field trip was amazing. No weaknesses."

   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "Yes! Professor Fairdosi is passionate and incredibly smart. The class was entirely discussion-based, and it was a lot of fun. Good balance between talking about readings and about personal experience.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in civic education. If not, you will not gain much from the class because there is a lot of listening to your classmates tell stories (not in a bad way, but if you don't have questions you want answered then you won't get much out of these discussions).",
    "I think a big strength of this semester's class was the people in it, which is always a gamble with seminars. However, this class was a lot of fun, and I really enjoyed my experience! Speaking from my perspective (as well as that of the other students I talked to), we all loved Amir and would gladly take more classes with him in the future.",
    "Absolutely! If you are at all interested in citizenship and how we learn about democracy, you should take this course. Also, Amir rocks.",
    "This is a really great class that surveys civic education from a theoretical and a practical lens. Professor Fairdosi creates a really easy-going, intellectually open classroom environment. I loved learning about the subject matter, forming my own opinions, and hearing those of my classmates.",
    "Yes. This is a great seminar for political science majors and anyone who is interested in education. It allows you to learn a lot of information without drowning in assignments. Make sure you do the readings.",
    "Yes! This course is one of few at Yale that sits squarely at the intersection between political science and education studies.",
    "Yes. We learned very broadly, which I enjoyed. We left with more questions when we started the class, which while frustrating, is how an education here ought to be."
