    "This course's strengths lie on the instructor's energy and passion to help the students. It's an L1 class so you can't expect a life changing experience, but where this class excelled was in allowing us the opportunity to get a great introduction from a professor passionate in teaching.",
    "This course was excellent. We were able to interact and speak with each other often, and the workload was manageable and relevant to class discussions. Weekly quizzes were a good way to keep us accountable for the course material. This class could finish more promptly, especially if students have other classes immediately afterwards.",
    "The course was overall amazing, but could have benefited from slowing down a little at then end--the pace picked up and became very fast. I definitely learned a lot more in the time given compared to other language classes that I have taken.",
    "Really good professor, very comprehensive"

    "I would recommend this course to another student. It was easy for me but I already had some background in modern Greek. The class was very small - which isn't true of a lot of L1 language classes - and that was very helpful for learning to speak the language.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a fascinating language taught, albeit relatively unpopular language. You will be amazed at how much Greek you learn by the end of the semester. If you wish to learn Greek this is a well taught course.",
    "Maria is incredible! Would highly recommend taking Greek if you're looking to learn a beautiful, interesting language.",
    "Yes; I learned a lot and enjoyed coming to this class every day.",
    "10\/10 would recommend taking Modern Greek. I'm having a much better language course experience than everyone else I know at Yale. Maria is an amazing professor and even if you can't take this class, you should check out one of her other courses.",
    "Yes. Very personal which helps alot with learning the language"
