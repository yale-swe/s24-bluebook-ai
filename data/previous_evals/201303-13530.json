    "This was a fascinating class and I learned a lot. Ann is a good lecturer and I think she explains things pretty clearly.However, there was a lot of really dense reading that was difficult to get through with no formal background in forestry. I think a separate discussion section with Marlyse per week would be very helpful.Also, the field trips were somewhat well organized, but in a few cases I think we could have accomplished the same thing in East Rock park. A lot of driving for only, in some cases, 1-2 hours of forest time. I think more thought could be put into the logistics.Also, I think having an assignment, a presentation, field trips AND an in class mid-term and final is a bit much for a 3-credit course. Perhaps cut out one of these. Maybe the presentation. Most of the presentations weren't that well done (from students) and we spent 3 weeks on them...",
    "I loved this course. Partly because I loved the material and partly because I thought Professor Camp did a great job teaching it. There were a few things that I think could be improved, though. First, I didn't think the assignments were particularly useful for understanding the course material. They seemed to be more a means to generate grades for the students than to supplement the lecture material. They were interesting to do, but perhaps they could have been more tailored to tie in with the course material.Second, I would have loved more field trips. That's really where the material came to life and everything made sense.Third, I certainly learned some things from the student presentations in the last several classes of the semester, but I think I would have preferred a few more lectures going deeper into some of the material.",
    "With field trips in particular, it would be really nice to have more field trips closer to Yale. Driving all the way to Harvard Forest is an enormous waste of time when interesting succesion is happening at West Rock and Westwoods. It would be very easy to do a fieldtrip right in Eastrock. The fieldtrips didn't really contribute to the class and seemed like a token. I would love more fieldtrips if they were more connected.",
    "N\/A",
    "I wished for a bit more interaction between the instructor and the students. It was clear the course is designed for a smaller group, and I almost wonder if it would have been better if it was capped. Still, I learned a lot and am very thankful I took the course.",
    "it was really nice class",
    "While I greatly appreciate the effort and planning that went into the field trips, I felt like the trip to the Harvard forest and to Great Mountain could have perhaps been a little closer to home. Maybe we could have just gone to East Rock Park for one of them. That being said, they were interesting and I learned something, they just involved a lot of travel compared to on the ground time.",
    "6. Marlyse was an excellent TA. She was very organized, especially considering all of the class field trips, and I really look up to her as a person. My one criticism is that she talks very quickly and uses a lot of jargon that can sometimes do more to confuse than clarify.8. The field trips were very well designed and ran remarkably smoothly. I especially enjoyed the \u00e2\u0080\u009cforest forensics\u00e2\u0080\u009d walk with Tom Wessels, and the first trip to Great Mountain!11. Ann is very responsive to student comments. Her great amount of experience in the field means that she has a tremendous number of great (and relevant) anecdotes that help to respond to questions and clarify concepts.14. This class is very valuable to students interested in the applied field\/science of forestry, especially to those of us who are interested in working in the northeast or northwest regions of the United States. I could see how some students might argue, however, that there was too little attention toward tropical systems (but this is not a complaint of mine!)."

    "Field trips were greatAnne's enthusiasm in trees is evident through her teachingThe subject covered a lot of topics",
    "Lit review, the content of the class, and readings.",
    "It covered a wide range of material, but in just enough detail that you did not feel you were missing key concepts. The practicality of knowledge learned in the class was very apparent and was especially evident when taking the midterm and final. And the field trips were great!",
    "The best aspect of this course was the field trip. By having the field trip, I understood the concept more.",
    "The field trips were incredibly valuable and helped compliment course material.",
    "The Tom Wessels field trip and Marlyse's old growth forest hike were some of my favorite parts. I like Ann's analogies in class.",
    "Field Trips",
    "It is a great broad introduction into forestry especially in North American forestry.It covers the basic essential aspects and helps students to focus their study concentrations in the following semesters.",
    "field trip and all the articles",
    "Class was well structured, and professor was organized for each lecture.",
    "Question 16: field trips, discussion of papers, class review by TA and lectures.",
    "The readings were classics, the content was gone over in a thorough way, and Ann's personal experiences in this field were fascinating. My favorite times were hearing Ann's experiences. I feel like a great part of what I remember were her stories of working out West. Lots of support from the TA as well.Thanks for the great feedback on the presentation. This is the only class I took this semester that actually gave me feedback on a presentation.",
    "One of the best aspects of this course was that it integrated lectures, discussions, field trips, and student presentations. Exploring complex topics from these different angles helped to solidify concepts in my mind, and it kept the class from getting to static. The annotated bibliography was also an extremely beneficial exercise \u00e2\u0080\u0093 of all of my classes, I probably learned (and invested) the most in this assignment.",
    "The readings were very appropriate in difficulty and were targeted very well to their respective lectures. For students with backgrounds outside of science, this was a good introduction to critically analyzing and being tested on scientific articles. The structure of the class was great. This was my favorite class of the semester by far!",
    "The conceptual knowledge gained in this course will be extremely helpful for future reference. Also, the management applicability is quite useful. Further, I enjoyed learning the history of the field of stand dynamics through scientific literature. Finally, I feel I learned a great deal through application of conceptual material through application on field trips.",
    "Some of the best aspects of this course were the field trips. They were really helpful for solidifying concepts we learned about in class and in the readings. I also really appreciated how organized the professor was with her slides and her readings. Her organization made it really easy to get ahead with the readings and organize the information for ourselves."

   "comments": [
    "From not having a background in Forests, this subject was the tougher than the rest. It was difficult to grasp the concepts and the review sessions were not as frequent as they should have been.It would have been better if there was an hour a week review session of all the readings assigned. This way everything is not left to the review session before the exam.The test is highly practical while the class is highly theoretical. For some of us who came with no knowledge in Forests, this was not good for out grades. It is not easily to learn a Science without the basics but then the exam should be on the basics and not on the implications of what the basics mean.If the exam tests our knowledge of understanding, then there should be more compulsory review sessions that speak about \"practical knowledge\"",
    "I already responded to this in question 15.",
    "See above",
    "The lectures feel slow, repetitive and outdated. There could be a much larger emphasis on other stand models such as Franklin- it's nuts to leave out a major part of forestry education just because of Chad Oliver's political stance. There also needs to be a much larger emphasis on quantitative stand dynamics. The sections on SI, SE, UR, and OG could be done in 1\/2 the time, leaving much more time for additional material. The discussions also need to be better organized and perhaps have a lecture for 1\/2 of the class then a discussion for the second half. This year they were a huge waste of time.",
    "We seemed to cover most material before the midterm and then go back and mainly review the same material with a bit more detail after the midterm. A better structure may be to spread the material more evenly over the semester.",
    "The course should have more sessions for reading discussion.",
    "The organization of the some of the lectures was weak and the PowerPoints tended to jump from topic to topic a lot.",
    "Instructor feedback wasn't great--again I think this is systematic of having too many students for the class format.",
    "Probably less focus on historical evolution of forestry and more on current-affairs forestry.",
    "TA review sessions were inefficient.",
    "Too many presentations at the end of class two weeks was too long.",
    "Question 17. The mode of assessment. I think the final exam should be cut out and allow for fully synthesized paper submissions that allows for critical thinking in a subject of interest.",
    "We could have spent more time walking around outside, especially during the first couple of months. It felt like a shame to be indoors looking at powerpoint presentations of trees when we're surrounded by such exceptional trees. This was brought home to me the other day when I was walking around in the forest and thinking about the concepts we learned in class: I realized that this was only the second or third time I'd really applied that knowledge (aside from the field trips). We had so many opportunities to go outside and talk about things in the forests around campus.Also, I'm not sure how useful it is to expect people to learn the names of all the authors we read throughout the term. For people in this field, sure, that makes sense. But for others, studying topics somewhat different than forestry, it is an onerous task, and of limited value.I would like to see more feedback on my annotated bibliography.",
    "My only real complaint about the class is the pace. It felt like it moved a little too slowly, especially because the concepts are quite logical and straightforward. I would like to have spent a little more time focusing on applying the concepts (which is where it really gets messy), as we were asked to do in the final exam.",
    "I wish the presentations were tied more closely to class material. The current structure allows students to tap into their varying interests and backgrounds, but I think we would have learned more if we had to step outside our comfort zones. Students tended to present on work they had already done, and it felt more like an exercise in public speaking than learning about forestry concepts.Also, a hands on or demonstrative component could have helped to clarify the quantitative lecture. Even if it isn't run by an expert, that field trip should definitely happen every year.",
    "It would be more helpful to discuss fewer papers but more frequently. I felt that I forgot most of what I had read in the papers before we discussed them in class.Also, I would have loved to have more time in the field. We could have visited the Marsh gardens to learn more about tree architecture or leaf formation instead of just discussing it it class."

    "Yes, aside from not having enough time to really put them into practice out in the forest. This is a foundational course for people interested in forests, whether or not they plan to actually work in forests.",
    "Yes, the knowledge gained from the course met my expectations; I only wish it would have moved a little bit faster so that we could have covered more.",
    "Absolutely! I can only hope I learn as much in other forestry classes as I did in Stands.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class did meet my expectations. I learned a lot and I feel like I now look at forests differently and have a better understanding of how trees grow and interact overtime."

   "comments": [
    "For those that have already done basic Env. Science, this course will be wonderful but for those who have not studied forests before, be prepared to put in extra hours to learn the implications of what is being taught in order to get a better grade",
    "Be prepared for a lot of reading. Participate and ask clarifying questions. Start your annotated bibliography EARLY. Study a lot for the mid-term and final, well in advance, because they are really difficult.",
    "I essentially never opened the Stand Dynamics textbook. I'm glad to have it as a reference for the future, but the course draws directly from the book in many cases, to the point where reading the book would have been almost superfluous. I can't say that is true for the whole book since I only read a few chapters.",
    "Make sure that your Lit. Review is well planned and work on it throughout the semester. Get the basics of these models from the class, and then do your own reading \/ research for the rest of the material.",
    "Focus on linking concepts learned in class to what you see at field trips and the field trips will be very useful, not just fun.",
    "Manage your time very well to read all of the journals.",
    "Do the readings and participate in discussions",
    "Read Oliver and Larson early in the course. Ann follows the format of the book closely and it will give you a good grounding for her lectures.",
    "The textbook should be a requirement",
    "A lot of reading is necessary.",
    "Try to understand broad picture (not detail!)",
    "Do it.",
    "Preparation before lecture is critical, this includes text readings, and review of slide presentations. Must be prepared for class.",
    "Students should endeavour to read all reading papers",
    "Learn to take notes on the readings. You will need to refer to them multiple times throughout the course and I spent a lot of time rereading things I had forgotten and neglected to annotate. Also, choose topics for your project and presentation that fit with your other coursework. I chose topics that did not relate to my other studies and it was an immense amount of work trying to get up to speed on them. I would have been better served integrating my coursework to a greater extent.",
    "I would strongly advise you to take the course. And even though the Forest Stand Dynamics text is not required reading, I recommend reading it as the course progresses. It provides nice continuity from topic to topic, and the writing is very accessible. I would also recommend going on all of the field trips for this class \u00e2\u0080\u0093 each one is different and useful in its own way. Plus, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great way to get to know the professor and hear all of her awesome stories!",
    "Even if you're not an MF, take the course anyway. You'll be surprised how much you learn!",
    "Keep up on the readings. They are extremely helpful. Also, think in terms of management and application when it comes to conceptual material.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It was taught very well and in a way that is easy to understand. Also, this is great background for people interested in business or a good foundational course for people interested in forest ecology or management."
