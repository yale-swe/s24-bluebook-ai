    "French 109 is a great course for motivated students who want to learn to read French. I would absolutely recommend it. It is rigorous, but doing the work is your responsibility. Just doing homework and classwork is not good enough to make you a proficient French reader; you will need to do lots of outside work like Sanjabi recommends. With that in mind, I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes- it is a good course to establish basic reading level in French for research purposes, and the workload is manageable around other courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone, both those already comfortable in their beginning knowledge of French and total neophytes.",
    "A good grammatical introduction to French. Helps if you have some basic French background, requires more effort if you are a true beginner or have no experience with romance languages or Latin",
    "I recommend it.",
    "In this course students learn to read French and also gain valuable tools for other language study.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course for those students interested in acquiring professional knowledge from materials written in French.",
    "The class is a great way to amass materials that I will use down the road. I would certainly recommend it as it gives students the tools they need to continue their own course of study."
