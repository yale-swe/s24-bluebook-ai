   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It gives you useful tools to apply theory in real life situations. It is a good seminar and you will learn a lot, even if you have reasonable readings and tasks. This was my favorite class this semester. If you are interested in global affairs, development, economics or international relations. Take it.",
    "Take it",
    "Def - easy course if you keep up with the reading and speak in class. Midterm and final are not too difficult.",
    "Take it if you are interested in learning more about developing countries and the tools to fight poverty! It's an interesting and enjoyable class, and workload is definitely manageable!",
    "Good class with not too much work",
    "Easy course, readings optional. Discussions are entry-level. Not really going to shake up your thinking on much.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone interested in development work or poverty alleviation. It definitely has a lot of real world applicable topics.",
    "Yes, take this class. Great introduction to topics important in poverty alleviation and international development. Professor is smart, energetic, and engaging. Topics are foundational, however, and might be too elementary for someone who's already taken a lot of development courses.",
    "Good introduction to poverty alleviation strategies. You'll study a variety of case studies from countries around the world. Class discussion revolves around the readings, so make sure to do them. Throughout theterm, you'll be working with an assigned group of 3-4 other students on presentations and memos - you'll be assigned a specific country. Three policy memos, two presentations (based on the memos), and a final paper. You won't go into too much detail, as it's a broad survey of topics, but I recommend the class if you want to learn more about the ways countries\/organizations are trying to reduce poverty. You should be comfortable with group work. Prof. De La O is very knowledgeable.",
    "Great course to give an overview of different approaches to tackling poverty and trying to understand the various conditions necessary and the setbacks that anti-poverty programs often face. The workload is not that much, especially if you keep up with the readings (which are light but interesting), and there is a healthy variation in assignments which keeps the work interesting.",
    "Yes, definitely take this class. It is essentially a broad introduction to issues of poverty alleviation that covers topics like child labor, the impact of democracy and authoritarianism on anti-poverty programs, debates on how to measure poverty, and others. Though the class is a lot of work (over 200 pages of reading a week, a simple but long midterm, and a longer final paper), Prof. de la O has chosen the work so that it's mostly interesting and relevant. Also in this class, unlike in many other seminars, you will have the chance to work in teams on a 'Memo project,' which will essentially require you and a few classmates to research and present a project about the poverty issues and poverty-alleviation strategies in a certain country, and then to propose a new way to combat poverty in that country. It's pretty fun, though a fair amount of work, and I think most students appreciated that Prof. de la O tried to add some variety to the coursework. She's also a great professor; she's friendly, accessible, and not a harsh grader, and discussions run smoothly because of her. Overall this is a great seminar, I totally recommend it!"
