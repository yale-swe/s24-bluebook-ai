   "comments": [
    "It was a great class. An excellent science credit that is NOT A GUY but provides you with a profound understanding of the Earth and its systems and how they relate to our day to day lives.",
    "Yes. Lectures can be dry but if you have any interest in geology it will be fun. Some parts you might not be as interested in (its a general survey course) but you learn quite a bit on how geology can be important.",
    "A very thorough survey to introductory geoscience, though not very well-taught. As for gut sciences, it is not one of the more fun ones available at Yale, and you will not take much from it if you really want to feel immersed in a scientific subject for a semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody and everybody, specifically because it gives an introduction to a number of earth-related topics and fields that I find of interest to everybody. The lab is a useful exercise if you are interested in learning actual methods of geology.",
    "It is a solid overview of geology. Some topics are really interesting, others much less so (though which ones would probably vary person to person). The work load isn't heavy in terms of problem sets, but the midterm\/final are surprisingly difficult. It is a good introductory class, and is well suited to a non-science major who wants a science class with real information. You have to put in some time, but it is not overwhelming.",
    "Geology and Geophysics 110 was a very interesting class, I would recommend it to other students. It briefly went over many aspects of the world and made me look at everything around me differently. I think it's important that everyone learn about the basic geology concepts at some point in their life and this is a very painless way to do so. The reading helps to make the lectures clearer but isn't exactly necessary to read every week. The midterm and the final were fairly easy if you have been paying attention to the lectures, and especially if you read the text book.",
    "If you are interested in a board, shallow survey of geology, take this class. Please be aware that there are other, more interesting geology courses so if you are considering geology as a major, do consider taking other geology courses at the same time or even before in order to make your decision. There is also another intro geo class in the spring that is more of a seminar style if you'd prefer that. Also, take the lab with Dave Evans if possible!",
    "This was a really good class, especially for a non-science major looking for a science credit. Geology is a fascinating field, and is incredibly important to understand if you hope to comprehend Earth history, natural disasters, natural resources, and global warming. This class actually made me wish I had taken more geology classes during my time at Yale. The team-teaching method doesn't always work perfectly. Both professors care a lot about their students, but Prof. Rye can be fairly dry whereas Prof. Evans is generally very engaging."
