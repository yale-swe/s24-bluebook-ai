   "comments": [
    "A totally new perspective on human biology -- I was actually inspired by course material from ANTH 242 to focus on more in depth and will be working in the professor's lab next year.",
    "BIOCULTURAL APPROACH! LIFE HISTORY THEORY! RACE IS A SOCIAL CONSTRUCT!",
    "I have taken science courses at Yale, but have never looked at these topics from an anthropological standpoint, which was very cool to be able to do in this class. All the topics you cover are very interesting and relevant, and it's taught quite well.",
    "I developed knowledge about human evolution as a whole. More specifically, I learned about human biology.",
    "Life history theory! Human evolutionary biology! Really useful frameworks that definitely reframed my understanding of human evolution.",
    "Knowledge about biological history and evolution of the human body in different aspects",
    "The basics of human evolution and how the human race has come to its current form in present time.",
    "I felt I learned how to think critically in a way that applied distinctly to the natural sciences. I am a heavily humanized-oriented student and thought this course offered me a meaningful way to apply those \"humanity-like\" skills in a scientific context. I also feel I learned a lot - truly, a lot. Since the course made a successful effort to place everything in a comprehensive, evolutionary context, I feel like remembering its content is akin to remembering a story: it makes sense and fits together intuitively.",
    "I have come to appreciate the importance of connecting overarching themes particularly in discussion about the human body. Specifically, I have learned the importance of considering the complexity and entanglement of genetics and environment and how conditions of these two factors at particular times in early life can affect a person's life trajectory.",
    "This class really brought me back to learning for the sake of loving the material, and taught me lots about human evolutionary biology in the process!",
    "I developed a more biosocial and biocultural approach to science.",
    "I got better at reading and analyzing scientific papers. I learned how to ask critical questions about established thinking and\/or science. I did take away some interesting knowledge about HEB topics, but I wish the course had had a more cohesive subject material. I don't think the specific information I learned will stay with me for very long, because it wasn't well-connected materially.",
    "Learned a lot about looking at developments from an evolutionary perspective and understanding the importance of trade-offs. Really interesting stuff. The papers we read for section highlighted critical concepts that we were learning in class and helped frame the material in an applicable context.",
    "I learned how to apply ideas discussed in the class to real-world scenarios.",
    "I took this course for a science credit, but I was able to learn more than facts and figures and really connect how human processes work. I was also encouraged to think about things critically and develop a reasoning for the why behind human evolutionary bio.",
    "This class is very interesting on a conceptual leveland I'm speaking as a Humanities majorand is thankfully most emphasizing in its concepts. It does become a bit of a classic Big Lecture in that some things are rushed and many people slack off, but I think lots of what is learned can be lasting. Claudia is also a great professor for a big lecture. She understands what is reasonable to expect of the class, but her agenda is to get you to think critically (which is reflected in the tests).",
    "I learned a lot about the human body, how it works, and how it has evolved over time. There was a lot of explanation of environmental mismatches and it was overall a very interesting course.",
    "Taking a biocultural approach to issues in biology, comparative perspectives in human evolutionary biology, learning to read through scientific papers and be critical of scientific news that is in mass media.",
    "I learned how to approach science from a broad perspective and how to use an evolutionary approach to analyze biology. I also leaned a great deal about anthropology and life history.",
    "I learned so much about the history of evolution, different ways of understanding biocultural interactions, and how to critically evaluate science.",
    "The biggest skill I took from this course was how to sit back and let the information soak in. She always uploaded the slides after class, I could really just listen to the lecture and try to absorb as much as possible.",
    "I learned a bunch about human life history!!!",
    "I learned a lot about female reproductive biology, scientific racism, and life history theory. I learned a new framework through which to see the world, and I learned how to read and extract information from scientific articles and graphs.",
    "Learned about human life history and applied evolutionary as well as anthropological perspectives to certain human behavioral phenomena.",
    "I learned some fun facts about reproduction and human life. More importantly, I gained a survey knowledge about the trajectory of human development and the past associated with each trait that we express.",
    "I had never taken biology in high school, and have always deeply regretted that decision, so I feel that I definitely have a more solid grounding in biology than I've ever had before. The evolutionary perspective was fascinating, and definitely appealing to someone majoring in history who seems to be asking similar questions that biological anthropologists ask, the who-what-when-where-and-why type things.",
    "I really developed a critical understanding of the way in which humans have evolved to possess current phenotypes and genotypes. Understanding interesting studies and ethics of conducting studies. As well as the most crucial time frame that shapes the development of humans.",
    "I gained a lot of practical knowledge relating to human health and evolution, and I also learned the framework of life history trade offs to evaluate my own activities.",
    "Soon much!! I learned all about the body and external influences (aka the environment!!) on our health. It covered evolutionary theory, reproductive health, diet, epigenetic, etc.",
    "An understanding of how to approach our histories and biologies from an evolutionary standpoint. Also, how to meditate :-)",
    "I learned so much in this course! Especially about reproduction, sex differentiation, and how humans are different than other primates.",
    "I gained a more thorough understanding of the function of the human body (biologically, genetically, etc) and the way that developed through evolution.",
    "This was a very interesting course. It is a great way to learn about human biology and evolution if you are a none science major.",
    "i learned a lot about human evolution and how to apply the thinking of genes x environment",
    "I learned alot and because it was amazingly taught, I will be able to retain alot of what I learned.",
    "I learned a lot about human life history and how it differs from other primates. I also learned about diversity within the human family and different evolutionary traits. I feel as though the class kept me engaged throughout and it was the most interesting science class I've taken in my life.",
    "A basic overview of some anthropology concepts and research methods",
    "This course taught me the importance of incorporating an evolutionary mindset throughout everyday life, and how much our evolutionary past shapes our present and future.",
    "Perhaps the best way to describe this course would be to say it's a Biology class where the things you matter tremendously to your everyday life. We learned extensively about the relationship between culture and Biology, the myths and misconceptions that plague popular representations of science, and the methods we use to study ourselves ethically and effectively. In short, it was the most humane Biology class I'd ever taken, which I suppose should be no surprise given the title.",
    "I loved this course, even as a non-STEM person, because I learned a lot of information that is really practical and relevant, and I think the style in which it was taught will make it memorable beyond this semester. I learned so much about human evolutionary biology and the concept of life history, as well as male and female reproductive ecology and interesting topics like stress and nonhuman primates.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I learned a lot about evolutionary biology and how it impacts many biological and cultural factors present and active in my everyday life. I thought the lectures were interesting and did a good job of incorporating theory with real life studies. If I had not needed a science credit, I probably would not have taken the class, but I am very happy I took this class.",
    "This course provided a lot of knowledge about basic human biology and evolutionary history. I thought it was very interesting and important concepts to understand for everyday life.",
    "I developed an appreciation for a lot of different, cool things I didn't know existed before (that's a vague answer, but truly, as an English major, this class taught me a lot of factoids and \"stuff\" that was just generally really interesting.) I learned to think critically about sensational headlines supposedly based in science, and got better at thinking about how scientific concepts play out in my day to day life.",
    "I learned a ton in ANTH242. I pretty much got an entire overview of human biology and life history as well as many theories about trade-offs, reproduction, and how humans survive. I now know so much more about the human body\/childhood\/life in general and I feel like what I learned will really stick with me, rather than just cramming for the test.",
    "Over the course of ANTH 242, I learned a great deal about human life history and how trade-offs inform every facet of human life. Alongside a brush-up on general biology and evolutionary theory, the class provided me with keen insight into the human capacity to adapt in order to optimize chances of success. I've never before considered the plasticity of the human body and of biological function -- from biological rhythms to physical growth -- and this class did an excellent job of introducing me to the choices our bodies make throughout life.",
    "My interest in biology became stronger and more educated. I learned to read academic scientific papers and condense my writing to the important and informative.",
    "Learn a lot about human biology from an evolutionary and biocultural standpoint. Also gives good insight into basic primate evolutionary biology, and how anthropological fieldwork is carried out.",
    "I gained an overview of human evolutionary biology. We covered topics from women's reproductive biology to the human stress response. I am walking away from this course with a better understanding of how my own body works, and why.",
    "I think I developed a good basic knowledge of anthropology.",
    "I learned more about bio-cultural relationships and how there are connections between socioeconomic factors and the biological wellbeing of a person.",
    "It offers you insights on how the human body works, and how we evolved to become what we are today. It sheds light, through an evolutionary perspective, on many aspects of our human daily lives - including reproductive functions, social behaviors, eating habits etc..",
    "Amazing survey course on human biology and evolution. Perfect science credit for non-stem majors. Claudia is a great lecturer and the material is interesting enough to keep you engaged all semester.",
    "A new topic in science I had never studied before. Good information and applications for the most part."

   "comments": [
    "Class was relaxing and understandable as well as informative --very well-constructed slides. Material was perfect for its audience (mainly non-STEM majors).",
    "Wow 10\/10 class. Strength: Claudia Valeggia, interesting course, accessible to all majors and skill levels, everything which Yale's distributional requirement for \"Breadth\" hopes to achieve Weakness: some of the TF's were sus. Dorsa was great but the other ones were not as engaged.",
    "This is a very well taught course - Claudia is fantastic, and the TA's are very helpful. Material is very well organized, and the workload is not overwhelming at all.",
    "This was a really great course! The information was very interesting and the engaging. The only complaint was that lectures sometimes seemed to be excessively long and filled with unimportant information.",
    "Overall, a very good course. Perhaps it would have been good to move up the big picture stuff to the front of the course, i.e. life history theory, tradeoffs, etc. This way, we're taking the framework of LHT and applying it to biological topics. Although I enjoyed some of the guest lectures, I wish they were shorter and that Claudia could have spent more time lecturing because she's so good. Also, I do not like that there was a full-length movie shown during the lecture. That is a waste of class-timeespecially because there were many other facets of HEB and LHT that we could have explored (i.e. the material was not exhausted). Finallyand I'm really thinking out loudI think it would be worth re-examining the outside-of-class work. On the one hand, I appreciated the consistency of a once-a-week assignment. On the other hand, though, it might be nice to have fewer more in-depth projects.",
    "I believe a strength is Professor V is really engaging and cares about what she is teaching",
    "There were no weaknesses of this course, I enjoyed it very much.",
    "Strengths: Claudia. Incredibly passionate lecturer. Instantly her level of engagement with her students and the material came off as authentic and responsive. I have not enough good things to write about her. Weaknesses: some of the teaching fellow staff. While I know they are exceptionally accomplished in each of their fields, some clearly felt more comfortable engaging with students in an authoritative role. For those who did not, sections felt a bit tedious and awkward.",
    "Mindfulness and meditation in the beginning of class led by Claudia is great because then you are ready to focus for the rest of the lecture.",
    "I was most struck by how relevant the course material was in day to day life. I believe that that relevance and Prof. Valeggia's enthusiasm for the subject made it enjoyable.",
    "Claudia really makes this course and is it's biggest strength. I also liked the format of the midterms, readings, and discussion questions, and liked that scientific papers were integrated into the discussion sections. There really weren't many weaknesses!",
    "Interesting course overall. Grading should not strictly adhere to a rubric, however. At times, I found myself putting down a correct answer and still getting docked points.",
    "The strength is in critical thinking and scientific reasoning. The weakness is teching and organizing of content. Some subjects were very confusingly taught, some we only talked about very briefly, etc.",
    "Professor Valeggia is very engaging. I love how attentive she is to her students. On the other hand, our sections seemed somewhat unorganized.",
    "I think it was a good amount of material and a nice range of topics. Sometimes it was a little difficult to figure out exactly what the information we should focus on was.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is Professor Valeggia, who is fantastic and cares so genuinely about her students. It is also just a really interesting and engaging course because of the material.",
    "Strengths: well taught, claudia clearly loves teaching the material and the TA's are experts in their fields Weaknesses: long class plus the mandatory section is frustrating",
    "The material for this class was extremely interesting but I think the order of topics could be slightly restructured to make it more cohesive. For example, I thought it was a bit confusing that primate life history came before human life history as life history theory was not actually defined till mid-way through the lecture on human life history. Maybe the 2 weeks on childhood growth and adolescence could be combined into one and related more to the week on life history theory, creating a gap for a different topic, maybe something like personalized medicine that goes well with evolutionary medicine?",
    "The teaching was great and the subject matter was interesting. The material was presented in a way that non-science majors could understand.",
    "Great content, great professor. One thing I would change is the Sunday reading response due date, it's a stressful day to have things due.",
    "The grading scheme is really heavily weighted on exams, so if you do bad on either the midterm or final, you're kinda screwed. I think it could be a good idea to maybe add a second midterm and allow you to drop your lowest score or maybe add a paper or something just to make everything worth a little less.",
    "To be honest, I didn't have that much time to engage with the course because of other commitments. But it was taught well and Claudia was so fun and low key. All around fun great class. And interesting studies!!",
    "Professor Valeggia's lectures are wonderful and engaging. The readings are really informative and pleasant to read. I did all the readings for the first half of the semester and got so much out of it! During the second half I did less reading and while everything was still interesting, I wish I would have made the time to read more. My section was great. Kendall was really helpful and knows a lot about female reproductive health and birth control. Those were some of my favorite conversations. I wish I'd had the guts to go see Prof Valeggia during office hours, because she seems really cool to talk to. The course could be improved if half the students in the class either stopped doing all their other work in class, or stopped coming to class.",
    "Great class, really engaging. I learned so much, it will forever think about how I think of the world.",
    "I don't like Claudia's lecturing style. It's very rambling and slow, and pretty hard to sit through the whole thing without loosing focus. I don't like all the personal asides.",
    "Most of the guest lectures by TAs were by far the weakest lectures in the semester. Claudia leading all of them would be an improvement.",
    "Gut.",
    "This class was engaging and comfortable, Professor Valeggia has a very distinct and refreshing, laid-back teaching style. The weekly discussion questions really forced me to do the readings, which really enhanced my learning! I think it could be improved with more structure in the lectures.",
    "The lectures with Claudia were fantastic, and I enjoyed all of the readings and learning how to read scientific papers. I do wonder about some of the scientific papers and section meetings...sometimes it was unclear what information we had to know and what information we didn't. Not just for \"what do we need to know on the exam\" but also just in terms of \"this was a study on a lot of biological processes that are incredibly complicated, there's so much information that I end up more confused in all the terminology than learning about the point of the study.\"",
    "Strength was that it was interesting material presented in an interesting way. It could be improved by practicing how to answer questions asked on midterms and finals. For many people this course is the first science class or there isn't a ton of science background and it helps to know things are needed to be answered and the ways to approach these questions.",
    "The course material is very interesting, but it is too broad. Perhaps this is kind of the point of having a class like this, but I felt like we were racing through semi-scientific topics for the sake of doing so, and not really exploring them in any depth. For instance, there is no need, in my opinion to have guest lectures from three teaching assistants during the semester. If the subject matter were more concentrated, I would have gotten more from it.",
    "The strength of this course is in the very clear objectives and themes running throughout different topics. I wish that the power points were a little clearer - Dorsa's ppts were always very good. I also feel that some of the topics leaned more towards everyday science - especially topics like diet - and was not as interesting or intellectually challenging as bits like epigenetics or evolutionary medicine. I feel like the course could be a lot more interesting with more science in it.",
    "Strengths: Very very interesting! The material is great for any student (whether they are STEM or not). I am more social science oriented but I still found it fascinating because there are so many important policy implications. It's also just great to learn more about our own bodies. Great gateway into the world of human biology\/anthropology. Weakness: While the material covered was very interesting, the lectures could at times get a bit boring because they moved slowly. I think it would be better to remove the historical access (who came up with what theory, ex: Seyle and stress, Montalliard and human growth, etc.) and instead focus on more studies and current information.",
    "Strengths: Comprehensive slides, interesting content, the discussion questions we had to submit and sections helped a lot in deepening and reinforcing knowledge Weaknesses: It would help to have a clearer idea how to answer exam questions (more exam skills taught)",
    "Sometimes, class lectures appeared unorganized. It was often difficult to keep track of lectures and note taking.",
    "Strengths are its subject matter--so interesting! Weakness is that sometimes lecture is too long for the subject.",
    "The course was pretty well structured. I wouldn't change much.",
    "really interesting and not forcing you to memorize a lot of stuff, rather encouraging you to think differently",
    "It is a very interesting class and I really enjoyed this.",
    "For the most part, the guest lecturers really added to the course. Professor Valeggia is a really engaging lecturer. This was the first course I've taken at Yale where I feel that the level of stress associated with the class was low but that I learned a great deal and was engaged in the material.",
    "Very good for students with limited science\/research background, lectures are interesting.",
    "This was one of the most enjoyable classes I have yet to take at Yale. Every lecture was taught in such an engaging manner and the content was so interesting.",
    "The only weakness of this course, if you could call it that, is that it spans such a broad range of topics that it was difficult to feel like we'd covered any one in real detail. However, one, that's kind of the point of a survey, and two, many general themes recurred over and over again in a way that satisfied my taste for depth.",
    "This class was great! Sometimes the lectures felt like they were a little slow, but I think that's because an hour and fifteen minutes is a long time for a science lecture. Claudia definitely wanted us to get the most out of the class and was great about checking in periodically to make sure we could give feedback about potential improvements to the course. I think the tests were very accurate representations of what we learned throughout the semester and were not tricky at all, and studying for them was actually surprisingly enjoyable.",
    "This course had a really good combination of science and social science. The only issue I had was with the order of the readings. Because weekly discussion questions were over the topics for the next week, that meant I was doing readings for the following week instead of for the week I was in. I would rather have the readings and the lectures match up, because I think I would learn better that way and the readings and lectures would reinforce each other more.",
    "I think the lectures were very well done, and the readings in conjunction with the discussion questions helped students understand what the main takeaways were. I liked the overall format of the class and how each lecture was clearly a specific topic and stayed to that topic. Other than a couple of them, I did not really think the Teaching Fellow's lectures were very helpful. I also thought there was a great discrepancy in the knowledge and leadership of the Teaching Fellows, which definitely made each section very different. I I really liked Professor Valeggia's lecturing style and how she enthusiastically shared her field work with the class.",
    "I thought the course was great! Lecture was always run well and the sections were helpful and engaging.",
    "A strength of this class is that it is accessible and focuses on interesting, relevant topics. It is very straightforward in its goals.",
    "I thought the strengths of the course was the extremely interesting material\/readings\/ case studies. I loved having science taught to me from a social science perspective in a way I could actually understand; I think I learned more from this class than any other science class I've ever taken (I'm a humanities major). Even though some people might say we went over the same stuff more than once I actually thought it was crucial to understanding the material and very helpful for those like me who this doesn't come intuitively to. I think some lectures could have been more clear or a few seemed extraneous such as the lecture where we just looked at our ancient primate relatives in their adolescence - that lecture didn't stick with me at all.",
    "This course has the potential to be an excellent class. The material covered throughout the semester is intriguing. The topics covered feel real and accessible and I really feel as though I've grown in my understanding of scientific concepts. Also, with the majority of the students in the class having enrolled for the purpose of getting a science credit, Professor Valeggia has created on a great opportunity to teach non-STEM students some fascinating science. However, there are several factors that severely detract from the class. Firstly, while I understand Professor Valeggia's interest in providing TFs with the opportunity to teach, the number of guest lectures undermined the entire course. As a learner, I rely on a consistent tone from my professors. Different teachers have different styles, and the rotation between Professor Valeggia, Professor Fernandez-Duque and four TFs often left me confused and frustrated. The constant switch in tone and teaching style negatively affected the course. I think that Professor Valeggia should be leading the class as much as possible. Not only is she an excellent professor, as I will go on to explain, but the switch back and forth between multiple teachers confused me, and I know others had similar issues with the rotating teaching team. Secondly, I felt as though the class, especially the first half of the semester, didn't follow a clear narrative. Much of the course was punctuated by leaps between disparate subjects; one day we would be learning about obesity, the next we would be taking notes on life history theory. By the end of the course, I began to see the bigger picture. However, this \"big picture\" was neither clear nor specific. I believe the course could be enhanced by making sure each lecture connects with the next and that there exists a clear an deliberate sense of direction. I've given some examples on how this could be accomplished later in this survey. Also, I disagree with the choice to split up grading for exams across TFs. In this course, each TF graded a portion of every single exam. I think each TF should grade all portions of their students' exams. This would make it easier to discuss directly with graders why certain marks were taken off. Also, students can better know grading expectations by talking to their specific TFs, instead of having to take into account the grading styles of 4 different TFs at one time. No rubric can remove subjectivity from grading. The best possible solution is to create a pathway for students to know who will be grading their tests so that they might better know how to tackle questions on exams. If the course were to have fewer guest lectures and a clearer sense of purpose, it would be an excellent class.",
    "It was a very strong course where i feel everyone learned something because it was for all levels and lecture was engaging. A weakness may be that the course may not have been challenging enough for some, but also thatwas not the point of the class and it did not feel like a repeat of things I knew.",
    "The class was good - by showing up to lectures and doing the readings, you had more than enough information to complete the short weekly discussion questions. The lectures were always interesting and comprehensive. Sometimes the scientific papers assigned as readings were too complex for me to thoroughly understand as I don't have a background in biology. Also sometimes the lecture pace was slightly slow.",
    "I think this class is a good intro anthro course that covers a wide variety of topics that are very applicable to everyday life.",
    "The lectures are engaging and thoughtful, and the material always feels relevant. Sometimes, the history of the field is not fully explained or engaged with--but this might be beyond the scope of the course.",
    "I think that this course was taught at an extremely good pace for learning.",
    "This course was very well structured, and I thought that all of the information was made accessible and easy to understand in lecture. Section highlighted the things to know for the exams, and I really enjoyed the meditation that we did at the beginning of every class. As a non-science major, I really enjoyed this science credit and do not have any complaints to make about the class as a whole.",
    "This course is captivating once you reach the end and are able to get the big picture of human evolutionary biology. However, it is a lot of work and it might be frustrating at times because it covers a lot of material that might feel unrelated - we go over many details, readings, and examples. The lectures\/lectures slides are not alway engaging and it is hard to tie them back to the readings (which can also be difficult, especially when we read research papers). At first, I did not like the weekly discussion questions, but in the end they really grounded me and forced me to keep up with the course on a weekly basis - or else I would have likely been lost.",
    "It could not be improved. This course was absolutely phenomenal in all facets.",
    "This course is both easy and hard at the same time. The content is not difficult to understand, but the tests are hard and require a lot of attention to detail and ability to soak up lots of information. I would've preferred if the balance was slightly different, i.e. the subject matter was more difficult or fast-paced and the tests were a little easier. I think it would've made for a better classroom environment.",
    "Strength is the actual information and the fact that many people seemed to find it genuinely interesting. The weakness is in the layout of the class. Too heavily based on 2 tests that don't even cover everything we had studied. Class would be much better off with a few papers."

    "This class is an extremely interesting and relatively easy science credit. You have to invest your time in attending lecture and section, but doing the readings is not critical. The content of the course is extremely interesting and i would recommend this to anyone without a science background looking for a simple science credit. Claudia and the TA's are also phenomenal.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. The class is interesting, the TFs are dedicated, and the professor is unmatched. Engaging, understandable, and comprehensive course material makes the class a pleasure to be in.",
    "YES 10\/10 WOULD RECOMMEND. If, by the end of the first lecture, you aren't crying at Prof. Valeggia's perfection, you will never be satisfied with life. This is a fab SC credit coming from somebody who cannot do STEM. Oh by the way, we don't have P-Sets *wow*, AND we meditate for the first 5 minutes of every class. I don't know what else I can say to make somebody want to take it.",
    "Definitely ! Whether you are a science person or not, there is a lot to learn from this course.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It's a more in depth version of the high school biology. The course covers race, the hormonal aspects of human cycles and relatable topics like stress. It's a more engaging class and shows you how complex and interesting human evolutionary biology. Also Claudia is a great professor and cares a lot about her students which is very apparent to those in her lecture. The TFs are also great!",
    "A must take! The workload is super manageable and interesting, the discussion questions are easy and actually help you understand the material, and the midterm and final are fair. Also, it is a very easy science credit.",
    "ANTH 242 was a really, really good course. Although it was the first anthropology course I took, I have shopped othersand I believe it is unique in several ways. For one, it sits at the intersection of cultural and biological anthropology, which makes it a particularly interesting cross-section of anthropological subjects. Second, Claudia is special; she is the sort of instructor who values her students and their learning above all else. She is a fantastic resource and someone with whom I would love to take other classes. All of the topics were compelling. The workload is fairly standard: there is a one-page (or so) response per week, so you ultimately end up writing around 10 pages and taking a midterm and final. This was not the most mind-opening, life-changing course I took, but I'm certainly glad I took it and would recommend it to others.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about human evolution and how our body has evolved and works. Not a gut but not crazy either",
    "Yes! This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale and I enjoyed every lecture. The professor and the TA's are extremely engaged and make this class a very pleasant learning experience.",
    "Yes! Certainly if you are a non-STEM major this is a course that will be accessible AND resonate with you. Take, take.",
    "Absolutely! Take this class!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to other students. Prof. Valeggia is amazing and passionate which makes the already engaging material more engaging.",
    "Yes yes 100% yes favorite course so far!!",
    "Good class for a Sc\/So credit.",
    "If you are looking for a science credit and you think the topics are interesting, then yes, I would recommend this class. If you want to have a long-term takeaway or get stressed out by disorganization, then I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for non-science majors trying to get a science credit. It's not a gut, but if you put in a bit of effort it's really not that bad.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this class if you need a science or social science credit. It is a relatively easy grade, and most of the people in the class were upperclassmen looking for a social science credit. The material is interesting, if somewhat intuitive, and the way the course is taught is great in that the instructors promote critical thinking and discussion, but I don't think that most of the people in the lecture took part in the discussion, unfortunately. This is a good class for a fifth credit, especially considering the very low workload required to get by.",
    "I would absolutely say this is the best course to take if you need a SC course and aren't a STEM major. It's taught well to make sure that students understand and relevant to life even if you don't pursue the content further.",
    "100% take this course if you need an easy and interesting SC credit. Fantastic choice.",
    "Yep! If you're history-minded\/social-science-minded, I think it's a great science course.",
    "Yes definitely. The weekly section plus weekly reading response is a pain but not too bad. And I learned so much. It was worth my time.",
    "I would recommend this class to students looking to take a science class from a social science perspective. The topics are engaging and the work load is fair.",
    "Yes! It is a very interesting science credit that I learned a lot from and enjoyed.",
    "Claudia is a goddess and this class is super interesting! Everyone should take it :)",
    "Yes, Claudia is awesome and the material is fun to learn about. I'm the farthest thing from a science guy, but she made learning this stuff fun. Plus, my TA, Dorsa, was great as well!",
    "It's a pretty gutty science, but the grading can be tough at times",
    "Yes. I took this for a science cred as a humanities person. I had some bio background, which helped for sure. I think it would still be perfectly manageable if one didn't, you'd probably just have to be more engaged on the building blocks. Cynthia is very loving towards her students and the material. It was a good class, often interesting, and a manageable science.",
    "Very fun sc credit. Take it with friends and enjoy. Claudia is awesome.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I took it as my first science credit and it was both doable and very interesting and applicable, so I enjoyed doing the readings and I'm glad I know what I know as I result of them. I would even be interested in taking Prof Valeggia's seminar after this class, even though I never had any intention of taking science classes at Yale. The grading is really fair, and the distribution of work is steady (in a good way). Take it!",
    "Absolutely recommend this class, this is a must take at Yale.",
    "Not really. I would advise them to find a good TA if they are set on taking it, because my sense is that most aren't great.",
    "Yes! I am by no means a STEM student, but I came away from this class having learned a lot. This is a great way to knock out a science credit.",
    "If you're looking for a relatively low workload\/intensity class, this might be for you.",
    "Yes! It was fun and laidback but I also walked away with useful knowledge that made me look at the world in a different way.",
    "Take this course if you want a science credit. It is not super 'sciencey,' nor is it super interesting, but Claudia and the teaching fellows are very kind and passionate and do their best to keep lectures and sections engaging.",
    "Absolutely...for those of us shopping for a science credit, this is a fulfilling, intellectual stimulating, fun, and interesting course that made me feel like I actually learned something and supplemented my other courses rather than just taking a GUT.",
    "Yes I would definitely recoommend it if you are interested, if you aren't at all then don't because the course requires a HIGH level of engagement andd dedication to the material. This is no science gut.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to someone looking for a science credit. The material is interesting, if a bit too broad to feel worthwhile when taken during a single semester. The teaching staff is fantastic and the workload is not bad weekly discussion questions, weekly section, a midterm and a final. The midterm and final were surprisingly difficult, and the grading is quite unforgiving though, so I would make the effort to study for both exams multiple days in advance.",
    "I think this is a good course for anyone - like me - who wants to learn more about evolutionary concepts as used in media or popular culture. If you're a bio person, you might not enjoy the course as much - the concepts covered are fairly basic.",
    "DEFINITELY a great science credit for a non-stem person! Not at all a gut, but very fulfilling. Also, come fore the meditations at the beginning of class.....",
    "Yes",
    "Yes!! Great class for any student! I am more of a social science student but I still found it fascinating because you learn a lot about social determinants of health and their effects on the body, which very easily translates into policy work. In general, it gives you a great introduction to understanding your body and its interaction with the environment. While the material is fascinating, class can sometimes be a little boring because it moves slowly. Definitely study for the midterm and final, but overall it wasn't too hard of a class. Take it -- could definitely spark your interest in anthro!",
    "Yes! If you haven't done much bio before, evolutionary bio is fascinating. This class is well catered to humanities and social science students in its approach and pedagogy.",
    "Yes! Interesting and relevant material, digestible",
    "I recommend this class to another student because Claudia is a wonderful human being who cares about her field of study and her students. Getting to hear about her research is really a privilege. All in all, the class provided me with a valuable perspective about humans that other classes in my major weren't.",
    "Definitely! I loved this course so much and learned SO MUCH. Even considered switching my major to anthropology because of it. Exams are reasonable if you study and pay attention.",
    "Yes. It was a fascinating course and had lots of useful knowledge.",
    "Yes! If you are looking for a science credit, but are not really a science major this a good class to take. its also just really interesting if you enjoy learning about human life history.",
    "Yes",
    "yes",
    "Yes!",
    "Yessss!!! It's not a gut but it is amazing!!",
    "Absolutely recommend this class to other students. It is an amazing science credit. Professor Valeggia's daily meditations had a noticeable impact on my stress levels. She's a great lecturer and the workload is very doable. The most positive learning environment I've been in at Yale.",
    "Yes absolutely. The class was interesting without requiring a lot of busy work or a massive time commitment. I learnt a lot about a large number of topics, and felt that with a small amount of effort I could keep up with discussion.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. It is extremely relevant to every individual and I think everyone can gain something of value out of it.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this class to other students! As a non-STEM major, it was not too difficult to grasp concepts, I learned a lot about biocultural anthropology and the material is very interesting and relevant to everyone. Prof. Valeggia is incredible (so warm and a great professor), so you should definitely try to take some class with her if not this one. The workload also wasn't too bad, so the class was overall a great experience.",
    "Absolutely! If you're looking to get a SC credit but you feel like Science of Science Fiction is a little too, shall we say, BS, take this class! You'll learn real stuff that will stay with you and Claudia is amazing!",
    "I can't recommend this class enough! To anyone and everyone! If you're looking for a science or a social science, this is the perfect way to fulfill it because if you're anything like me, you will actually get more out of it than most of the classes in your major. This information is super pertinent and good to know just because you are a human being and come from a long line of other human beings, and it's really cool to have a better understanding of all these topics. Plus, Claudia is a great professor and the TA's are so helpful. It might feel like an intimidating workload or subject matter but its so worth it.",
    "Someone told me at the beginning of the semester to take this course instead of an astronomy course for a science credit, because not only was it easier and more interesting, but she cited it as life changing. After its conclusion, I could not agree more. Professor Valeggia is an amazing professor that is passionate about her studies, student engagement, and the material. She is a wonderful lecturer, and I looked forward to lecture every week. The material is applicable, fascinating, and it makes you begin to think critically about aspects of biology from an evolutionary standpoint, thinking that I continue to do three weeks after the class ended. I wish I could take the course again!",
    "This is a great course for non-science majors who need a science credit (which is honestly why most people are taking it). It reviews the concepts you hopefully learned in high school and applies them in really interesting ways to human evolution. It is also a great introduction to biological anthropology.",
    "A great science course that gave me a lot of familiarity with a new and fascinating subject matter. Do recommend. Taught very well.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a science credit that is both interesting and caters to non-science majors. There was enough science in the course that I felt I was learning information I would not otherwise know while also not overwhelming me with very difficult and complicated science. Professor Valeggia is a great lecturer, and the graded assignments are well spaced out.",
    "I would recommend this class! I think the concepts covered are important for everybody to know. The class is not too difficult but you learn a lot of important information.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who, like me, needs a science credit and wants to learn something interesting, but also doesn't want to devote a ton of time to that class.",
    "Definitely - an extremely interesting look at human evolutionary biology and a great way to get a science credit from an accessible point of view.",
    "At this point, I'm not sure if I would recommend this course to another student. The course has potential, but I felt as though the class never took on a full identity and sense of purpose, as identified above. ANTH 242 feels almost like a survey of a survey: the lectures and readings jumped and bounced from broad topic to broad topic. I believe the course should be more focussed with a clearer direction. The class was difficult not because the course material was difficult. In fact, I believe the difficulty could be raised. Instead, the class was difficult because I found myself struggling to make sense of what I was learning in lecture because nothing seemed to come together into a solid picture. Perhaps it would be wise to cut down on the number of topics covered. We would often go over an entire are of study - i.e. the evolution of human diets - in one lecture. Perhaps three or even four lectures could be spent on the evolution of human diets. The topic of \"diets\" here is arbitrary; the diets section of the course was neither my favorite nor least favorite part of the class. However, my point is that I would prefer picking more selectively the topics covered so that the class might take on a clearer sense of direction.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would recommend this course. It makes the learning easy and interesting. Lecture is engaging and Claudia teaches the class to promote your actual learning of the material rather than a challenging competition. The grading is straightforward and the unique blending of disciplines makes for interesting material. Class builds upon knowledge from high school or previous bio classes.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking for a science credit that's interesting and will teach you useful content, but isn't too hard if you don't have a science background. Perfect level of challenge for someone who hasn't taken science classes for 3ish years, but not boring.",
    "This class is engaging and has a low workload. It might be a little boring for people who have taken anthropology (especially paleoanthropology) before, and will be easy for people who have taken intro bio. However, I learned a lot of interesting information in this class and Professor Valeggia and the teaching team are great.",
    "Take this course, especially if you've never engaged with evolutionary biology as it pertains specifically to humans. You'll have a bunch of crazy interesting facts to entertain your friends with, and you'll walk away from the course with knowledge about your own body\/basic existence that you feel you should have always known.",
    "Yes I definitely would.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. What I most enjoyed about this class was that it took a lot of the biology that I had previously learned in high school, and it placed it into a relevant, real world context. I had always wondered how certain topics that I had learned previously were even useful to know about, and I think that this class clearly demonstrated the relationship between science and important, real-world topics. I also really enjoyed the focus on studies performed in a non-Western context.",
    "Yes ! If you are looking for a science credit that will be of great insight and a great addition to your culture\/general knowledge of the human body. It is a lot of work and I would recommend being already interested in either science\/anthropology\/humans before taking it.",
    "Hands down the best science class for a non-science major! Regardless of your specific interests, you will come away from this course with a changed understanding of your everyday existence. Professor Valeggia is an unbelievably amazing professor, and you will get so much out of this course if you're willing to engage with the material.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. First of all, I was not expecting the tests to be so difficult. If you do take this class, study quite thoroughly and precisely for both the midterm and final. If you are interested in the subject matter, I would recommend this class (unless you already know a good amount about it). If you are not distinctly interested in the subject matter, I'm not sure I would recommend it, just because I think you will not learn a lot unless you have the interest and will to actually delve into the topics covered. I personally enjoyed lecture and section but was frustrated by the fact that, despite completely understanding the subject matter, I was unable to demonstrate this knowledge of tests because of how particular the questions were.",
    "yes",
    "Yes. Stay up to date on the material and your grade will be fine, hope that you get a good TA."
