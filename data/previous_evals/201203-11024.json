   "question_text": "How would you summarize AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 for a fellow student? Would you recommend AFAM 505 01\/AMST 643 01 to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a great class! I would absolutely recommend it to a fellow student, for many of the positive reasons listed in this report. And free food. :)",
    "It helped me immensely to read papers in the literature more efficiently and effectively. It also taught me a lot about how methods work- we learn so much about the biology and theory behind experiments that it was nice to get a crash course in the actual benchwork that goes on. I would recommend this course to everyone- it is extremely enjoyable and I learned a ton.",
    "All students in MB&B are required to take this course but I would still recommend it to any student since it teaches you how to critically approach scientific literature. It is a great course that helps you understand the logic behind the experiments conducted by the authors.",
    "Definitely! It is the most \"useful\" course in this semester.",
    "Although it required a lot of work and time to gain a full understanding of the papers each week, it was certainly worthwhile. I would highly recommend that any student should take a class like this, and if students in other programs don't have a class like this I would recommend any department to implement a class of this style.",
    "This course teaches you how to criticize research papers from different fields of research. I encourage everyone to take this course, it has changed the way that I read and evaluate research papers.",
    "This was a great course that improved my ability to read scientific literature. I definitely recommend, unless you are painfully shy and do not learn from public discussions.",
    "I would recommend Methods because it was thought-provoking and well taught.",
    "I would recommend this class. You learn a ton about very diverse areas of biology and how to effectively evaluate experiments.",
    "Although the format of the course can become tedious over time, it does a great job of teaching you essential skills for analyzing scientific papers. Although I dreaded going to class almost every week, by the end of the semester, I discovered that my comprehension of scientific literature had increased substantially as a consequence of this course. In that sense, I would recommend the course to anyone wishing to enhance their reading comprehension and critical thinking skills.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student, specially to whoever wants to go beyond just understanding a paper and actually exercising his or her critical thinking.",
    "I would tell them that it is a class that examines techniques and t\"thinking\" behind experiments, why the researchers did what they did, how they designed what the did, why they did what they did. I would warn them that it is a difficult class. And that reading three papers every week can be tedious (not always, but sometimes with the older papers), but that the class is good and worth it.",
    "A review of papers of various significance and the techniques\/methodology used in them. Provides practice reading papers and asking further questions after an experiment is performed. I would definitely recommend this class, as it was very useful and provided enjoyable discussion, but with students and with professors.",
    "This is a discussion-based course that focuses on reading and deeply understanding classic primary literature in Molecular biology. It is difficult and very time consuming, but the knowledge gained is very valuable. It focuses a lot on the methods of the papers, but the logic of why the experiments are done is also discussed.",
    "Summarized: It's a fun class that looks at seminal papers for their logic and technique, and is more about understanding the reasoning behind the science rather than any particular natural phenomenon. Be ready to read for hours and discuss for hours, since you'll get the most out of the class by participating and putting your own ideas forward. I would recommend this course to all scientists.",
    "I used to think I knew how to read papers in college and during my undergraduate research, and this class showed that there was so much more to it. I learned so much from the content of this class, and I think that the acquired skills will help tremendously throughout the rest of my career. I would highly recommend it (even though it is already required).",
    "MB&B 730 is a great course to learn how to critically analyze primary research articles for integrity of methodologies used and understanding why the data presented can be used to arrive to a particular conclusion. I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student because of the learning opportunity as well as for the selection of papers that we analyze.",
    "Yes, highly recommended to everyone in BBSB program and even beyond.",
    "The course MB&B 730 is a course in which students read multiple scientific papers and discuss the logic the papers used to answer the question that was posed. I would recommend MB&B 730 to another student because this course helps in the logic and experimental design to proposing a research project."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The answer to both parts of this question are essentially the same. Upon entry to grad school, I obviously knew how to accumulate raw knowledge, and knew that, when gazed upon in retrospect, the logic behind most papers is remarkably simple. I think Methods was an invaluable part of my learning how to link those two ideas together, and begin to use my knowledge to ask questions and solve problems, rather than take tests.",
    "It helped a lot in really understanding techniques in molecular biology, which is very relevant to my research. It also helped me read scientific papers more effectively.",
    "Knowledge of fundamental papers is key in science. This course was a great introduction, and I feel comfortable approaching many papers that I was not as comfortable in reading through in the past. In addition, I feel that I could get through papers in a shorter amount of time than before.",
    "Critical thinking and knowledge about experimental design.",
    "This class certainly contributed greatly to my knowledge and preparation for thesis research and my career.",
    "This course changed the way that I read research papers, and has introduced me to important concepts and methods.",
    "The course allowed me to attain a better understanding of molecular biology techniques and applications.",
    "It really helped me in every aspect of reading a paper. I can better evaluate papers\/experiments at a much faster pace.",
    "This course taught me critical thinking skills that are essential for a career in scientific research. I now have a significantly enhanced comprehension of scientific literature, and I feel like I have developed a stronger ability to pick apart scientific papers for purposes of assessing the validity of conclusions such papers might assert.",
    "This course contributed to my future research because it allowed me to expand my knowledge on how scientific problems are approached, and I was also able to learn methodological techniques I could now apply to my own research.",
    "It helped to deepen my understanding by not simply presenting the experiments and the results but by actually allowing us to look at the paper ourselves and allowing us to see if we were able to come to the same conclusions by looking at the data presented. I do not think it will directly help my thesis research, but learning how to think like a scientist will absolutely be helpful.",
    "This was an invaluable course in my understanding of the material and logic of experiments.",
    "I sort of answered this in Question 4, but this course greatly contributed to the completion of my dissertation\/research, and I'm sure I will look back on it as one of the most important classes I took.",
    "I hope I have gained skills that will help me in my graduate studies to analyze primary literature to critically assess methodologies and results, as well as understand whether the results allow to make certain conclusions.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my discipline by this course taught the different and clever tricks when trying to answer a research question that a scientist poses.",
    "This is the only class where I was forced to read and critically analyze papers that did not directly apply to my research. I think learning this skill is essential to knowledge of a discipline outside my narrow research focus. I probably would not survive graduate school without this course."
