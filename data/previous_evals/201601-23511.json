    "I spent about 5 hours on average per week for this class.",
    "Hours per week were quite variable for the class. It depends on if you have to take point on a class discussion, how responsible you are with your book report, and how dense\/long selected readings are for the week. I didn't keep a clock with me, but maybe a range of 4-8 sounds reasonable due to variability.",

   "comments": [
    "Strength: Discussions and professor's guiding questions and insights into this complex topic! Weaknesses: Few, other than having the final paper due during finals week. Recommendations: Knowing that we ended up cutting short many of the discussions at the end of each class, perhaps a shorter lecture in the beginning of class and then focusing on 3 papers per week (~30 minutes per paper) to really push students to reach each one in depth before class and to then really analyze the methods. Then at the end, perhaps a short 10 minute summary of the lecture and future directions.",
    "I like the seminar-style where the class reads a selection of articles and discusses them as a group. The small class size allowed for this to work well, and it was a very comfortable environment to have some personal discussions. Book club was great and I definitely recommend keeping that aspect of the class.",
    "This class was so great! I liked the discussion-based seminar setting. With such a small class size (we had 6 this year), we were able to really get to know and learn from each other. Because of its small size, this class requires that all students read the weekly readings. This makes discussion more enjoyable and awkward silences at a minimum. Strengths: small class setting, interesting readings, great discussion, ability to learn without grades looming over your head Weaknesses: readings are sometimes too dense",
    "I thought this class was excellent. The small class size catered to insightful class discussions.",
    "The course is very intimate, which was a really big plus in my book. When there's less than 10 other people in class it really forces you to stay on top of readings and the topic in order to contribute well to the course. It provides a thoughtful and in-depth look at health disparities and their relationship to race through empirical data and literature, which was a refreshing and needed component to the YSPH curriculum. My only concern was the variability in which readings became available (which in and of itself was because they were made to be as current as possible), making it harder to plan out a reading schedule with additional responsibilities. Overall, one of the best courses I've taken at this school.",
    "A very well-organized, informative course! A nice break from other math heavy courses."

    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Insightful comments, constructive commentary on written and presented work, really expanded the way I understand this issue!",

    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0I absolutely love Beth Jones! She is so incredibly intelligent and passionate about her work and it comes through in her lectures. She also does not force students to speak up so this allows us to slowly get out of our comfort zone and contribute to discussion. Her teaching style is laid-back and accommodating but also very invested in her students.",

    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Beth Jones is an amazing professor. She is very thoughtful, honest, and respectful of student concerns, insight, and personal experiences. Although I know criticism is constructive and helps for improvement, I can't easily say what would have made her teaching any better.",
    "Instructor: Beth Jones \u00a0Dr. Jones was an excellent instructor. She always prepared interesting readings, and there was a good flow of topics."

    "I would recommend this class if you are looking for a chance to have meaningful discussions on an important topic in public health.",
    "If you're interested in learning about how health disparities manifest into chronic diseases, this is the class for you! You learn not only about the different data sources and limitations, you find out about the different cross-cutting determinants of health that are normally not considered. I thoroughly enjoyed the class!",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone hoping to gain additional insight into a health phenomenon that we see quite evidently in public health but don't talk about as frankly as we should. It is a CDE\/SBS style course, so buckle up for plenty of reading and epidemiology. If you're into that, you'll be into this.",
    "Would definitely recommend to any student"
