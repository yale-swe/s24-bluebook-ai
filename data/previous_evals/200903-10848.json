    "I think perhaps quizzes for readings would have made the class learned more about the discussion topics.Or, maybe a quiz or a list of questions can be drawn up for each week's readings. and students have to come to class to 1. turn in the problem set; and 2. discuss the problem set.",
    "Good Course",
    "Regarding 10:Interests are in marine systems; coastal ecosystems are thus somewhat relevant, but not quite directly so. If you're interested in coastal systems for their own sake, then this is the course for you.",
    "Question 1.I enjoyed and appreciated the use of journal articles, raw and processed data and real and near world examples to teach about coastal ecosystems. For example, it was much more engaging and instructive to consider all the possible culprits for eutrophication, examine each one individually and in different environments, and come up with conclusions as a class and as an individual, than to listen to a lecture.Valiela, the journal articles, the packets from different publications, all served to create a detailed and more complete picture, reinforce the ideas and concepts that we are currently sure of, and highlight the issues that we have not yet resolved regarding coastal ecosystems.Question 5, 7Prof. Anisfeld's socratic method was fantastic. He was open about what he didn't know and what he was not sure of. I felt he treated students as equals: we surely did not know as much as the professor about the subject matter, but we had the potential to solve problems and constructively build on the material.Prof. Anisfeld would always pause and take as much time as needed to address any student's question or comment. No matter how silly or complex or tangential the question, he would approach it as an important subject to consider, and he would consider and address the subject in earnest and to his full capacity. And that was great. The floor was open for questions at all times.Question 9The field trips were fantastic. Students were able to see and touch and smell and experience almost all of what was discussed in class. I wish there had been more field trips. If there had been field trips offered outside of scheduled class time, I would have participated. The people we met on our field trips were also very interesting and instructive, and just as open to our questions as Prof, Anisfeld. We met a variety of stakeholders: members of NGOs, practitioners, state and local officials. The field trips were a fantastic learning tool for both the natural science and the management aspects of the course."

    "The course is very well designed. I enjoyed the field trips, the invited lecturers, and Valiela's text book.",
    "Field trip is good to understand the topics in the class. One of good points is the synergy betwenn class and field trips.",
    "Professor Anisfeld's very apparent interest and great effort in helping students learn about coastal ecosystems.",
    "The class size of nine got all involved. Everybody participated and I would say we all understood the topic by the end of the class",
    "the teacher, the readings, the field trips, the lectures",
    "Field trips!Also, the dual focus of the course, while occasionally confusing, always helped to keep things interesting.",
    "The best thing about this course (obviously aside from the field trips and coffee breaks) was the teaching approach of the professor.",
    "Prof. Anisfeld is an extraordinary teacher. He is well prepared for each class and explains the sciences of coastal ecosystems with magnificent clarity.I truly enjoyed the field trips to different marsh ecosystems; as well as the class discussions regarding different perspectives on coastal ecosystems' issues."

   "question_text": "The things about this course most in need of improvement are:",
   "comments": [
    "The course material is very lengthy and there are several scientific concepts. With this in mind, the students will be strong in some topics and relatively weak in others. Considering that the exams are 50% of the grade, they should be carefully designed to cover the wide array of topics. Although the Professor paid attention to this, I feel that this goal was not met. Thus, the exams could be improved by these options:- Ask more questions. Maybe shorter ones, but that cover more topics. When high-value or \"nested\" questions are asked, and they coincide with relatively weak concepts for the students, it is frustrating.- If the first option is not the best, let the students have their summaries or brief notes during the exam. I respect the style of closed book exams, and also would be unpractical to have a pile of articles and books to browse during the exam. However, allowing some notes would encourage students to make good summaries, especially of the concepts that need to improve.- In the final exam I was expecting questions that could summarize the most important concepts that we learned in the course. The applications in management, policy, etc. That was not the case. Although it was fair an even to ask about all the discussions led by students.",
    "I don't think the final captured the essence of the class. While it was fair and there were not any trick questions, some of the big picture items were not included (maybe becaue it was assumed we should know them) and questions on otherwise minor items where asked. Also, although I realize this is a graduate level science class, the amount of content on the chemical processes was too large a portion of the class.",
    "can't think of a thing",
    "Student discussions could be a bit more focused and standardised. It wasn't entirely clear just what the point of each discussion was (both as the leader, and the audience), and what we were supposed to be learning\/covering\/taking away from it.",
    "The course is entitled Coastal Ecosystems. It should be renamed to highlight the fact that the material covered predominantly examines coastal ecosystems found in particular temperate zones: wetlands like tidal and estuarine marshes. There was very little talk about mangroves, coral reefs, or sea grass beds. I don't know anything about coastal ecosystems that occur in polar and sub polar regions. I can't remember if we talked about the Everglades or not.It would be impossible to incorporate more types of ecosystems to this course without compromising the depth and breath of material and time on each particular ecosystem, or lengthening the course to a full year. The design and structure of the course is fantastic. But the course's title should be modified to reflect the predominant focus of the course. Perhaps Coastal Ecosystems of the Temperate Zones, Temperate Wetlands...",
    "Since the class is divided into estuarine components and marsh components, sometimes it was hard to jump from one subject to the other in the same class.I recommend complementing the midterm and final exams with additional problem sets or out-of-class assignments so that the percentage of values of the exams within the course grade is reduced.Prof. Anisfeld mentioned that in previous years, there was only a final exam in the course. I recommend maintaining the midterm exam in future courses."

    "Although I have and interest in water resources related issues, this is not a direct fit with my focal area. I originally took the course because I need to fill the \"2\" bin in the MEM requirement and I hheard some positive feedback on the instructure. Looking back, it was a good decision.",
    "I'm interested in marine conservation biology, especially open-ocean and tropical. There are, of course, strong linkages between coastal and marine ecosystems, so that's where this course came in.I'd have preferred if it covered mangroves as well, since they're a bit like the tropical equivalent of salt marshes (and hence relevant to the tropical marine systems I'm interested in), but their absence was understandable.",
    "I have previously concentrated on coral reef ecosystem biology and management. This course was perfect for me, because I explored ecosystems that I previously had no familiarity with. I would like to specialize in coastal ecosystem management in general: I have not yet decided on a more specific area of concentration.",
    "This course focuses on an area of study that has been on my professional interest during the past 10 years. It is an excellent component for those that want more science and issue knowledge in the management of coastal ecosystems."
