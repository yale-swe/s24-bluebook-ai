   "comments": [
    "Yes! There are a lot of long medieval texts to read though so just know that.",
    "Jonathan Cayer is great! He's personable, funny, and relaxed. He assigns a fair amount of reading, but doesn't expect you to remember the details (cf. Rabelais). He likes creative assignments as well as academic ones -- his reading responses are a chance to express your true, weird, complicated feelings about the works. The final research paper was tough (but also an opportunity to explore tangents and unanswered questions).And obviously -- don't take a French seminar if you're not willing to do the reading and say a few things in class. The intellectual reward depends on the personal investment.",
    "Premodern Travels is a great class for a survey of medieval and premodern works touching on travel, voyages, and exploration. The syllabus is well crafted and the work load is manageable as well as interesting. Cayer is a fantastic teacher who is adept at maintaining class discussion and leading the class to agreement. I definitely recommend the course for anyone interested in French lit or travel.",
    "yes! this class is so different from other french classes! it's slightly hard but it's so worth it!",
    "Yes, take the course. Professor Cayer makes medieval literature comprehensible and is an all-around great professor. Classes are consistently upbeat, the readings are manageable, and Professor Cayer offers frequent opportunities for evaluation.",
    "Yes. It can seem a bit of a dull class at times but it's worth it if you put in the effort. For anyone who's taken DS, its a bit like reading the classics of the Western canon but the French, christian version of the Greek epics. For some of the texts you read, you really have to take the time to dig into them, but the gems you find can surprise you. Also, its great practice to have to read medieval French- you'll be able to breeze through modern French readings after.",
    "It was an extremely interesting class, and Professor Cayer was great at keeping a good balance between in-class discussion and close reading of the texts. The syllabus includes mostly works that are not necessarily considered 'classics' of French literature, but which are crucial for understanding pre-modern, and especially medieval, mentality. As he would normally say, the books were basically all 'best-sellers' of their time, and it was very helpful to read them for this class. I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in French intellectual history and wants to keep up with your French in academic context."
