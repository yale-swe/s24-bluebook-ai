    "Introductory Quantum Mechanics (QM) - you will learn a lot of QM and even some MM (molecular mechanics), increase your intellectual capacity, but also be super-stressed out from the poor course design. You will understand why the teaching instructors emphasize standards and expectations. You will have to create them for yourself to say the least.",
    "Chem 570 will be a struggle. Just try to hang on. Don't stress too much if you are lost, you will not be alone.",
    "Great lecture to study quantum chemistry.",
    "Yes I would recommend",
    "Yes, I highly recommended the course, because one can develop a thorough understanding of quantum theory though this course.",
    "I believe this course is a great introduction to quantum mechanics. I highly suggest having some quantum background before taking this course."

   "comments": [
    "Quantum mechanics, abstract notions and derivations do not seem unapproachable anymore as the instructor desired. Electronic structure theory does not seem intimidating anymore and I look forward to using it in my research.",
    "It has helped me develop my knowledge substantially",
    "It is indispensable for pchem students because it does not directly rush into experiments. This is very important.",
    "I believe this course will help in future research applications. Professor Batista goes far in-depth into practical applications of quantum mechanics in chemistry."
