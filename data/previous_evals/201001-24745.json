    "The course is thematic in the sense that each class builds on a little bit of previous knowledge but also presents new information from sand mandalas to mount meru. Each class covers a new topic. I didn't know anything about it but doing the reading and participating in the seminar really helps.",
    "interesting introduction to Buddhist theory and mandalas. Take it if you have a strong interest in the theoretical material, because the art history element is lacking. really fun though. I enjoyed it greatly.",
    "Take it.",
    "Interesting, especially to students studying the arts. I would recommend this class to other students because I feel it is a unique examination of visual culture."
