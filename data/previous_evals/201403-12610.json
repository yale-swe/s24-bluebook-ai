   "comments": [
    "This class is purely based on class discussion. Every week there are 2-3 papers assigned. These papers need to be read in great detail, especially the methods and materials. Two students lead the discussion every week and Rosenbaum adds stuff when he wants. He likes picking on people, so you must be prepared all the time. Overall, it takes a bit to get used to the class format and Rosenbaum.",
    "This class is amazing! This course has been my favorite class at Yale. If you have the opportunity to get into this course, I would absolutely 100% recommend it. Each week you are assigned a paper or two to read and you will discuss it for two hours during class (our class was Tuesday 7-9 PM). You need to thoroughly read the papers and understand the techniques, so reading might take 4-6 hours depending on your familiarity with the topic. You have to lead the discussion once or twice during the semester, which is a bit of extra work since you have to prepare a powerpoint presentation (but you lead with one other person). Professor Rosenbaum is an awesome teacher with a great personality. While this is a purely discussion course, Professor Rosenbaum sometimes breaks into mini-lectures (~10 minutes) to really explain the importance of a certain technique at the time or the richness of the research. The people are what really makes this course great. While I only knew one other person prior to the class, we all became friends during the class. The only person I wouldn't recommend this course for is someone who doesn't like to talk in small\/large groups. This class is pure discussion and it attracts people who are quick to speak their mind.",
    "An excellent course for those who have a solid molecular biology background and want to dig deeper into the papers that have built this formidable field. Definitely take it if you are able.",
    "A must! If you can, take it! Put everything else aside. Prof. Rosenbaum is a true gem. He is the most attentive teacher you will ever find, and he has great stories to tell about Yale and his time at other research institutions. The class meets on Tuesday evenings for 2 hours (sometimes a bit longer) from 7-9 in KBT. You discuss \"landmark papers,\" that is, papers that either described a major discovery or provided the groundwork for one, often in relation to a Nobel Prize. The topics range from cell signalling to vesicle fusion, and everything in between. It is a very relaxed class in the sense that all you have to do is read 1-3 papers a week, and discuss them in class without having to do any writing or anything. However, Prof. Rosenbaum is very demanding and you must come prepared. Do not let that put you off, as you will learn a tremendous amount in the process.",
    "It's a great class for those wanting to improve their paper reading skills and interested in learning about some good fundamental science.",
    "There's ups and downs to this class. When prof Rosenbaum is in a good mood, the class goes well, you learn a lot. If he's not, prepare for an awkward and arduous class. You need to prepare a lot for the class, and your entire grade is based on participation. However, prof Rosenbaum is one that commands respect, whos been in the game for a while so he knows quite many of the authors you discuss. It's a good class if you have tough skin, and are sick of tests. You learn how to read and analyze research papers better than any other class. It's worth it if you can get in and you like his teaching style. Not for the weak-willed.",
    "If you're an MCDB major, you NEED to take this class! It is perfect for seniors. It is at night (7-9pm), so doesn't interfere with lab work, is super productive in teaching you about methodology in cell bio and how to critically read scientific papers, and THERE IS NO WRITING AT ALL. You will learn so much, get to know new people in your major, and have way more fun than stress. BTW the course is open only to seniors (in MCDB and MBB) and admission is by prior coursework. You have to have taken cell bio, maybe a couple others, and the more you've taken the better. But you've taken a lot by now, so I think everyone who wanted to take it and had taken the basic prerequisites for the major got in."
