    "I would recommend a student to take the class if you want to gain a better perspective on images and how gender is constructed. I would not recommend taking this to write your senior thesis in unless you have a really strong background in writing journal articles or research methods.",
    "yes, i would definitely recommend the class. the work is described vaguely, so it often feels like a shot in the dark where you have no idea what is expected or how to do well, but the class itself is really fun and the discussions are great. the teacher is nice but not very specific about expectations. it is also not just generalities about gender but rather very specific facts presented in a seemingly unbiased way.",
    "No.",
    "Psychology 414 really allows students to focus on the visual aspect of gender portrayal across many different forms of media. I would recommend this class to those interested in gender psychology, but not very strongly to those who are not. The information is so specifically aimed that while the manner of examination would be interesting, the subjects likely would not.",
