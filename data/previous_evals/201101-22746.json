    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale (and I'm a senior). You will be so frustrated at times and you will have to put in a TON of work and hours, but it is so worth it in the end. I think I've learned more in this class than in any other class at Yale. I have a new skill and interest that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. So worth it! If you can, take it with Ben--he's helpful, funny, accessible, and you'll learn a ton from him. Take it credit\/D if you're not sure whether you can put in all the hours (at least 10 per week).",
    "Certainly would recommend it. B+W is essential to progress as a photographer, but I think it's also essential in acquiring a complete art education. If not an art major, certainly a great way to step out of the classroom and become hands on in the development of your creativity. Certainly not a class you can expect to slack in--lots of work, but well worth it, especially w\/Ben.",
    "Intro B&W Film Photography is a comprehensive introduction to the technical aspects of B&W film photography (including camera operation and the darkroom) and is also a light introduction to the history and themes of B&W film photography (with some other photography thrown in there as well). If you're at all interested in a photography, even in this modern day, it's an absolutely necessary class to take, to place yourself within the historical context. The class is also a lot of FUN (but be warned: time consuming!). I'd definitely recommend it for all art majors, and for anyone interested in photography (not necessarily for students just wanting to take a \"fun\" class).",
    "It is a great class, but make sure you have a lot of time to devote to the class. It is also a very expensive course, especially if you don't already have a camera. (I spent a minimum of 300 dollars on supplies and I already had a camera)",
    "This is a great course, one that will challenge you yet still be really fun. That said, it's a lot of work. You can't cram for this class the night before the critique. But if you are genuinely interested in art photography, and willing to put in the thought and effort required, this class will be exciting and incredibly fulfilling. I found myself caring about the photographs I made for this class far more than any essay I've written at Yale. It was nice to be doing work that I was truly invested in.",
    "Yes. Take it, it's completely worth it.",
    "A class that takes hard-work and a keen artistic eye. You can't be afraid to go out on a limb or to follow an idea the entire way up or the entire way down."
