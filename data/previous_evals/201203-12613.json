    "American Studies 318 \/ HIST415J was AWESOME. Hands-down my favorite class of the semester; definitely one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far! I was always excited to do the readings and short assignments; and I'm really enjoying writing my final paper. Professor Meyerowitz was AWESOME! Her mini-lectures at the beginning of seminar were great; she led discussions really well. Grading was super fair. She also came across as very accessible, which is important. The class basically covers the history of development, which is critically important stuff. However, the class does move from one big, sweeping model of development to the next - which I think accurately reflects the history being studied, but ultimately is really frustrating. This class definitely made me more skeptical of development, but in an important way. This class was a fantastic experience, and I seriously think that EVERYONE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in aid and global poverty, and in my opinion, this is a must-take for students in the Global Affairs development track. As far as I'm concerned, this class teaches more about the issues and subtleties of poverty and development - or even interactions between poor states and rich states, poor people and rich people - than the entire Global Affairs core curriculum does.",
    "This course does an excellent job of making anti-poverty efforts of the last fifty years clear and interesting. Every Global Affairs major should take this course as should ANYONE interested in anti-poverty efforts. Don't be scared away by the little weekly assignments - they didn't take very long and a few helped me with my final paper. Meyerowitz handled an overcrowded seminar well and presents very interesting readings.",
    "If you're looking at this- yes. The class is well taught. The readings are interesting. Relatively low workload of two 4 page papers and one 15 page paper, as well as small weekly research assignments that help with the research paper. You'll learn quite a lot about poverty alleviation movements. However, it does appeal to similar types of the people, so the discussions tend to be a lot of agreement, but Professor Meyerowitz does a great job of leading the discussions. At the end of the semester, we also went through and critiqued every item in the class and whether to keep it- Professor Meyerowitz really cares about making this a great class.",
    "TAKE IT.",
    "yes, you need to take this class. it taught me many lessons that i will keep close to my heart when i (hopefully) go on to do development-related work.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this seminar or any other course offered by Professor Meyerowitz - she is fantastic!"
