    "Honestly this is a kind of crazy class, with very little structure. But I got to explore a lot of different kinds of journalistic writing, and get to know a really cool professor. Don't take this if you want an intense training in journalism, but do take it if you want to try the medium out and hear valuable insights from a nytimes journalist",
    "This was overall a good course in journalistic writing. There are weekly writing assignments that are well chosen and fun to complete. These include a profile of a local figure, a piece on a foreign culture, a story about a neighborhood, and a personal essay. There are also readings of well-crafted pieces and books on writing, many of which I did not do, and I felt liked I missed out on a big part of the course because of this. Lectures sometimes felt unfocused, and discussions and workshopping of pieces sometimes could have been more rigorous. Patti is really nice, but sometimes I felt like she could have taken a stronger role as leader of the class."
