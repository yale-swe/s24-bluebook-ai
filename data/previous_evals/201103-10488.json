    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else. It gives you a great survey of Joyce's major hits while providing historical context and criticism. Class focuses mostly on close readings, which I found exteremely helpful, both in order to get a sense of Joyce's working method and to really look at the nuts and bolts of the text. In Joyce almost everything is in some way about language, so close reading works really well. And if you haven't had a chance to read Ulysses you better take this. For the love of god.",
