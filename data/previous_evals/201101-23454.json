   "comments": [
    "This class, although useful, was an excessive amount of work, especially since most of the students were second years who also had to write a thesis. It was like expecting SBS students to take a capstone and do a thesis, which is required in no other track. In order to minimize work load, class should be once per week with another scheduled meeting time for groups. I did not learn enough in class to make it worth going to twice a week.",
    "It's a great alternative to all of the research-based courses Yale offers. It help students build real skills to apply to the practice of public health. There is a huge disconnect between research and practice and this begins to bridge that gap. I also really liked the laid-back feel of the class time - it was more of a conversation among everyone than sitting and listening to a lecture.The biggest weakness is that it is very unlikely any of the projects will actually be implemented. At times it is frustrating to have to spend so much time on details (e.g. the exact room in a building that the intervention will take place), rather than on the big picture. But it does force you to consider every aspect of a true intervention, as minute as some of these details may seem.",
    "Very good. If you can, and have the knowledge and work ethic, do the project alone. Best experience I could have asked for.",
    "Very practical skills to learn. Difficult to work in a group when people have such different schedules. Would have liked a little more personal guidance for the project",
    "Wish we would have discussed more interventions in class (looking at papers)",
    "Unbelievably hard, but worthwhile. The course was valuable in that I would be able to balance myself between analyzing and reviewing public health literature and applying the knowledge gained into the real world as a public health professional.",
    "The class was ok, although it felt very hollow to create an intervention that will most likely not be implemented. The end result was not satisfying, and felt like a waste of paper, time, and energy.",
    "This class was highly applicable to what I hope to do in the future and thus it was a great experience to truly create an intervention. The project also provided a valuable opportunity to engage in group work as well as work on presentation skills.While the project was the class's biggest strength, I wish we had had a smaller, more interactive class. I believe some of the lectures could have been delivered more efficiently with more time devoted to group discussion. Perhaps we could have broken up into our groups to discuss the material at hand more in depth. I also feel like we completely stopped discussing the assigned articles in class. It could have been helpful to analyze successful and unsuccessful interventions (although we did this a bit in terms of recruitment materials, logos, etc., it would have been helpful to look at whole interventions from the design stage). I also was hoping to learn a bit more about funding sources for chronic disease interventions.",
    "This course is not for the weak-hearted! I really loved the practical nature of this course. So many of the courses at YSPH are wrapped up in theory and pure research and it is great to get to apply those principles in a real-world setting. This course is A LOT of work. Just be prepared to give your life over to your intervention manual for the semester.",
    "The amount of work required for this class is way more than what's appropriate for a one-credit class. It taught me some practical skills, which I appreciate, but the balance of minutiae to big picture work was way out of whack -- I spent hours and hours agonizing over highly detailed things like consent forms. Is there any way to make the workload more manageable?",
    "Great way to get us thinking about program design and implementation. I really liked the flexibility to choose our own project topics.",
    "This is one of my favorite courses so far. Classtime is interesting and applicable and the work is practical. I will certainly discuss this class in future job interviews and did mention it in internship interviews. Having developed an intervention from scratch is incredibly relevant to many public health positions.",
    "Where to begin. This class was the hardest and best class I have taken at EPH. I laughed, I cried, I sweat, I bled. (well...not quite. But you get the point.) Producing 150 pages of anything is difficult in and of itself. Producing 150 pages of a thoughtful, useful, evidence-based, practical, culturally-sensitive manual for an intervention that you plan to hand to someone working directly in the field is much more difficult. I got the sense that the instructor really cared about each of our manuals and carefully considered them from many different angles. This was class's focus on practical skill-building was extremely useful, and I am sad that there are not more classes like this at EPH. (although I'm aware of the community program planning course and its similarities.)All that being said, I am very glad that I was not one of the poor souls trying to write a thesis at the same time as this class. I think that would be very difficult. Maybe a suggestion would be to somehow encourage people to streamline this class with thesis directions? For example, encouraging 1st year students who are taking the class to consider working on something related to what they would liketo do their thesis on. It just seems like a LOT of work for something that isn't really going to relate to any usable product in \"real life.\" But, I'm still very glad I took this class. Trace is an absolutely wonderful instructor.",
    "this course should be a req for all public health students. it is vital to understanding public health fieldwork.the course itself would have been more engaging if the readings were required and discussed during class. Further, case studies would be a good introduction to each day's topics-- this way we're not bored by our own project subjects, but also learning things from past PH intervention attempts.otherwise, great course. probably will be one of the most memorable, enriching experiences I will walk away with from this program.",
    "Teaches practical skills. Tangible.",
    "This class is very useful in thinking through the steps necessary to complete a public health intervention from beginning to end. However, it does not acknowledge that the exercise is ultimately not a realistic process, as no health intervention would be formed without input and guidance from other health and\/or psychological professionals, as well as many other stakeholders. Perhaps designing an intervention in partnership with with non profit or other organizations looking for interventions designed to address a particular issue would provide more real-world experience, instead of a hypothetical exercise.",
    "This course was very practical and useful for the SBS division, however, it was a lot of work. I liked the group aspect of the course because the workload is too great for most to take on on their own. I thought the act of developing an intervention opened my eyes to the 'real world' work of a researcher\/interventionist, and provided invaluable experience of how to interact with community stake holders and real, important, public health issues."

   "question_text": "Please evaluate the instructor of this course. What are the instructor's strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might his or her teaching be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Good teacher and enthusiastic, but this doesn't come off in class. He was also very demanding in terms of his expectations and did not seem to understand this was not the only class we had.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Strengths:- Trace really knows what he is talking about- He doesn't stand up and lecture, but makes it more of a casual discussion.- Constructive criticism - doesn't coddle you or tear you to shreds, has found a happy medium.Weakness: It would be helpful to use different types of interventions as examples of how to develop the various interventions components, e.g. choosing one's determinants. Condom use was commonly used, but there are all types of health outcomes and it would be nice to be able to hear about some of those too - I think it helps people learn and understand the concepts better. This is especially true for the first few weeks of class, when our own projects are still in their infancy.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0great. seems to really care about the projects and very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Professor was ok, but I would have appreciated more discussion surrounding his own intervention work and how he was able to chose a theory\/process for his work. At times class seemed repetitive and circular conversations without a lot of benefit.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was very knowledgeable instructor; however, I wished some of the lectures had been delivered more efficiently. Class discussions were better after we were not allowed to use computers; however, I believe this problem could have been circumvented from day one by going through the material more quickly and perhaps by making participation a greater portion of our grade.I really appreciated his meticulous attention to detail when reviewing our interventions.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a great instructor. He incorporates a lot of participation in class and works at applying the specific principles taught in the course to the projects we created. With a class highly based on participation, it is likely that there will be awkward silences when no one answers, but Trace just waits patiently while other teachers may just but in with a response which in fact stifles future participation. Trace is a hard grader but he does give very good feedback on the sections of the intervention manual and he does make you think about things in a way you hadn't thought about them before.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0One-on-one, Trace is fabulous: he gives detailed, thorough, prompt feedback. His lecturing style, on the other hand, could be improved. He speaks as if he couldn't care less about the topic. He rolls his eyes, has a completely flat affect, and doesn't try to make the lecture engaging. It was painful to sit through this class twice a week.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Great! Made the class very interesting and kept students engaged.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is open, honest, and interesting. His lectures were relevant and laden with essential information. Feedback for assignments was detailed and thorough. A recommendation may be to meet with every group to discuss feedback. All in all, one of my favorites courses and favorite instructors.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is one of my top 3 favorite professors at Yale. Practically-minded, experienced, laid-back, extremely smart, invested in students, demands excellent work from his students. All of the things a professor at Yale should be.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0instructor has a laissez-faire manner of teaching which fosters a good classroom atmosphere. the tradeoff to this, of course, is a less serious attitude from students towards the subject matter. perhaps if the instructor could mix his own personal passion for PH into the open environment, then students would be even more encouraged to take the subject matter more seriously.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Seemed a little bored while lecturing. Made it hard to really pay attention.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is knowledgeable and very accessible to students. Lectures provided a good starting point for each part of the intervention, and he also gave helpful feedback",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Dr. Kershaw works hard in the classroom to foster a discussion-based atmosphere, and the class was more relaxed and enjoyable as a result. He was always willing to offer advice and made himself available when necessary."

    "Designing a health promotion from beginning to end, with all the work you would have to do were you in the real world. It's not a conceptual thing or a huge grant proposal, it's actually a step by step process of developing, implementing and evaluating a program in a targeted population.Yes, would absolutely recommend it. So different from other Yale courses, and is one that I envision drawing on a lot in my public health career.",
    "Learn how to plan and organize a health intervention. will create a detailed manual as a final project",
    "This course is not what it appears to be on paper. If you want a hands on course with an end result, I would recommend the community planning course. If you would like a class that is more abstract coursework thenthis is a class for you.",
    "This course is primarily composed of designing an intervention from the ground up. I would recommend it to anyone who believes they might work on or are interested in designing interventions.",
    "I really do think this is an excellent course, but if you don't have to take the course (basically if you are not in SBS), I don't know if I would recommend it because it is so much work. The skills and tools acquired are very useful but you should know what you are getting into when you take this course.",
    "This class is a LOT of work, and only about 20% of it will teach you important skills. The minutiae will drive you crazy. Make sure to pick your group carefully because you will be spending a lot of time working with them throughout the semester.",
    "Lots of work on our program manuals but well worth the final product in the end.",
    "Even if you are not an SBS student this is the closest you get to practicum or real-life skill-building. I would recommened this course to anyone. But go in knowing that you should choose your group wisely and be prepared to meet often. Fantastic course!",
    "If I could give one piece of advice, it would be to choose your group-members carefully. They should ideally be people you have worked with before. This manual is a LOT of work to have to split with someone who won't split the workload evenly. Also, I think it is a lot better to have larger groups, with 4 being the best. You'll just end up with a better manual with more people contributing.",
    "the heart of public health planning",
    "Great class to take if you have a particular intervention and stakeholders in mind already that you'd like to learn how to plan in detail and come away with a ready-to-implement final project.",
    "This course is required for all SBS students, and I would warn anyone that it is a lot of work. Pick a topic you are highly interested in because by the end that is going to be your only saving grace! I would also recommend that students try to think of something that could really be implemented, because after writing a 150 page manual, it would be nice to see all that work go into action."
