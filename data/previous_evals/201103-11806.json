   "comments": [
    "Syntax is awesome! It is not too much work and Raffaella is the kindest professor! Class is really enjoyable, especially all of the ridiculous sentences that you get to diagram! Raffaella is great at answering questions and making sure that everyone understands what is going on before continuing in her lecture! The problem sets aren't bad -- GO TO OFFICE HOURS! The personal help is what really made me understand the psets. Also, the midterm and final are not bad, especially if you ask for help where you are confused. Great course!",
    "The first part of the course may seem very familiar if you've taken Intro to Linguistics, but the later part (roughly half) will definitely cover some new topics. It's less of a lecture course than you might expect (since the class is roughly 30 people) and there's usually discussion about the topics as they're covered. Manageable workload and good class for anyone interested in linguistics.",
    "Most of the psets were fairly straightforward, though some did require abstract\/creative thinking in proposing solutions to problems in different languages. It's not the most fascinating topic if you're not into diagramming sentences and figuring out the technical rules governing their grammaticality. Overall, its exactly what you'd expect from a Syntax class.",
    "Introduction to syntax, required course for linguistics majors... but even if you're not a major, this would be a very interesting So credit. Prof. Zanuttini teaches it really well!",
    "A fine introduction to the major principles of Syntax. The concepts are not all too difficult to understand, and much of the work is very interesting.",
    "This class is required if you want to be a major. It's a good class to take if you're deciding whether you want to be a major; it begins by briefly introducing some of the history and ideology of contemporary linguistics, it gives you a good dose of both the theoretical exploration and the methodological rigor of the field, and it allows you to make friends with Professor Zanuttini, who was DUS my year and who is very sweet and easy to engage. Syntax, with its endless trees and theoretical mechanisms, might not be everybody's cup of tea. The professor keeps the lectures more or less interesting by being very open to students who want to test a certain theory with examples; she's also not shy about admitting when aspects of the relatively new field of generative syntax are a bit wonky. This makes a potentially daunting subject seem homey, if not always exciting.",
    "LING 153 is an introduction to twentieth-century theories of syntax (how words combine to make phrases and sentences). Although the class is nominally about deep syntax, it actually really only discusses English and Romance languages, because these are Raffaella's interests. If you take this class because you want a better understanding of world linguistic diversity outside of Europe, you will be disappointed. (However, if that's your interest, you're probably already a ling major and have to take this.)This class is required for the linguistics major and is a prereq for most upper level linguistics classes. If you're majoring or thinking of majoring in linguistics, you should take it ASAP. There were also many cognitive science majors and natural science\/math majors in the class. I imagine that if you are a natural science major looking for an SO, this is probably one of the better classes to take - it is small and well-taught, the subject is empirical, and the problem sets are lots of fun.",
    "Yes, a good class if you're interested in linguistics. Medium difficulty.",
    "Very technical, but I found it interesting. Professor is friendly and nice, and she keeps it feeling as interesting as sentence diagrams can.",
    "If you think you want to, go for it! The subject matter isn't for everyone, but Raffaella is lovely and a great professor.",
    "Really interesting class. Gives you a good overview of Syntax. You learn a lot about English and about language in general. Professor Zanuttini is very smart, good-humored, and available to help students. There is lots of joking and laughing in class -- I always looked forward to going. Highly recommended for anyone, regardless of interests.",
    "Take this class! However, do not be misled by the first few weeks; the majority of the material is much theoretical (not a bad thing) than the first few weeks (which are also interesting). Expect to do a lot of thinking. This class isn't just about plugging in formulae.",
    "I thought it's really nice course if you're interested in understanding the structure behind languages. You'd learn more about the grammar and syntax that you use so naturally and effortlessly but without really being aware of it. Pretty eye-opening course.",
    "This is a good course if you want to learn about syntax, and especially if you want to solve syntactic \"puzzles\" across different languages. The work consists of weekly problem sets (which are sometimes challenging, but not impossible) and two 24 hour take-home exams (one midterm and one final)."
