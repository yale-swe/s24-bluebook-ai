    "Directed Studies Lit is an overview of the Western Canon of literature from Homer through the 20th century. Reading all of these classics in two semesters is a lot of work, but well worth it when it comes to having a good background in literature. It will set you up well for anything else you choose to do at Yale.",
    "It's DS, so you probably know the deal. Loney is a great professor. He knows literally everything about Homer, and he is also able to engage with original Greek texts in interesting ways. My advice is to take the class, even if it's at 9 AM.",
    "An amazing experience. Do it!",
    "Directed Studies is a wonderful, wonderful program! I absolutely recommend it to everyone. DS is a unique opportunity to see how all of these texts build off one another, not only in literature but across the three disciplines. I would say, however, that the books made this class great, not Professor Loney.",
    "This class is fast-paced due to the number of works on the syllabus. Such speed and breadth, however, does not really take away from the depth of analysis you can make with the texts if you are willing to put in the effort both inside and outside of class. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who thinks they are ready to commit themselves to engaging with ancient literature. If ancient literature is stimulating for you, this course will be fulfilling in lecture, as the professors are all very good, in section, as discussion helps to deepen your understanding or analysis of the text, and in individual writing assignments, as they offer you a chance to explore what interests, frustrates, or confuses you.",
    "I would recommend it. It's a lot of work, but you come out of it feeling amazingly well-read.",
    "Directed Studies is fantastic. If you like reading great books--the kind of person who loves the feeling of reading famous books--then DS is perfect for you. Even if not, I think the education is not to be missed. While 1st semester may not be as appealing and 2nd semester DS, it is still a rich academic experience. Take DS. However, if you have Loney, I'd suggest switching to another professor. He isn't bad per se; he just doesn't really do much. Class is entirely run by the students, and his essay comments are pretty sparse. Still, the lectures can definitely make up for what you might lack in class.",
    "Some of my friends took theEpics course during the fall semester, and they said that it provided a comprehensive look into many of the same texts that we read in DS Literature. However, I learned a lot from some of the lectures, and the academic caliber of my peers was truly excellent. However, I would not have taken this course if I did not have to take it as part of the Directed Studies program because I would have preferred to have a deeper study of certain texts, such as the Bible and the Divine Comedy.",
    "I would recommend DS Lit to a student who is prepared to do a lot of reading and can understand texts on their own. It can be hard to grapple with large, challenging texts like these.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. It is the perfect course to I familiarize oneself with the western canon."
