    "Fantastic class, fantastic TA, fantastic (if not a bit abstract at times) material.",
    "I took this class the first time it was ever offered. The fact that it was cross listed with the medical school made it interesting because you get to interact with medical school students. Although I really enjoyed listening to the med school students talk, it was really difficult for undergraduates to really participate in the discussions because the knowledge gap between med and undergraduate students was often too large. The information wasn't as enlightening as I'd hoped, and by the end of the course, it kind of feels like you're just discussing a lot of unrelated topics at a really shallow level. If you're expecting something rigorous or wanting to take a class where you leave at the end of the semester feeling like you've learned a lot, I would not recommend this class. Stephen Stearns is definitely a character and sometimes has arbitrary standards in terms of grading, but he's an interesting professor.",
    "Fantastic science seminar with a terrific professor and an interesting format. Highly recommend it. While it seems like a good idea at first, the 7pm thing got old very quickly, so keep that in mind. Also, the quizzes do take a while, but it's so much better than having midterms\/a final. Term paper wasn't too bad when you find the right topic. All in all, if you get in, you should definitely take it.",
    "Absolutely take this course! It was incredibly satisfying, with an overall focus on intellectual stimulation rather than regurgitation (much unlike most other biology classes I've taken in my Yale career). Evolutionary medicine as a field is itself fascinating, and Professor Stearns will awe you with both his immense knowledge of the field, and his dedication to improving the student learning experience. As a fair warning, it comes with a fair bit of work (take-home quizzes and reading each week in lieu of a midterm\/final), but it's absolutely worth it. I also hadn't taken an EEB course before this one, which wasn't a major issue at all (though having prior EEB knowledge would certainly be helpful).",
    "Good class to take if you're interested in viewing medicine from a different angle or if you want a break from lecture-based science classes. The final paper is still a lot of work towards the end even though they try to pace it out throughout the semester, so be prepared for that.",
    "~1 hour of video lecture per week, 1-2 hours answering the quiz questions, and then a big 20-25 page paper which you work on throughout the semester. Class consists of talking about papers and lectures, all discussion. I recommend it if you like talking through big concepts, but if you're going to be afraid to talk, you're going to hate it."
