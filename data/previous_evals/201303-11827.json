   "comments": [
    "Take it! The structure of the course is a little similar to French 170 but professor Zhuo's approach to analyzing the works we read is really great (for instance, we got to look at the essays by some literary critics in order to compare their views with our own opinions).",
    "The readings are great and the in-class discussions can be as well (depends on the other students), but grading can be a bit confusing. I'd advise that you go talk to Mme Zhuo before each paper is due and make sure she understands what you are trying to argue. She has a very specific style that she is looking for.",
    "I would recommend French 200, not only because the material is very interesting, but also because it is very well taught. If the syllabus does not change in the future, the course starts with several short stories of Maupassant, then moves to Flaubert and Baudelaire, continues with Proust, and finishes with Sartre, Ponge and Duras. Most of the readings are relatively short, so you'll be able to read and enjoy the works of these authors without being too stressed or overwhelmed due to a lack of time. In terms of writing, the workload is completely acceptable: there are two 4-pag papers and a 6-pag final paper. Finally, Professor Zhuo is great! She is very sweet, and she is always willing to help her students. Definitely take this class.",
    "I think the course provides an excellent survey of important French authors from the 19th century onwards, and I would recommend the course to anyone with a basic interest in French literature."
