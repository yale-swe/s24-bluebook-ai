    "Money, Meaning and Morality is a good class, but not a great one. I took this seminar hoping to engage in interesting discussions about themes that intrigued me, but mostly we ended up talking about the readings. The readings aren't great, and listening to your fellow students present summaries of readings you did but didn't enjoy can like a huge waste of time. If the class structure changes, consider taking take it, because the material is pretty interesting and Professor Singh is very good. But as it was structured this year, I wouldn't recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. In a money-centric world, this will challenge many of your prior conceptions of the history and role of money.",
    "One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. The work load is really light, and everything discussed is interesting. The professor is easy going and understanding, and definitely tries to make the course work for everyone. The course raises important questions about money, the good life, and how we are related to all these big ideas... definitely important things to think about as Yale students before we head out to the real world. If it is still offered, take it!",
