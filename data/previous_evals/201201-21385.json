    "This isn't really a course that needs recommendation. If you are a non-senior and you are considering this course then you should think about what you want post-grad. During semester is much harder to get a good lab flavor and see if you like it then the summer is, and it is also hard to get started in semester without a summer first as there is so much to learn. However, if you know you want to be doing research you should be in this class. It is possible I would say to take six courses if research is one but only if your other activities are limited.",
    "This class is a great opportunity to do your own research but assessing it is impossible as everything depends on the professor you work with and your grad students. Both in my case were fantastic and had a great time with them - I learned a lot and I will continue the same research after the summer.",
    "Do you like working in labs?",
    "CHEM 490 is definitely one of those must-take courses. You learn so much about research and how to think independently in a way you don't in most other labs.",
    "I would recommend it to other chemistry students.",
    "If you're taking the course it's likely because you have to. Choose an adviser wisely or you'll end up miserable and angry",
    "Yes, definitely"
