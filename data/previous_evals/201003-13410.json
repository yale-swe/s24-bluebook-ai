    "This course is a good introduction to the field.",
    "sometimes confusing as to what was expected on assignments. Information challenging for a beginner with no knowledge of emergency response. NIMS certification great. Nice to take part in real VMOC. Enjoyed final project",
    "Very theoretical. Designed for leaders.",
    "Great class on disaster management. Lots of discussion and lots of material that is well taught. Expect a lot of projects and applying your knowledge.",
    "As a student in a professional school taking this course, I have a unique perspective of sorts in assessing this class as it is my first and only EPH experience. However, this class is absolutely perfect for ANYONE that has an interest in disaster management, particularly on the domestic side. There is enough of a focus on the nuts and bolts of FEMA, ICS, and other federal response systems that someone without a public health background isn't lost. Furthermore, its the only course I could find at the university that concentrates on these issues, and the only one that provides reasonable training for those students looking to concentrate in emergency management and operations.",
    "The course was an excellent introduction of practical introduction to the world of public health disaster preparedness and management. I was glad to see YSPH introducing the class this year. I found it the most useful in building practice knowledge to use in real world public health disaster situations.",
    "The course was a great overview of all of the necessary actions that must happen in a disaster situation. It is extremely helpful to hear 'real world' examples in the academic context to know how some of the principles we learned in class are applied in reality.",
    "Overall a good course.Strengths-Great instructorsWeakness-Course timings were not very feasible.(Thursday 3-5)"

Her weekly lecturer Joanne was very knowledgeable of real on the ground experience in a disaster and worked with us as a small group to help fine tune our practical public health applications.",
    "Instructor: Linda DeGutis \u00a0Joanne McGovern and Dr. Sandy Bogucki were extremely knowledgeable in their fields. Particularly, Lt. McGovern provided students with many real world examples that helped give students a real prospective on what really occurs in a disaster situation"

    "Good for career options. Would recommend this course if only for the FEMA courses.",
    "The class is a lot of work but definitely worth taking if you have an interest in disaster management. The instructors are extremely knowledgeable.",
    "The course was one of the most useful and practical classes for local and national public health jobs after graduate school. Working on Virtual Medical Operation Centers (VMOCs) for current world disasters such as Pakistan and Haiti were extremely useful in navigating the world and response to disasters.",
    "I would recommend this course to fellow student"
