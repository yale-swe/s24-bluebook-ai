    "Takes you through the basics of music. Even if you have no musical background, you should take this course.",
    "This is probably the easiest humanities credit at Yale if you have experience with music, but then again, if you know the basics of music already you should be taking 205. I imagine this course would be pretty tough if you don't already know the basics. It's a lot of material. I'm not sure if she'll be around next semester, but if you can, take it with Lynda. She's a fantastic instructor, and I wish the professors in my major were more like her. I was never tempted to skip this 9 am class because of her enthusiasm and great teaching.",
    "In this course, I learned an incredible amount about music. I had very little musical background coming into the class and am coming out knowing so much more and inspired to develop my piano skills. The instructor is wonderful and extremely helpful and encouraging.",
    "I would reccomend this class. I knew almost nothing about music before it and now I can read all music and understand some basic music theory. I'm so glad that I took this class!",
    "Great class if you get a fun instructor, shop different sections to find someone fun. Really for people who know no music theory, if you've done anything at all and you're serious about learning more then go to the next level. I took it as an easy class to learn something that I had always sort of known but never learned formally and really enjoyed it. one warning though: there are some horribly annoying, 2 hour+ homework assignments in the middle of the course that will ruin your perception of the class for a few weeks.",
    "Music 110 is a great class if you are at all interested in music. Lynda Paul was definitely the best teacher. The workload is very manageable and the material is interesting. Some people will say it's incredibly easy, but that is only the case if you keep up with the work and study sufficiently for the quizzes. It can be a little rough if you don't. Overall it was really fun and made me want to take another music class in the future."
