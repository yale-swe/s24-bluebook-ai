    "Grammar-wise, we started at por vs para and made it to conditionals. The short stories we read and videos we watched helped improve our ability to understand conversation.",
    "My ability to read and understand spoken Spanish was dramatically improved by this course, and I also continued to develop my ability to speak and write in Spanish.",
    "My Spanish reading, writing, and speaking improved immensely in this course. It was a challenge well worth it.",
    "Speaking reading and writing in Spanish",
    "I learned to speak Spanish and the grammar.",
    "I gained a lot of speaking Spanish skills, and further solidified my writing and grammar in Spanish as well.",
    "I became more capable of engaging in Spanish conversation, as well as understanding grammatical rules when writing.",
    "I gained a lot of cultural knowledge about the Spanish culture, but also gained a much greater knowledge of Spanish language and grammar.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths of this course included for me: a fun professor, and very structured and organized learning. Weaknesses of this course included: topics that did not feel that relevant to my life and meeting every day of the week without exception.",
    "The strengths of this course are the course packet and online assignments. Deadlines and assignments were straightforward. The weaknesses of this course is that 50 minutes is not enough time to go over homework assignments, learn a new lesson, and practice what we've learned.",
    "Strengths: forces you to learn since class every day is in Spanish, you have to practice what you are learning.",
    "I think the weaknesses are that the course focuses a lot on only grammar. I think it is just as important to speak in casual settings with your classmates, not just practice that one grammar rule of the day. I would also rather spend more time learning about the culture of the many spanish speaking countries.",
    "Strength is that the pace of the class was perfectnot too fast and not too slow. Also, the resources provided to us for exams really helped me prepare well for it.",
    "The greatest strength was Professor Lestayo, because he engaged the class greatly, which I appreciated because it helped me feel more comfortable speaking and expressing myself in Spanish.",
    "Very well organized, could incorporate more listening activities"

    "I would recommend this course to another student as I found it to be fun and engaging. I would say that the professor you get makes a huge difference on how well your learning goes, so one should make sure that they have a good professor.",
    "Yes. Spanish 130 is a great course. Whether it's your first language class at yale or a continuation from 120, the curriculum ensures everyone gets to the same level.",
    "Its a good refresher on most of the topics of basic Spanish so that you really learn them, but it is obviously tough showing up 5 days a week.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student who is past the introductory level of Spanish, but really wants to improve their speaking, listening, and writing skills.",
    "Yes and Jose was an amazing teacher.",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course, it was very well taught and organized.",
    "Yes"
