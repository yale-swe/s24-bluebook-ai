    "A perfect stepping stone into Homer for anyone with budding Greek knowledge. This class makes the transition easier and gives you the tools to better analyze and synthesize Homer for more fluid reading and understanding. Homer is so fun, and this class really opens the door to his writings!",
    "If you have not read Homeric Greek before, or if you plan to go on to poetry in other dialects, take this class.",
    "Josh is amazing, but he is leaving. I mean, you are only taking this class if you enjoy it \/ have to take it. Largely will depend on the professor you have.",
    "An excellent introduction to Homer. Unfortunately, Josh Fincher won't be teaching this course, but of course this is the one to take if you want to read Homer, which you do.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Reading Homer in the original language is honestly one of the best things in existence, and this class is a fascinating and supportive way to do it."
