    "PLSC 384 looks at various aspects of Indian democracy - the impact of development, the rise of Hindu nationalism, and the influence of the caste structure. One lecture a week is devoted to India while the second lecture looks to compare India to another nation (generally in Asia or South\/Central America). There is one midterm exam consisting of essays and a final exam also consisting of essays. I would definitely recommend the course to a fellow student. The readings are all really interesting and the professor does a great job of stimulating discussion.",
    "This course was an unexpected find. It meets twice a week and has only exams, not papers, so it surprised me after bluebooking that it was actually a seminar. The class is a great way for students both with experience in India and without to delve deep into the workings of such a fascinatingly complex country. The workload isnt light in terms of reading, but I appreciated having no writing assignments and having an in-class final before reading period. Prof. Thachil is a fun guy who is great at explaining difficult concepts. All in all, a good course for learning to think like a political scientist and apply it to a case study different from our own experience at home.",
    "If you're interested in Indian politics, this is a great course! It looks at Indian politics from many different perspectives and has interesting comparisons to other countries as well. I really enjoyed it, and Prof Thachil did a great job of leading discussions. I wish there was some more focus on theoretical political science -- a lot of the class was just about parties and the choices they made.",
    "Yes, absolutely take PLSC 384. It's a really cool look into Indian democracy, but also does a good job illuminating the challenges of democratic government in any country just because of the sheer size of India and the effort professor thachil makes to delve into comparative aspects of studying democracy. He also makes an effort to not have the only comparison be China - we learned about Zambia and Nepal and Pakistan and a whole smattering of other countries. Take this class to learn more about democracy and about India. You should be prepared to read a lot, though, but besides the reading there's only the midterm and the final, so the workload is pretty manageable. I took it as a fifth class and it was fine.",
    "Absolutely a VERY reading heavy course. Discussions (2x per week for 1.25 hours at NINE AM!) weren't that helpful, just because they essentially just went over the main messages of the readings. There wasn't much room for reflection on the ideas or discussion about our thoughts about the themes. Not much previous knowledge of India or democratic theory was assumed, which was nice, but it left the discussions lacking as we were stuck with the basics of \"what's caste?\" It was a very small seminar, graded pretty easily, with a midterm & final that weren't that bad, given you'd done the reading. However, I would not recommend, mostly because of the excessive reading (more than 100 pages twice a week), and the discussions that didn't go that deep. Prof is good, but not very personable or easy to connect with.",
    "This was a great course. Its strengths were interesting content, exploring Indian democracy in a comparative manner as well as democracy more theoretically, and a great professor. Professor Thachil is just excellent. He is incredibly knowledgeable about India (being an Indian who spends considerable time researching there) and democratic theory, and this competency really shines through in his teaching style. He is excellent at leading seminars and navigating discussion, responding very thoughtfully and effectively to any student comments. Honestly, I'd say he is the best seminar leader I have had at Yale. Compared to some others in the department, actually, he really stands out as the most effective and competent at teaching, rather than just being a researcher who teaches on the side (which is all too common, quite unfortunately). He is also very approachable, friendly, and willing to meet with students about any and all concerns, including if you are not very comfortable speaking much in seminar settings - he's great at working with students on that. The only weakness I would say is that the grades are completely dependent on the two exams, so there is not much leeway to mess up and the students cannot really prove themselves in a way other than the exams and class discussion. Also, this class is demanding. It might be the only one I've taken at Yale that I did absolutely all of the readings for, because Professor Thachil expects that of you and holds students accountable in discussion and exams in a way that even other seminar professors do not. This could be a con since it means it's a ton of time reading with all your effort only materializing in discussion and the two exams (rather than reading responses or essays or something), but the accountability also forces you to get a lot out of the class when you might not have otherwise. I found the class very rewarding. It was cool to get to explore democracy through the Indian example. I really learned a lot."
