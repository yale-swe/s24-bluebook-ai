    "I learned more about Integrals, And I learned about sequences and series.",
    "Studying for tests got better.",
    "Learned Calculus 2 skills, as well as general problem-solving skills.",
    "I learned how to take the material I learned and apply it in more complex problems we were given.",
    "Lots of stuff, perseverance from when I failed midterm 2",
    "Mainly techniques for integration and series convergence",
    "Deeper understanding of integrals and the importance of analysing series.",
    "I gained a better understanding of calculus. We learned integration, series, polar, and parametric coordinates."

   "comments": [
    "James organized the daily lectures well with packets and organized activities. The homework often was significantly harder than the daily lecture problems though.",
    "Strengths: James was an amazing teacher, the order in which material was taught made sense, the explorations helped preview\/review material, the notes were very helpful.",
    "Strengths were the outlines of the material and the straightforward approach, while the weaknesses were engagement and keeping the material interesting.",
    "Homework problems were unlike exams.",
    "They need to be more on what is tested and have more assessment.",
    "Professor Barnes did a really nice job with making good handouts for class and also making us think as opposed to just talking at us. Some of the review sessions were all over the place but overall it was a good course. More structure or handouts for reviews would be helpful.",
    "the explorations make it hard to learn the material because we try and do them and learn the material for them before we are taught in class.",
    "I didn't find the pre-class explorations to be helpful. It would have been better to just have the psets as assignments. A strength is that psets were always relevant to the course content.",
    "Given the content, Professor Barnes did an awesome job in keeping it engaging and promoting understanding.",
    "The strength of this course is that it teaches you the skill of critical thinking."

    "Yes, because the concepts and skills that Ive developed allowed me to get a greater understanding of mathematical concepts that will be vital to my career.",
    "If the student likes math, I would, but other than that not particularly. It is a lot of theory and problem solving which can be enjoyable at times.",
    "Yes, it teaches you a lot about mathematics.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, especially if they have professor Barnes. Really engaging and good content.",
    "Yes if they need a math requirement",

    "Yes, especially with Professor Barnes. It teaches the fundamentals you need.",
