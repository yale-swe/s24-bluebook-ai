   "comments": [
    "A good class if and only if you know that you are interested in performing arts reviews. Don't take it unless you are fully committed to writing a review every week, and attending many performances etc. outside of class. The workload initially seems much heavier than it ends up being, and the guest artists were amazing--definitely the best part of the class.",
    "A rigorous writing seminar with an ample amount of work every week (significantly larger than in an average lecture course) that without a doubt truly improves your writing and reading skills as well as your overall understanding of the art of writing and the subject you are writing about.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. IF you want to learn more about appreciating the arts, or just improve your writing skills, take it.",
    "Surely take it if you are interested in performing art; you will learn about something outside your specialty. I am a trained musician, but the course opened my eyes for dance and got me very interested in theater. And the final paper for the course, which is a profile for an artist, is very interesting.",
    "Absolutely recommend. I had very little performing arts background going in, and a STEM major, and I will say, it is the hidden gem of the English department. Absolutely lovely course. I was worried that the discussions would be lacking, but they were very thorough and insightful. I definitely learned more about writing. Definitely have a greater appreciation for and interest in the performing arts after taking this course. Margaret Spillane is a brilliant, wonderful woman--the sort of Professor you come to Yale hoping to learn from. Anything I write here is an understatement of the happiness and fulfillment i got from taking this course with Professor Spillane.",
    "If you want to take a fun English course that could cultivate the Roger Ebert in you, take this course. You'll see the multiple parts of the art\/entertainment world from the performances, movies, art shows you see and from the students (I took the class with two theater students and a musician)."
