    "A great class if you have any interest in Shakespeare.",
    "YES please take it if you love theater and\/or Shakespeare. You should be willing to put in the work though, because the class is usually very small and everyone is highly talented. If you work hard on it though, I think you'll have a great time!",
    "Definitely recommended.",
    "This is a fantastic course that really teaches you a lot about acting and acting Shakespeare. Note that this is primarily intended for people who want to pursue acting and a lot of time notes are given about audition techniques. I found this particularly helpful but to the non-actor, it may not be. It is a lot of time both in and out of class, especially if you want to get a lot out of it, but it was definitely worth it.",
    "If you are serious about acting (and prepared to work), it is an absolute must.",
    "If you want to get better at Shakespeare you should definitely take this class.",
    "Of course i recommend it. best class of my year.",
    "This course is a life experience well worth having. If you\u0092re thinking of auditioning, put together an awesome monologue and go for it. I mean, it\u0092s Shakespeare. And Murray Biggs is delightfully quirky and insightful. The work tends to be technical and detailed\u0097is this character\u0092s jacket is buttoned or unbuttoned? what\u0092s the most important word in this phrase?\u0097and it\u0092s cool what a difference the details make. The atmosphere is at once laid-back and a bit stressful; Murray Biggs is kind and funny, but he\u0092ll keep you on your toes, so be ready to really do your work\u0097text, blocking, costumes, props. I made some room in my schedule for the class and was glad I did (though alas, this can only get you so far with group scenes). Take it."
