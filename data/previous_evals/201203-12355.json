   "comments": [
    "English 125 is often described as a necessary evil for English majors. Let me say, as a non-English major, who took the class with a desire to develop a true appreciation for poetry, I can honestly say not only that the authors you will study in this class are essential for understanding poetic verse, but that if you approach this class the right way, it's entirely enjoyable. Make sure to stay on top of the reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. If you are intending to be an English major, it is a prerequisite. That being said, the course does not need to be a burden. I enjoyed the material and the subject matter. Your experience in ENGL definitely depends on your section leader and the students in your class. Be sure to shop around several sections before settling on one. If you do not intend to become an English major, I still recommend this course, but with reservations. The course includes a decent amount of reading and a lot of writing. It also presents a very specific type of writing on certain themes. While some students might be interested in the course from an enrichment perspective, others might be better suited taking a broader English course. At the same time, ENGL 125 is a great way to experience a seminar course.",
    "The class is completely discussion based, thus you will learn to stretch your skills mainly from your classmates. It is pretty much mandatory to do the readings, but if you do you will be rewarded. There are six papers in this class, so the workload is high but manageable. Overall you will take away a lot from this class, if not just gaining a greater appreciation for some important English Poets.",
    "A poetic exploration of the most intriguing type. Definitely would recommend it to anyone.",
    "Recommended as an exciting course where students interact closely with the texts",
    "This is a fantastic course - don't be put off by the fact that these poets predate 1900, as they really are the bedrock on which the entire canon is built. You'll read some incredibly beautiful and surprisingly rip-roaring stuff, and have great discussions as the class tends to be mostly prospective English majors who are really serious about this. That said, don't take this is you're mildly interested and feel like dabbling: it's a lot of work (5 papers, a final and a few other assignments, in addition to a reading load that isn't long but takes a long time to read if you're analyzing as you go - which you'll need to do). It's also pretty harshly graded as you go along, although final grades get a nice little boost from somewhere! Take it with Prof Manley if you can as he's really really great - pretty senior in the department, taught it a lot, really clear and brilliant and helpful and wry.",
    "I would recommend taking it with Professor Manley but make sure you have a good class. The discussion is what these classes are made of."
