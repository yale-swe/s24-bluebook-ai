    "I became more comfortable with writing at a college level and learned rules for different types of papers. I got better at organizing and expressing my thoughts in longer essays.",
    "I learned so much about soccer history and the power of sport in culture. I learned a lot about how to craft arguments and writing papers. I have also learned my weaknesses as a writer and what I need to work on, which is great.",
    "I became a better writer by taking this course. The assignments and reading were helpful to understanding what composes a good essay,and the writing process was thoroughly explained.",
    "I gained a lot more confidence in my essay-writing abilities, both from sheer practice and from the really helpful insight that the professor would provide for each paper.",
    "I got comfortable writing several different styles of academic papers, and with reading academic work and properly citing it (not just in terms of MLA format, but in terms of using the information responsibly and accurately). I feel that I am now able to write more meaningful papers with analysis that actually matters and isn't pointless.",
    "I believe I further developed my writing skills, and great improved my ability to edit and analyze my own work."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that it is interesting if you pick a theme that you like and that it covers four different types of papers.",
    "The Wednesday\/Friday schedule was unfortunate. I think the course was well structured though besides that. The course layout allowed us to write many different kinds of papers, which I enjoyed and was good to figure out my strengths and weakness as a writer as well. Additionally, writing the paper in steps (not just having one due date, but having partial drafts, rough drafts, etc. due along the way) made it easier to write a successful paper and to get feedback from the teacher along the way.",
    "The small number of people in the class was nice because everyone was able to voice their opinions and I was able to voice any questions I had. Maybe more in depth feedback of drafts.",
    "Strengths: really interesting subject material, great personal attention from professor, really helpful feedback on work Weaknesses: very heavy reading requirement",
    "This course is extremely engaging, and it's easy to stay interested in the assignments and during class. I also felt like I what I was learning was valuable, even though I'm not going to be an english major. I had no problems with this class except for the fact that I didn't have time to do some of the readings from the book that we used mostly for background info on the history of soccer, but that wasn't too much of a problem",
    "This class is very engaging, with each class presenting a different opportunity to both learn about soccer history and further your writing skills. On top of"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommended this course to anyone interested in the relationship between sport and culture in all parts of the world. It has been my most enjoyable class this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who wants a transition into college level writing. It is a manageable workload with 4 papers but the professors make sure you are managing your time by assigning rough drafts for all but the last paper.",
    "Absolutely, a great course to learn how to improve your writing skills. Additionally, an extremely interesting class for anyone.",
    "This was an excellent introductory course on writing analytical essays. I will use the skills from this class and apply it to other courses in the future. Workload was manageable and I think the small classroom environment really benefitted my learning.",
    "I would, because I found it really interesting and also helpful to me as a writer. I think I gained a solid foundation of writing skills that I can use for many other classes, not just english.",
    "Yes, for sure. Such a fun class, and as long as you don't cause your own downfall (with procrastination an such) the workload is not too much. It's also really cool to learn about soccer in an academic context, and you learn how to write well while doing it.",
    "I would recommend the topic is very engaging and interesting, and the class taught the essentials of writing research papers. I would especially recommend to international students, who may not be very confident in their writing in English.",
    "Absolutely, and I already have to multiple students."
