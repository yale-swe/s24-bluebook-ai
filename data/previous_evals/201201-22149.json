   "comments": [
    "This is a seminar on foreign perceptions of Japan. All of the readings are written by foreigners traveling to Japan. The course often challenges conventional wisdom on Japanese history (overturning notions of Tokugawa Japan as a closed nation, etc). Unfortunately, because of the nature of this course, most of the readings are diaries or travelogues, so if you're not a huge fan of those, don't take this course. Professor Botsman seemed to be rather tired the whole time and was pretty passive throughout the seminar, which was pretty disappointing. Still, though, take the class if you're interested in Japan; it's definitely a new and fresh perspective.",
    "Great class to study Japanese history and its interactions with Western countries. Professor Botsman is great, very accessible to his students, and runs a good discussion. Familiarity with some Japanese history would probably be useful.",
    "History 340J is not a survey class, and goes deeply into Western accounts of Japan, and into ideas about Wester people define, perceive and write about Japan, this inter-relation between the East and the West. Workload is slightly above average. Good amt of readings on western accounts and diaries. Assignments include presentation, transcribing primary documents, newspaper archival research, and a 20 page research paper.Workload is slightly above average, but definitely hones your historical research skills, and the process can be quite fun and rewarding. However, as I have said, the class goes deep into analysis of historical context through primary sources, and if you are into broad and illustrative survey of Japanese history, take his survey class instead.",
    "Overall great and interesting class, but don't take this course if you want to learn a lot of historical knowledge about a large span of Japanese history. This course very much focuses on several important journeys to Japan that explain a lot about relations between the West and East, but doesn't necessarily give you a big picture view of Japanese history. Either way, definitely take this course - Professor Botsman is great and the material was always interesting.",
    "History 340J studies Japan through the lens of western perspectives. I would definitely recommend the class to another student. It's an excellent way to learn about a different part of the world. The readings are really fun, and the assignments make use of the primary sources available in the library.",
    "This is a good seminar to take for a rest of world credit and to learn how to do historical research. Prof. Botsman is great and approachable.",
    "I would recommend it. Good opportunity to learn about Japan without any necessary background knowledge",
    "The strength of the course is Professor Botsman -- maybe it seems simple, but it's so nice to be in class with someone as friendly and personable as he is. His willingness to help with assignments is refreshing, as are his comments in seminar. The class is structured around roughly two student presentations each session, and I do wish he had restricted the student presentations a little bit, as they tended to drag on (and when he interjected, his comments were very helpful). I enjoyed all of the small assignments, but wish we had gotten a little more advice on writing the paper. If you want to take this class, make sure you're interested in Japanese social history -- that's what the cross-cultural connection idea of \"journeys\" ends up being. For me, it got a little boring by the end.",
    "A very interesting way to think about Japan. I would absolutely recommend it as Botsman is a fantastic professor - very knowledgeable, helpful, funny, and cool. The reading can be dull, but you don't have to do all of it as the class is mostly presentation based.",
    "Good seminar, but the reading list could be improved (too many diaries and not enough secondary sources). Workload is manageable and assignments are really interesting because they force you to explore primary sources at Yale. Botsman is a wonderful professor who is an expert on Japanese history and very approachable. Take if you have some background in Japanese history and are interested in learning more about it from the perspective of East-West contact."
