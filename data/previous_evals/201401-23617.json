    "It's a class where you watch anime and then learn about how these shows relate to posthuman ideas and how other facets of the anime culture like animation and the fans interact with this medium of entertainment. I recommend this class to any fans of anime or even people who aren't fans but want to learn about how complicated ideas can be expressed through the medium of entertainment.",
    "If you like philosophical\/literary theory, take the class. You learn to think about pop-culture (specifically anime) in a more rigorous way, which extends to how you approach daily life.",
    "So I can imagine the reviews of this class will vary widely based on who was in it. I have no background in Japan or Anime. I took it as I was a senior looking for a \"huh that sounds different\" kind of class. This fit the bill. The films are weird. Really weird. Acid tripping weird. But hey, that's fine. The workload wasn't light, but it was manageable.",
    "It's helpful for those who has a good background in philosophies and visual culture in general.",
    "Good syllabus, but shop it to see if you like Seth's teaching style. Not much work!"
