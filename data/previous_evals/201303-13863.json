    "Portuguese L3 focuses much less on grammar and more on conversational skills. It's mostly based on reading texts and analyzing them. Professor Vital is a sweetheart and she really cares about her students. L3 is worth taking.",
    "This class was a blast and I appreciated getting to interact in Portuguese with a Brazilian professor. It was only weak in that it didn't focus on grammar at all (that was a side note); learning something substantial from the course requires a little personal initiative from the student outside of class."
