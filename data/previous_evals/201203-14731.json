   "comments": [
    "The majority of the readings were interesting and the workload was very manageable (average weekly reading; fewer written pages required than most other EAS seminars). However, class was a trial: \"discussion leaders\" spent too much time being \"summarizers,\" which encouraged people to fail to do the reading; Prof Weiss did not lend much direction to the discussions, which tended to revolve around questions so vague that people were prone to talking past each other or talking about their feelings; and half of my classmates spent half of each seminar on Facebook or answering e-mails, which didn't help matters at all. A very disappointing class overall.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to any student interested in contemporary China. It provides an overview of the issues critical to understanding both social and political behavior in China, and the push-pull dynamics their relationship creates. In doing this, it also shines light on some of the drivers and motivations behind economic policy.",
    "If you are interested in human rights \/ protests this is for you NOT for those more interested in Deng Xiaoping reforms",
    "Great overview of Chinese domestic politics."

   "comments": [
    "Understanding contemporary China is impossible without understanding the nuances of the relationship between state and society, and the delicate balance that is kept between the two as China plods on into the future. After taking this course, I feel I now have a strong grasp of the core issues and dynamics at play here."
