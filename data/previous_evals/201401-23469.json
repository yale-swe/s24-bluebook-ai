    "I would recommend this class to another student looking to complete their requirements at this level. The course load is manageable,and the daily classes give some routine. What is nice about L3 is that it gives you a good basis to complete a summer abroad program instead of L4.",
    "Good class that's useful to fill a language requirement. If you need to take it, Tortora is a very good teacher, though the class is not particularly interesting. Spanish is a tough class to keep interesting for students, so know what to expect coming in."
