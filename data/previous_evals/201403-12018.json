   "comments": [
    "It was a great overview of the major social theorists. I would definitely recommend it to everyone considering it, regardless of his\/her major. It will open up your eyes to the field of sociology.",
    "Good survey course of some fundamental thinkers in sociology--Kant, Weber, Durkheim, etc. If you really like theory, though, I'd take a different course--it doesn't go into depth on any one thinker.",
    "This is a really awesome introductory course to sociology. It's not overly difficult, and my TF and Prof. Erikson were both very generous with giving extensions. The only annoying part is that there's so much reading, but if you genuinely just pay attention in class, you won't get less than 9\/10 on the quizzes (5 total).",
    "This is a great class - take it! Course material: the main arguments of a range of prominent thinkers (Kant, Marx, Weber, Smith, Hobbes, Durkheim, Rousseau, Nietzsche, de Beauvoir, and others). Very well taught: clear, well-structured lectures; abstract stuff beautifully explained (Go to lecture!). Medium workload: 5 short tests (10% each), 2 5-6 page papers (20% each), and section participation, including very brief weekly reading responses. Something due every other week, but manageable. Tests cover thinkers' main arguments, and papers make you analyze them more closely (and can be lots of fun, if you like this stuff). Fair grading. Professor Erikson and my TF (Billy) both very pleasant and approachable!",
    "I definitely recommend this course with Professor Erikson. She does a great job with the material despite the ambitious goals set out by a survey of so many authors. The course focuses upon the connections between the evolving social theories from Kant to Peirce. The readings are both short and good, but the lectures are comprehensive enough to get by without them as long as you find time to read them before the quizzes. There are online lectures of a similar course on Open Yale Courses, but Professor Erikson's lectures are better.",
    "As an engineering major, I really enjoyed mixing up my schedule with this class. It caused me to think in ways and about issues that I normally don't.",
    "It's a good intro course to sociology. If you have never read any philosophers\/sociologists like me, this is probably the course to get started because the lectures are helpful.",
    "This course covers a lot of important pre-modern social theorists and how their work is related to each other. Overall I really enjoyed this class. The workload is pretty light. The quizzes are pretty factual and straightforward, all you need to do in order to do well on them is go to lecture and section. Don't do the readings before lecture, because the latter only focuses on a small and oftentimes random portion of the former (also a lot of the readings are really dense). You only need to read three to four authors in depth because the papers ask you to discuss how theorists build on each other, but otherwise digging too much into the readings doesn't help too much with the course.",
    "Not a bad class to take. Not excellent, but definitely not horrible or anywhere in the realm of bad. For one, Professor Erikson is incredibly kind, sweet, and caring. She genuinely wishes the best for her students and is very helpful when you seek help. The TAs are just as wonderful as well; no major complaints about their willingness to better students' understanding of the material and their lives. Another major strength was the canonical readings (Marx, Durkheim, Hobbes, Kant, and many others). We read major intellectuals' writings, often from lesser-known works that were just as interesting and important. With that said, the major criticism of the class (which for me was a criticism but for many is probably an advantage) is that the class is incredibly, incredibly easy. There's no need - as most students figure out by the fourth week - to do any of the readings; you can do well in the class just from attendance in lecture and in section. This is a bit sad for me personally, as I genuinely wanted a more challenging academic experience. However, if you need to fill a distributional requirement or want a painless taste of PoliSci\/Sociology\/Philosophy, it's a great one to take. Just don't expect your life to be changed.",
    "Absolutely! It was a wonderful inspiring course, and I enjoyed every one of the classes.",
    "I thought that this class was a fantastic overview of social theories. The lectures are incredibly interesting. Professor Erikson is an awesome professor. She was enthusiastic about the subject, accessible, and willing to discuss ideas with students. The readings can be a bit dry, but I felt that they were rewarding.",
    "SOCY 151 is a MUST-TAKE!",
    "This course is a great summary of all the main social theorists through the early 1900s. Professor Erikson is a great lecturer, clear and interesting. A lot of the reading is what all college students should read at least once: Weber, Marx, Durkheim, Kant, etc. The workload is not too heavy: mostly just reading, with a few quizzes and two papers.",
    "Take it. Interesting subject and not too difficult nor is it alot of work",
    "100% TAKE THIS COURSE. This was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale--scratch that, my favorite class. The material was fascinating and so relevant. You're doing social theory-- so the theory behind how people interact with other people and within a society. The material made me think so much and I loved every class. I left every class saying, WOW THAT WAS AMAZING and applying the material to my life. I loved the format of the class too -- the 5 short tests rather than exams, I thought it was perfect so you get the chance to digest the information and think about it and learn it, and then two essays, which weren't too bad (5-6 pages). Professor Erikson is INCREDIBLE and the whole class is amazing. You will think about yourself as an individual and the way you interact with other people and communities in a whole new way. Take this class. I didn't do one of the readings and still got so much out of it (but you have to study really hard for the exams)",
    "A broad sweep of social theorists is covered in the course. This course provides a solid background and foundation for sociology, and its main selling point is its assigned readings, through which one can glean several insights. A total of five in-class quizzes is assigned throughout the course; these are helpful in assessing your understanding of the readings, but they don't necessarily require you to think about them critically. The critical thinking segment arises in the two papers assigned in the later half of the course. I would recommend this course as an introduction to sociology.",
    "A good introductory for all students regardless of prior knowledge of the various authors. The content is fairly comprehendible. However, to write and think in a manner which the class calls for might take slightly more effort. Overall, a useful class.",
    "Yes, it's a great class. Most of the material seems to really stick, which doesn't always happen.",
    "This course provided a great overview of important themes in social theory, and I felt confident that I was exposed to formative texts in the field. The lectures were interesting and gave useful information in a way that kept my interest. The design of the course is such that the reading is often too difficult -- even the TFs acknowledge this and have trouble with the fact that we only read primary sources. I felt like that was damaging to the effectiveness of the course, because nobody had much more insight into these ideas than what was presented in lecture, making section meetings seem like a waste. You're rewarded for repeating the lecture notes verbatim on quizzes because there isn't much else anyone is able to say.",
    "Take this class, obviously, if you need it for the major. Also, I would recommend take this class over intro to politics philosophy or MoFoPo if you can get away with it.",
    "Introduction to modern theorists with short papers and exams.",
    "OK, but not awesome. In my opinion too much work for how interesting it was--5 brief quizzes which were actually great (easy way to have a solid 50% of your grade without studying too much material), but having two papers on top of that was a little much, I thought. Interesting stuff though. Made it through the course, expecting an A or an A- and I did exactly 0% of the reading--fine if you pay attention in lecture.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. If you engage in the readings and attend lecture (and paid attention) there is a lot to be gained. Going into this class I was not thrilled at the idea of a semester of theory, but I am so glad I took it and definitely have a new perspective on and appreciation of sociological theory. Prof. Erikson was great, the workload fair and steady, the grading fair as well -- and as an added bonus, there's nothing due during reading period\/no final exam!",
    "Recommend this course--by the end you read a lot of important people in social theory and Prof. Erickson structures the course so that you can see the evolution of the theories--a lot about the dialogue between authors, pretty neat. Not too much work.",
    "I would recommend this course. You have to know these thinkers!",
    "Really good class, gives you a good basis in social theory. A lot of really interesting theorists and theories, and professor Erikson summarizes there ideas very well in class. A lot of the reading is dense, so coming to class, taking notes, and participating in section is pretty much necessary. work load pretty light",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Prof Erikson is a fabulous lecturer and a wonderful person. The readings are very thought-provoking and contain important ideas that are relevant to people of all majors (although sometimes they are long and a bit dry). Prof Erikson brings life into them and will certainly make this class worth your while!",
    "Fantastic course! Definitely recommended to anyone who normally wouldn't want to take a harder, more abstract philosophical course, since this class does a really good job of connecting these ideas to the real world. Prof. Erikson is clear and the work isn't too bad.",
    "Very wide range and shallow survey course, great for people who don't have a lot of experience reading and writing about philosophy. Not too much work and lectures were pretty engaging. Would recommend for someone looking to try their hand at reading Marx, weber, Durkheim etc.",
    "SOCY 151 01 is an introductory sociology course that really helped me understand the range of theories that emerged after Kant and their developments in relation to each other. I would most definitely recommend this course for its clarity, breadth and enthusiastic presentation."
