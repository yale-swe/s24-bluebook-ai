    "Take it! If you need a \"fun\" senior year class with low commitment, take it CR\/D. I took it and was not disappointed--only wish my thesis didn't get in the way of me participating\/reading\/attending more often than I did. Definitely fight your way in!",
    "If you like science fiction, take this class. The material was quite different from what I expected and we read a lot that wasn't even on my radar beforehand, but I learned a lot from that. It's pretty fast paced at moments and the papers can be tricky just because there's so much to get your head around. But it's useful to work on your writing and the amount of work averaged over the semester is fair for a WR course. Prof. Guy is great and everyone in my section at least was really well prepared and invested in the class and so discussions were great.",
    "This is a perfect course. It's been a long time since I've been able to pinpoint an event in my life that caused me to be more examined about literature; this course has been such an event. Thoughtfully curated set of readings, reasonable workload, and fun, interactive lectures. Professor Guy is one of the best at this school. Science majors will find the style of thinking in this course especially agreeable.",
    "Definitely take this class. It isn't a lot of work and you'll really enjoy it.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Guy is fabulous. The reading list is fabulous. The film list is fabulous. It's a writing credit, so it's a lot of work, but Professor Guy has mentioned he'll try and space assignments better next time he offers the course. I took it because I wanted to learn more about SciFi, but mostly because of the professor, and I've come away with immense respect for the professor and the TA's and surprise, at how intelligent and fascinating science fiction is.",
    "Yes, I found science fiction awesome. I don't read much but I really enjoyed the course.",
    "Take it. You will not regret it.",
    "This class is enjoyable and fun if A) you like reading science fiction and B) you want to learn a lot about how to write an essay. Prof Guy has great energy and is very interesting, but there is a big focus in the class about honing your writing in a very particular \"writing center\", \"outline your whole paper in your intro paragraph\" type of way that I found a little trying. You also have to do most of the reading because the essays force you to use like five books per essay. But they are great books and fun to read, so if you're into sci fi that won't be a problem.",
    "Okay, drop whatever you're doing with your schedule and add Science Fiction to your courses right now. Then take it. This course is absolutely excellent. Whether you've never taken a humanities course before and need a WR credit, or you're an English major and you thumb your nose at non-Real Literature (you'll see just how wrong you are), or you're a sci=fi buff who can recite Star Trek by heart, or you're anywhere in between (I'm a philosophy major and minor SF fan, most interested in treating these texts as thought experiments in how we ought to live), you will find yourself actually caring about making your assignments and papers good, even if you're the sort of person who normally just dashes things off. Guy's teaching STRONGLY DISPROVES the idea that lectures are useless relics which ought to be cordoned off as MOOCs\/online courses. His constant willingness to take questions, to take 60-90 second pauses for students to write reflections\/thoughts, to ask us to talk to the person next to us and share our ideas in small groups of 2 or 3, and to learn all our names over the course of the semester, all while keeping the lecture moving, really demonstrate that the classroom remains a key component of the Yale liberal arts education even at a size of 60 or 70 people. ALL deliverers of Yale College lecture courses should HAVE to come watch Alfred Guy's Science Fiction lecture at least once and adapt their courses so they look more like it. (Don't just take it from me -- he officially won a Yale College Teaching Prize in 2014 for his excellence.) What's more, the discussion sections are taught by great TAs hand-picked by Guy, and Guy in his role as director of the Writing Center is constantly committed to improving the writing ability\/proficiency of everyone in the class, no matter how experienced or inexperienced their starting point might be. On top of THAT, the course is studded with highlights of academic \"theory\" -- Derrida, Donna Haraway, Freud, Marx, Baudrillard, etc. -- and particularly a focus on gender studies, which enriches the academic value-added of treating science fiction as literature. This course is LIFE-CHANGING. You'll be asking a huge number of the Big Questions which many of us came to Yale for (What is human nature? Why do we have stories? What separates the self and the other?, What is 'right'?), in an enthusiastic, excited, and just-plain-fun environment, and you'll grow a lot as a thinker and get your mind bent pretty strongly by all sorts of radical possibilities for human identity, the future, and self-construction in the texts themselves. Drop whatever else you're doing at the time this course meets -- you won't regret it.",
    "Science Fiction was incredible. The reading in and of itself was fun, but I thought the lectures were fabulous. It was the first course in which I really looked forward to every lecture. Professor Guy was able to clearly explain the ideas presented in the novels in an interesting way. He combined film clips and photographs to enliven his lectures. He also accepted any and all comments and would discuss them equally - there was never a \"dumb\" question in his class. Professor Guy was also just an awesome person in general, so I think he made the class what it is. The reading is minimal. There's generally one book assigned per week, and since it's fiction, it doesn't feel like a burden. It was actually nice to sit down and just read a book for homework.",
    "ENGL 132 is an incredible course on science fiction. The novels and short stories are intriguing, as are lectures and discussion sections. There is a substantial amount of reading, but it is worth doing. Prof Guy is an amazing professor and is obviously very excited to teach the class. ENGL 132 is a great way to get a writing credit or just add an enjoyable class to your schedule.",
    "I absolutely do not recommend this course.",
    "YES. Take it. You read amazing books. You get to witness the life of Alfred Guy. Section is fantastic. All in all, the best class I have ever taken at Yale.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "OK course, but not if you want a challenging, college-level writing course. The assignments seem geared toward freshmen\/high school writers, and sometimes can get tedious. But overall, a fun and interesting English course.",
    "Take it. Professor Guy is THE BEST, the TA's are AWESOME (if Megan E. is a TA for this class in the future, try to get into her section!!!!), and you will read some INCREDIBLE Science Fiction and learn more about why LITERATURE MATTERS. Humanities majors, read: your majors will be justified. I learned so much, I loved lecture, and I highly recommend this course across the board.",
    "TAKE IT NOW",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Seriously take this class. It's so fun.",
    "Yes. Take this class if you can get in; super chill, and really fun. Do it!",
    "Yes. It's not an easy writing credit, definitely. We read 8 full length novels, plus some short stories, plus watch some movies, plus read some analytical pieces. But Prof Guy is so enthusiastic and awesome. If you have time and would like to improve your writing and argument-building abilities while thinking about interesting texts, this is a good class.",
    "Take it! The books are great, not too many, and fairly quick to read. The papers can be a bit of a chore, but there are only three, plus another two one-page responses. Professor Guy is a blast.",
    "This is an AWESOME course. Professor Guy is amazing. SF is a fascinating area of literature not often covered in the English department, but (as Guy has taught us) the questions these texts pose are essential to human nature and society--and how they might be different or transformed. They were also so fun to read that the work for this class often felt like a break from others! But delving into the material at the level Professor Guy demanded in the papers could also be challenging and rewarding.",
    "It's a cool course for a writing credit, and it starts off quickly with a lot of work, but finishes earlier, which was awesome because that's the opposite of most classes so everything doesn't go crazy all at once. I would recommend it as a good writing credit for the person who doesn't want to take writing credits - my TA was awesome and You could get extensions by going to the writing center since the professor is in charge of it. It was a fair amount of work but not crazy.",
    "You read timeless science fiction books and some short stories. If you like literature, but are not too versed in science fiction, you should definitely take the class. It's more about how science fiction relates to life, not how life relates to science fiction. Professor Guy is such an engaging lecture; I always hated having to miss lecture, but sometimes it was hard to go when I wasn't keeping up with the reading. There is a lot of reading, so if you think you might not be able to keep up with it, take this class a different semester.",
    "Great class. Great professor. Great material. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Yeah easy writing crsdit",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Take if you need a writing credit (the course includes lessons regarding important writing fundamentals) or you absolutely love science fiction. Don't take if you're older than a sophomore because you'll likely really resent the flow of discussion in the class haha. Overall I didn't much like the course.",
    "Definitely! Great class if you love science fiction, but the reading load is pretty heavy. Professor Guy is great!",
    "Yes, I suppose I would recommend this course, but not particularly strongly. I would describe it as an excellent course if you need to get a WR or HU out of the way and you love science fiction, but don't expect fantastic lectures or for it to be exceptionally easy. Essays are graded very fairly, which means that you probably won't get an A. So take it if the syllabus looks good.",
    "TAKE THE COURSE!! Professor Guy is awesome and my love for sci-fi only increased as the course continued. The books are really interesting (although if you're not interested in gender and sexuality at all you may not find them as interesting as I did), and Guy is an excellent lecturer.",
    "Absolutely take this class, as long as you have the time to give it the attention it deserves. It is A LOT of reading and writing, and if you get far behind on either the experience won't be nearly as rewarding. I feel like I improved a lot as a thinker and a writer, but I wouldn't have seen that improvement if I hadn't busted my butt on every paper.",
    "Take it for the professor if nothing else - Prof. Guy is incredibly talented, helpful and fun. The novels are fantastic even if you're not a scifi fan, and it's not that much writing for a WR course. And the section TAs are all great too - the best section experience I've had at Yale.",
    "Great course, a lot of reading that's not necessarily required for fully enjoying the course, but well worth it if you do it. Definitely take if you have the space.",
    "Though I hadn't read much (if any) science fiction previously, I feel that I have a much expanded appreciation for and love of the material upon completing this course. If you're interested at all in pondering human identity and what it means to be human, TAKE THIS COURSE. Lectures and especially sections regularly blew my mind. Professor Guy is fantastic, as well; he really cares about his students!",
    "Gender studies through the lens of science fiction.",
    "JUST TAKE IT.",
    "Wholeheartedly recommend it to underclassmen. If you're a junior or senior, take it if you think you could be interested in Sci-Fi; Professor Guy will make it so. CHERISH HIM.",
    "Yes, I would definitely reccommend this course--I have recommended it to quite a few friends. There is quite a bit of reading, but it's almost all fiction, and doesn't feel like work. The papers have pretty open prompts and the nature of the texts makes them fun to write. Professor Guy is an excellent lecturer. The TFs all seem great but try getting into Megan E.'s section if she's there again. Her section was really interesting.",
    "So, yes and no. The course really commands a heavy amount of ambivalence. It's so good\/interesting but requires far too many pages. Let's say 'Shawn' has not taken it, and 'Terry' has. Shawn: So what was your favorite course last year? Terry: Hmm, Sci-Fi was definitely up there, engl132. S: Oh cool! It must have all the classics of the science fiction genre. I always wanted to read them. T: Umm, sure. Yeah, it has... Blade Runner, and Stranger in a Strange Land. And Cloud Atlas... Neuromancer. A LeGuin book. S: Sounds great! What kind of commitment level? Worth taking? T: Well... what's your reading speed? S: Idk, kinda normal, like 25 pages an hour or so. For novels, right? T: Yeah. Uhh, what number class would this be? Like in, how much time you would wanna give it? Already taking two tough courses or looking for one? S: [either \"It's not for my major...\" or \"I've already got two busy English classes...\"] ... so third to fourth class. T: Take it credit-d!! Two different weeks in the semester you get assigned a 400+ page novel and several other times it expects you to nail 300 pages in one week. Just a little math: (400 pp\/wk)\/(25 pp\/hr)= 16 hr\/wk. That's not every week, but it's a handful of times. And I've had peers cringe when I tell them my p-set (for which I had a week) lasted 15 hrs. It's definitely hard to make this your 'typical class' since what's typical across this class is (300 pp\/wk)\/(25 pp\/hr)= 12 hr\/wk and (4 classes)*(2.5 hrs\/class lecture and section + 12 hrs\/class homework) = 4*14.5 = 58 hrs\/wk. Honestly, I doubt most Yalies spend 10 hrs\/day 6 days\/wk or 11.5 hrs\/day 5 days\/wk working besides time spent eating, sleeping, showering, and laundry. And that's a 4-class schedule, not a 5-class one! And if you complain about my 25 pp\/hr estimate, here's why it's realistic.... English and literature courses should be developing students as close-readers and critical thinkers, especially at Yale where the best and the brightest go to become brighter. The development of these skills will only really come with an interaction with the text corresponding to reading with a pen in your hand. Most, if not all, students in the course should be making notes periodically as they read. Since you don't know which passages will be key before you read, you have to be willing to notate whenever, so most-to-all of the time you'll be slowed down by a note here or there. Most Yalies, and the average kid in the class, I guarantee you, will NOT read faster than 25 pp\/hr while taking notes. So if the teacher wants the kids to do all the reading AND actually get smarter, all of which the teacher should want, my estimates hold true. All of this yields why only 200 pp\/wk should be assigned: (5 classes)*((200 pp\/wk)\/(25 pp\/hr)+(2.5 hr\/wk lecture and section)) = 52.5 hr\/wk for a 5 course schedule, which sounds about right, during the weeks when you have no paper or midterm test on top of readings to do.",
    "If you like science fiction even a little bit, take this class. If you like discussing human nature, take this class. If you like The Matrix, Blade Runner, Rocky Horror Picture Show, take this class. If you want a fantastic professor, take this class.",
    "English 132 is a great class for science and nonscience majors. Everyone should try to take a class with Professor Guy. The class is definitely a lot of work, the readings are thick and tough, but it makes you re-evaluate who you are as a person. I can honestly say I have a different perspective on my own view of society by reading these texts and listening to Professor Guy discuss them. My suggestion would be to take it Credit-D-Fail, even though I didn't.",
    "It's a wonderful class, and gives you an excuse to read wonderful literature! The essays can be difficult to write though, and the grading definitely varies depending on who you have as your TA.",
    "Only take it if you have time to read a mid-sized novel almost every week, all semester. If you want to do this class right, you need to commit to spending the 5-10 hours to read the material in addition to the time demanded by semi-weekly assignments and weekly blog posts.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone that wants to broaden their access to science fiction, or anyone that wants a solid introductory English course. The reading list incorporates some of the classics of science fiction, whether text or film, and the lectures never failed to be both informative and entertaining.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Good readings, bad lectures. I loved Professor Guy personally but I think his lectures were structure rather poorly. Section was by far the best part of the class for me -- try to get in a good one. The essays were fine but the prompts were always a bit vague.",
    "Yes. I would highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction.",
    "Lecture-style English course about some of the greatest sci-fi works out there. If you're well seasoned in sci-fi or merely curious, take it and you won't regret it. There is a lot of reading though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. I really enjoyed the class, and I think both my writing and reading skills improved through the course of the semester. The readings were also interesting, so even heavy work weeks were enjoyable. However, the essays are quite challenging and the lectures are most rewarding when the reading is done beforehand, so I would take it either during a lighter semester or with an informed commitment to do all of the reading. I also highly recommend going to office hours-- Professor Guy is always a pleasure to talk to even if you have nothing in particular to say."
