This was a reasonable approach for someone stepping into preexisting curriculum and teaching a class for the first time, but didn't help me understand the scope of the course."

    "Classes were always prepared and the information within the presentation was presented well.",
    "He is very well pea pare with the presentation and document that he hand to student in class. He always have extra information and book for us to add more in the topic he taught.",
    "The classes were well structured with good PowerPoint presentations. The material felt somewhat inaccessible, however, so it wasn't always easy to engage with the lectures. Clearly students who take the class want to know about acoustics, but few of them want to be acousticians. The material covered was all good and important, but lacked a useful context for the audience. The key to making this class really successful will be to find the framework that allows all the same topics to be discussed in a way that makes the utility of these skills readily apparent."

   "comments": [
    "Either the course should cover a multitude of parts to the subject through individual assignments. Or the course should revolve around a single project and each assignment is a specific part of the project. For example: Assignment 1 - Do a ray tracing study of the space; Assignment 2 - calculate the total volume and each surface area of the space; Assignment 3 - calculate the reverberation times of the hall with and without the coupled volume; Assignment 4 - Compute the sound output of the HVAC system inside the hall; Assignment 5 - Compute the sound isolation necessary for 2 instances of noise, 1) Air Traffic and 2) Street noise through the walls. There are many ways to improve the course I think it is important to determine what should be the primary points to convey.",
    "This class is more about TDMP class in term of learning more about the structure of the building and less for sound designer. I wish the topic will be more about theatre. Like practical stuff that we can use in production for example how could we adduct the scenery that affect the sound in theatre. I have learn some math in this class but I do not know how could i apply that number to my design."
