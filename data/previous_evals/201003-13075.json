    "Yes",
    "pretty standard polisci course. no paper at the end which is nice.",
    "Pretty average class",
    "This course covers the main issues of American Foreign Policy. If you want to know more about current issues in the World, especially involving the US- TAKE THIS COURSE. Plus, the professor is great.",
    "Amazing class- not liberal hogwash, and very practical view of Poli Sci. Take it, and go to class.",
    "Good overview of US foreign policymaking. If you are a social sciences major or a frequent reader of the news, I can't say that you'll get too much out of this class, but you'll at least deal with some interesting stuff and have two cool assignments.",
    "I would recommend strongly against taking this class unless 1) you have no background whatsoever in American foreign policy, unlikely given that its only open to juniors and seniors or 2) you want an easy foreign policy class. Left A LOT to be desired.",
    "Great. Background knowledge of U.S. history is helpful but not super necessary.",
    "Definitely take this class. Gottlieb is the man, lectures aren't very hard to follow, not much work. You aren't held accountable for the readings, but they are interesting nonetheless. Midterm is take home, memo assignment is common sense, and the final isn't bad if you go to class.",
    "A survey course of america's involvement in the world from 1776 to 2010.",
    "I would definitely recommend Central Issues in American Foreign Policy to another student as a great, comprehensive and yet detailed course on the evolution and workings of American foreign policy. There's a ton of reading but it's not necessary to do it all, though it is great and super super interesting reading. The course may be a little challenging for those who have never taken a poli-sci or international studies course before, but it's a good into to the subject. The course is enjoyable, Professor Gottlieb is super helpful and a great lecturer, and the reading load, while huge, is manageable.",
    "The class isn't too hard or too much work, and the material is interesting, and necessary for a background in American foreign policy. It's a survey class, and you won't learn any new ideas, just basic concepts, but it's still a good class.",
    "This lecture is pretty good. Because of the handouts, you get bored sometimes since you don't have to take notes. He gives you a lot of material that is not necessary but interesting. The assessments are not bad either. I would take it if you want a look at the history of foreign policy and not solutions to contemporary issues",
    "Gottlieb does a brief history of US foreign policy since 1783, then analyzes formal\/informal institutions of policymaking, talks about the economy, Iraq\/Afghanistan, etc. Pretty interesting stuff if it's your thing, though I definitely saw a lot of overlap between this& other polisci or history courses I'd taken (especially Gaddis' Cold War).",
    "Yes yes yes.",
    "The course underlined the pivotal changes in changes in American foreign policy and outlined the US's success on the international stage in response to status, power, and militant expertise. It opened the student's eyes up to the world of controversial politics and showed how drastic some repercussions could be. It helped us to understand how difficult policy making can be but also how crucial those decisions turn out to be in the future.",
    "Basically US history for the first half with a focus on foreign policy. Then you learn about how policy is made in government. Then it is a large focus on current issues.",
    "This class looks at the foreign policy making process and how policy is created and executed. Traces the implications of foreign policy making from the birth of the U.S. to the present.",
    "Absolutely recommended. Gottlieb is great.",
    "Yes. Gottlieb is a very engaging lecturer, and the course isn't too difficult. Some of the more liberal students may not be used to a professor willing to criticize both parties though. (But this is one of the course's biggest strengths.)",
    "Very fun class and very interesting stuff--assignments are even fun at times--take home midterm, policy memo and final--if you're interested in the subject, you'll have no trouble digesting everything--and you don't have to do most of the reading btw",
    "Take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot more than most other Political Science courses. The material is relevant to America's current foreign policy and it is very thought provoking.",
    "Great Poli Sci and IR course, that is definitely worth taking.",
    "Great course! Gottlieb is a phenomenal lecturer and if you are interested in learning about modern foreign policy and its evolution through the eyes of the timeless debates that have been going on since our nation's founding, take the course!",
    "Yes definitely. This is material every student should know, and Gottlieb makes the class interesting and fun.",
    "yeah take the class, its an important thing to know and you will appreciate your understanding of history and the evolution of FP",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You do not need any advanced knowledge of foreign policy, though a brief (high school-level) background in American history is helpful, and it's not theory-heavy at all. Though there are a lot of readings, the assignments are very doable (take home midterm, policy paper, and final). It's a good class for anyone interested in American history of current events.",
    "Great survey course of American Foreign Policy.",
    "Gottlieb is a good lecturer and the material is interesting. The first half of the course is a lot of history, while the second half is more political theory \/ how our political system works \/ themes etc. Though there is a lot of assigned reading, it is more for your benefit and you dont have to do any of it to do well in the class.If you are at all interested in American history or politics, take this class.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it. Not too much work. Very interesting lectures.",
    "In this class, you'll see the history, institutions, and current challenges of the US foreign policy machine. To get the most from this class, you really have to do the reading. While one can get away with just writing about what you already know, it defeats the purpose of taking this course. Gottlieb is funny yet crams a large amount of information into every minuteof his lectures.",
    "This class is interesting and relatively easy. Attending lecture and paying attention was enough to succeed. The course isn't as intense or in-depth as I would have expected, with it being a junior\/senior only foreign policy class. That being said, I did learn some things, and Prof. Gottlieb is an interesting, engaging lecturer.",
    "really great class. TONS of reading- i took it credit\/d to relieve some of the pressure, but that probably wasn't necessary; i think you can do well without doing all of the reading. the class moves VERY quickly, especially at the beginning (and it's kind of a shock to the system to have to take hand-written notes), but it's all REALLY interesting and relevant.",
    "Don't believe the positive reviews. Gets really repetitive toward the end of the course, and although a lot of the material is interesting, there is a lot of bland, repetitive reading as well. This could have been a 50 minute class with half the readings and I would have gotten just as much from it.",
    "Yes, take it even if you're not Poli Sci.",
    "Take-home midterm, Short memo, Final. Course Load was simply, but there are a lot of readings. The readings aren't crucial to the papers and tests, but they can help to be an A student. Good class, I'd take it.",
    "Pretty solid overall course with not too much work.",
    "INTS 376 is just one of those classes that you're sure you're going to take on the very first day of shopping it. Prof. Gottlieb is possibly one of the most versatile, informed and engrossing lecturers I have come across at Yale and adds tremendously to the already-engaging topicsthat the course covers. There are just 2 assignments - a paper and a policy memorandum - both of which are enjoyable and very doable. The final was also very reasonable. The readings may seem like a lot but they are well-chosen and interesting-you also don't have to do all of them. Take this class whether you're a poli sci\/ints major or not. You'll come out with a solid grasp on American foreign policy from 1776 to present and its link to domestic politics, and probably not want to miss a single lecture along the way.",
    "Great class, great professor. The memo assignment is somewhat arbitrarily graded. You could do no reading and get a better grade than others that do the reading since you're not really asked to involve the readings in your responses. Just go to lecture and try hard on the assignments when they come up, and you'll get an A- or A.",
    "Yes. Highly informative course.",
    "Yes, it was an extremely interesting class.",
    "Great class, very interesting material, awesome professor.",
    "Take it. Pretty interesting and not too hard",
    "Definitely recommend for any student interested in the history and theories of US foreign relations.",
    "It is a great introductory course to US foreign policies. It has manageable workload but lots of assigned reading (no need to read all but a good amount). I would recommend it wholeheartedly - it's one of the best courses I have taken at Yale.",
    "The lectures are very interesting, and the two written assignments during the semester are very fair. The reading load is huge, however, and come exam time it's hard to know what is the most important and what isn't. But it's a good class if you're interested in American Foreign Policy.",
    "Take it if you like military history.",
    "Good but too basic at times",
    "This class is a good overview of major themes in Foreign Policy from the founding of the country to the present. Rather than discuss everything in detail, the class is organized around major themes. There is lots of reading, but they are generally very interesting and the lectures are good. Take this class, and go to sections, even though they're optional, because the TAs are great and it really helps your grade.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone, it is important to take.",
    "Yes. I took it CR\/D but still went most of the time because it was really good."
