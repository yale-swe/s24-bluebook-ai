    "The class discussions were on the whole very good, some of the best I've had at Yale. The field trip tothe Yale Farm was good, and I enjoyed the lightening presentations at the end of the course.",
    "The readings were very interesting and, even though it may have been overwhelming or annoying at the time, being forced to write weekly reading responses was a truly helpful exercise.",
    "I really enjoyed and learned a lot from the readings. I also enjoyed having guest speakers and hearing their perspectives.",
    "Great group for discussion. Very interesting concepts. Loved the anti-oppression exercise and the broad coverage of readings.",
    "The breadth of course readings was nice, since it gave us a good perspective on many current issues in the field. Also, the organization of the course seemed to bring us back to recurring themes from different angles which was nice, since concepts began to build on each other in interesting ways, which made class discussions get much richer as the course went on.",
    "BEST CLASS AT FES BY FAR. I loved it. Not only was the material so helpful in my critical thinking, the class was dynamic, the readings relevant and Kristin did a great job at facilitating while not dominating the discussion. Discussions were great and sometimes pushed some comfort levels, but the class also simultaneously was a very safe space and very encouraging. A testament to the class is that we sort of became a little family toward the end and I always looked forward to it."

   "comments": [
    "The reading list could be tightened up a bit -- it seemed like there was a fair amount of repetition in topics and content.",
    "The course was mostly discussion-based, which was good, but sometimes the discussions needed more structure and seemed to ramble in odd directions. I think having a concluding comment from the instructor at the end of each discussion would have helped tie things together and leave students with a better sense of what just took place.",
    "Would be great if there were a little more structure to the discussion. Maybe at the end of the day the professor could leave the class with some thinking points to connect weekly sessions after our broader conversations.Expected it to be a bit more practical\/geared to actors in the field about how to dismantle oppression in the food system. It did give us the mindset, but not a bunch of practical contacts with actors or experiences. Was very theoretical, but interesting nonetheless.",
    "I think some (very few) of the readings could be changed in order to be more current or more helpful. There were two or three that seemed to contribute less to the course than they should have.",
    "More feedback\/grading during semester to reading responses."
