   "comments": [
    "unique course (compared to other courses we were taking at YSPH). helpful for interviews, job search",
    "I felt that the material we covered was very essential for our professional careers. However, the way in which it was taught was not effective. For example, we would have to make a powerpoint without any guidelines before class and then find out during the class that we might have a lot of errors in our powerpoint. How is that going to help us if we're set up for failure? One student asked if we could have the guidelines ahead of time and a very convoluted, complex \"no\" was a response.I also didn't think that public speaking session was helpful because we were put right on the spot to discuss a topic without preparation. For myself, I take a lot of time preparing for public speaking so I obviously did not perform my best when I spoke without any preparation.",
    "Strength- Instructor is goodWeakness- Lacks personal assessment of each student",
    "The course is a good idea but I did not agree with the execution. All the topics were really good ones and they will help us in the future. The problem I saw was that the instructors were not that serious sometimes and did not even listen or critique properly. There was a week when they had limited instructors and one was looking over 2 groups which made that weeks assignment a joke. Hopefully that can make it more meaningful.",
    "I thought it had a lot of potential but they weren't able to get the buy in of a lot of students which was damaging to its effectiveness.",
    "Get to know some basic skills need at work, which is really useful.",
    "Great",
    "improve our professional skills",
    "I am very grateful to have had the chance to take this Professional Skills seminar. At first, I was not convinced that having it during the first semester of our time at YSPH was most appropriate, but now I am grateful that I am aware of presentation, communication, writing, etc. skills that will surely help me in my internship search. It was very helpful to have the 'coaches' there to provide individualized feedback.",
    "I think this class should be optional. For students with work experience, this class is a waste of time.",
    "I believe you will get a lot of negative responses about this course. I must tell you many of them are misguided. As you know many of the students here are straight from undergrad. To be blunt they wouldnt know what it is like to work a real day in their life it it hit them in the face. I feel like they had a more difficult time seeing the importance of this course. Yes. Having a course on a friday afternoon, especially while half of the YSPH friend dont have it is rough. It actually makes us mad. Angry we have to take it. I believe most of your feedback will be around this. The first two lecturers I think were very important. I believe the course can be condensed into probably 3 classes to be honest. I think we can have a lot of hand outs of videos to watch. Making this a required module with a test at the end to supplement the other 3 classes that wont be in session (due to shortening) would make it a lot easier. (sorry that isnt succinct response). I have already noticed the way I give presentations have changed slightly from what I have learned which means this class has been invaluable. I think it should be taught in the Spring instead.",
    "I know Dr. Vance is very well respected, but I do not think he gained respect of the class and this didn't help with our attention to what he had to say. I don't think this class went the way it did because YSPH students don't care about professional development... We do! We really do! It's just that his teaching style and content was not very relatable to what we needed to be doing. I have plenty of ideas on how to improve this, so let me know if you want to talk more about it. Bo",
    "A few helpful suggestions, but overall not helpful for the stage of life of most first-year students - we are unlikely to be running meetings during our first year as students (and less likely to remember all of his pointers down the road).",
    "It helps to get a quick grasp of the basic professional skills needed in the outside world. It would probably be more helpful if it took place in smaller groups over the whole semester.",
    "Strengths: this course would be relevant to any professional student, within and outside the school of public health.Weaknesses: although the material appeared to be interesting, some of the ways that it was displayed in did not entice students to be as engaged and responsive to the course as they could have been.",
    "Very important topics to cover, but the way modules were structured didn't always teach these topics in the most effective way. For example, the public speaking module was fairly unhelpful in giving a 5 minute speech on the fly (i.e. without much preparation), while I would guess the majority of professional speeches given would provide more preparation time. Students were not asked if they consented to being filmed twice. Although important to learn and practice these skills early in our careers, it seemed unfair to assign a no-credit, 2 hour seminar on Friday afternoons in what is recognized as one of the semesters with the most time spent in class. I found it hard to stay engaged in a no-credit class held on Friday afternoons. The tips Dr. Vance provided were helpful in looking back on the 6 week course. I found the panel and presentation modules the most helpful.",
    "Strengths: Everything we learn is directly applicable to things we are expected to do in real life. I used the lessons even during the second half of the semester when I took the course.Weaknesses: We should not practice skills on real public health issues, but we should use extremely fake scenarios so we can not push people's buttons.",
    "It was helpful, but could have been more helpful.",
    "material was interesting and useful , but the class didn't need to be two hours long. a short lecture with some practice would make the class feel less drawn out. also, maybe if the course weren't at 2pm on a friday, we would feel a little more engaged.",
    "Could be improved if it focused on topics that can be covered in such a short amount of time or if it was extended to be a year long course.",
    "the course teaches students valuable skills. Theoretically it is a very good class. I did learn most from the break out groups",
    "Love this course. It provides very useful content and help us improve areas we didn't pay attention to previously.",
    "strengths- the information on good powerpoints, how to interact in meetings, negotiations etc.improved: the time really made it an annoyance, finding a different day or time would make a difference",
    "Provided informative information---immediately applicable.",
    "This class could be beneficial, but the structure and timing of the course was not working. First semester students have a lot of other things to worry about than learning how to conduct a panel in a professional manner. Doesn't apply to us yet, and Fridays at 2pm is not a good time for a class very few people care about.",
    "Some of the content was interesting, but having it required made it more of a hassle than a tool.Such a class was requested by previous students to provide specific professional skills training. Individual seminars should be voluntary- and then based on attendance the instructors would clearly know what students value as professional training and what they do not.Many sessions were tedious, lengthy, and provided no opportunity for personal growth.",
    "- These topics are very important as we launch into our careers. So I really appreciate these topics. I think anyone who has worked prior to coming to the program can attest to the fact that it's now what you do, but how you sell it that matters. So it's critical to always be professional and mindful of how you come across to others.- I wonder if these skills can be developed as part of the overall MPH curriculum and taught throughout the two years. Like a full-semester course or built into the existing courses.- Since it was the first year of the course and we didn't know about it until getting here, I think there was a negative reaction towards this course. It was packaged like an add-on in an existing busy time. I think this'll improve if the incoming class already expects to take this class. So I'd say work on the messaging. Also, students need to understand that some of the skills being practiced will feel uncomfortable. It's a very different type of learning than writing papers or studying for exams. So of course you're going to feel silly when watching yourself on camera.- The breakouts are a good place to practice these skills.",
    "It's a very helpful and practical course. I use the skills that I have learned from this course everyday, even when I am not interviewing or giving public presentations!",
    "This seminar was a joke. I was at times offended that this was mandatory, as the entire thing was a complete waste of time.For example, one Friday session focused on running meetings. We were asked to fabricate a meeting topic and assign other members of our group to play certain roles. Then, we would each practice taking minutes. I pretended to run a meeting that focused on organizing a bake sale. Conveniently enough, my group members consisted of an avid baker, a fan of grocery shopping, and a family member of a nearby orchard. I submitted my fake meeting minutes, riddled with typos and grammatical errors, to William Vance who just replied \"great.\" Again, it was a joke.Another Friday, our \"skills coach\" was wearing a button-down blouse so tight that her bust was causing gaping holes between the buttons. Good thing she was wearing a very nice bra.Yet another Friday, William Vance had us print out seven copies of some document we were to use during class. The document he sent ended up having one word on a second page, so we all had to print 14 sheets. Then, we were assigned to work in groups of four - not seven. It was another example of the inherent irony involved with this cast of characters teaching \"professional skills.\"Prior to starting at Yale I worked as a Scientific Recruiter, placing scientists (from entry to director-level) in companies throughout Los Angeles. I mention this, because I would never send William to any of my clients for an interview.I highly recommend discontinuing the seminar. If real professional skills are the goal, the course should discuss resume writing\/tailoring, when to show up for an interview and what to wear, how and when to negotiate salary, etc. How is spending my Friday taking fake meeting minutes going to improve my professionalism?Please feel free to contact me directly with any questions.",
    "The course was very effective at teaching me skills that apply not only in professional settings, but also more casual and social settings.",
    "I liked the idea of this class, but it was not run very well. Having it on a Friday afternoon for 2 hours is probably the worst time of the week to have this seminar. I liked the 1st half of every class where we would get a little lesson on the skill of the week. But the 2nd hour felt very rushed\/contrived to try to actually put the skill into practice.",
    "Useful course that will definitely be helpful in my professional career. Though, I believe we should be spending more time on public speaking, interviewing, and networking. We only spent one class on some of the areas, we definitely need more.",
    "I think that this class could be incredible useful. Unfortunately, the timing isn't conducive to the first year (first semester) schedule. I found it difficult to prioritize a class that we do not receive grades for (even if the subject matter is useful) when we are just being introduced to some new, difficult topics like biostatistics and epidemiology.",
    "I thought the course presented some useful information to students about succeeding in a professional workplace. I really thought the public speaking and presentation portions were very helpful because the experience of watching yourself speak on film and critiquing it is beneficial and constructive.Much of the other material, however, did not beneficial. For example, we talked about negotiating, but not about salary negotiations, the one skill I would have actually sincerely liked to learn about. I've been taught about conflict negotiation since third grade, and in about the same format. It would have been nice to practice a salary negotiation instead or learn what that process is like.Additionally, it was taught as if we had never worked in the professional world when in fact many of the MPH students have years of successful work experience behind them. I would have liked to see more input from students on what skills they actually wanted to learn instead of the very basics many of us had been taught before.Also, it was taught very much as if we were all intending to work in 1980s America - where rich, white, older men dominate and customs are very traditional.While some fields may be slower to modernize than others, I don't think many of us will actually be in those particular work settings for the rest of our lives. For one thing, most of the workplace skills and expectations he discussed are specific to the United States, and even just certain areas of the U.S. Furthermore, many of the things would not be appropriate for some non-profit settings (like many of the ones I have previously worked with in my past). He was speaking to an international group of students, with a broad background of professional experience in a range of settings throughout the world and took none of that into consideration. It seemed as though Dr. Vance thought that the material he presented was absolute fact throughout all settings just because it has been his experience.Some of the content was beneficial, and the concept is good - Professional Skills is very practical and useful for our future. The breakout section format was great and I loved the chance to work in small groups with the breakout session leaders. I would definitely keep that part, but maybe get rid of the lectures, and\/or dramatically change the delivery of content by Dr. Vance.",
    "Having more time to specifically cover and practice the lessons taught in class would be ideal. It would be beneficial to offer additional workshops. Also a class or workshop on contract negotiation would be helpful.",
    "I thought the class was really helpful in learning best way to handle ourselves professionally. I think it would be better if it was maybe an hour or an hour and a half rather than 2 hours.",
    "Exercises were great (public speaking, panels etc.)",
    "Great idea, but needs improvement on the structure. Having itfriday evenings isn't the most motivating strategy to attend class.",
    "I didn't really benefit from being in this course.",
    "Good topics, but the weakness was that the instructors for the group breakout sessions were rotated which made it difficult to gauge ones project. For the first two classes the groups and the breakout instructor should be the same since the second class builds of the first.",
    "This was a great course, very necessary for professional life after graduation (and before). I feel like a picked up many useful skills.",
    "This course had many merits. I especially enjoyed the negotiation lesson. However, I felt that there are a wide variety of students within our class with varying professional experiences.I think it would have been personally more beneficial for me if I could have picked a certain number of sessions to attend (perhaps with a minimum number of sessions necessary). I have a great deal of experience writing professional emails and memos, and found that lecture to be an inefficient use of my time during my already busy semester. Having more choice about attending specific sessions would have provided more personal control for students in terms of crafting their professional skills.I would also suggest that the course be reformatted to be more like the Tropical Medicine course format, whereby it occurs during the evenings and food is provided. This may help students to view it as the bonus instruction that it is rather than a bothersome activity on Friday afternoons.",
    "it was too easy, and there is a lack of consistency between coaches and their ability to be critical.If they made it harder and took more time to give us critical feed backs I think many of our classmate would be more respectful.",
    "The strengths of this course was providing students with a general overview of how to develop professional skills. The course content providing useful tools that could be implemented immediately. The way in which the sessions were conducted allowed for feedback from several coaches. The weaknesses are that it was too short in duration and met too infrequently to really put into practice the tools and tips that were taught during lecture.",
    "Overall, I think the course provided students with an awareness of some areas that are important to consider in professional interactions, which I'm sure will be helpful, especially for those who have not worked in a professional environment.I wonder if it would be more helpful to focus on fewer topics in more depth rather than have such a broad range of topics. I think students could have benefited from more practice in some of the skill areas (such as public speaking).",
    "I thought the course had good principles to teach, but it is not very effective to teach it at such a time on Friday afternoons because it holds us back from so many other opportunities and networking events in other schools, such as SOM and HGS.",
    "It was good learning experience. Would have been nice to get credit for it. The time was a bit tedious.",
    "It gave us chance to practice",
    "Good, and very helpful.",
    "Strengths: topics it attempts to cover, some useful information obtainedWeaknesses: course instructor's demeanor, limited feedback, not enough time to get adequate training from the courseWays to improve: I had doubts about this course but I actually think it could be a really useful seminar. First, we need to have adequate amount of time to prepare. I definitely did not want extra work outside of class for a no-credit seminar, but it was really stressful to be told to come up with a speech topic in five minutes to be critiqued on. No one can get adequate feedback on a speech they haven't practiced. You're too busy trying to come up with your next line to concentrate on the skills taught that day. Also, it is useless to turn in real assignments (like the memo) and not get any feedback on it. Perhaps this could be an optional course for credit, and it could be a weekly class for the semester.",
    "Excellent preparation and strengthening of professional skills.",
    "This course was a great resource for helping refine professional skills, and it covered a broad array of useful, necessary topics. My only critique is that since there were so many things to cover, specific topics may not have received all of the attention that they deserved or could have used. I would actually recommend that, if possible, this course be extended to an entire semester in length to give the appropriate topics the attention they deserve, as all of the material will be useful going forward.",
    "Great class, just poor planning. No way to give this class adequate attention in the first semester, generally considered to be the most overwhelming, at grad school.",
    "great",
    "not quite helpful",
    "excellent course and useful",
    "The course was good but there were some sessions I found more helpful then others. The public speaking and presentation modules were the most beneficial to me. I think for students who have already been in the workforce and have many of the skills the workshop goes over this might not be the most beneficial seminar. Perhaps if you had to go to three out of the total number of sessions and were able to pick the ones that were skills you actually wanted to work on it may have been better.",
    "The course consisted of some of the important skills required for professionals. However, it could be improved if the class time was changed to an earlier time of the day and if it was little bit shorter.",
    "This course had the potential to be really valuable in imparting important skills to a class of budding professionals, but fell miserably short of my expectations. Perhaps it is because I am going into Health Care Management and thus have already honed my communications skills myself, but I found the information to be useless and an affront to prior communication workshops I have taken. I would argue that these skills are useful for people who maybe have spent less time in the past in positions that require such communication and interaction, but I did not get anything out of this course. Because the course was not graded, no one took the assignments seriously as we simply did not have time to devote to this on top of our other classes and coursework. Also, the timing of the class was horrible. I often had to miss other lectures or seminars I was truly interested in to attend this valueless seminar.",
    "This should not be a mandatory course.",
    "Very useful course. I don't think people appreciated how useful it was due to the fact that it was on Friday afternoon.",
    "The professional skills course was very helpful. The exercises were all very helpful and it was great to have feedback from fellow students. I think the sessions for first years can be moved from Friday afternoon to late morning or some other weekday afternoon. This is because from 2-4pm on Friday afternoon can be a tough time because we were all very tired by then.",
    "Strengths: provided real-world examples, tips, and tricks on presentations, meeting facilitation, writing e-mails\/memos, among other things.Weaknesses: scheduling -- it absolutely should not take place on a Friday, sequence of topics (e-mail\/memo should have been first), inappropriate comments made about Asian women (poor handshakers, ways accent reduction was brought up), breaking out into groups was clunky (organizers should look into easier ways of doing that -- perhaps a laptop for attendance so names can be sorted based on who attends), attendance sheet and associated materials (e.g., meeting facilitation agenda templates) has misspelled names which meant the post-work was not complete for all and typing up and e-mailing minutes for a practice exercise was inappropriate given the many deadlines and real assignments first semester students are already juggling.",
    "pretty sure i already evaluated this when i finished mid semester...it is amazing how ineffective a communicator dr vance is considering it is his business and research. not sure if ive ever come across a more calculated, robotic speaker in my life. any credibility set up for him by his credentials is completely overshadowed when he speaks. i think his advice is valid and certainly worthwhile, but there is no question in my mind that it needs to be delivered by a competent and engaging lecturer. there is not a person in my class who thinks dr vance fits that bill. its too bad, the class had a lot of potential.",
    "Strengths--teaching something that is not normally part of university curriculum. Breaking the ice really quickly (by this I mean that having us do our public speaking in the first lecture took the fear out of the remaining sessions). The instructor is also very knowledgeable and brings many examples from real-life.Weaknesses--they did not provide feedback in all of our assignments (e.g. they never revised our memos and I would have liked comments on that).To improve--It should be a semester long course since it was so good. Lecture should take longer since the info is so interesting.",
    "Since this class required work out of the classroom, it seems unfair that it was only a 0 credit seminar. The idea of this seminar is great, but it was not properly executed.",
    "The class was good and we learned a lot of useful information. I enjoyed the public speaking assignments. I think the class would have been better if it was structured to our divisions during the break out sessions.",
    "There were a few weeks that were really useful, such as how to give a good presentation and how to conduct meetings. However, when the courses were discussing things such as \"what is charisma,\" when the topic was very vague and it made a lot of sweeping generalizations.",
    "Very good introduction of important topics regarding how to behave in a professional environment.I feel that some people were put off by the aims of the course because they did not fully understand its importance. Emphasizing this with more \"peer instructors\" sharing real life stories in class might be a good way to bring the point home for students.",
    "Good",
    "Useful information, but it was a tough lecture time.",
    "I overall really enjoyed that class and considered it a finishing school for professionals. I also liked it because I was in the 2nd year\/ AP class and it felt that everyone there also wanted to be there. I really think this helps with any sort of class.My only improvement for the class would be to have more sessions since I really enjoyed what I learned.",
    "The lessons learned are very valuable however the course is very long",
    "Great course in theory, but poor execution.",
    "Useful skills to use in the future.",
    "The course was good at providing feedback on how students should conduct themselves in the professional world. However, I don't believe the students were prepared for the type of course this was going to be (you're going to find out how you conduct yourself and the feedback won't be sugarcoated...something that older students with some professional experience would be prepared for) and were put off by the instructor and the course.",
    "I think the timing of the course wasn't good. It's our first semester at Yale and many of us are getting acclimated to grad school and ivy league rigor. It felt like extra needless work that isn't graded. The content was very good, but hard to care about with all of the other obligations going on first semester.",
    "The intentions of the course is good, but the execution was poor. The course should be more practical. Some suggestions would be helping students take a professional photo used for online networking sites such as LinkedIn. Also, there should be workshops where we can do mock interviews and such.",
    "I love the content!",
    "Overall a good guide for professional skills. May benefit from by having more job interview tips.",
    "This course was only given too us because the second years felt like they needed it. If every class is as unique as we are led to believe, how can anyone be certain that we would need a course like this? More importantly, why not ask us directly? We are not children, so I think we are capable of making decisions for ourselves.That aside, this course was not a complete waste of time. I received fantastic feedback from one instructor whose name escapes me (caucasian lady, brown curly hair, glasses). She was excellent.",
    "There was a lot to learn from this course but I found it very condescending at times. Some of us have had experience working, it's patronizing when someone tells you how to write an email in a certain manner. I thought I was attending a masters program and not back to high school. I understand that there is a large spectrum of student. I think the sections should be split by those who have work experience and those who do not, and not by last names.",
    "It still has too much off a business focus. Try to broaden it for non-business types of professionalism that is needed",
    "Important range of topics.",
    "Strengths: I liked the public speaking help. Videotaping us was really helpful. I didn't like that we had to come up with a speech about public health given we were so new to the field (I was in the first group). Also coming up with a Power Point was annoying since I didn't have access to my old ones. Creating a Power Point for a class I'm not receiving credit for was frustrating.",
    "It was a good course. I learned skills that I can apply during my professional career.",
    "This course offered some very good advice on how to organize and deliver a speech and a power point presentation, as well as how to organize and lead a group meeting and how to best organize a short persuasive written piece. The main points were worthwhile and memorable. However, there was also a lot of material in this course that was simply annoying. The course presented a lot of advice on how to act in interpersonal settings. I found much of this to be oriented to the American corporate world - such as having a confident handshake and smiling all the time and saying thank you at every turn. This was superficial and was not a good \"fit\" for the medical\/public health world.",
    "It's an excellent course to help you build up skills in public speaking as well as professional communication and interactions.The classes are well organized and progress step by step, especially helpful for international students.",
    "good",
    "Overall, the course was extremely helpful and offered great advice and practical suggestions. I gained the most from the breakout sessions where we got individual feedback.",
    "This course taught very useful tips to prepare students for professional public speaking, presentation and writing correspondence. The break-out sessions are particularly suited to put the theory into practice. The skills learned in this course may be further strengthened and reinforced if there are more sessions to practice",
    "Boring. Also didn't like it being on Friday. Kinda helpful, though. Public speaking part, in particular.",
    "This course is fundamental to our careers but it tries to cover too much, we can not practice what we learn in class sufficiently. To improve it I would make for modules to be taken each semester and divide the course into this four modules ad in this way be able to really improve your skills by practicing more than once each skill.",
    "great.",
    "The course covers interesting and undoubtedly important skills. It was great to have formal training on these things but some of the assignments seemed tedious, and given workload from other classes and the fact that this was a seminar, did not receive full effort. The timing and day did also not work in its favor.",
    "Great course that provides many useful skills. The course covers a lot of material, and should really be a whole semester instead of half a semester. The instructors were great and very knowledgable and did a great job in engaging the students.",
    "STRENGTHS: I liked the format. The lectures provided information and tips that could then be applied during the breakout sessions. I also liked that time was allocated at the end of the breakout sessions for debriefing and giving feedback. WEAKNESSES: The Friday afternoon class time was the worst part of the course. I understand that it can be difficult to find a time when no one has another class, but Friday afternoons are valuable time (e.g. homework, work). Maybe the professional skills seminar could be incorporated into a longer orientation. Just an idea! IMPROVEMENTS: I would have been useful to have access to the slides in advance of the lectures to look over.",
    "very good course, can be structured for better delivery",
    "There were some useful pieces of information, however much of the material was not necessary for those who have substantial work experience before starting their MPH. I feel this course is necessary only for people who have little or no previous work experience."

    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0engaging speaker. I appreciated his professionalism - never once late for class (unfortunately, many well meaning and nice professors have been late to class before in my student career) and things ended on time.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance tends to profile people. He made several comments about international students and Asians and how they tend to be timid and less adept individuals.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Good. Dr. Vance is knowledgeable and very helpful.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Brilliant",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0I found him offensive sometimes when he would explain in the beginning. I think he needs to take care about what he says in the lecture. And he was not that engaging enough to generate valid interest in the lecture. It was on a Friday afternoon and it could have helped if the instructor was a little more entertaining and funny but yet great at his\/her job.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Good instructor.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Great",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0great",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0It is clear that Dr. Vance knows a great deal about professionalism, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to hear his advice. The examples that came from real scenarios that Dr. Vance provided throughout his lectures were especially effective. I found it quite helpful to be able to ask him specific questions about professional situations I faced in the past and how best to handle them in the future.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very professional.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance is a smart professor. He knows his stuff. I commend him for taking the afternoons to teach us. A few of his comments I think were definitely found offensive to some. Talking about different cultures and such...",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance is a good person, but I didn't necessarily get much out of his class. Maybe I didn't put the effort I needed to into the class, but I truly didn't ever feel a desire. Dr. Vance could have related better to the class.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0I found William Vance incredibly condescending and often border-line rude. Surprising, given his career is focused around interactions with other people. One of the breakout group instructors was also (unnecessarily) rude and catty.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He provides useful insight to the subject.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Although Dr. Vance did offer some important points as to how to improve our professional skills, some of the manners in which he delivered this message could have been construed as negative. In several occasions, he made references that appeared to single out groups of individuals which could have been explained in a different manner, and some of the goals of the course did not appear to be clarified until much later in the course.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance is clearly very knowledgable but as stated above, breakout sessionswere not always as helpful as one hour sessions. Additionally, he perhaps does not always express ideas in the most culturally sensitive or politically correct manner (e.g. telling \"all the Asian women in the room\" to make sure to shake hands firmly; calling international students \"internationals\", etc).",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Strengths: Runs the course in a very organized and intuitive wayWeaknesses: I could do without the racist remarks (teaching us not to shake hands like an Asian women) and clearly embellished or made up stories.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very good, knows his stuff",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Not approachable.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Vance was okay. I felt at times he was a little condescending and frustrated with class participation. But he is clearly passionate about the subject material which was refreshing.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0ironically the instructor is a bit socially awkward.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Love William Vince. He is very knowledgeable and makes good suggestions to students.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0I found a lot of things he said extremely offensive.\"I have never met an asian woman with a firm handshake\" and calling people \"internationals\" was really a huge turn off and made me not respect or want to listen to him",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Presented information well, but could have provided material earlier for students to study over and prepare ahead of time.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He's pretty painful to listen to, considering he's supposed to be the one teaching us how to be better presenters.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He's very knowledgable on this topic, but his style is very different than all the other professors at YSPH. So there might be some negative reactions to this. Overall, I found that he was very concerned about how the course was received. I think he should make sure that he sets the stage for his examples being business oriented.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0His constructive criticism are helpful. He is strict, not very approachable. His personality and style are robot-like.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0William made inappropriate comments throughout the course regarding race and gender. I didn't take anything personally, but I heard others mention it.I did not find him engaging, but instead robotic and scripted. I'd never say this about any other instructor, but because this is professional skills training...his suits are way too big.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Professor Vance was very insensitive to students, very condescending, and way too often boasted about Yale. He knew the material well and I think he did a very good job designing the curriculum in an effective way, but his interactions with students were often degrading, especially the times when he made racist and sexist comments to students.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0I felt like Mr. Vance was condescending toward the students.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Mr. Vance was definitely knowledgeable about the subject matter. My biggest complaint was that for a class on professional skills, he doesn't necessarily display the charisma and relatability that one might expect. For a class on professional skills, I would not only expect someone who is professional (which he is), but someone who seems homogeneously personable in an office setting.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Clearly Dr. Vance has a rich background in the field of communications and experience in the field. He had some useful content to deliver to students with regards to communication and presentation skills.However, his delivery is so poor it is very hard to gain much from his presentations. Yes, his communication is textbook perfect. But he does not relate to his audience, nor does he try. He seems to look down on us as incompetent professionals, though many of us have successful professional experience of our own. He was condescending to students and arrogant about his own views and experiences. He referred to international students as \"internationals\" and made broad generalizations about whole groups of people that I found offensive. He once said that he \"had never met an Asian women with a strong enough handshake\". Under what circumstances is that appropriate? When he spoke to students in the break out sessions he was kind of harsh with his criticism, and always condescending.I am sure he intends well and is trying to be highly professional, but he instead comes across as completely unapproachable, pretentious, and someone that it is very hard to accept criticism from. Furthermore, textbook communication skills are not necessarily ideal communication skills - sometimes a more warm and open and less formal style are appropriate, particularly when speaking with young professionals.As emerging professionals, we bring our own unique energy, technological skills, language style, and culture to the professional world and it would be great if that was recognized and supported.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very intelligent and very well versed in his subject matter.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0William Vance is rude and has said quite a few racist and offensive remarks, not directed at anyone in particular, but to the whole class.He should know that it's not ok to say things like he's never met an Asian woman with a good handshake, or when women speak up in meetings they have to watch themselves or else they'll sound bitchy. not appreciated, especially from someone who's teaching us how to be professional.I know he's well qualified and good at what he does, but he should watch what he says",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Seems to know what he is doing, although at times his mannerisms and the way he speaks are a bit robotic and seem forced\/fabricated.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance is very knowledgeable and it was great to learn from him.Came off as culturally insensitive at times, but otherwise, great instructor to learn from.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance has crafted many ideas that one learns on the job into short tips. It is definitely helpful to have these tips reinforced, though I suspect that without the real world experience to contextualize these tips may be less useful. In certain circumstances, I felt that he could have be more politically correct during his lectures.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He is nice, and very good at what he does, but he really should single out asian females and call out people in our school by their names less. Hearing about how my dean shuffles is not a good experience, and I am frankly offended at how unprofessional he was. He could have easily omitted identities, and removed some snark with many of his anecdotes.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance was very clear in the lecture portion of the class.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance made it difficult to pay attention during class with some of his comments. The slides were structured well though, and the breakout sessions were well done.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0William Vance really knew his stuff!",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Helpful",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Interesting, but feedback from the professor would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0This instructor is clearly enthusiastic about this topic. However, this mostly comes off as condescending towards students which takes away from the class. There were multiple episodes of his speech becoming offensive and talking down to students, some of which I have written about in previous reviews so won't repeat here.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance was direct and forthcoming, professional and generally received questions well. Some students viewed him as unfriendly\/unapproachable due to calling attention in class to late-comers and those who were disruptive or holding side conversations, but I appreciated that he had high expectations and a strong command of the class.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance did a great job teaching the course and highlighting important skills and practices that will certainly be encountered in the professional world. The assistants he brought in to facilitate the breakout sessions also were of great help and they did a good job providing personalized feedback.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0If you paid attention to this guy, you learned a ton. I wish people didn't ignore this class as much as they did, but I completely understand considering the unrealistic expectations caused by our overall workloads.",

    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr Vance is kind and warm-hearted",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance is offensive, sexist, and rude. I found him to be a horrible instructor for this course. He often referred to Asian students as the \"internationals,\" which I found horribly demeaning and offputting. He commonly made sexist remarks about how women fall to engage appropriately in the work setting. Further, he seemed to have a personal vendetta against me after I utilized the one allowed absence to complete an assignment for another course. After that point, he made sure to either call me out during seminar in front of the whole class or use me as an example, etc. These overall sentiments were shared by many of my peers.One of the individual instructors (unfortunately, I do not remember her name) took the opportunity to critique my powerpoint presentation as a chance to inform me that my voice was \"too creaky\" and that I \"should get voice lessons\" so that my voice is less painful to listen to. It is probably not surprising to hear that I was offended by such remarks, particularly when they appear to be outside the scope of the course. I was offered little instruction about my presentation style; she focused just on how awful my voice apparently is. This is not constructive and not valuable criticism.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Did a great job. I really liked his lecture on professional writing.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Mr William Vance is a great teacher. He provides very useful feedback during the breakout sessions. My only concern is that he keeps referring to international students and their difficulty with English language and I think it will be great for him to realize that not all international students have English as a second language and not all international students struggle with English language. He could try to be more sensitive on that subject.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Strengths: engaging, clearly an expert, provided real-world examples, tips, and tricks on presentations, meeting facilitation, writing e-mails\/memos, among other things.Weaknesses: inappropriate comments made about Asian women (poor handshakers, ways accent reduction was brought up)",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very knowledgeable about the material and good at keeping the attention of the group.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance was quite culturally insensitive through out the course. While I am not Asian or an international student, the comments he made were very offensive to me. I could not believe it when he stated \"Asian women have weak handshakes\". While he may be a \"guru\" on professional skills, it was hard to take him seriously when he was being so culturally insensitive. I do not believe that he was professional in that light.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0There are times where Dr. Vance's \"cultural sensitivity\" was really on the verge of being lazy stereotyping.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Prof. Vance was very knowledgeable and his material effective. However, his way of relating to students was felt as abrasive and off putting by some, which in turn ended up keeping students from taking the course more seriously.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance was a very good and clear instructor. Every session I learned something new and I think that this is the primary goal of a teacher.Thank you.",

    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0overall very good and effective instructor.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Very knowledgeable, but sometimes says things that come off culturally insensitive.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0William Vance was an obnoxious, inconsiderate, and ineffective instructor. He emphasizes how important it is to be an effective speaker, but I personally found him to be boring, robotic, and not charismatic at all. I would hate to have a public presence like him. He is also extremely racist, looks down on non-whites and perhaps even misogynistic. I am certain he looks down on students in YSPH because he has talked down to the class on multiple occasions regarding how YSPH are mainly two year master's students and not phd candidates.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He knows the material. He is insensitive to difference and often comes off as politically incorrect with his language to foreign students, non-native English speakers and women.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Strengths: Pointing out flaws in student's performance. Very fluid presentation and teaching skills.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He had some good tips but his behavior was somewhat unusual at times. I don't think people appreciate him calling out foreign exchange students on a regular basis.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0His criticisms at times were excessive in the bluntnessStrengths-much experience in teaching the course and the subtleties of manner of speaking and body language",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Great. Passionate and Energetic.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He seems arrogant and condescending. And the over-anunciating was frustrating. He is supposed to be teaching us how to be professionals, but if any of us talked like that in a professional setting we would be laughed at.Also, he was kind of passive aggressive when it came to asking people to turn off their cell phones. Just ask people! He kept hinting at it before finally asking people.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance was a good instructor.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Mr. Vance does have some good advice to offer on how to organize and deliver a speech and a power point presentation, as well as how to organize and lead a group meeting and how to best organize a short persuasive written piece. His main points are memorable and helpful. However, Mr. Vance was not able to really connect well withhis audience in the pubic health school. He appeared to become very \"preachy\" and to be telling students what is the correct way to behave, which did not go over well. He also did not set the ground rules early in terms of people connecting to the internet in class, and instead of requesting that people not do this in a proactive and respectful way, he became sarcastic and singled people out with derisive remarks, which did not work well and didn't create a positive environment.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Excellent teacher and speaker, very passionate in teaching and can always draw students' attention. He can convey the important concept of the class clearly, fluently with clear logic and humor.a role model to learn form.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0great teacher I will contact him personally after the class.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Professor Vance was overall a good instructor and offered effective instruction. However, I felt that he overextended himself at trying to be articulate, and I was also offended at times by his lack of political correctness.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance made his lectures interesting with a multimedia teaching style such as videos and movies. He also offered a lot of constructive comments during break-out sessions.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Nice guy.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0The instructor was very informational.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Clearly quite knowledgable in the art of communication and professional behavior. I only wish we were able to receive more personal advice\/critique from him directly. The one time that he critiqued a speech I gave benefited me more than any other single assignment in the course.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0He was very well fit for the position but his disposition seemed a little off at times. I feel like participation in seminars (and classes in general) should be encouraged not forced. The energy level was also too low at times especially for a Friday afternoon.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Professor Vance is very knowledgable and personable. His lectures are engaging and present important information in a logical manner. It is clear he put a lot of time an effort into preparing this course - it shows in the quality of TAs, the diversity of readings, and engaging delivery of lectures.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0Dr. Vance is knowledgeable and a valuable resource on this topic.",
    "Instructor: William Albert Vance \u00a0The instructor made several racial and gender insensitive remarks throughout the course, enough that it made me uncomfortable in the class. Specifically he made several comments about Asians and women that were unnecessary."

After being given tips in a lecture format, the course provides mock situations in which students can truly test their skills. I would absolutely recommend that every YSPH student take this course.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it to another student. Communication skills are not supposed to be learned in classroom. The time could be put to better use.",
    "That is difficult to say... summarizing it. I feel like maybe even a day workshop would have been a better fit for this or part of orientation.I would say take it. Just be medicated for it.",
    "I would not recommend this couse unless it was changed significantly.",
    "A few of the sessions were helpful",
    "I would recommend it. I think it was very useful for me (especially the first 2-# sessions). However, I think the structure of the Seminar has to change for students to get the most out of it and to be taken more seriously.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, as it does provide information and tips that are relevant to us as professionals, not simply public health students. However, I would explain the student that it would be important to be aware of the professor's style of teaching.",
    "The course provides an adequate overview of some basic professional skills. The instructors do fairly well with the two-hour session each week, but this structure is more effective for some modules than others (for example, the panel discussion rather than public speaking).",
    "Well, people have to take it, they don't have a choice. I felt the first two weeks with presentations were the most useful. I needed a lot of work on my presentation skills. However, having a new coach each week was frustrating. The first week my presentation was very weak, and needed a lot of work. The coach gave me a lot of good feedback, and I was much better the next week. However, there was a new coach the second week. And while I had improved greatly, I was not quite up to the level of the other students who had experience in presentations. I know I did better, butthe feedback from the coach the second week was not as helpful, and felt overly critical and obviously there could be no feedback on how well I had improved from the first week. My classmates noticed the criticism from the coach and went out of their way to let me know how much I had improved from the first week and to not get too hung up on all the negative feedback I got the second week. The week that was just a lecture on plagiarism and other topics without any breakout was incredibly useful. Some things were obvious, like dressing appropriately, but other things like what to do if an employer asks for your facebook password were novel and relevant, and real. I know the class is new and taking it in the first section I was a bit of a guinea pig, but it was ok. I didn't like it, but there were some useful parts.",
    "Very good course, many real life skills are learned",
    "I would recommend this course to others, even though I felt it was a little longer than it needed to be. If the class were offered at an earlier time for maybe just one hour, I would say go for it! The subject material was useful and pertinent to my future.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, practical.",

    "I would not, I would recommend specific sessions: panel discussions, public speaking, etc.",

    "Take it! You will learn tons of skills that you will use for the rest of your life.",
    "I would repeat my answer to question 6.",
    "Take this class if you want to improve on your public speaking.",
    "I think that this course could be really interesting however I think that the timing of the course should be reevaluated for future years.",
    "This is a very basic introduction to professional skills. Some of the sessions are beneficial and some may not present much new information, depending on your level of experience. I would not recommend this seminar to another students, but instead recommend attending various career center seminars or other professional development opportunities offered throughout campus, or just a separate public speaking course. That way, you could pick and choose which skills are most important to you to develop.",
    "Worth taking if you are interested in learning more about\/or gaining additional insights\/skills professionals need.",
    "Necessary, sometimes great, sometimes awful.",
    "Overall some good feedback on your presentation skills that you will definitely utilize in the future. An important course to many, but some of us who have been in the professional world already may find it less useful.",
    "Necessary class where you learn important skills that you can't pick up in another class.",
    "I would recommend this course, depending on your level of professional experience. I think that this course in its entirety would be especially useful for those who have minimal presentation\/work experience or for those whose first language in not English. For those with more professional experience, some of the modules in this course may be quite redundant.",
    "ask the coaches ahead of time to be more critical, and you will have a much better experience.",
    "I would recommend this to a student that has some experience in a professional setting. For those that have never had this kind of experience I do not think the class will provide them with enough tools to develop their skills.",
    "This course is a good introduction to appropriate professional behavior. I'm not sure if I would recommend this to a fellow student; some topics were helpful, but others I thought were more appropriate for those who have never worked.",
    "This best thing about the course were the breakout sessions, the rest of the course could be online or at a different time.",
    "As tedious as the course could be, I would recommend it. The skills are quite useful.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, helpful and relevant to for both 1st and 2nd year students.",
    "This is a course to teach\/refine your skills on giving speeches, giving presentations, writing memos\/emails, having group discussions\/meetings, etc.I would suggest this course to all students if it were refined to be for-credit with better feedback, and also possibly if there were some changes in the instructor's way of teaching.",
    "Great class for anyone to take in order to strengthen their professional skill set, even mid-career professionals and those older can get a lot out of the course. Those new to the workforce will also attain exposure to an important new skill set, however for me personally it was helpful that I had already worked a few years following college before taking the course. Although the class wasn't offered last year, I found it helpful to take in my second year, as it is closer to the time in which I will be searching for jobs.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students, as it provides information regarding valuable skills that will definitely be utilized going forward.",

    "learned a lot",
    "Great",

    "Very useful and applicable",

    "Valuable course. I agree that it should be required. Some kinks to be worked out.",

    "It's best to just pay attention to what you consider good advice and just ignore what your gut is telling you is not true or useful.",
    "Good",

    "I think overall it's helpful but I found the instructor frustrating.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "I think this course could be given in 1\/2 of the sessions. The most important ones on giving a speech, presenting a powerpoint, and leading a meeting, could be done in 2-3 sessions. I would cut out most of the material telling people what is the correct way to behave interpersonally (to smile and say thank you, and how to address people in an email, etc...) as this comes across as very corporate and superficial and preachy. Stick to the main organizational points and make the course shorter.",

    "It can be an annoyance to go every week and do the assignments, but it's one of those things that you'l get in what you put in.",
    "This class is a must as it provides tools that will serve any future professional throughout their carrier.",
    "This course gave me a chance to practice my professional skills in various situations (e.g. meetings, panels) that I would not have thought about until they suddenly popped up in my professional life. This was an eye-opening course. Hopefully I'll remember some of the tips!",
