    "I would summarize the senior essay as a self-motivated project - however, the choice of adviser plays a huge role. I would absolutely recommend writing the senior essay.",
    "good class that teaches you a lot about research; not very structured though, which is a big change from other econ courses at yale.",
    "The senior essay is hard but rewarding!",
    "It is definitely worth doing a senior essay, as long as you pick a topic that's manageable.",
    "Opportunity to write a senior paper in economics. Recommended for anyone who has a strong passion for a particular subject and\/or desire to deepen a relationship with a particular adviser. Go into the experience with a topic - don't write a paper just to do it.",
    "If you're going to write a senior essay for Econ, definitely go for the year long option. Overall, it was probably one of the most work-intensive and challenging experiences I've been through in my four years. But in the end, you definitely feel like you've accomplished something and have learned a lot along the way.",
    "Yes if you like to write.",
    "I would do a senior thesis. It's overall a great learning experience and really worth all the agony. Plus it's actually not as much work as people think!",
    "I definitely recommend the senior essay to other students! It's the ultimate culmination of your undergraduate career. However, it is critical to write on a topic that you're truly interested in or passionate about.",
    "As an Econ major, you will have to submit your thesis earlier than others. So prepare to budget your time accordingly. Overall a rewarding process. You finally feel like the past couple years of Econ are actually useful for something.",
    "Just make sure you find the right advisor. That honestly determines your experience writing a thesis.",
    "Definitely do it",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. I think you truly begin to understand econometrics and the research process by working on a research project yourself.",
    "It's the senior essay. You dedicate a great deal of time to it, but you do it (roughly) at your own pace and you do it on a project that you design.",
    "Overall, writing a senior thesis brings a great feeling of accomplishment. The actual coursework really depends on your advisor to figure out how much work you have to do, how in-depth your analysis has to be, how often you meet, etc.",
    "The paper is a lot of work and difficult if you've never written an econ paper before but it's a really rewarding and interesting experience that I learned a ton from.",
    "Good senior essay class",
    "Do it!",
    "There is nothing to lose from writing an economics senior essay. You get two credits without going to class. You get to choose your subject matter entirely (you need to write a paper using economic methods, though not necessarily about economics). And then you get to write a tome that you can show to other people and use to self-validate.",
    "Grueling. Life-shortening. The highest number of all-nighters I have ever pulled in a year. I ended up with a great piece of research, but I'm not sure that I would do it again. It depends on how challenging your topic is and how awesome your adviser is. I lucked out on the latter. How much do you want those honors or a start on your PhD?"
