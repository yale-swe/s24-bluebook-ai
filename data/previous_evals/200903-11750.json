   "comments": [
    "This class is illuminating. The readings are INCREDIBLE. Sometimes I wish the discussions drew less on personal experience and more on academics.",
    "I would recommend AMST 321 to those who have little knowledge of interracial history and an interest in an often overlooked subset of literature. There is not a heavy workload, and discussion is often interesting when the focus is placed outside of personal experience ordetails in the text and instead on the larger issues of interracial identity.",
    "If you want to actually learn something about interracial experiences and theory, you would be better off reading a few of the books from the syllabus. Class was painful and felt like a support group rather than a classroom. Don't do it.",
    "studies interraciality and hybridity in literature, as well as in the national context.i would recommend taking it for personal reasons, and not if ur trying to really analyze the literature.",
    "For all the interracial people, don't expect to actually understand your lives better, and for the non-interracial people don't expect to learn much more than you already know or can deduce about black\/white mixedness you know (passing, tragic mulatto, etc). It was not a very substantive class, but the readings were enjoyable.",
    "If you are interested in the lives of interracial human beings (specifically part white part black people) as well as interracial interaction (ex. interracial relationships) then this is a good class to take.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student, specifically those interested in black-white intermixing. Professor Pabst is a leading scholar in the subject area, so if she is teaching the course I would definitely recommend taking it. Class discussions were always lively and interesting, never a dull moment. Professor Pabst is really open to other ideas and hearing what students have to think. Take this course!",
    "Amazing course!! A class you look forward to going to, especially because it's only once a week. (Although sometimes a bit nerve wracking because you had to read a book for each meeting and if you didn't finish it, it was hard to participate in the 2 hour seminar.) I took it for personal reasons (trying to find myself I guess) and it really really helped. I learned so many things that I had been curious about my whole life and it helped me understand my own background in this country even better. And I managed to meet two people who were exactly like me, which has never happened before!The discussions are so wonderful and intense that Professor Pabst has to remember whose \"turn\" it is to speak because we all wanted to all the time. She was really great and so informed about the entire field and just really enjoyable to spend time with.Would definitely recommend this course to anybody, doesn't matter if you're black, white, mixed, or not.",
    "Take it! If you don't, at least read a few books on the assigned reading list.",
    "Really good class! Professor Pabst is great. The readings are very interesting and the workload is very very reasonable: usually a book a week; sometimes a book every two weeks. We had two reading responses that were around 4 pages and then a final research paper that you got to choose the topic for (10-12 pages). At times discussions would get off track b\/c people would talk about their own personal experiences with race\/interraciality, but this would make discussions even more intersting and, in my opinion, more relevant. Everyone (regardless of your racial identity) should take this class. You will like every book!",
