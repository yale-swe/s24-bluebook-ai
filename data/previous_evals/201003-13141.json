    "Outstanding class! 8 reading responses (1-2 pages 1.5 spaced) + 10-12 page final research paper. Manageable workload, awesome readings, great professor (Reid), and a must for anyone who is interested in gender\/queer theory.",
    "Intro to LGBT Studies was great! I guess in the past the course has been an academic mix; however, this semester most everyone in it had extensive experience with LGBT studies, which made for, in my opinion, very interesting (but very theoretical) discussions. That kind of made non-WGSS people's contributions to seminar pretty valuable, but also meant that some people were operating on very different (and occasionally conflicting) levels. The workload is manageable but interesting, and you have a lot of freedom in reading responses and final papers.",
    "This is a great class to get a foundation of LGBT theory. The workload is not too heavy and a variety of topics are covered. As an intro class, it does of course move through topics quickly, but it will prepare you well for other classes.",
    "This was hands down one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The readings are fascinating and Professor Reid is an absolute joy as a discussion leader. If you're at all interested in queer theory (Foucault, Halperin, Sedgwick, Butler, etc.), you should definitely take this class. I took it concurrently with Chauncey's U.S. Gay and Lesbian History, and this was BY FAR the superior course.",
    "A good course. The students in the class were interesting and thoughtful--getting a group of people together that cares about LGBT studies yielded some very interesting (and sometimes controversial\/heated) discussions. I feel I learned a lot and had the chance to read a number of the important writers in the field of Queer Theory.If you're looking for two interesting discussions a week with a quietly helpful professor to stir things up just at the right moment--take this course. It is a wonderful introduction to the WGSS major at Yale.",
    "If you're at all interested in being a WGSS major, definitely take this class. Professor Reid is fascinating and the readings are all things one should read and very very interesting. Sometimes the class dragged a little because no one wanted to participate. The class is very open-ended \u0097 students bring in questions every meeting, rather than the professor \u0097 which sometimes made it feel like it wasn't worth my time. But by the end I think I really learned about the field of study.",
    "Great class! Not too much theory; plenty of engaging readings on a range of topics (bisexuality, media representations of queer people of color, transgender history, transnational organizing for LGBT rights, queer rights and the Supreme Court, class and identity politics, and much more) and interesting discussions. The eight response papers are very doable, as there's so much interesting material to discuss in them, and the final research paper is pretty fun, if you're excited about your topic. Unless you absolutely can't stand Foucault, take it.",
    "Take this, but be sure to write responses on the weeks that you're most interested in, it'll just make things easier!",
    "It's a lot of theory and reading, with not much writing. There's a final paper at the end and reading responses you do, but it's all spaced out. Really, the main focus is in engaging with the readings given you. I'd really recommend this class for a student trying to get an understanding of the theory that informs studies of gender and sexuality studies as well as an understanding of the context in which politics of sexuality operate. It gives you a good grip of things academically, socially, and personally (in regards to how we all weigh and define sexuality, desire, gender, etc). I would certainly take it, whether you're in the major or not."
