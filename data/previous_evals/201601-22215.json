    "Introduction to the topic of reconstructing religion based on material remains, including in conjunction with other data such as texts and images. I would definitely recommend it. The course brought together a number of issues that are touched upon by several disciplines, and is thus importantly interdisciplinary.",
    "This course allows students to consider the possible types of evidence archaeologists may use to identify religious activities, including rituals, sacred spaces, pilgrimage sites, and types of shamanic activities. I would highly recommend this course to other students, especially those interested in the interpretations behind religious materiality.",
    "I would recommend any archaeology student to take this course because the subject matter is too often overlooked and it's incredibly valuable.",
    "This is an excellent course for students who are interested in archaeology and religion. I would recommend to other students because it really help one better understand archaeology of religion in a global perspective.",
    "I would definitely reccomend this course to another student. It is an in-depth, yet easily comprehensible study of the archaeological study of religion."
