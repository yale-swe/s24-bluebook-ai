   "comments": [
    "My understanding of Spanish grammar increased tremendously in this course. I also completed my first Spanish novel, which was a fun milestone of sorts. Having taken Spanish L4, I feel comfortable engaging in conversation with native Spanish speakers (even though I still speak relatively slowly).",
    "Generally speaking, this course emphasized the development of skills with regards to vocabulary, grammar, and culture. I was able to learn a lot of new vocabulary in a wide range of topics. Nonetheless, I think I was able to more fully develop skills in grammar and apply those skills through a lot of practice in class with listening and speaking, which was extraordinarily helpful in terms of instilling grammatical rules into my ability to communicate in Spanish. This course was also very helpful in terms of exploring the culture and history of Spanish-speaking countries. Overall, this course allowed me to improve in terms of my ability to think in Spanish and become more fluent and knowledgeable in the language and culture.",
    "This class improved my speaking skills to a level of fluency.",
    "This course expanded my ability to speak fluently and naturally in Spanish. There was some review of grammar and sentence structure however most of the class was focused on learning about the culture of many Spanish speaking countries and improving speaking skills. I gained more confidence in my Spanish speaking ability from this class.",
    "I learned an incredible amount of grammar\/conjugation, and spanish-speaking culture!"

   "comments": [
    "The workload of this course was incredibly heavy, even for 1.5 credits. It felt like there was a big project to complete or an exam almost every week. In addition, there was little focus on grammar review while we were reading the novel as a class. I wish there had been more focus on grammar along with reading the novel. That would have helped me on the last exam.",
    "In general, this course has many strengths in terms of building skills in thinking in Spanish and becoming a more fluent Spanish speaker. I think the class size and the professor really made the course engaging. I particularly enjoyed the class size because my class had 10 students, which made it very comfortable to practice and make mistakes in Spanish amongst one another. I also would highly recommend taking this course with Profesora Valle because she is very understanding and really helpful in facilitating discussion. The weaknesses lie in the logistics of the course; for instance, the midnight deadline for the VHL homework was difficult to meet for students. Also, the scheduling of assignments resulted in the buildup of a lot of assignments in a short amount of period near the end of the semester.",
    "This class has no weaknesses. This was the best Spanish class that I have taken at Yale University. The personal attention and level of engagement in this class is unbeatable.",
    "Strengths - the course only taught a limited amount of grammatical concepts but I thought that the class focused on difficult concepts that needed to be reviewed such as the subjunctive tenses and relative pronouns. Also the oral activities and presentations were good and very helpful in increasing my confidence in my speaking abilities Weaknesses - having to finish the supersite activities at 11:59 every night",
    "Amazing class. Very detailed, well-paced, meticulous, well adapted to english speakers learning spanish. No weaknesses!",
    "Please extend the supersite deadline, midnight is unrealistic for college students."

    "This course really does increase your knowledge of Spanish and your comfort in conversation and writing. However, be prepared to work. It is an enjoyable course and very valuable, but the workload is heavy.",
    "Yes, this course really provides an environment to practice Spanish. You have the opportunity to learn a lot of new vocabulary, reinforce grammatical skills, and delve into the culture of Spanish-speaking countries, all the while spending time to practice speaking, listening in, and understanding Spanish.",
    "Absolutely! This semester was amazing with Professor Valle. The class was engaging and worth the time commitment.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is wanting to improve his\/her speaking abilities and who is genuinely interested in learning more about the culture. Workload isn't too heavy and Sonia Valle is such a great, understanding, helpful teacher to have.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. It is a perfect bridge between learning and almost-fluency.",
