   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to future students. It was interesting and completely manageable. Tests\/quizzes\/essays were all well prepared for in class. Professor Alexandrov was an enthusiastic teacher as well, which made the class more engaging.",
    "Great Spanish class. Not too much work like some other languages but just enough to keep you up to date the whole year, so when the exam rolls around you don't have to panic and study insanely. Fun activities and readings!",
    "Grading really nitpicky",
    "Spanish 120 is interesting, but a bit too much on the 'games' side for my taste. There are a lot of cuentos, and games, instead of thorough grammar learning...",
    "I definitely recommend spanish 120 04 if a student is interested in focusing on grammar and improving their speaking skills.",
    "If you're placed into L2 and don't feel like moving away from Spanish, take it with Alexandrov. I can't speak for other sections, but I felt as though mine was actually enjoyable and I learned a lot of spanish. The workload was more than manageable and all worthwhile.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "It is a great class for students wishing to brush up on their previous Spanish knowledge, and also a good mediator into more difficult material for students just learning the language. I would absolutely recommend the course.",
    "If you do the work and put in the effort, you will succeed in this class. Professor Alexandrov is excellent, and I enjoyed starting my day with her class every day. There are plenty of minor assignments, but the main thing with this class is investing the time necessary to do well and learn."
