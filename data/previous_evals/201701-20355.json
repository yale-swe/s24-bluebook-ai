    "It was excellent to be able to apply the mathematical concepts I learned to an independent project t",
    "It was an interesting problem to work on and I enjoyed working with my professor.",
    "I think I learned a ton through the senior project. I definitely learned material specific to my project, but I think that's the point of the class, and I think that as the semester went on, I got better at teaching myself the material that I needed to know.",
    "Learned research skills, how to write a more formal paper, and a whole lot about neural nets."

   "comments": [
    "I think more structure and guidelines would be helpful but it is also nice that it is very open-ended. The process of finding an advisor is important and should be stressed more by the DUS for students to do that sooner.",
    "more mentoring \/ structure?",
    "The course could benefit from a bit more structure, such as having more deadlines\/checkpoints throughout the semester, and more involvement from the DUS.",
    "Strengths: it is a great way to purpose ones interests. Weakness: it is very much dependent on the student advisor relationship",
    "More communication about expectations\/deadlines would be good.",
    "I think this course is what you make of it. I think I realized that early on, and I knew that the more work I did the more I would learn. That said, I have no specific suggestions for improving it.",
    "Some more guidance from the Applied Math department could have made the experience smoother and more rewarding."

    "You have to. The seminar is probably a waste of time so do this instead",
    "The senior project is a ton of work so due it in the fall if possible! It would be nice of the department gave a bit more guidance about the project.",
    "Yes! A senior project is an excellent capstone",
    "It's a requirement.",
    "AMTH 491 is a great course to delve into an area of interest and spend a lot of time on it. I think you definitely get out of it as much as you put into it, which is something to consider when choosing a project. Your choice of advisor also makes a huge difference in your experience, so it's important to find someone who is as interested in your project as you are and wants to help you figure stuff out.",
    "A requirement for Applied Math majors. Would recommend, but make sure to find an adviser quickly and think about truly interesting projects."
