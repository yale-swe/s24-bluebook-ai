    "If you have to for a major etc. If not, credit, d because it s very difficult.",
    "I would absolutely take this class. I'm not planning on majoring in EEB or EVST, but I am interested in the environment and conservation, and I think this class gives one a really good foundation for the science behind those topics. It covers both the math and practical applications of ecology and looks at some extra ideas like human interaction with the environment, climate change, population growth etc... There was no real homework and so it wasn't too much work outside of class and even though the paper can be a lot of work, it really is about anything you want so you really get a chance to explore an area you really enjoy. I learnedso much more about scientific research and writing in the process, as well as my particular topic. The exams are hard but the curve is nice and the quantitative project wasn't hard.",
    "The class is weird in that there are two very distinct styles of lectures -- and also styles of learning required. I enjoyed Prof. Vasseur's lectures (the more quantitative ones), but had trouble following Prof. Post's lectures.",
    "Eh. I didn't hate this class as much as everybody else seemed to, but looking back on it I have pretty mixed feelings. I enjoyed writing the paper, though the early due date and the incessant hand-holding (you turn in a topic, an outline, an annotated bibliography, AND a first draft...c'mon guys, we aren't in middle school, we know how to write research papers!) were rather annoying. Midterms and the material they covered were fine, take-home final and the material it covered sucked. David Vasseur's a great lecturer; David Post is a lot of fun to listen to and to talk to, but his lecturing style's pretty disorganized. Expect a lot of math and ecosystem ecology; don't expect many cute fuzzy examples. If you're an EEB\/EVST major, it's not that bad(particularly if you take it later in you Yale career when you know what you're doing with science classes), but if you're just looking for a cool EEB class, look elsewhere. [[For example, Ichthyology and Ornithology are AMAZING, and Evolutionary Biology, offered in the spring, will give you a much better idea of how the field works and is way more fun than Ecology.]]",
    "I wanted to like this course. I really did. But as past reviewers have noted the lectures jump around a lot and are too disconnected from one another. Take it if your major requires it, but don't get too excited or anything.",
    "Very math heavy and challenging. Exams are in no way shape or form easy. You'll have to work hard but the material is interesting and the professors are great.",
    "If you're interested in Ecology and not to terrified of the maths, go for it.",
    "I would recommend EVST 223 to any student with the slightest interest in ecology or the environment. I actually came out of this class with more interest in ecology than I had coming into it as an EVST major. The experiments that Post, Vassuer, and my TA are taking part in are pretty inspiring. Also, if you're already decent at math, this class will be easy.",
    "At times, EEB 220 felt like a math class with Vasseur, and a history class for famous ecologists with Post. But I'd still recommend it. The professors are still young and enthusiastic about their field, which makes a huge difference. The research paper is a great practice for writing scientific papers. Plus, the class is full of EVST and EEB majors, who are chill and quirky.Take it! (most likely you have to if you're reading this)",
    "Environmental Studies 223 was an introductory course to ecology in some ways. There was a bit more emphasis on quantitative material than I expected which changed my perspective of the course. I would not recommend this course to another student unless he or she had to take it as a requirement for their major.",
    "Ecology is a lot of work, but I think it pays off in the end since I feel that I have learned so much in this class. The tests are pretty hard and the essay is a little confusing, but we had a take home final which was a nice way to end the year, and the material covered is extremely interesting. It was nice to have an ecology class that feels like a real science class.",
    "Deals mostly with population dynamics - starts with a simple picture and builds up by adding more complexity and reality to the population models. I am not a \"math\" person but still found the equations doable. It was interesting to learn.",
    "I would recommend this class if it is required for your major. It is inherently very interesting material with knowledgeable professors. But it's lack of organization makes the class frustrating at times for someone who really wants to learn the material.",
    "EEB 220 covers interesting subject matter in a somewhat relaxed way. There is little official reading and only 2 major projects (the first, cemetery demography, is relatively easy and enjoyable; the second, the term paper, is a lot of work but can be a great experience if you put in the effort and choose a good topic). I found the 2 midterms difficult and didn't do as well as I wanted on them, but this was partly because I did not study appropriately for either- if you take this class, focus on concepts, not equations (do look at graphical analysis). I would recommend this course to EEB majors and interested non-majors, but would urge all to take it seriously- while the homework load isn't terribly heavy, you will have to work hard, pay attention in lecture, and study to earn your grade.",
    "A series of good lectures on general ecology topics. The class does a nice job presenting what is currently being researched in the field. The class was more work than I was expecting given the large amount of time needed for the paper and take-home final. However, the take-home exam is a nice change from other classes. The paper is definitely different too, but this was something that I really learned a lot from in this class- really take time to make the paper something you care about and something you learn from. The week with the second midterm and the draft of the paper the next week is exhausting- plan ahead for that one! This is a class where you definitely need to go to section and take advantages of the TA's knowledge and support.",
    "A decent introduction to ecology that was more mathematical than expected. Unfortunately, explanation of the math wasn't always great. However, reading the accompanying book set everything straight.",
    "It's an unorthodox introduction to ecology. The course is pretty disorganized, and there is little continuity between the two professors in the course. You might be surprised that the first half of the course is entirely quantitative, which caught meoff-guard. The second half of the course is much more concept-based and writing-based. I would not recommend this class unless it is required for your major. It is not a ton of work, but the tests aren't easy and it was not that fulfilling.",
    "This course was an enjoyable survey introduction to Ecology. The professors were really good- Professor Post keeps you engaged with his fast paced lecturing style and his good-humored occasional joke, while Professor Vasseur asks questions which students actually answer (amazing for a lecture) and which lead you to really understand the topic at hand. There is a lot of math, so if you don't like mathematical modeling, you may not like it. However, the professors are always available to talk and answer questions, and the overall themes and results you learn are REALLY interesting. If you're an EEB major (or someone interested in EEB), I guarantee you will like it! Writing the paper is a really great experience, particularly if your TA is as awesome and helpful as Amanda, and you can write it about practically ANYTHING you want. This course was hard, but it was fun.",
    "I would recommend this course if you like ecology. It's a nice followup to the introduction class with Professor Stearns.",
    "Most students take this because they have to. That being said, I felt like I learned a lot throughout the course, but I thought the class was pretty disorganized.",
    "There is much more math than you may expect going in. Also, there are a ton of assignments so it ends up being a lot of work. I would only really recommend taking it if you have to. It's somewhat interesting but even as an environmental studies major, I didn't particularly enjoy learning about the material.",
    "Take this if you have to, but not otherwise. This is an almost completely theoretical ecology class. Lectures range from mildly interesting, to dull, to incomprehensible (for some of the quantitative lessons). Be prepared for the midterms to be wicked hard. I don't know what grading is like yet, but based on the tests, everyone struggles a lot. The paper is also totally unstructured and extremely scary. My TF was amazing in helping me through it, but I don't know that people in another year's class will be so lucky.",
    "General Ecology is designed for EEB majors, not EVST majors, and this could beextremely frustrating. As an EVST major is good to know where the field of ecology is at, but I didn't get much out of this class practically - it is a lot of modeling. The paper is a great opportunity to do some work that you're really interested in.",
    "Good introductory course, I'm glad I took it, but I wouldn't recommend it if it's not required for your major. Definitely don't bother taking it if you've already taken Professor Stearn's class. Although the two are different, there are enough similarities that you will be bored.",
    "I would say to take this class. It was much more work than expected, and the final exam was really terrible to write up. The grading was quite harsh, though I do not know what the curve is. However, a better class than say genetics, and it's good to get a more scientific basis of ecological questions.",
    "If you have any interest in how ecosystems work, take this course. Most of the people taking the course needed to for their major, it seemed. I really enjoyed the course, but I don't think I would have taken it if I didn't need to for my major. For a non-QR class, there is a lot of QR, so be aware of that. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed everything. I especially enjoyed that it was a good balance between QR and writing.",
    "General Ecology was not a course that really wowed me. However, if you're taking it, it is a probably a requirement for your major and you will be interested in the topics taught, like I was. I enjoyed this course, it was well taught and did a good job introducing the theories and background a person needs to get a good grip on ecology. I would recommend this class, it wasn't especially hard but it was challenging and I feel like I learned a lot from good professors who knew what they were doing and lectured well. Again, it isn't a flashy seminar that's going to blow your mind each week, but it is a very good survey course."
