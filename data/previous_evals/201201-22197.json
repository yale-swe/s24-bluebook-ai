   "comments": [
    "I recommend this course if you're either VERY naturally good at math (in which case this is probably too basic for you anyway) or if you're willing to put in the time necessary to hunt down good online resources for learning concepts and techniques that can't be fully covered in class. 50 minutes three times a week just doesn't suffice, and it's too easy to muddle through problem sets without quite knowing what's going on until the exams.Speaking of which, STUDY YOUR ASS OFF FOR THE EXAMS! They're not great at letting you know this, but homework doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.",
    "It'll teach you multivariable calculus. The curve on the exams is pretty tough, 'cause a bunch of people will get near perfect scores (very doable, if you study hard enough). The homeworks are a pain. The material is good to learn.",
    "Yes -- it provides a good understanding of multivariable calculus. However, if you're interested in pursuing a more math-related course of action for your years at Yale, I recommend taking Math 230a and b, which combine multivariable calc and linear algebra (I wish I'd done that this year).",
    "It's not the most dynamic class out there, but",
    "Only take it if you absolutely need to. The material is really abstract, and requires an enormous time commitment in order to understand it. Don't count on the teachers to explain everything, as you really need to teach it to yourself to get it.",
    "Only take it if you have to. Through the first two exams it's not bad. But be prepared to learn a lot right before the final. The end is pretty rough.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting class, be sure to go to the sections and do what you need to make sure you understand the material. Tyler Foster is good at explaining the theory and concepts behind what we're learning and he uses less in-class examples than other professors, so this might be the kind of teaching style that you like.",
    "This is a good course. If you need it as a pre-requisite, it probably won't be as bad as you think. Even if you don't need it but you enjoy math, I would recommend taking it. If you consider yourself a bad math student, you might struggle...but you don't need to be great at math to do well in the course.",
    "I would explain to a student that Math 120 is a basic multivariable course, with some applications to physics, although it is mostly theoretical. I would recommend the class if he\/she is interesting in math or a subject that requires a strong background in math.",
    "Do not take MATH 120 unless you need to as a prereq for whatever major or course. It causes an unnecessary amount of stress. I took MATH 115 last semester and got an A in this course - definitely did not get an A in this course. The material takes a while to fully comprehend and the TA's aren't always the best. If you do take this course, my advice to you is to do the psets early so you have time to ask questions about material you don't understand. Also study for the exams more than a week in advance.",
    "It's multivariable calculus. No surprises."
