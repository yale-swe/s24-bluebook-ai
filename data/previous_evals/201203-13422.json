   "comments": [
    "First off, this class is amazing. On top of strengthening your writing skills, a second emphasis of this class is speaking. About two-thirds of each class is dedicated to some sort of class discussion about the reading or a prompt. In relation to this, there's a special focus on communicating as a whole. Dr. Morrison is extremely good with constructive criticism and is always supportive while still improving your skills as a communicator.We had four papers in the class, and the third also had a presentation component. Dr. Morrison has a background in public speaking, so she knows the various \"tricks of the trade\", when it comes to verbal communication. If you are scared of presenting then I actually recommend you to take this class because Dr. Morrison's method of teaching may be the most stress-free way to get over your stage fright.Overall, I feel like the reading is slightly lighter than most of the other ENGL 114 classes. Also, the topic is new and interesting. Instead of trying to squeeze ideas out from an older topic, you're studying a fairly new and extremely relevant field.I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants an awesome introductory English class.",
    "The material covered is very interesting (especially if you are already interested in surveillance). In the first weeks, the class is a lot of work but half through the semester it gets more tolerable. However, input might exceed output.English 114 in general is an intensive class.",
    "This class was quite a bit of work, though less than my other writing credit. It's a very good way to become accustomed to writing college essays, and the material is very interesting. The professor is lovely, and the material is great for promoting discussion.",
    "Take English 114 even if you're a good writer. There's always room for improvement and you really get to learn a lot about a topic that you are interested in. Dr. Morrison is a great teacher, and everything we did in class really helped us develop skills to be better writers, whether that was through oral presentations or writing workshops. Definitely recommend this class.",
    "English 114 involves writing four essays and a host of other writing assignments. I took it because I wanted a lot of writing which is exactly what I got. I would recommend it if you want an intense writing class which is what it is observed to be. Grade wise, unless you are stellar, you will probably receive an A- or B+.",
    "I recommend English 114 for all incoming freshmen, even freshmen who feel confident with their writing.",
    "It definitely improves your technical writing ability. It's super helpful for framing arguments, organizing papers, and using evidence. Basically, all the stuff you need to do before you actually start writing an academic piece.I doubt my writing style is any more refined or convincing. Even if my papers are more logical, they're not any more interesting to read.Overall, the work load is manageable. Just don't wait until the last minute to do things. Grading isn't too bad either.",
    "As an international student with English as second language, it was vert hard to keep up with the level of writing",
    "I would definitely recommend that you take this course if you are interested in improving how you present your arguments on paper. If you are interested by the role of technology in relation to privacy in the 21st century, then this section will definitely interest you. Dr. Morrison is a fantastic instructor, a fair grader, and she really wants to help you with your writing.",
    "This was my favorite class during my first semester of college. The background information in the field of focus was fascinating and engaging, and I loved the in-class discussion. However, I could have more efficiently used my time here at school by taking a different course. I thought that this class would help me greatly improve my writing; although I did grow as a writer, I think it was more the practice of writing than the actual course that did this for me. If a student genuinely worries about his writing ability or has never before had to write analytically, I would recommend this class. Otherwise, I would suggest gaining a writing credit through a different course."
