When writing for a wider audience, it is always useful to have a large number of people read drafts of your work. The work groups provided an outlet for this.",
    "Very helpful to do the peer review, especially since by the end we were quite familiar with each other's research.",
    "Additional one-on-one feedback for this class was useful. Also, it was nice to discuss our projects without the pressure of having the Professor and TA also critiquing you at that time.",

    "(1)If you plan to pursue analysis and writing of your summer research over the course of the year, this class provides a great opportunity to do that with others. There is no need to sign up for more independent research credits.(2) For those who are feeling nervous about giving presentations at conferences or the FES research colloquiums, this course will provide a supportive environment to help you work through your presentation hang-ups and leave with you greater comfort and style.(3) This course requires self-direction. Deadlines are widely space, and it is important to plan accordingly to ensure you are making continual progress on your work.",
    "Very helpful if you haven't published a first author paper before.",
    "I would recommend they practice as much as possible to make their presentations better and listen to the constructive feedback given throughout the course to improve their writing."
