    "The student was wonderfully coordinated in every aspect from our travel to our presentations. I am completely satisfied.",
    "The project was on an urban scale which seemed out of the comfort zone of both Deborah and Noah. Additionally, despite the urban scale very few experts on urbanism were present for either the midterm or final which may have been helpful to us. Deborah and Noah both were infinitely more helpful at the architectural scale rather than the urban. I think we could have used more help with larger landscape and planning issues.",
    "Because the project required so much interaction with these disciplines, it seems that sometimes it became difficult to figure out what the focus of the studio really was. There should have been a strong planning component, but this wasn't really pushed. We struggled with the idea of this site as integral (or not integral) the city because of its nature as a private development, but it would have been valuable to really investigate infrastructural systems as a way to make the project more relevant to the true Sao Paulo landscape.",
    "Since the program of the studio was situated in Sao Paulo, there were significant opportunities to engage architecture in a rich culture of landscape and urban design, two disciplines central to the evolution of modern Brazilian culture and very much present in the contemporary context of Brazilian urbanity. Due to the large scale nature of the project, the elaboration of urban design was a necessity. The presence of a strong culture of architectural construction in Brazil had also a strong influence in a few projects that took upon themselves to build on this spatial and formal structural language."

   "comments": [
    "Almost every aspect of the studio was quite valuable. Unlike my past semester, I felt like I received a good desk crit each and every time. Whether Noah or Deborah, both gave constant and helpful critiques and are a wonderful duo. The presentations (including the pre-final presentation in New York) were very helpful. I appreciate the focus on presentation methods as well. I am also very thankful for all of the interaction with the people from Tishman Speyer. We were really able to develop a relationship with quite a few employees which was nice.",
    "The trip was infinitely valuable to the development of the project. Desk-crits were probably on a weekly basis the most helpful for developing the work. We may have benefited from more outside experts in planning and landscape. The sessions with the developers were very educational. The juries at midterm and final were a bit difficult because it was hard to reconcile the expectations of the developers and those of the architects.",
    "The most valuable aspect of the studio was, without any doubt, the focus that was placed on the preparation of presentations. A lot of work was concentrated in helping us students prepare our presentations and understand the nuances and subtleties of different contexts architects must face in displaying their projects and ideas. During the course of the semester we had to present to both teams of developers and professional architects within the development and academic environment.",

    "After taking the Post-Professional studio the past semester, I really liked the chance to build upon my last semester urban studio. As a developer studio, I felt there was a good balance between architecture and development. My one suggestion would be to be a bit more playful in the early research stages, perhaps with less formal exercises. This might have been the students problem rather than the professors, but it would be a good time to really experiment before forming concrete ideas.",
    "The main problem with the studio was the tension between the expectations of the architects and developers on the reviews. On one hand we wanted to produce practical and elegant solutions to the developer's brief, but we also were pressured at juries to be idealist architects and attempt to redefine the brief. It was hard to tell where our role was - of learning from the developers or trying to change the way that development is done.Also, the developer part of the studio seemed to fall away mostly in the second half of the semester as we continued to design architecture in formal way, rather than responding to developer goals.",
    "See below.",
    "I thought that the program of the studio was very interesting as it established a problem that needed to be resolved in the large urban scale and a more focused architectural scale. This context encouraged the employment of strategies of design of many different natures: urban strategic design in the framework of financial and cultural issues, architectural design of a smaller scale, and a technological-ecological program of detailing the tectonic ideas that respond to the environmental context of Sao Paulo. Perhaps a little more time should\u0092ve have been allocated to the resolution of the smaller scale architectural ideas.",

   "comments": [
    "My expectations were completely met. I felt there was a good mix of craft and creativity as well as facts and figures. The trip to Brazil was quite eye-opening and very enjoyable. I will be forever thankful for being able to partake in such a studio.",
    "I expected to do an urban project with architectural details, learning from development strategies in Brazil. I was dissappointed by the lack of criticality in the instructors, lack of integration of larger urban issues into design, and theidealist architect heavy nature of the mid and final reviews.",
    "See below",
    "My expectations for the studio were to learn about the nature of economic and financial strategies of thinking as they respond to architectural practice, while in the same time test the limits of architectural discourse operating in a productive developer environment. These expectations have been surpassed, as my lessons in the studio have been tremendously informative and valuable in my development as an architect. I went in the studio with a desire to see architecture exceed over the conventions of the complex developer world and now I feel confident that a possibility for such a position exists.",
    "this was a great studio, i appreciated the freedom to design.",

    "Deborah - Wonderful sense of scale and material. Really inspirational and intelligent. Was able to develop a great working relationship. Also appreciated her inviting the class to her house.Noah - Very approachable and good criticism. Gave good direction and was very organized.Katherine - A wonderful role model. She made a great effort to know each of us quite well and was very approachable. Like Deborah, she was very giving treating us to dinner at her home as well as a wonderful experience in Brazil.Nate - Great experience working with Nate. Wise and confident. Did an excellent job organizing the trip and other aspects of the semester.",
    "Both Deborah and Noah are clearly invested in education and were very supportive in the studio setting. If anything, they weren't critical enough, and on the rare occasions that they were critical there was little reasoning behind it. I think I could have personally been more directly challenged in my ideas, so as to prevent such an entirely linear project.",
    "Both studio heads and both teaching assistants were unique in what they had to offer to the studio, and I enjoyed working with all of them. On the developer's side, I was struck by the time dedicated to our studio and the desire of Katherine Farley to give us a real life view of what the developer goes through on the business side of things, but also in their relationships with architects. She and Nate Shanock demonstrated an uncanny level of dedication that truly made this studio unique. Moreover, even their critique as architects was a tremendous force in the studio.Deborah Berke and Noah Biklen also showed an incredible amount of interest an dedication in our studio. Each week they were available to discuss our interests, and really guide our projects in a direction that was interesting to us. If there is one critique, it would be that this attitude could be somewhat problematic. In a way, the freedom that is given to us results in a lack of resolution in almost everyone's project. It would have been interesting for our critics to guide in taking a stance. For instance, whether our projects were a direct response to the infrastructural shortcomings of Sao Paulo; or whether our projects were a direct criticism of Brazilian Modernism, etc. The sometimes open endedness of every meeting was often frustrating. Although I can appreciate this pedagogical approach, it was sometimes problematic.I am also slightly disappointed with the final comments given to me about my project. I feel as though they were not specific to my work, and offered only a superficial account of my abilities that was too general and in fact not very productive.Overall, I am very happy with both Deborah and Katherine's energy and teaching abilities. I cannot say that I am thrilled with the architectural critique that I received on a weekly basis, because I felt like we were operating outside ofany contemporary discourse. Like I mention above, I felt as though our studio did not have any specific ambitions when it comes to areas like representation. This is something that should be addressed in coming studios.",
    "In my opinion, Deborah Berke is an excellent instructor for one very important reason: her ability to discuss architecture beyond the limitations of form, style and particular cultural desires and taste, is extraordinary. She is able to identify the essential and central ideas in the work of a student and concentrate the conversation around the evolution of those ideas presented by the work itself. The diverse nature of the projects in our studio led her to bring in just as a diverse critical debate. I felt that she was able to engage the work of each student in a contextual intellectual and practical way, and this added greatly to the quality of the overall communication that was present among us.Noah Biklen was very engaged in our projects, as well. He was a constant contributor to the studio environment and followed the development of our projects with great dedication. His presence would have been even more constructive if he had taken a more intellectual position as opposed to his predominant practical facilitating role.Katherine Farley\u0092s role in our studio has been invaluable. The instruction and knowledge she has brought in the studio environment throughout the semester has been of tremendous value to me, and I believe that all of my classmates share the same feeling. It has been incredible to be in an architecture school and learn so much from a practical economic and financial environment, academically and professionally. She has spared no means to provide us with a strong conceptual understanding of the developer perspective; in the mean time she has shared so many lessons with us from her professional and past academic experience, lessons which have added to my understanding of both architecture and the parallel disciplines that surround it. It must be mentioned that Nate Shanok has been instrumental in all of this process: I greatly appreciate his dedication and will to speak to us throughout the semester.",
    "both were great.",
    "noah was unhelpful and condescending....otherwise great."
