    "TAKE IT",
    "Super fun way to learn german. Yes do this class if you like german",
    "Most comfortable way to pick up the language.",
    "This class was excellent. If you are interested in taking German, I would recommend taking it with Theresa, as she is an excellent teacher. It provided a solid basis of simple language skills, as well as a wide range of basic every-day vocabulary.",
    "I would highly recommend it. Meeting every day ensures that one does not forget the material of the previous class and the format of the class (discussion-based) and nature of the homework allows students to feel fully integrated in the language.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to others. Within half a year, you can learn to speak and understand basic German. Moreover, German 110 01 is a lot of fun, because it is never monotonous but very varied in its activities and tasks."
