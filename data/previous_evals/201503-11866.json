    "Take this course if you wish to be exposed to various forms of non-academic writing, and\/or explore your own capabilities as a writer.",
    "Million percent yes. This was my favorite class of the semester. Not only does it help you become a better writer, but it relaxed and enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend it - it does help with improving one's writing, but you definitely have to be open to criticism.",
    "Interesting take on \"creative\" writing--diverges from the standard of academic papers and gives you a new level of freedom in your writing.",
    "English 120 is a great English class that I can recommend wholeheartedly. Not a ton of work, interesting, and useful for improving your writing.",
    "I would absolutely recommend English 120 to another student. One gets to read great writing, and work on your own craft. The class focuses on the writing process itself; English 114 is more research oriented."
