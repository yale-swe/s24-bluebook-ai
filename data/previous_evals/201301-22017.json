    "very good course. improves your writing\/comprehension of italian significantly however it does not improve speaking very significantly",
    "This is an introductory course, and will focus mostly on grammar, writing, and speaking (in that order). I think there could be less grammar, honestly. However, we do cover pretty much all the tenses by the end of the year. Italian is gorgeous, probably the most beautiful language!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, even if you don't need it to fulfill your language requirements. It's an incredibly well-tought class, and truly enjoyable.",
    "INCREDIBLE COURSE.Speaking italian everyday has given me incredible speaking abilities, and my writing is pretty decent. language learning at Yale is TOPS.Prof. Lorenzini is a FANTASTIC professor. Flexible and understanding when it comes to assignments, but still expects you to know the material for the class. She calls out all the people in the class to answer questions (whether or not you have done the homework), and keeps conversation going all the time. She expects you to learn your stuff and keep up and this has helped me IMMENSELY. She's also very, very nice and makes the classroom a very welcoming environment that you want to be in everyday. If there is something you don't understand she will work with you until you get it down.I have learned so much from her!!"
