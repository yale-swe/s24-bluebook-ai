   "comments": [
    "Highly recommend this class to anyone who likes maps. I would also highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in colonial history. The role of maps has often been undermined in recent years. The class will benefit your understanding of power relationships for much of the worlds history.",
    "\"Mapping the World\" is a history of modern European cartography as it relates to power structures, especially imperialism, state-building, and urbanization. The readings each week are thematic rather than chronological, and can be fairly vague. The final paper gives you a good opportunity to research an interesting topic and look at some really cool maps, but the material you discuss in class can be way too theoretical, without touching on many concrete examples. Take the class if you tend to dismiss everything European as an oppressive power structure.",
    "Mapping the World is a broad overview of the history of cartography up to the modern day use. The books\/readings in this course are GREAT. The professor needs a little bit more of experience in seminar teaching, but she is incredibly nice. I would recommend this class only if you have a great idea for a term paper, because it is where you will focus in this broad class about maps.",
    "This class introduced me to topics in history that don't often get covered in other Yale history courses. I enjoyed the often-theoretical perspective, and we got to spend a lot of time in map collections filled with primary documents. The instructor was new and relatively inexperienced, but she worked hard and was very receptive and enthusiastic. I always looked forward to this class, and I hope a similar one will be offered again.",
    "This was a great course overall. Professor Dunlop is a very young, but very spirited and intelligent professor. The reading and discussion were pretty theory-heavy, but the atmosphere was relaxed and we all got a chance to say our part. We took a handful of field trips during the semester, which were really interesting. The final paper was great to do because we got to use maps as primary sources for analysis. For the most part the people in the class were there because they (like me) think maps are really cool, which the semester certainly confirmed.",
    "I thought that HIST 272 was pretty awesome. Catherine is super-nice and supportive. The reading isn't too bad and is extremely interesting\/unlike most of what you'll read in other classes. The maps are really cool. You get to visit the YBCA and Map Department and look at incredible maps ranging from Portolan charts drawn on animal skin\/medieval mappa mundis to city plans. The final paper is very flexible.",
    "This is a very good class on cartographic history. The overall themes of the course--emphasizing the roles maps play in nationalism, global history, and power--were fascinating, though some of the case studies were less interesting. The final paper is also a great opportunity to do your own research with maps, which I really enjoyed, and the spectrum of potential topics is virtually unlimited. Professor Dunlop is also great--her feedback on the midterm and draft of the final paper was very valuable, and she ensured an easygoing discussion in class. The workload is also not too bad, though the reading is a bit mixed in quality\/interest."
