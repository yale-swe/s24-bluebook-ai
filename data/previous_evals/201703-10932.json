    "Strength: - Reading group: It really helped to read papers on the various topics which highlighted different aspects than the ones discussed in class - Knowledgeable professor: Always pointed out the strengths and weaknesses of papers which helped to assess what can be done and what is beyond the paper - Reasonable overview of various topics Weaknesses: - Should impose more structure on discussing the theoretical and empirical derivations. Discussion of results should not take up that much time - Maybe proceed at a slower pace. Sometimes it was a little bit too fast - End on time",

    "Yes at it is a reasonable course for learning the up-to-date methods in research even if you are not interested in labor econ. If you are interested in labor econ, obviously you have to take the class! Costas is a brilliant instructor and he puts forth a lot of effort to teach this course which can be seen in his slides and his engagement in class.",
    "Especially if someone is interested in structural estimation.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a well-balanced course, covering theoretical models, econometric tools and applied topics. Summing up, it is a very complete course."
