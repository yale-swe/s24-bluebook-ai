   "comments": [
    "I probably would have dropped this course if it wasn't required for the psych neuroscience BS. a lot of the lectures after the initial brain dissections were just very tedious and not directly applicable to the exams. It's a lot of being lectured AT for 3 hours. Not fun.",
    "A boring, painful, uninteresting class, that by all reports was better when Karen Frick taught it. I would absolutely not recommend this class, even though it's a requirement of the neuro track, try and take 260 instead.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who is genuinely interested in research. You don't get much experience and the learning is not that valuable.",
    "take it if you are in the neuroscience track, or need a research methods class by the end of your jr year for the bs and dont have one yet. class can be a bit slow and when the lights go off for 3 hour powerpoint presentations you can get a bit sleepy, so caffeinate right before.",
    "The professor is very, very long winded, which lead most of the class to either fall asleep or fb for 2+ hours every week. You write two scientific papers which are really not all that substantive and you have 2 tests which if you study meticulously for are not bad. You do get to memorize the parts of the brain and their functions while dissecting a sheep brain which I felt was informative. I probably would not take it again if I were to choose again though. If you are pre-med, the class is much easier than your standard biochem, orgo, etc related classes. But I don't think that many premeds were taking it considering the class average was always pretty low.",
    "Take if you must but otherwise, be prepared to put in a lot of work for tests\/ labs because there isn't a clear aim for the class looking for.",
    "Somewhat of a dry class in terms of lectures, but the labs are interesting - hands-on behavioral neuroscience work. Not the most interesting class, but if you plan to further study psychology and neuroscience, very practical and illuminating."
