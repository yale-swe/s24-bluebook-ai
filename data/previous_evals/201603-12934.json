   "comments": [
    "Everything I could need to begin to understand relativistic field theory. A better understanding of special relativity, representation theory, and classical field theory than I had coming in. How to read and use Feynman diagrams to make calculations for things like differential cross sections. Also, understanding the origins of spin and the use of Noether currents were especially fun concepts to grasp.",
    "mathematical treatment done by high energy theorists.",
    "I understand quantum field theory now which is awesome.",
    "I learned a semester's worth of quantum field theory. I thought the material was well-motivated and well-taught throughout. I especially appreciated the extended discussion of the representation theory of the Lorentz group, and how it motivated the construction of Dirac spinors. This was not material that had been explained very clearly in my previous exposure to quantum field theory, and it helped solidify my understanding of why spinors have the structure that they do.",
    "This course was my first introduction to QFT. I think I gained a solid groundwork that I will use to undertake the study of modern theoretical physics that utilizes QFT in the future. The course has brought me a lot closer to understanding research in this area.",
    "I took this class to get the fundamental background and understanding for my field of research. I feel this class helped me understand the background fundamental theory needed in a second quantized theory.",
    "Knowledge of fundamental aspects of quantum field theory. Problem solving strategies for these field.",
    "How to build a multiparticle, relativistic field theory from scratch, e.g. why causality and Lorentz-invariance requirements impose constraints on our theory, why the creation and annihilation operator framework is the easiest to use, and how Feynman rules correspond with physical properties.",
    "Standard introduction to quantum field theory, roughly based off of Peskin and Schroeder, but with a more logical flow. Field theory, canonical quantization, wick's theorem & time ordering, scattering and Feynman diagrams of scalar fields\/baby Yukawa theories, culminating in the Dirac equation and QED with scalar photons.",
    "A great intro to relativistic field theory.",
    "I think that all of the skills we covered were useful for me, being an experimental particle physicist. The course has helped me to better understand the most important parts of the theory behind what I am studying."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is fantastic. Goldberger's lectures, notes, and problem sets all coordinated to build my understanding of QFT. I cannot think of any obvious improvements besides the ones that Goldberger himself would want to make like correcting typos he noticed and pointed out in his notes.",
    "Strengths- instructor is very well-prepared. Weakness- fairy tough course material.",
    "It's excellent.",
    "The course did a good job of covering the motivation and construction of relativistic quantum field theory, the basics of scattering calculations, and the addition of spin to this formalism. I feel that I understand these topics much better than I did before taking this course. There is only so much material that a one-semester course can cover, but I thought it was somewhat unfortunate that we did not get to any serious discussion of quantum electrodynamics. It would also have been interesting to examine the path-integral formulation of quantum field theory, which lays bare useful parallels to non-relativistic theories, especially in statistical mechanics.",
    "The lectures were great! Very clear, and the online notes were great for reviewing after the fact.",
    "This course provides a great overview of the background needed to do any field theory-based research. There are unfortunately not too many physical examples that we can understand during this class, but it gives the background for future physics.",
    "This course is the best course I've yet taken in physics. Prof. Goldberger is excellent at taking students through the logic of the subject.",
    "Huge strength was the wonderful set of lecture notes supplied. I'll be using those as references for many years, I imagine. Plus, the high levels of energy and movement in the lectures always made me eager to come to class. The problem sets were involved but insightful, helped us exercise concrete tasks that we'd be expected to use on the exam, and built naturally from lectures. Also, the final exam was a work of art. I loved how each of the questions were framed, and while I didn't get everything perfectly right, I thought it was quite fairly constructed. Can't think of many weaknesses. I loved this course. It would be great if you fixed any typos in the lecture notes -- I think I fixed all the ones you mentioned in class, but it wouldn't be a bad idea. I also admittedly didn't really crack open Peskin & Schroeder before the final exam, so I wonder if there's a way to tie in sections of the textbook more naturally into the course throughout the semester. Oh, and getting problem set solutions sooner would have been great, too. I made some important mistakes on my problem sets and got points off, but the grader didn't make it clear what I did wrong or would only count off a point or two, and I didn't realize my deeper errors until just before the exam once I got a hold of all the solutions.",
    "Great lectures and problem sets. The class was excellent.",
    "I think that the class was very good, except for being rushed at the end.",
    "The LATEX notes were very good. The professor's level of knowledge and engagement with the material was very motivating.",
    "Overall I think this was one of my favorite courses at Yale. It is an extremely interesting topic and it was taught well."

   "comments": [
    "YES. I am a biophysicist and just wanted to take this course to see QFT and Goldberger gave me the best intro I could have asked for the course. I won't be taking the second semester but that is most certainly not due to him, but more that I need to focus on more relevant topics for my field (unfortunately). I would recommend this course to anyone interested in any theory work in physics, and for absolutely everyone doing anything with particle physics.",
    "If you can take it yea",
    "Yes. Quantum field theory is essential for understanding many areas of modern physics research, and this class gave a manageable, clear introduction to many of the important topics.",
    "I would say that one can't be a real research physicist without knowing at least some basic QFT, so I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Definitely",
    "Definitely. I think a background in QFT is important and this class was a good introduction.",
    "Yes. The course material is quite interesting, and Professor Goldberger is an excellent instructor.",
    "Every physicist should take this course.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "100% yes! Favorite course at Yale so far; super enjoyable and interesting and important subject. Energetically and engagingly taught with beautifully-constructed lecture notes, problem sets, and a final exam that will challenge you but also gives you ample time and resources to shine.",
    "It's a lot of material, like any course in QFT would be, but it's well worth the time for an aspiring theoretical physicist to take as soon as is right. As an undergrad, I can say that taking graduate quantum and GR was very useful before taking this class. It is, thus far, the most challenging physics class that I've taken at Yale, and also the most interesting. I would highly recommend reviewing some of the introductory field theory and perturbation theory before taking this course.",
    "A great class to review classical field theory and begin quantum field theory.",
    "Yes, it is extremely well taught and also teaches topics whose understanding is vital in particle physics.",
    "Yes. It was a difficult course, but it was also one of the most interesting physics courses that I have taken.",
    "Yes I would."
