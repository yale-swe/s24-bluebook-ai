    "I develop a skill of understanding and filming digital video, lighting, recording sounds and editing",
    "I became very well acquainted with film equipment. My technical skills drastically improved.",
    "This course really broke down the different elements of film\/video (e.g. composition, lighting, audio, etc.) and gave us a chance to isolate each factor and work on it, which was extremely helpful. Through a combination of readings, hands on work and watching other pieces, we were able to work through the basics of video.",
    "I learned a great deal of technical skills, including how to shoot on manual. I was exposed to so many different artist which helped me clarify my artistic vision. It was a great introductory class and I feel ready to take on more challenging camera work."

    "Strongly recommend to those who are new but interested in making videos",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone trying to get a grasp on the technical side of filmmaking. If you are interested in narrative, that won't be addressed too much in this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this, it was a wonderful introduction to videomaking and I definitely feel more confident in my videomaking ability after this.",
    "Definitely recommend if one is interested in cinematography and videomaking. The course covers all the essentials of filmmaking very well. I appreciate that projects are very creative and require a lot of thinking. Neil is a fabulous instructor - very supportive and willing to spend a lot of time discussing projects. The only small downside is that the course focuses on experimental films more than I would like. Anyhow, I think I improved my filmmaking skills quite significantly by taking this course.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in video work and art, this class is very helpful. You'll learn about video (both art video and narrative) AND you'll get to film and record sound. This class is high engagement and if you put work in, you'll see major improvements. You'll leave the class feeling like a filmmaker."
