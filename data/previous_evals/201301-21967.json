   "comments": [
    "Class pretty much has a hippie agenda. If you are not a hippie, do not take because your views will be disrespected.",
    "It's more historical than it looks on the syllabus, still a great course if you like the material.",
    "An interesting course that should change the way you think about science. It tackles some of the misconceptions we have about science as it addresses both the strengths and weaknesses of science. Some of the interesting (false) dichotomies covered are science vs. religion, science vs. capitalism, and science vs. politics.That said, this class may not be for everyone. I found some sections to be very interesting but when I didn't enjoy the topics, the class and the readings were dry.",
    "I'm not a big history person, so this class wasn't that interesting for me. I only took it because I needed the humanities credit. But it wasn't too hard. There are two short op-eds that you have to write (1 page, single-spaced each), a midterm, and a final. There is a lot of memorization involved for the exams.",
    "A great class! It is not one of those classes that everyone hypes up, but they should! Lectures were amazing, and I got a much more nuanced view of the history of science. The work was incredibly reasonable too. My only complaint is that section was a gigantic waste of time but was unfortunately mandatory. Other than that, TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It presented a great history of ideas and themes that are definitely applicable to thinking about problems of today. Transferable skills is always a great selling point of a class. His lectures are very well structured, and they end up being really interesting, at least to me. If you don't care about earth sciences at all, then you should probably consider another course. It breaks down a lot of dichotomies and explores the different types of arguments use for issues like peak oil, the ozone hole, and global warming. It has a great balance of the history of ideas with the history of their social impact.It'sa lot of reading. Some of it very interesting, other times augh, so boring.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! It's not that much work but you learn a lot. There are no prereqs and you don't need any specific prior knowledge or background. As a bio major who's never taken a history class in college, I found this course manageable and definitely not intimidating. Professor Rankin's lectures are well organized, easy to follow and engaging. It's a great class overall!",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class, unless it goes through a major makeover. Needs new slides, a new angle, and more interesting readings.",
    "Great class with a great professor, but the TA made section unbearable. Overall it was a great humanities credit for a science major and you'll learn many interesting and helpful things about the history of earth sciences. Just be prepared to dislike the section if Courtney is teaching it.",
    "I would recommend this course very highly to anyone interested in history that is not stuffy and irrelevant. It was witty, relevant, and very interesting. Professor Rankin is a wonderful professor, very knowledgable and has great rapport in the classroom and wise evaluation methods. I am very glad that I took this course.",
    "Interesting topic and readings. Very well delivered and planed lectures. Good life lesson take aways.",
    "Yes, as I said, it was the best course I've taken at Yale. I think it would be immensely useful for almost anyone of any discipline. If I were in charge I'd make it a core course of the Yale curriculum, or at the very least HSHM.",
    "A good history course, though understand a broad conception of the word \"catastrophe\" is taken.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. This course examines the history of the earth sciences through viewing catastrophes that have shaped the world throughout time. It is very effective promoting critical thinking. The lectures are very strong and engaging. I wanted to go to lecture everyday.",
    "This was the best History of Science class I have encountered yet in terms of the lecture style, the professor, and the overall concepts the class covers. However, the readings can be long and boring. I'd suggest taking a close look at the syllabus before committing to see whether the materials would hold your interest.",
    "It's a fun course, with a relatively small course-load; topics covered in the class should be interesting to anyone curious about the modern environmental\/scientific\/political world. While intellectually stimulating, however, there's little in the way of useful\/practical knowledge - though of course, that's a matter of opinion."
