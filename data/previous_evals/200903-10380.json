    "CPSC532 is a course that focuses on sound-level synthesis with a musical focus for applications. I would recommend this course to other students with a music background or at least some experience playing instruments. Although sound synthesis itself doesn't necessarily require a musical background, a lot of the terminology and discussions in the lectures might be confusing for someone who is unfamiliar with various aspects of musical performance."
