   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class-- lots of material there and it doenst get boring.",
    "Great course - gives you an overview of issues related to natural disaster preparedness \/ response. Bussell is great and really knowledgable about the subject.",
    "This is a great, truly discussion-based class. Prof. Bussell really emphasizes that she wants us to be driving the class, and that's exactly what happened. There's a lot of reading every week, and we're expected to post 3 discussion questions on classes v2 a day before class meets in preparation for the discussion. But it really helped in terms of making the discussions engaging and productive, and by the end of the semester we really had a solid understanding of disaster risk management and every factor that goes into improving these efforts through the Hyogo Framework for Action. It was great to apply this knowledge to our final paper (a case study on a country of choice) and our last three classes of the semester were also case studies.",
    "The class examines developing countries' disaster management systems. For most of the semester, the readings consisted of frameworks and studies that examined the role of different actors within a country in disaster management and preparedness. The last few classes looked at actual cases of disaster management in different countries such as India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. I would recommend this class to another student, but make sure you understand what the class discussions will be concerned with. This isn't necessarily a political science course.",
    "I would recommend this seminar. Professor Bussell is sweet and enthusiastic. The weekly reading is interesting and pretty easy to keep up with. Other than the readings, you are responsible for presenting one class and writing a 20 page final paper. Pretty reasonable workload for a seminar. Make sure you contribute during discussions.",
    "I would not recommend this course. While the topic seems interesting the course unfortunately focuses on repetitive, boring aspects of laws regarding naturdal disasters. Discussions are painful with no visual prompts to break up the monotony of discussion. That said, Bussell seems to really care about the subject and conveys here passion to her students."
