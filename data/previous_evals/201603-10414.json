    "In taking this course, I learned on a rudimentary level how to oil paint--the necessary solvents to buy, the way in which additional mediums could be added to the paint to produce alternate effects. While this was interesting and valuable, I had hoped to delve deeper and begin to learn more classic and traditional oil painting techniques, rather than focusing on the way in which the paint could be used for rougher, more contemporary expression.",
    "Art 230 was an enjoyable painting class. I was exposed to oil paints for the first time, and we spent much time carefully learning how to use colors in terms of value, hue, or their relative appearance to one another. I greatly enjoyed painting from the figure. In the three or four sessions we had, I learned about gesture painting and painting from life. Most of the course was structured around in-life studies, and the later half of the course was independent work."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the life studies with the models. I think those classes of the course helped me the most with painting from life quickly and getting used to oils. I also greatly enjoyed Molly's lectures. She is very insightful and knowledgeable, and this knowledge also comes out during our critiques. I wish the second half of the term were more structured and that the requirements were more clear from the beginning. When we began our master copies, the class lost some structure and momentum. I really enjoyed having a personal studio, however, during the second half of the term. I would have enjoyed doing more studies, such as the master copy, as a way to learn. Because it's a beginning painting course, I wouldn't mind not having the independence in the second half of the course. I felt like I had much left to learn when we began our independent works, and I wasn't sure how to guide myself in the second half."

   "comments": [
    "Take if you have a background in drawing and some painting, or if you have experience with your own making process. If you're not comfortable producing your own art, you might want to wait to take it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless of whether you are seriously interested in the fine arts or not. This class is not a lot of work for most of the semester, except when you have your midterm and final critiques, when the work can pile up if you don't plan ahead accordingly. That being said, the work we did together and separately for our critiques was fantastic to do and resulted in huge personal growth for myself and, I think, some of my classmates. Intro Painting teaches you some basics of how to paint, but it also teaches you how to see, how to present yourself, and what your interests are, since those surface in one's work.",
    "I would hesitate to recommend this course to another student unless he or she is thoroughly sold on the idea of taking an introductory painting class that is really more of an introductory *contemporary* painting class. Little emphasis is placed on classical painting technique, which is frustrating for a purportedly opening-level oil painting course. If hyper-contemporary painting is the kind of art you want to make (and if you're fine with \"breaking the rules\" without really learning them), by all means, take this and get something out of it. But with a course called \"Introductory Painting,\" I was looking for a much broader and more traditional techniques-based class, and this is not it. Having your own personal studio space is great, but I am tempted to say that this was the best part of the class for me, and this should not be the case.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this painting course with Molly. Molly is a zany, knowledgeable, passionate professor. I would take this course if you're looking for a studio space and some time to paint. The cost of the course is a bit much... I spent more than I intended on overall material costs of paints, brushes, gesso, canvases, etc."
