   "comments": [
    "Difficult in light of poor teaching. Also math intensive.",
    "The class gives you some literacy in quantum mechanics. You learn how to solve Schrodingers equation for simple potentials, apply basic perturbation theory to more complicated ones, and the formalism. I find it all very theoretical and interesting, but not very rigorous and somewhat superficial. No \"real\" physics here.",
    "I personally love watching people diagonalize 6x6 matrices by hand, so this class was truly riveting. McKinsey will show you the magic of quantum mechanics: that if you throw a bowling ball at 2cm thick wall, the probability of it tunneling through is (wait for it) pretty low. Abysmal, but pretty easy.",
    "Well if you have to take this course for the physics major you have to take this course for the physics major. Lectures cover the material in the textbook, but rather slowly and the lecturer (McKinsey) seems to struggle with presenting the material well, or appearing to have a solid grasp on the material. Luckily Griffith's is a very good textbook.",
    "Quantum mechanics is a very interesting course, although a very difficult one. Its definitely best to not worry about the implications of what you calculate in class, lest you lose sleep. Kind of interesting for an engineering student, and of course required for a physics major.",
    "Very math intensive, pretty thorough introduction. Take it if you can handle the math and if youre ok learning a lot from the book",
    "Don't take this for an interesting relaxed science credit if you're not a physics major. If you're a physics major, you are almost definitely going to take this, so nothing really needs to be said.",
    "PHYS440 is a generally required class, so there isn't much point in recommending it or not; it can be pretty dull and slow, but it's something you have to do and has some interesting moments. Definitely check out APHY439 too (depending on who's teaching 440) if you're nonintensive.",
    "If you are unfamiliar with quantum mechanics and want to take an advanced quantum course in Yale for credit, it is highly recommended that you have a supplementary text (Townsend, Sakurai, Feynman) while you take this course, if you want to draw out anything meaningful from it. There is far more to quantum mechanics than the mathematics demonstrated in this course, and there are no true applications to be found to quantum modeling or chemistry. We start immediately from Schrodinger's equation on the real line, and never deal with the simple and extremely applicable systems of electron spin or photon polarization. It is disappointing that this course is so discouraging to the novice in quantum mechanics, so it would be better to first learn from a textbook (or another source) before taking this class. There is no easy way to introduce quantum mechanics, but to focus on only the aspect of continuous systems at the beginning for so long before even mentioning Dirac notation or two-state systems is a poor way to go about it. This is Griffiths' way, and I highly urge the future instructors to either use another text simultaneously, dispose with Griffiths altogether, using it as a supplementary text and a source for problems.",
    "hard class, especially toward the end. probably my least favorite physics class so far but quantum is cool physics and i think phys441 is gonna be more interesting. griffiths (the text) is ok and sometimes the lectures are incromprehensible. go to office hours, mckinsey is very nice and better at explaining topics 1 on 1.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Despite criticisms you may have heard about the course (some of which are certainly valid), I did feel I learned a lot from taking this course and even enjoyed it. Quantum mechanics is an inherently fascinating and exciting subject, and I thought I got a lot out of it. While I will say the lectures sometimes left something to be desired in the conceptual arena, the bottom line is Professor McKinsey got through all of the material in a clear and organized way, and anything that you didnt fully get through the lectures, you could fully supplement by reading through the assigned sections of Griffiths, which I thought was an excellent textbook for a first full-semester immersion in the subject. The reading assignments were manageable, reasonably chosen and relevant, and as much of a pleasure to read as a physics text can be (by the way, this is a class for which I would highly recommend doing the reading since it is so important in reinforcing the material and because frankly there wasnt very much reading assigned). Problem sets I also found to be overall quite helpful at reinforcing the problem-solving aspects of the material and sometimes conceptual aspects as well (although as is always the case with problem-set-intensive courses, there were occasional questions assigned in which I felt the pedagogical merit did not adequately justify the algebraic tedium). As I mentioned, I thought Professor McKinseys lectures were clear and organized as well. In the future, though, I hope he spends less class time reviewing prerequisite math and less time following through completely on lengthy algebraic manipulations during exercises and derivations in favor of spending more time discussing and reinforcing the big picture concepts of the course and how all of the material fits together as part of a coherent whole. As for whether you should take this course or the one-semester course, Physics 439, which you may be debating taking instead: Since I didnt take it myself, I cant offer any input on Physics 439 itself, but I am personally very glad I opted to take the two-semester sequence. Quantum mechanics is inherently a very difficult subject to grasp conceptually, and I think splitting it up into the two pieces of the Physics 440-441 sequence is a sensible way to digest the material thoroughly at the undergraduate level. Between the generally clear lectures, excellent textbook, and generally reasonable and sensible problem sets, I was pleased with what I was able to learn in the class and am looking forward to continuing with 441 in the fall.",
    "All I can say is: what was that curve?! A 92 for an A and a 88 for an A- in a class where no one could understand anything? I couldn't learn concepts in PHYS 440 at all. Rather, we did tons of algebra. I think McKinsey knew what he was talking about, but he never explained anything. He's a cool person and a very dedicated professor and he was helpful outside of class, but a bad lecturer. The final was just a lot of algebra. So it was basically like: how much algebra can you do in 3 hours? All we did during the semester was algebra without actually understanding much of what we're doing, and it was really frustrating. Problem sets weren't exceptionally hard, but had really annoying algebra that took forever to solve. I wish we had learned and been tested on more Quantum Mechanics and less on stupid algebra. I think I'd tell another person to take 439 instead of 440, but McKinsey is going to UC Berkeley now, so I don't know how the course will be next year.",
    "This course was horrible, but hopefully it will improve when McKinsey is not teaching it. This course focuses on tedious calculations INSTEAD of fundamental concepts in quantum mechanics. Avoid this course at all costs.",
    "You'll have to take this for the intensive physics major. Don't let it discourage you: your understanding of the material you were taught is not reflected on your grade (because in order to get a better grade you need to consult several other resources).",
    "Absolutely fascinating subject, yet quite poorly taught. This class will require a lot of dedication outside the classroom. The grading was insane: an 85% median yet an A- range of 88-92.",
    "McKinsey is leaving so it will be a different professor. The material itself is very interesting, and you should take this as early as possible so that you have time to take particle physics (Phys 442). With a different lecturer this course would be better, this time around everyone had to learn it all from the textbook.",
    "Phys 440 is tough, but the material is interesting and you do end up learning a lot by the end of the semester. Psets can involve a frustrating amount of algebra, but they really help cement the concepts in place. I'd recommend at least finding someone to talk to about them, because introductory QM skims over quite a few subtleties and talking about your questions with others can really help straighten out confusion. Exams will expect you to go a little bit farther than the material covered in class, but are generally doable if you have a good grasp of the material. Finally, Griffith's is a great text book for the first 2\/3rds of the course, but it doesn't cover perturbation theory as thoroughly, so pay close attention to lecture when you reach that unit."
