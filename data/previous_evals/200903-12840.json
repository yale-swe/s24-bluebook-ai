    "Maripaz Garcia is the BEST! I shopped several spanish classes and I thought she was far beyond the talents of any teacher I shopped. She is amazing, if you are going to take Spanish 1, pick her classes. She is fair, logical, understanding, and enthusiastic.Keep in mind with Spanish 110. You are in the class a lot, but the outside workload is very minimal.",
    "Spanish 112 is a daily course with daily work, but is well work the large amount of time put in, because you feel satisfied coming out, knowing you have learned a large amount of a new language.",
    "I'd highly recommend this course to another student because it offers a great introduction into a new language, even if you have never taken Spanish before.",
    "It was a very difficult course, especially in freshman year. It required a significant amount of work EVERY SINGLE DAY, and if you slack off for one day, you will feel totally lost all week! Take it only if you have done Spanish before, otherwise take a higher level language if you are a native speaker to fulfill the requirement.",
    "If you want to learn Spanish and you're willing to put in the work, go for it!",
    "I would definitely recommond it. It went pretty fast and was challenging, but you will learn a lot. After this course I am able to read, write, and speak in Spanish after only one semester. The actual homework wasn't too bad, but we had many tests such as oral, compositions, and quizzes.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 110, especially with Maripaz Garcia. It is the perfect way to begin fulfilling your language requirement. The course gives you a solid foundation in the language and the confidence to move on to the next level. And above all, it is a relaxing atmosphere. Put in the work and you will see the results. But it isn't terribly hard to keep up in the class.",
    "It is good for improving your spanish speaking skills.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class as a manageable introduction to Spanish and an efficient use of a semester to learn a great deal in a small amount of time. The curriculum has clearly been time tested, the teacher always knew exactly what she was doing. This class fulfilled all my expectations.",
    "Yea I thought it was a pretty easy class, though it did get a lot harder at the end",
    "I recommend if you want to learn Spanish. But it is true that this language is very tough to learn.",
    "Spanish is a fun language?"
