In the course, students read a good deal of primary sources and literature, which I found to be very informative and practical.",

   "comments": [
    "Carlos Eire does a great job of facilitating discussion and the assignments are very conducive to student learning.",
    "The strengths lied in the syllabus, which was fantastic, and Professor Eire's knowledge, which was incredibly deep. The weaknesses were in the seminar discussions on occasion, which sometimes were a little slower, because some had probably not done the reading, but Professor Eire usually filled in for this lack of conversation.",
    "Professor Eire was extremely engaging and helpful. The syllabus of the course was oriented toward religious topics, in particular, but all of the works were nonetheless interesting and illuminating.",
    "This course truly honed students analytical and historiographical skills in a diverse and varied manner, due to its multidisciplinary perspective. The comprehensive characteristic of the overall syllabus presented students with multiple historiographical viewpoints, incorporating such sources as actual seventeenth century official documents and treatises, as well as modern monographs, such as that concerning the theoretical development of Golden Age Spanish Art. Furthermore, weekly class discussions gave students opportunities to comment upon different historiographical methods and utilization of primary and secondary sources, and the individual presentations enabled students to put to test their own historical and historiographical perspectives. Additionally, the term paper enabled students to sophisticate their historical and multidisciplinary knowledge, upon their pursuing a particular theme. Overall, this course consists of a comprehensive and profound demonstration of the immense historical and cultural implications of Early Modern Spain."
