    "I learned a ton about the history of human experimentation that I didn't know before. I honestly had not heard of basically any topic that was covered in the class, even though many of my suitemates regarded topics like Tuskegee and J. Marion Sims' slave experiments to be par for the course (so to speak). The only one I had heard about was the Milgram experiments, but that's just because I'm a Milgram fangirl. I've developed a lot of insights regarding the autonomy of human subjects in research, especially in light of the topics later addressed in the class during the unit on \"professional guinea pigs\". This is probably my favorite class this semester. 10\/10 love u Jenna",
    "I learned a lot of new and interesting information in this class that spanned an important time period in the development of ethics and ethical guidelines. I honed my contextual analysis skills and worked on analysis in of historical information from the viewpoint of that time period.",
    "I greatly increased my knowledge about the history of human experimentation since 1800. The seminar covered a variety of topics such as bioethics, HIV\/AIDS, LSD and yellow fever. The course provided insight to understanding what human experimentation entails, who are the actors involved, who are the beneficiaries, how experimentation is justified, how and why are experiments regulated, etc.",
    "I feel like I was able to improve my skills in reading and discussing the History of Science. In the small seminar setting, I was able to push myself to ask more questions and participate more in discussion. Additionally, I feel that I improved my reading abilities in terms of being able to pull out the important ideas."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Excellent topics, excellent professor Weaknesses: Humongous paper dude seriously, one boring unit on IRBs but it's pretty necessary so just deal with it",
    "I enjoyed this course greatly. It was engaging and covered a great breadth of information in a way that was understandable. However, I offered felt the readings were too long, making it difficult to understand the essential points of the reading and apply them to the class.",
    "I thought the course was fantastic! The strengths included the organization of topics and readings, seminar discussion prompts and activities, the diversity of the readings and the types of assignments required. A major strength would also have to be Professor Healey, who was intelligent, engaging and wonderful to be around. The only weakness I can think of is the technical difficulties we had sometimes with the projector, which delayed presentations or class discussions.",
    "I thought the course did a good job of not just discussing past experiments done on humans, but also doing reading and discussion on further implications both at the time and for the present. Dr. Healey tried to give a variety of readings each week, which I appreciated. Overall, I liked the class structure, especially with one student presenting the introduction to the discussion each week."

    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone. It's s p i c y and I loved it",
    "Yes definitely. It is a lot of work but highly enjoyable if you are willing to put in the effort.",
    "I would completely recommend this course to another student. I would rank it in my top three classes at Yale thus far. The material is extremely interesting with something for everyone. I would definitely recommend it if you find yourself interested in HSHM, history or bioethics. There is a decent amount of reading, but on the whole, the sources are interesting and not too difficult to comprehend. Aside from the reading, the workload isn't too bad with a class presentation and response paper, midterm primary source paper and final research paper. Professor Healey is phenomenal! She is engaging, helpful, intelligent and she makes it a joy to be in class. The discussions were lively and the class activities were creative.",
    "I really liked this course, in terms of both the material and the design. Workload is manageable, with a 5 page midterm paper, and 20 page final paper, with checkpoints along the way. One student also opens the discussion each week presenting the readings with further questions, which made things interesting."
