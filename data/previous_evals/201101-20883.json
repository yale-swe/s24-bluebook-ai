    "If you want to pick up applied game theory along with substantive knowledge, this is great course. Beware if you haven't had substantial game theory training, though.",
    "Economics 792 is a course of both substantive and technical interest. For students interested in formal theory, the course is a logical extension to the game theory courses in that it applies the techniques to specific substantive problems. I would not recommend the course to students who have not had training in game theory.",
    "It's an overview of some of the major questions in comparative political economy, with a greater focus on recent formal theories and non-democracies. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in political economy, institutions, and\/or formal modeling.",
    "It's very interesting for anyone with a solid economics and\/or mathematical background who want a slightly technical approach to the questions of political economy of development and institutions.",
    "Good introductory class for research in the topic"

   "comments": [
    "This course provided a great overview of some of the major questions in comparative political economy, especially those dealing with democratization. It was also nice to get further exposure to applying formal models to substantive questions. The course covered topics that I will likely pursue in my dissertation and future research. Also, familiarity with formal theories is important for my research given my interests in institutions and the fact that formal models are common in the institutions literature.",
