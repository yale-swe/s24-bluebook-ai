    "Amazing course on Ancient Greek medicine",
    "I learned a lot about ancient medicine and how to trace the evolution of theory over time.",
    "I learnt how to evaluate ancient Greek texts and learnt about ancient Greece medicine and ideas.",
    "One of the most interesting courses I've taken at Yale. Greek and Roman medicine is a fascinating subject, and the course is structured very well to cover its the main developments and transformation through the ages. The readings are presented in multiple perspectives (modern\/ancient, manuscripts\/commentaries), so there is a lot to learn from one topic beyond the official manuscripts or corpus.",
    "hippocratic medicine, galenic medicine ability to read ancient texts spread of medicine over time from Greek to Roman culture through translation medicine\/religion intersection\/overlap archaeological evidence, types of evidence used in ancient studies",
    "I very much so enjoyed everything we learned in this course. The foundations of modern medicine stem from the Ancient Greek tradition, and it was very interesting to learn more about how medicine came to be. The various texts and secondary sources we read were very interesting and insightful.",
    "I did not have any working knowledge of Ancient medicine or really any history from that time at all. This course also really cemented the ideas and theories of ancient medicine with modern medicine. This course was extremely interesting, engaging, and relevant."

   "comments": [
    "Great for non history students",
    "I feel like class sometimes was just reviewing the readings, but that was helpful for understanding the texts at a deeper level.",
    "It is very well organized and well thought out. It could be improved by replacing some redundant readings with other readings.",
    "I like Prof. Lamont's mini-lectures; they are very insightful and helpful for writing papers or studying for midterm and final.",
    "really enjoyed seeing early translations up close -- may have been fun to use babylonian collection's tablets as well and look at the medical incantations and recipes",
    "I immensely enjoyed this course. It was a lot of reading, but I enjoyed it all because it gave me a nuanced understanding of medicine in the ancient world and how it relates to medicine today.",
    "This course was really good about connecting modern medicine with traditional medicine. I really enjoyed this class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes great course!",
    "Yes, I would if the student is interested in classical civilizations or the history of medicine.",
    "Yes, this class was very interesting and great for anyone looking for history of medicine classes or a Humanities credit for a distributional requirement.",
    "Yes! The stuff covered in this course are beyond my wildest imagination. That is not to say this is all about crazy stuff people did (it kind of is). You'll learn a lot about the history of medicine and how lucky we are to have the medical knowledge we do today. This is a great course for HSHM majors but anyone will find it fascinating.",
    "If you're at all interested in the subject matter, it's a really fascinating course and to me, not being at all familiar with ancient history or classics, it was a very exciting introduction to the material",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Lamont is a wonderful lecturer and an even better person. The class itself was very interesting and helped me gain a nuanced understanding of medicine in the ancient world and how it relates to medicine today.",
    "This course is excellent! You definitely have to do the work, otherwise you won't be able to engage during class, but the workload isn't bad and the course is really interesting."
