   "comments": [
    "Great course, useful application of the Physics I have learned in a different way. It was very hard for me to maintain the same attention level throughout the semester. I was also took this class somewhat confident because I thought the first week's material was an indication of the difficulty of the class - its not. Problem sets are a little time consuming, they are difficult to solve because you have never seen questions like those before. The key is not to leave the problem set to the last minute.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they was interested in stellar physics and star evolution. It isn't an extremely technical or math based course, but it does require some reading and problem solving.",
    "Astr 210 is a laid-back and low-stress class, but, at the end of the semester, you'll realized that you actually learned a lot. The math fairly basic, but provides insight into why things work the way they do. If you keep up with the work, the class is very manageable and easy to do well in. I'd highly recommend it to non-science majors.",
    "Yes. If a student is interested in the topic, they should definitely take this course",
    "Overall, this a great class and great way to help me decide whether or not I wanted to be an astronomy major, just like 220, the next one up, which I took last year. The concepts are fascinating, and there's just enough physics to keep it interesting and challenging for science and math majors without scaring off non-science\/math majors who want a science credit that's not completely dull. Well structured, and the homework counts for a significant percentage of the grade, which forces you to spend time on it and doesn't put as much pressure on you for finals and midterms. And the prof is great.",
    "This course was extremely enjoyable. It introduces one to all of the important methods astronomers use to understand the stars. It is a good overview of how current astronomical research is performed, without going into heavy mathematical or statistical explanations.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. If a student is interested in astronomy, this is a great place to start. It's mostly astronomy without the convoluted astrophysical equations.",
    "Not a bad class to take for a science credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It gives good coverage of star formation with depth on some choice topics, like the life stages of a star and gas laws. Good for math\/science majors; problem sets only once every two weeks, which is nice. Lots of choices on the tests. Felt like I was able to learn a lot without a constant heavy workload, which was a nice change.",
    "This class isn't particularly challenging, but it's not nearly as fun as Astro 120 or 160 (Kenney is a great lecturer, and I hear Bailyn is too; Basu is nice but not that entertaining). That said, if you're mildly competent with problem sets, this class is a lot less work than 120, and the material is interesting.",
    "A science and QR class with not a lot of math and not a ton of work period. A little slow moving but still good for someone with a moderate interest in Astronomy."
