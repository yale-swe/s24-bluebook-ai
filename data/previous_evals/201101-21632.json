    "I think this class is really pointless in terms of preparing young biomedical engineers for laboratory work and or research. It's really the fault of the lab assignments themselves, I would say only two of the labs are things which would be actually helpful for research techniques.The course consists of 6 labs, one of which is a leftover from last semester's lab. So we haveLeftover lab-whatever.Image Processing- This is the first useful lab, it teaches you how to process images using MATLAB. It's really very fun and teaches you a bit about programming.Ultrasound- This is just such a silly lab, it really teaches you very little and the likelihood that we will ever need to use an ultrasound machine in the near future is comical.NMR- Very boring and pointless, you simply follow commands from the TA and print out 20 pages of spectra which you then write a silly report on. If NMR is going to be used in your research you probably won't be the person using the machine, and if you are building and NMR machine or running it you will probably need to know a lot more than what this lab offers.Microscopy- This is the other useful lab since it teaches you how to use various microscopy techniques. That being said it could have been executed better by allowing you to use better stains and prepared samples rather than trying to find cheek cells which can be very difficult.Ionizing Radiation- Another lab which is so oddly specific and useless. It is just another reiteration of what EVERYONE at this level of science education already knows about radioactivity.My recommendation for this class is a huge overhaul on the curriculum. Also, if you require a lab report for each lab then having an lab final at the end is just overkill, please remember that this is supposed to be a half credit.",
    "Part 2 of an introductory BME lab course. Learn about basics such as MRI, ultrasound, microscopy, etc.",
    "Very good course - more interesting than the first semester course. The material is a little bit more challenging but still manageable.",
    "You have to take it if you're bme.",
    "I would recommend this course for any student interested in BME. It is interesting and useful for future work in a research BME lab."
