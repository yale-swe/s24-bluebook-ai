   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone looking to learn a new language, especially because of Hebrew's importance in the world with Israel's key location in the Middle East.",
    "If a student want to learn Hebrew at Yale, this is the perfect opportunity.",
    "L1 Hebrew is a lot of work - you'll have multiple worksheets every night, short essays every weekend, a quiz every week, and various speaking assignments scattered throughout the semester. You do, however, learn a lot of Hebrew in a very short time, and the workload is never impossible. The instructors are both very helpful when it comes to explaining concepts, looking over your work, or meeting outside of class to review. You also get to simultaneously learn about Israeli culture, both in class and at various cultural events, which makes the course especially interesting.",
    "L1 Hebrew gives perhaps the greatest workload of any other L1 class. My friends in other introductory language courses had their share of homework, but I always spent at least another hour than they did doing my Hebrew assignments. Also, there are several requirements outside of the classroom that prove to be similarly time consuming, including Hebrew tables, Israel events, and Hebrew movies. However, by the end of the semester, you will realize that all of that extra work has only made you that much better at the language. The curriculum of the Modern Hebrew program is highly logical and builds upon successive concepts, making it fairly easy to grasp. There is a definite learning curve at the beginning of the semester, due to the vast differences between Hebrew and English, or whichever other language you may know."
