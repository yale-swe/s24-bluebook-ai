    "If you're really interested in the topic, then maybe take it.",
    "This course is fantastic. I was skeptical at first, since it can be theory heavy and a little dense towards the beginning, but I was not disappointed for having stuck with it. The readings, especially towards the end of the class, are really interesting, and I came out of this course feeling like I had learned a lot.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The material is fascinating and Professor Wood is awesome. I was always looking forward to lecture. The workload is manageable and meant that people (and I) did the reading, which meant I got much more from the course. This is the kind of class that changes the way you look at the world. Highly recommend it.",
    "I'd recommend collective action, for the basic reason of knowing the case studies and prisoner's dilemma\/barriers to collective action. Know that it's very academic and you have to be interested in the subject matter, however.",
    "I liked the material in this course a lot as it provided a useful analytical lens for considering why social movements succeed or fail and why people choose to participate in collective action. Prof. Wood is a very good lecturer. There was a midterm exam, four memos (there were originally five but then everyone complained), two presentations, and a final paper. The The paper (10-15 pages) gives you a chance to write about whichever social movement interests you.My only complaints were these: memos and presentations became a bit annoying because there was logistical confusion about who was presenting when. Also, many people had difficulty working with the teaching fellow who, though knowledgeable, was a bit annoying. If there is adifferent teaching fellow, I would definitely recommend this course, especially for political science majors.",
    "Good course if you are interested in looking at case studies of social movements. This is not the best course for those interested in a theoretical understanding of the defining factors of a social movement, however. Just know what you are interested in; if it is understanding a broad variety of social movements worldwide, then I would definitely recommend this course. The reading is really interesting and not overwhelming in quantity.",
    "I would definitely take this course, no questions asked. The work load is a bit heavy but it's fascinating material and it's both history and social science method\/information that anyone remotely interested in should know and will benefit from.",
    "The material is interesting enough. But if Cory is TA-ing again, she is thoroughly unpleasant so steer clear of CASM.",
    "yes I would recommend the class if you are interesting in social movements",
    "Maybe, its interesting material, if there was a different TF, definitely",
    "I would definitely recommend Collective Action and Social Movements to a fellow student. It is a fascinating look at when and how social movements form and what factors determine their trajectory. It does a good job combining historical case studies with theoretical work. While there is a significant amount of reading, the course is not terrible difficult and is definitely rewarding. Professor Wood is a good lecturer; I always found class interesting. The memos, however, aren't much fun--but the course is absolutely worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in sociology, it provides a good theoretical background to how sociologists approach social movements and to sociological theory in general."
