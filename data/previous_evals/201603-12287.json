    "I learned a lot about Hadrian and the Roman empire during his reign. I also learned how to think critically and analytically about artwork in general.",
    "It was a bit daunting in the beginning to take on a research project that would last the whole semester and would be the main focus of the course. But I found the presentations very helpful for preparing me to write the paper and they helped improve my public speaking. This class also forced me to think on my feet whether we were analyzing a single monument or trying to draw connections between multiple works."
