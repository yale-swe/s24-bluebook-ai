   "comments": [
    "A really great class for anyone in any major... Not even just Anthro majors or Film majors.",
    "This is a wonderful class. Take it.",
    "This was a really fun course that allowed me to learn a lot about parts of anthropology that I was not aware of. It is pretty chill and the homework often involves watching fun movies.",
    "If you can fake it pretty well and are lucky, there's not much work for this course. The films and readings are both time consuming and, a lot of the time, very dry. Professor Nakamura is aware of this but she gives those readings because they express some aspect of the class really well. She is a good lecturer and an engaging professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for novelty and freedom. But it might not be the best choice for those who need rigorous curriculum and constant push to do the work.",
    "Great course. A lot of readings, and reading responses but it is interesting material. You also get to watch great films.",
    "Visual Anthropology is a fun class. You get to watch movies for your \"section\" time, and sometimes even during class time. You can pick and choose which reading responses and labs you want to do, which is nice. However, while the readings might address some of the deeper intellectual issues involved with images and anthropology, class time itself does not really go that extra step. While I ultimately do not regret taking this class since it was fun and I liked the big ideas it introduced, I was sometimes frustrated during the semester."
