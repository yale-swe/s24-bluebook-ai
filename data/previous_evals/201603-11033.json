   "comments": [
    "A deeper understanding of historical methods; an analytical survey of recent, cutting-edge literature in the field",
    "Prof. Chauncey spent a lot of time guiding us through doing archival work and writing a history paper, thinking about our methodologies, questions of ethical research, evaluating other works of history, etc. which was great. I hadn't taken a lot of history courses before, so getting to know the discipline and learning how to do history research, not just archival work but also forming questions and arguments, was really awesome.",
    "This course develops crucial skills as as a researcher, writer, and human; this is an important history, and we are lucky to have the chance to learn it this thoroughly.",
    "I learned how to do real historical research and historical writing in a way that I never had before.",
    "I learned how to write an intensive history research paper using archival sources. I learned how to comb through an archive, how to write about documents that are vague and unclear, how to assess someone else's historical argument."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths -- well-organized and consistently focused on skills development Weaknesses -- none I can think of!",
    "Please see question 3. As for improvements, I wonder if it would be feasible to do peer reviews of the drafts of our final papers? I think this would be a horrible idea, because my paper was a hot mess throughout the process, and it might mean more work in a shorter time, but I don't know, maybe that could be helpful. I would have liked to see more readings dealing with communities of color, and maybe we could have talked more about that in our discussion on methodology and so forth? Like thinking about what we miss when we overlook race in our analysis, how to thoughtfully approach questions of race in our analysis, and, while acknowledging that our archives are limited, how to overcome or deal with archival limits, etc.",
    "This was a strong and amazing seminar. Because the material was defined largely by what we have access to as lgbtq scholars at this point it was largely the words and lives of white men, so I would have loved more engagement with queer women and queer people of color in general.",
    "Sometimes the reading assignments were changed at the last minute and there were some deadlines that were adjusted that I wasn't aware of. However, the course material itself was fascinating. I wish the syllabus had been more clear about the pre-war focus of the course, though."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! The class epitomizes the aims of a Yale College history departmental seminar: a rigorous exploration of historical methods and writing in a workshop setting. Professor Chauncey is without a shadow of doubt the most dedicated instructor in Yale College, and provided extensive feedback on research projects throughout the semester. It was a delight to hear from the leading-edge expert int he field.",
    "If offered the chance to, take it. This history is crucial, the archival research thrilling, and the experience of getting to spend 2 hours a week with professor Chauncey invaluable.",
    "If you can take a seminar with George Chauncey of any kind, even on the literal dictionary DO IT. You will not get a chance like this in your Yale education: doing primary source research in Beineke that very well could be groundbreaking in a developing field. Do it. Do it. Do it.",
    "Yes",
    "If you are interested in learning how to write history and love digging into archival sources, you will love this class. It is NOT an extension of the lecture - rather a focus on how to analyze and construct historical arguments. Chauncey is a wonderful teacher and manages to be critical while also incredibly kind. The majority of the semester was spent working on independent 20 page research papers, which was challenging but also fun."
