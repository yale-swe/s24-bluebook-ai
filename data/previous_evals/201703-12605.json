    "Being exposed to the vast amount of sources continues to be eye opening.",
    "We covered a lot of ground so I learned about varying types of Christian exegesis. But I also really appreciated the ways in which we approached secondary materials throughout the course, as a way to compare various scholarly methods for studying the material. That was helpful as I consider my own approaches to the study of ancient Christianity.",
    "Experience with primary sources, secondary sources. Gave me a degree of confidence in approachign primary sources, and broadly expanded my understanding of what can be done with secondary sources.",
    "This course helped focus my approach to ancient Christianity. The focus was on primary materials, with occasional recourse to secondary literature. This design helped facilitate original thought as it pertains to the ancient texts. Furthermore, given the subject of the course, I learned how texts were read and interpreted by a seemingly endless list of authors. This plurality of readers demonstrated the flexibility of textual strategies and aims."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall, the course is a very strong introduction to principles and practices of early Christian biblical interpretation. A particular strength was the well-curated selection of primary sources; the multiplicity of genres, contexts, and exegetical strategies we surveyed was SUPER helpful for getting a broad feel for the myriad and variegated ways that early Christians used the Bible. There is so much more to late ancient hermeneutics than \"Alexandria vs. Antioch\"! The addition of book reviews was also helpful, and a great way to expand the scope of the course without expanding the reading load. Overall, the course was exceptionally well-designed. The one flaw in course design was the assignment of group presentations on the last day of class. While I like the idea of group presentations, adding additional research burdens during the most research-heavy time of the year was an additional and unnecessary stressor.",
    "Strengths: looking at how the same text was interpreted by many different authors, having a good mix of primary and secondary materials, opportunity to lead discussion and do group work, the course was extremely well-organized Weaknesses: sometimes I wish that discussion would have been moderated a bit more, because certain students had a tendency to lead us off topic",
    "Excellent course. In the last week, we had to gather in groups and present ways of identifying sources on a particular theme. A bit more of this kind of exercise can be helpful.",
    "The course was excellent, overall. I enjoyed the syllabus and the curated list of readings. This has to be its biggest strength. The only weakness to come to mind is related to the professor's intentional restraint from several of the seminar weeks. That is, the class called for doctoral students to facilitate discussion, which also called for a lesser role for the professor. I feel that Dr. Doerfler could have been more involved when doctoral students were leading the class, even though I generally support her pedagogy in this regard. She tried to let the particular student have \"free reign,\" but nonetheless, I still wanted Dr. Doerfler's opinion on our discussions."

    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes! I thought it was helpful for thinking about methodology, the assignments were useful, and it's an important topic for the study of early Christianity.",
    "Yes, with the reasons given above.",
    "This class has a wide appeal, and for good reason. I highly recommend any course taught by Dr. Doerfler, and especially this one."
