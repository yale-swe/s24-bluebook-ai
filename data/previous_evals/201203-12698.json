   "comments": [
    "Introduction to Programming is perfect for those who think they might be interested in computer science, or who want to get a little experience with programming. It's very well taught and the material is extremely relevant and engaging. Problem sets take time, but they're manageable in that you essentially always know whether or not you've gotten the right answer, because your program will or won't compile, and will or won't produce the desired output. It was refreshing to be able to work alone in a QR class and still know whether or not your work is correct. There are also a lot a resources available to you if you do get stuck. Exams and problem sets have been stressful at times but generally fair, and Professor Abadi is a talented teacher.",
    "The problem solving and p-sets were fun exercises in critical thinking, but the class and lecturer were not great. I would recommend it to perspective cog-sci majors and people interested in cognitive science because it really helps display the complexities behind tasks that seem so easy to us. That said, I took this class as an easy class because I'm good at these kinds of things. The beginning was very slow and easy. Towards the end, there was more work. If you are good at critical thinking, there are less time-intensive classes if you're looking for an easy credit.",
    "Be ready for work, but you are probably going to be excited about it too. I would definitely recommend this class because helps you think about things logically.",
    "If you aren't very into Computer Science, this could be a very challenging and frustrating course. However, the logic that we use in building programs is extremely useful to everyone - whether science majors or not. So it depends on how much time you're willing to put into this course. I would definitely recommend this course - I absolutely loved it. All of the concepts were really interesting and I thought it was a very relevant class in that we learned a lot about logic. Professor Abadi is amazing. He's young and funny and vibrant, and he is very clear about what he's explaining. He makes sure everyone understands what's going on and he does a little bit of review at the beginning of class. There are weekly problem sets (8 of them) that get more and more challenging, so you can end up dedicating a lot of time each week to this class. But the important thing is that you start the problem sets early and go to the TA office hours. There are pretty much always office hours which is really helpful and the TAs are always there to help you with problems and walk you through the problem sets if you need them to. So the amount of time spent on problem sets really depends on how you go about doing them. A lot of the time can just be spent trying to figure out what small detail went wrong in your program - but getting help is essential. Overall, this class really turned me on to the computer science major and I'm SO glad I took this class. Awesome teacher.",
    "This was the most time consuming class of the semester. That being said, I would recommend this class. It teaches you to think in a different way. The psets take a very long time to complete, and don't be fooled by the first two, which are far easier and not an accurate reflection of the work demanded from the rest of the course. Psets are worth 50% of the grade. The material is interesting, and I managed to do well with no background in Java programming coming into the class. Lectures are short, and the textbook is good. TAs and peer tutors are fantastic.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I came into it slightly afraid of computer programming and I left having learned to love the puzzle-like problem solving of the computer programming world. Professor Abadi's lectures were clear and engaging and the problem sets were quite fun (if you are the kind of person who likes solving logic puzzles). Take it.",
    "This course is a great introduction to programming, and I highly recommend taking it if you have any interest at all in learning the fundamentals of programming in Java. Professor Abadi is excellent.",
    "This course seemed manageable during the first few weeks, but once the course got going it became extremely time consuming, and those without a steady grasp on the topics struggled. However, there were plenty of resources (peer tutors, TA's, office hours, etc.) available for those who needed them. I would recommend this course to those either with LOTS of time to spend on it or with high interest\/proficiency in the topic.",
    "Take it, but be prepared for up to 15 hrs a week for psets",
    "Absolutely. It was an interesting and engaging course.",
    "Recommend if you have a pretty easy course load otherwise. Definitely takes up way more time than I had thought - 10-20 hrs a week on problem sets, and definitely go to the office hours. Make sure you're really interested and the type of person that doesn't get frustrated easily. There's a HUGE amount of time just trying to figure out what you did wrong, so if you're the type of person that is a perfectionist \/ likes to get things done correctly within the first 200 times, this is probably not for you. The first few weeks are wildly easy, and then week three or four, it got a lot harder.",
    "If you aren't sure whether you should take this class, you should take it. You learn valuable skills for the future (even basic programming is extremely useful), you learn to think in a logical, step-wise manner, and you gain an appreciation for all the other programs that you use throughout the day.The workload isn't incredible, being a problemset due every week and a half or so. They get harder as you go, so don't leave them to the last minute, but they are by no means impossible. There are plenty of office hours if you don't quite understand something and the TFs are very helpful.You should take this class.",
    "If you just want to learn programming, I would take this class Credit\/D\/Fail. It's tough for people who are not naturally inclined to program.",
    "Whether you want to be a CS major or not, CS112 is an amazing course. Since it moves at a resonably quick pace, you learn a lot about programming in just a few months. The skills and way of thinking you learn are invaluable and very applicable to the real world. Although the problem sets take several hours to complete, they are usually fun to work on and reinforce the material learned in class. Likewise, midterm and final were challenging but fair. Finally, Professor Abadi was wonderful: he always made lectures engaging and enjoyable.",
    "See response to question 1. Seriously, go read it if you're on the fence about this course enough that you're actually looking at the evaluations.",
    "Good intro to programming in java. If you have taken programming before, do a higher level. The class is pretty interesting though.",
    "Be very careful: if you find programming very challenging during the first two weeks, then this is likely not the class for you. Although I was fascinated by the material and spent limitless* hours on the course, this was the most painfully frustrating course I've ever taken at Yale (and I say this as a senior).",
    "This is a hard class that involves thinking in a new way that is not always intuitive to everyone. Although it has it's frustrating and annoying parts, overall getting a program to work is one of the more rewarding feelings I have had in my academic career. I would very much recommend this class because of that feeling, and also because learning how to program is an important skill. As a music major I still found this class to be one of my favorites in my time at Yale.",
    "Take it! I'm not exactly super computer inclined and before this class I only knew how to \"println\" things (aka no programming experience whatsoever), but felt that this class was totally manageable, and very satisfying in terms of the knowledge I've walked away with. The psets are also reasonable and if you go to office hours you will almost always get them done. Definitely take this class.",
    "It is a really good class. You can learn the basics of programming in an easy language. I would take it again if I could go back in time. Take it seriously and you can get a lot out of it. Also, finishing a program that works is one of the best feelings ever!",
    "I thought I would like this class because I like math things...that didn't mean it was easy\/took no time, but was still interesting to learn about.",
    "Good class for people who really want to learn programming. If you aren't willing to put in the work you won't do well or enjoy this class, but if you do then it is very rewarding.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has not had a programming course before. You learn a lot from the time put in. Do not get put off by the reports next to this of the problem set commitments. They are true, but that is how you learn the material.",
    "Compsci 112 gives a solid introduction to programming in Java. I recommend it to someone who has a genuine interest in the subject and is willing to spend a lot of time working on the problem sets.",
    "While the class is not supposed to be about learning Java, it actually ends up being that. Having said that, it also fulfills its purpose of teaching you how to approach programming problems and see how you can apply\/write programs for tasks. Good fun exercise in logic and problem solving. Problem sets get hard as the semester goes on. It's likely that you'll spend 10 hours on the last few. But it's very satisfying to have completed them. Even if your program doesn't work you'll have learnt something. Exams are straightforward. If you're followed the lecture material, played around a bit with Java\/lecture programs in your own time and done the problem sets then you'll have enough experience to do the midterm\/final possibly without even studying.",
    "I would recommend it. If you are new to comp sci like I was, it will be a bit of a challenge, and the P-Sets will provide some late nights, but you really learn a lot.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. It teaches you about the importance of algorithms. It is a lot of work though.",
    "Computer science was often a struggle for me, and I don't think I fall in the category of people who just \"get\" it naturally. That being said, it's certainly possible to succeed in this class if you're willing to put in a LOT of time. As the semester progresses, psets take more and more time (several of hours), so be aware of this before the fact.",
    "Bad. You can't learn programming in a classroom. Too fast paced. Unhelpful book. Not enough practice material. Too hard to find your errors when you can't even read an error message since it is in code you don't understand.",
    "Computer science is a great class. It challenges people logically and the class can be very fun. I would recommend the class.",
    "This course can be a fun class. It's one of those classes either you get it and it comes naturally or you don't. It also is a major time investment. Therefore, if you don't have at least 10 hours to invest each week on a problem set then I wouldn't do it.",
    "Yes because its a fun and interesting course that is manageable yet challenging.",
    "Whether you are planning on becoming a computer science major or not, CPSC 112 is a good course to take. We mostly worked in Dr. Java; however, the course is not focused on learning Java but on how to think like a programmer and how solve problems logically. The grading is based on problem sets (50%), a mid-term (20%) and a final (30%). One problem set is usually due every week. Start early on the problem sets and make use of office hours because they are NOT easy! The exams are open book and notes but unless you have been doing the problem sets regularly and practicing questions given at the back of the book, you will find the exams difficult and having a book in front won't help.The course isn't easy but its definitely useful. If you are not planning on becoming a computer science major you might want to take the course Credit D\/Fail.",
    "Yes if you considering majoring CS, not as an easy QR...it's a basic introduction to how to program so don't expect to be able to program the next facebook after this, but overall nice, PS are very very hard, but office hours can help, get to know other students from the class right on the beginning so you could solve it together.",
    "CPSC 112 is a fantastic intro course if you have no programming background and want to see if comp sci could be for you. The problem sets are simple at first, but get very complex. If you are a logical thinker, enjoy math, or have a knack for QR, 112 should be fun for you (and not terribly difficult). I really enjoyed 112, and it helped me understand if comp sci was for me.",
    "Good course. Moves really pretty slowly, which is great as an intro course because it allows your brain time to soak in a new way of thinking. It's like learning a new language; the more you spend time using it, the better and more natural at it you become. You will learn a lot in class, but will not truly understand material unless completing the Psets, most of which take a good amount of time (start out around 3 hrs, then about 6, then ending at around 14). Most Psets, however, are genius and very fun to solve. It is one of the greatest feelings solving a PSet or even one step in a Pset or error that has been staring at your for hours. Abadi is really good. I think that he was great at teaching everything up until Objects. When it got to Objects, none of it really made sense. I did not truly understand how Objects related to super classes\/subclasses\/polymorphism, or even how main methods properly used objects. I think his Pset on this topic was interesting (pretty much created pokemon) but I think he should write a PSet that truly relates a main method to classes, forcing students to understand how to write their own main method and their own class and how they interrelate.",
    "CPSC 112 provides an overview of Java. By the end of the course students are able to write programs to solve Sudoku puzzles and control critters in a game. There are eight problem sets, a midterm exam, and a final exam. The problem sets get significantly harder throughout the semester. The sets at the end can take approximately twenty hours. I would recommend the course if you are interested in programming. Because the problem sets can take so much time, it is important that you are interested in the topic.",
    "Comp Sci 112 is an applications-driven approach to introducing Java programming. Take it if you want to learn the basics of how to code in Java, but be aware that it's not going to give you much information about what's going on behind the scenes. Lectures basically just go over the textbook material; you can probably get by only doing one or the other.",
    "A good way to start learning how to program using java. I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is a logical thinker.",
    "Great intro class but be prepared to spend hours on your problem sets.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. If you can handle the time commitment over the course of the semester, it does so much for you beyond just learning a new language. You learn how to approach problem-solving in a totally new way. Take take take.",
    "This class is pretty useful and it can't hurt to have some exposure to programming, especially with the growing importance of computer science in the world we live in today.",
    "This is a great class. I would recommend it to anyone. If you just need another QR, it's useful and not too hard. If you (like me) need to work with computers in your major but don't know much about them, take it and enjoy it!",
    "If you have a really strong interest in being a computer programmer, or have 20 hours a week to spend on a problem set, go for it.I found I wasn't gaining much from lectures, and had to go to office hours 1-3 times a week in order to get an elementary understanding of the material. However, I'm not a strong math student, so this could be why.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Very important stuff to know, very interesting way of looking at the world. Also, with Professor Abadi it's well taught and cool to learn.",
    "Most definitely I would recommend this course. It was perfect in every possible way. I loved the teacher, I like the material, I enjoyed doing the problem sets, and I liked the students I was in class with. The only draw back was that the final and midterm were handwritten, which is not something we do in class throughout the year at all.",
    "Wonderful class. Try to finish problem sets before the weekend.",
    "CS 112 is a GREAT intro CS class. I went in knowing nothing about CS and came out with some basic knowledge but more importantly with a very good understanding of what computer science really is. After taking this class, it will be abundantly clear to you whether CS is for you or not. Additionally, Abadi is a great professor and very approachable.",
    "If you have no experience in programming before and you're interested in learning it, it's a good place to start. Overall, I think it's a great course. At the end of the semester, you do learn a lot about programming in Java and other programming concepts in general. However, if you don't have any programming experience prior to this course, you might need to spend a great amount of time struggling through problem sets and a small project at the end. Nonetheless, the TAs are very helpful whenever you get stuck on problem sets. I knew nothing about programming when I take this course, and I can say by the end of the semester, I learn tons of things.",
    "It gets a lot more difficult after the first few weeks (as Prof. Abadi warns at the beginning of the semester) and it's really important to do all the readings in addition to going to lecture. The problem sets take a while and can be frustrating. It's definitely worth it to do all the readings, go to all the lectures and start the problem sets early. It required more work than I anticipated but it's not too bad. I found it rewarding to know even just the basics of Java by the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course as a good and thorough introduction to basic programming tools (for\/while loops, if statements, arrays, and a little object-oriented programming). I would not however, treat the course as any other intro course with minimal work. You will only get a lot out of the class if you put time into the problem sets, which for most people who are unfamiliar with programming and or are not \"naturals\" will take a lot of time and patience.",
    "Yes, yes a thousand times yes. Every semester since coming to Yale I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shopped this course, and now I so wish I had taken it earlier so that I had more time to take more CS classes.The problem sets are challenging, but there are SO MANY TAs tha are down to help you and the feeling of completion you get when you finish one is unmatched by the one you get when you finish an essay (do you ever, really, finish an essay?).Aside from being fun and unlike anything else I took (and Abadi is the man, he takes what could be a very prodcedural class and makes it interesting, fun and relevant) I also think that learning how to think this way is important to being a modern citizen. Why learn it on your own when you can learn it in a structured class environment? Take it, and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what I mean. The hours you spend on the Psets will fly by.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone with a slight interest in programming. It's so applicable to many fields. You can take it credit\/d if you are worried about your grade. The class grade is also 50% problem set. Even though it may take a while, it's not too difficult to get a good grade on problem sets.",
    "A good intro to Java programming for someone with no experience and a good way to satisfy a QR credit. I would recommend it to another student.",
    "Intro to Programming starts off very simple, especially during shopping period. However, don't be fooled by this. The problem sets for this course are intensive and will take you a while, so make sure you have the time for them.",
    "CPSC112 is a good introduction to programming, in introducing you to all of the basic concepts and piquing your curiosity about further computer science classes. The problem sets and exams are all very fair, and you will be completely fine if you keep up. I would recommend the class, as it was both fun and inspiring, as I plan to take more computer science classes.",
    "The class as taught by professor Abadi is very good. Definitely recommend.",
    "Take it if you're really interested in programming. It's going to be tough and you're going to find yourself hating the course at times. But in the end it will be worth it. Some students complained that it teaches you nothing practical, but Prof. Abadi took steps to change that. The problem sets are grueling, get started on them early and always go to office hours for help.",
    "Yes! It was really a lot of fun, and quite interesting. I would shop it, and if you don't \"get it\" on the first problem set, and don't enjoy figuring it out, don't take the class, because they only get more difficult from there.",
    "This is a great course if you think you might have any interest in programming. If it clicks for you, it becomes a very easy class. Problem sets still take about 6-10 hours to complete, but you can pretty much choose between either doing the readings OR paying attention in lecture.",
    "It is an introduction to the techniques of programming in general through the use of Java. You will learn how to take a problem and break it down into components that can be explained to a computer and then executed. If you enjoy problem-solving -- and long hours not being able to solve the problem -- then this course is for you. If you are too easily frustrated, then you will probably not enjoy this class.",
    "The professor taught so closely to the textbook that I rarely attended lecture. I essentially taught myself java from the textbook. That said, learning java was a lot of fun and doing the problem sets was often the most enjoyable homework I did each week. While the class itself felt like a bit of a waste, learning java is definitely worthwhile. Taking the class forced me to do it, and the TAs were super helpful.",
    "I would definitely recommend CPSC 112 to a fellow student especially if s\/he likes puzzles. A majority of the problem sets are like puzzle-solving. The workload is very manageable. There are 8 problem sets throughout the semester. The first 4-5 are pretty fast, but it is easy to spend a lot of time on later problem sets. The time spent on problem sets increases exponentially throughout the semester so the 20 min problem set assigned the first week is no indication of your workload throughout the semester. There is also a midterm and a final and they really test your understanding by asking fairly tricky questions. However, since they're open book\/open note, tricky questions are really the only way to separate students by test scores. Also, since the tests are open book\/open note, they emphasize critical thinking versus regurgitation. So, the only true way to study for the tests is to spend a lot of time on problem sets or doing practice programming. All in all, would definitely recommend this class to be more literate on what computer scientists do!",
    "It's a course that you should take if you would like to get a flavor in programming.",
    "CS112 introduces you to the basics of Java programming. Professor Abadi is a really good professor, and the problem sets are really manageable and are like solving little puzzles. I would recommend this class to a student who has no programming experience (in any language) and isn't frustrated to take a few hours to parse out how to solve a problem set.",
    "My simultaneous fear of college-level calculus and unwillingness to settle for a gut QR brought me to CS 112, along with my interest in graphic design (for which a base knowledge of programming is a definite boost). CS 112 was hard, full of grueling Wednesday nights in the library working on problem sets until sunrise and one of the hardest midterms I've ever taken, but it was so, so worth it. Take it with a group of friends in your college and those nights won't feel so long, and don't stress too much about the midterm\u00e2\u0080\u0094there's a curve and the final has a much more reasonable time cushion. The problem sets are fun, maybe not always while you're stuck debugging, but always once you solve the puzzle. Although you won't come out of the class with super applicable knowledge about building websites or fluent in Java by any stretch of the imagination, you will have a good basis for understanding how to get there on your own.",
    "Would most certainly recommend it to allow students to develop a basic programming background. Not an easy class though, would not recommend as a 'gut'.",
    "CS 112 is not an easy class but it is very useful. Many basic programs can be written with the information gained in this class. However, it is a time consuming class and daily attention to the material definitely pays off. It is great class but difficult if you have other classes, in my case a profession, that takes you away from the time you need to developing your coding skills.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. I took it CrD, which was really good even though I spent a lot of time on the psets. It meant that I could be a lot more relaxed on the exams, and could spend the time really learning the material at my own pace. I would def recommend it, as I took this class as a senior non-CS major. Programming is fundamental to everything really, and a basic knowledge of it -- while not necessarily useful -- gives great insight into the world.",
    "This is an introduction to programming, but don't expect to come out KNOWING java. It isn't really a good indication of the computer science major from what I've heard. But, it was fun and really helped me get used to programming (which helped when I had to use Stata for example). Problem sets take HOURS honestly.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a bit of experience and want to know more about programming. I am not sure if I'd recommend taking the class to someone who has absolutely no clue about CS because even if it starts from zero it moves on pretty fast. I guess this class is beneficial for people who never had the chance to take a class in CS but tried to find out something about CS by themselves.",
    "Please take this class! It is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Abadi is one of most dedicated instructors of Yale. The class is not easy. The homework toward the end of the course took an average of 15 hours. I had no programming experience and learned a lot in the class. It is really slow paced, so you have time to really grasp the concepts. FRESHMEN AND SOPHOMORES! Consider taking this class and majoring in compsci. The skills learned in this class and in the major will be the skills required by many employers in the near future. If you think that investment banks pay well, you should take a look at software companies. You work from home, fewer than 40 hours a week, and are paid more than in an investment bank. If you do not have a busy schedule and actually want to learn something. The curve is EXTREMELY GENEROUS. Professor Abadi takes the students who have programming experience out of the curve and curve the class again. It's great!"
