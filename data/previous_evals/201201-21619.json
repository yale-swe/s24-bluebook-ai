    "This class is a relatively interesting class, but people with a want for theory will be left wanting. Only in the last few weeks do we cover the theoretical backing that was used throughout the entire course. Also much time is spent reviewing special relativity which can get boring.Also, much of every class is spent doing out long derivations which don't add much understanding.",
    "The course is incredibly difficult. Even if you did well in the quantum mechanics courses that are the prerequisite, it doesn't make any promises as to how well you will do in the course.",
    "It's a good course if you want to know more about particle physics. Will go through everything from Griffiths.",
    "This is not a great course. The subject matter simply is not suitable for undergraduates. Particle physics relies on group theory and quantum field theory to really make sense; this course attempts the subject without either.",
    "Physics 442 is a good class and I would recommend taking it if you are considering doing research in particle physics. The material is kind of boring early on (lots of rules governing particle reactions with no context, relativistic kinematics), but starts to get more interesting after the first two weeks. The last part of the course is awesome (GWS theory, the Higgs mechanism, neutrino oscillations). I recommend reading a bit about representation theory and Lie algebras to make the bound states and QCD sections easier to follow.",
    "This class is a nice introduction to the Standard Model. Some of the details are invariably involved (or tedious, depending on the relative velocity of your reference frame) and some of the integrals are pretty furry (don't worry, this choice of adjective will be like 5% funnier after Chapter 7). Lectures are very detailed and problem sets are generally very manageable in a couple hours each week, although a few select problems can be nightmarishly long or tricky. The midterm and final are both open book, open note, open homework, so hold on to all of these. Some of the exam problems can be long, but not really especially tricky if you're thinking with a clear head. Also, a word of warning to any potential enemies of Communism considering this course - one of the homework problems asks you to show that a theorem holds for a particular Feynman diagram. Doesn't sound like a problem, right? Well first off doing anything with Feynman diagrams is a pain, and that's kind of a problem. But the real problem is that the theorem is named after a Communist sympathizer who was not only accused of sedition by Senator McCarthy but also verifiably guilty of affiliation with Harvard. The dastardliness of the integrals involved in solving this problem is out-eviled only by the moral bankruptcy of the Communist society this physicist sought to create. In conclusion, if you are interested in learning about the Standard Model of particle physics or (that's right, \"or\") recognize any redeeming qualities in Communist doctrine, you should strongly consider taking this course. This course evaluator also sincerely hopes that the previous sentence will create a generous curve for future physics students."
