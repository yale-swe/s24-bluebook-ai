   "comments": [
    "important knowledge about climate",
    "Knowledge about fuel systems, and basic petroleum systems as well as the consequences of fossil fuel use",
    "I learned about the geologic properties of fossil fuels, world energy use, and energy and its implications on the environment.",
    "I learned a great deal about the world energy market.",
    "I thought this was an interesting class teaching the fundamentals of fossil fuel development and extraction. The class covered a lot of material about their formation, extraction, use, and impacts. Overall, it was great for understanding the entire life cycle of fossil fuels, and also understanding the world's energy systems.",
    "The course was transformative and I learned so much about energy systems. It gave both a broad and nuanced perspective on energy today, and really delivered an understanding of the systems that support it. I learned about the economics, geology, and biological reasons for our fossil fuels and other systems today, and how they might change as we move into the future.",
    "Fossil fuel systems, effects, alternatives, origins.",
    "We learned about fossil fuels in several different contexts: as natural resources and how they are extracted, refined, and used; the uses of fossil fuels in the world's energy system; fossil fuels as chemical substances; fossil fuels in light of global warming, and the overall characteristics of the global energy network.",
    "You learn the basics about how fossil fuels form and are extracted from the environment.",
    "I learned about the coal and petroleum systems and how each of these complex processes affects our environment and the way in which climate change affects us",
    "Gained knowledge about how fossil fuels are produced and what types of geologic circumstances are necessary for creating these resources. Also learned about energy use in the U.S. and the world and scenarios that could potentially decrease global warming and climate change.",
    "The uses, sources, and sectors of fossil fuels. The effects that fossil fuels have on the world economy, environment, and geology.",
    "A knowledge of geologic and chemical processes of fossil fuels. Understanding of how fossil fuels are actually used in society, and how they create climate change.",
    "I learned a lot about fossil fuels.",
    "Gained basic knowledge of fossil fuel systems and the chemistry behind fossil fuels. Also the geographic location of the large petroleum systems.",
    "The basics on fossil fuels and how it is affecting the world.",
    "I developed a knowledge of fossil fuel systems, in regards to their geology and relation to the environment. I learned to calculate such numbers as my carbon footprint, and carbon emission predictions based on changes in such factors as population and energy intensity. The course is, at its heart, science- rather than policy-based, but I also gained exposure to historical and current-event issues regarding climate change and fossil fuels."

   "comments": [
    "It was an amazing course, Professor Oristaglio is so invested in this topic and is so happy to teach us about this. he takes time to help us and makes sure we understand everything.",
    "None.",
    "The assignments often covered very niche topics, and thus were tedious. An example of this was problem set three, where we spent incredible amounts of time searching databases for trivial information. We would have understood the purpose of the assignment from one example rather than four or five.",
    "Strengths are the psets",
    "The course was fine, I thought there weren't any outstanding pros or cons. I do wish that the class focused more around fixing the problems faced by fossil fuels, such as making them more efficient. This felt like it was teaching how to use and extract fossil fuels, which wasn't totally what I was looking for. However, I do think this was because Oristaglio wanted us to have a good foundational knowledge of fossil fuels to move forward.",
    "Loved the course. i learned more than I could have asked for. The Psets were really fair, and the study sessions gave us every opportunity to synthesize and deeply understand the material. The lectures were so engaging, grounded in real-world topics, and a lot of exigency! I know a lot of students didn't fully pay attention because they thought it was a gut.... but if you did, you'd get a lot out of it! Prof Oristaglio put SO much effort into crafting concise, insightful, illustrative slides. They doubled as a fantastic study guide. I didn't feel that this was a gut: the exams were very intense, and the psets could be challenging if you started late.I actually really enjoyed the readings, especially the one about the salt basins and the early BP world energy reports! I am so thankful for the love, passion, and \"energy\" (lol) that Prof Oristaglio poured into teaching us. I wouldn't have changed a thing. Also loved the halloween surprise, and handling the samples of fossil fuels, rock types, and coal!",
    "Very interesting material for any student. But it could be taught in 50-minute lectures.",
    "Strengths: covers the nitty-gritty science of coal\/petroleum systems but also discusses climate change and how fossil fuels have contributed to it Weaknesses: the content and the lectures were a little dry (maybe because I'm not much of a science person haha)",
    "Strength: interesting topic, well taught. Weakness: bit of repetitive lecture structure.",
    "Course material was very interesting and relevant, but lectures were at times not very engaging. Class demonstrations were helpful and engaging.",
    "The strengths were the problem sets, Professor Oristaglio's kindness, and the hands on demonstrations.",
    "Strengths: Oristaglio is just the absolute nicest professor out there. The psets are the majority of the course and they aren't bad. Generous with extensions. Cons: distance of KGL",
    "The problem sets included too much busy work, and not enough real intellectual challenge.",
    "Strengths: Study sessions were very helpful for problem sets, and the professor was willing to help.",
    "Strengths: The course's grading structure is excellent- 60% from problem sets, 15% from midterm, and 20% from final. The focus is definitely on fortifying real knowledge over the semester, rather than forcing you to worry about your entire grade from the outcome of one exam. Professor Oristaglio holds multiple office hours for each p-set, which I found to be incredibly helpful. The midterms and finals are fair as well. Furthermore, the topic is really interesting, and you'll get to learn about the entire life cycle of fossil fuels, from creation to remediation\/mitigation. Weaknesses: Honestly, not much- I really enjoyed the class. If anything, I'd say that the extra credit system is kind of arbitrary, and the readings aren't fully discussed in class sometimes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Professor Oristaglio makes this course worth it. He is absolutely wonderful and caring. Also, the material is interesting and it is a gem of a science credit.",
    "Very much so.",
    "Yes, solid science credit that is in an interesting field rather than something boring",
    "Yes, if you are interested in understanding the world's energy sources, this class is very interesting. The problem sets cover a lot of different topics, which is nice and the workload is not too high.",
    "I would. I'm a STEM major, and I found Professor Oristaglio offered tremendous insight about a branch of science I knew little about. However, this was not always presented in the most compelling fashion.",
    "Yes. It is very interesting",
    "I think this is a good course for understanding the current world energy system. I think for anyone looking to go into energy or environmental studies, this course is good for learning why we're in the predicament that we're in. Can be a bit tedious, but it's a good extra class if you're looking for something important that also isn't too much work.",
    "Absolutely. This was one of my favorite courses this semester, and left me with a lot of takeaways that I know will keep me up at night. Especially helpful for architecture or urbanism students. So often, climate critics and climate skeptics (both sides) don't have a real understanding of the earth fluxes and deep geology that lead to the energy systems or crises of today. Take this class to understand them. Also, the economics play such a large role and we got a great understanding of those.",
    "Yes. Great science credit. Professor really cares, content is interesting, workload is fine.",
    "Yes, a great course with really interesting material. Take a look at the syllabus if you're thinking of taking the course to get a good feel for the material",
    "I would not as I do t feel that you actually gained a great deal of knowledge.",
    "YES! It's a really laid-back and pretty interesting science class! Not gonna lie, it gets a little boring when it comes to doing the math and learning about the REALLY science-y stuff, but I think the climate change and fossil fuel use and pricing were really interesting!",
    "Yes, its a topic that is helpful to know at least on an introductory basis.",
    "I would recommend this course. I thought the material was interesting and content was something that is extremely relevant and useful, but accessible to someone who has no background in energy studies.",
    "Yes, Professor Oristaglio is engaging and has a passion for fossil fuels.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The lectures are a little bit dry, and problem sets take forever and are tedious to complete.",
    "Maybe. If you are really interested in the subject then yes, however, the lectures can get boring if you aren't invested in the material.",
    "If you are interested in fossil fuels and the sciences that go into it then yes.",
    "Take it! Whether you're a humanities or STEM major, this class is really meaningful- the prereq IIRC is just basic chemistry, and there's no barrier to understanding any of the topics that we discuss in class since Professor Oristaglio is very thorough. The class is graded fairly, without too much of an emphasis on exams. The p-sets initially took a while, but on average took me about 3-4 hrs every two weeks, which was definitely doable. 274 isn't a gut science credit, but it's also not a class you should get stressed about. If you take this class, you'll be able to better understand the things we hear about on the news regarding energy usage and climate change, and I think that it's absolutely worth it."
