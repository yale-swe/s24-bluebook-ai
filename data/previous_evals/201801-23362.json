   "comments": [
    "Temporal mode theory and the mode coupling. Also learnt a lot about noise theory and Green function method.",
    "I learned a lot about ways to think about fields and modes, and became a lot more comfortable with the mathematical manipulations involved.",
    "The most important thing that I have gained from taking Modern Topics in Optics and Quantum Electronics was the background and perspective to follow current research in the field and be able to continue learning myself in any tangent field. The course has also equipped with many specific formalisms of mathematics and new manipulation techniques. It has made very concrete connections between different subfields of physics, which I was able to make use of in other courses that I took. Taking this course I have learned formalisms of optics, but also gained new insights into connections in physics.",
    "Rotating wave approximation, how waveguides work, and the basics of quantum and classical mechanics.",
    "Coupled mode theory"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It will be even better if we can have more specific examples.",
    "Strengths: Lectures were interesting. The topics were all interesting and very relevant for experimentalists. It was nice to have a class about the theory behind experiments that wasn't taught at a crazy level. I learned a ton from the mini-project! It was nice to be able to sit down and do out some of the calculations that relate to my research that I hadn't had a reason to do out before. Also, I liked that the lectures use a lot of the same lingo as papers in the field. I have found that a lot of things I learned in the course have popped up in papers (things that I just didn't know the word for before). Weaknesses: I found there to be too much review of material covered in other graduate courses. I know that that is very helpful for some students, but it might be useful for students that have solid backgrounds to opt out. For example, having a problem set that heavily reviewed hamiltonian mechanics for 1\/3 of it was a lot. Another way to do it could have been to have a 4 problems pick 2 where 2 were review of hamiltonian mechanics and 2 were new applications that you wouldn't get out of a classical mechanics class. Also, I would have liked to have more homework assignments that were all slightly shorter so we could have had problems on a greater selection of the course. I learn by doing and would have liked to have HW after spring break.",
    "Strengths: Professor Rakich was incredibly helpful and approachable. He really cared about the class. The course was a good overview. Cons: I think it would have been good to cover more material. Weekly psets would have very good for better internalizing material.",
    "A strength of the course is that it follows a good amount of material in a structured manner. The teaching of the material is also well-paced and keeps track of the students learning. The homework assignments were very interesting and informative, but a setup where students have weekly or biweekly homework assignment could also help students check their understanding of the material regularly.",
    "Strengths: The professor clearly cares a lot about the course and there are so many resources for every single thing he covers. The TF is also pretty cool. Weaknesses: Sometimes the lectures can get stuck on concepts that are important but most people already understand them. Having written notes is already sufficient - if something needs repeating, maybe write on the notes which previous notes could be referenced as well as the books. The homeworks are also weird. There are a ton of questions to answer but only three problem sets. It would be significantly better to break those into two problems for a problem set every week. (The final project is mildly intimidating, especially with the written homework problem component. That doesn't necessarily need to change, though, unless other students have complained about it too.)",
    "The course would be better if the pre-requisites were clearer so Prof. Rakich didn't have to spend time going over things like poisson brackets and basics of quantum mechanics. I thought the progression through topics could have been smoother if he didn't have to stop and go over these fundamental topics. I like the idea of the course, but some more thought into what the main purpose of the class is in order. During lecture, he should spend less time talking through algebra steps that people should be able to see quickly.",
    "It is advanced and interesting, especially it is close to our research topics."

   "comments": [
    "It is more suitable for the students who work on modern optics compared to other guys working on electronics.",
    "Yes! For anyone that does research related to experimental quantum optics, this is a must.",
    "This is a solid course! We had not enough psets to fully understand the material, but if you do work on your own outside of class you can still get a lot out of the lectures. Also, I think Professor Rakich was more busy than usual this semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning current methods and formalisms in optics. However if you are not interested in optics, this course would still be a great physics class to take for how it brings together the general study of wave mechanics with quantum mechanics and quantum mechanics with aspects of classical mechanics. You might enjoy this course if you are looking to develop your understanding of connections within physics and like learning interesting tools from mathematics!",
    "Yes, only because this was the professor's first time teaching the course and so the things that were weird this semester are unlikely to be problems again, and the material itself is really interesting and the professor is clearly extremely invested in the success of his students, which is so nice.",
    "Yes, the instructor is very active and patient. He can explain any questions related to his course very well."
