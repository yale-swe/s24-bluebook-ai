   "comments": [
    "Great class, you'll see your ability improving over the course of the semester, which is nice. Not a class on software - most of the semester is spent working with xacto knife and glue. Critiques can drag sometimes, but they're usually fun with Julian. I would take it if you know how to use Photoshop\/Illustrator but have never received training on approach\/theory.",
    "This class will take lots of your time, but it is totally worth it! It is a nice break from the science classes that I was taking. Definitely recommend it, and take it with Julian! Not all sections are the same, and whether or not you enjoy a class depends largely on your instructor. Julian is amazing! You will learn a lot from him, and will end up loving Swiss graphic design, too.",
    "This was a great class. Art classes at Yale don't just teach you how to make art; they quite literally change how you look at the world. Julian is a great guy. He's very open (and aware of his own visual biases for example), and he provides helpful advice. For many of the projects in the class, you'll do multiple iterations. I found myself making substantial changes from iteration to iteration. It was clear that I was learning and growing as a designer. Note that you'll spend much of the semester working with your hands -- I loved this! It was nice to not be looking at a screen for change. There's also something to be said about the physical object. I definitely recommend this class. I'm looking forward to working on my own graphic-design side projects after I graduate!",
    "A great introduction to design principles. I recommend this class to any student interested in learning about graphic design (whether or not you're looking to pursue a career in design).",
    "This is hardly an easy fifth class (but you probably already know this)! I spent about 6-7 hours a week on our assignments. Students submit work on Tuesday (never Thursday): I really appreciated that schedule, but I understand that other students might find it unbalanced or top-heavy. The class itself is moderately interesting, sometimes a little boring, but often thought-provoking. Julian is smart and articulate and funny! By the end of the semester, you'll understand his likes and dislikes very well. I guess that means class can be a little predictable? I still enjoyed the semester!",
    "I highly recommend this course if one is at all interested in design. You will learn so much in terms of composition and technique, and will be introduced to many other great designers and designs. The class is a lot of work, but it is well worth it in the end.",
    "Awesome class! Crits (every Thursday usually) can be a little tedious.",
    "Great class, definitely work taking. It is perhaps the most 'pragmatic' of the introductory art courses: the discussion revolves around fairly visual aspects as opposed to somewhat more ambiguous ones in other photography or drawing classes. The work load is not excessive.",
    "A brilliant course with a brilliant instructor! If you are even slightly interested in design or visual arts, you should absolutely take it. Julian is a world-class designer and one of the best instructors I have ever encountered at Yale. I really appreciate his support -- he is always ready to answer questions in depth and to provide additional feedback after class. I really learned a lot from him. The course itself is quite diverse, you start with basic abstract compositions, then you get into typographical compositions and posters, then you analyze works of renowned designer, and for the final projects you create a catalogue of your own collection. The final project is very rewarding -- it teaches to see the world differently and draw inspiration from everyday objects. Even though the class is quite work heavy, I never noticed that -- I was thrilled to start every next homework (some time it took over 20 hours a week because of my perfectionism). Bottom line, take it! No matter how familiar with design you are, this class will push boundaries of your creativity."
