    "Physics 201 is a good way to delve into physics, unless you want to try 261, which is probably another very good class. Even though it is an introductory physics sequence, Physics 201 spends a decent amount of time on quantum mechanics in the last few weeks. The topics include electromagnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics. Some knowledge of complex numbers is useful as well, but can be learned easily enough while taking the class.",
    "Maybe. Be prepared for hard work.",
    "If Shankar is teaching it, it'll go really fast. He makes the constant assumption that everyone has already seen electricity, magnetism, and optics in high school before. If you have, great, but if you haven't, be prepared to put in a lot of extra work.He's a good lecturer and adds humor every now and then, but it definitely appeared as if he was teaching PHYS 201 in the same way he probably would've presented PHYS 402.Keep in mind that a lot of kids drop out of Phys 200, so if you weren't doing phenomenal then, you're even lower on the scale now.",
    "Challenging course in electromagnetism, geometric and wave optics, and quantum mechanics. Not for the math-shy, but it's a really awesome class!",
    "Take 201 if your preparation in Physics is considerably good. Just know that half the people in our class got fives on both portions of Physics C with ease and are still struggling.",
    "An extremely difficult class, especially with Shankar. However, that being said, this class will really push you to think about physics at a college level and you will become a flexible problem solver. Be prepared to spend 10+ hours a week on the problem sets though. Hard tests as well.",
    "This is a fine course if you want to finish the physics started in 200. It is more difficult and the problem sets take a lot of time. Professor Harris is better than Professor Shankar, so definitely take it if Harris is teaching. The TAs are worthless, so find other students to work with.",
    "Professor Shankar is a great teacher. However, he made up his own problem sets this semester, which were way too hard.",
    "Do not take this course while Shankar is still teaching it.",
    "Physics 201 will make you a man of elementary physics.",
    "I took this class with Shankar, which makes my experience significantly different from other 201 years. It's on open courses.",
    "Follow-up to Physics 201. I imagine it's a requirement, but if you're just taking it for fun, take it with Shankar. He's amazing.",
    "I learned a lot from this class, but it was way more work than it was worth. I love physics but a lot of the problem sets were excessively long and difficult. Way beyond intellectually stimulating or rewarding.I think this may be because Shankar was teaching for the online course so he used difficult problems that were kind of interesting on psets and tests. Many pset questions came from 401 psets. Shankar is funny and brilliant, but not an incredible teacher. He seems to know the material almost too well to explain it.I recommend 201 if you liked the rigor of 200 or didn't like how theoretical and proof-based 260 was. I wouldn't really recommend switching in from 180 and I think it's definitely worth considering dropping down from 200 to 181. It will make your life easier and will probably only be marginally less rewarding.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who wants to go into physics.",
    "It's a great class. I think in part this was because Prof. Shankar was teaching it, but it covers a fair amount of interesting material. If you want an advanced applied physics intro, this is the class you should take. 260 is harder, but that's mostly because it's all theoretical and proof based. If you like physics, you should take this class. Also if you took 200, then you probably don't have much choice, so my recommendation is somewhat meaningless. If Prof. Shankar is teaching this class, it doesn't matter whether or not you like physics, just take the class. He is incredible.",
    "Prepare to work. A lot. Professor Shankar is often difficult to follow and the class can be very stressful. You will learn things, but it will be through your own work outside of class. Not on the introductory level. 180\/181 might be a better choice but then again Professor Grober is not as nice a guy, is boring, and often is unreasonable (no formulas allowed on the final), so pick your poisson -- harder material and nice prof, or easier material and a notso nice one.",
    "Take 201 if you've taken\/are taking multivariable.This class will really keep you engaged and you will actually learn the material. It is really important to challenge yourself in math and this is a great way to really build your brain.",
    "Way harder than 181 but in the end you don't learn that much more",
    "A difficult course and a huge time commitment. However, extremely informative.",
    "I would NEVER wish this class on anyone. It is terrible. The running joke amongst physics students in 261 this semester was that 201 was the hardest class out of the Intro physics series. The thing is, it wasn't conceptually difficult, it was difficult simply because Shankar made this class about the bitchiest math he could muster up.Only take this class if you have profound familiarity with the concepts beforehand, then it may be interesting to see the hardcore math behind it. If this is going to serve as your intro to these concepts DONT take it. Honestly, PLEASE take 261 instead. I seriously regret not having taken it instead. This class will crush your soul. If you do decide to inflict this upon yourself expect to spend 10+ hours on the problem sets a week, and to do dismally on the exams unless you are a math god. This class should just be renamed Intro to Applied Mathematics and Physics. DONT TAKE THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS. I luckily took diffyqs concurrently, but I can't even begin to understand how others managed through this class without it, because after you hit circuits everything basically is differential equations which Shankar tries to teach with weird tricks.",
    "Very hard course...the problem sets are murder, the tests can be difficult to even finish on time, but it's a pretty good class. Not for the easy-way-out premeds.",
    "Physics 201 is the logical continuation to Physics 200 and is just as described in the YCPS. The course rigorously covers at advanced depth (well beyond Advanced Placement Physics) the topics of electricity, magnetism, light and optics, and quantum mechanics. The class expectations were set very high and there was a problem set due every week (including the week of the midterm and Reading Week), a difficult midterm (average grade was a 62%), and an even more difficult final examination. Professor Shankar\u0092s expectations were often seen as too high as evidenced by his long problem sets (on average 10 multi-part problems of which 5 were usually impossible and the rest very challenging). Lectures often had some entertaining, mind-opening, and thought-provoking moments, however topics were covered disproportionately as Professor Shankar would rush through some topics while beating other topics to death. Overall, I would recommend this course to (1) anyone who took Physics 200 (this year with Professor Harris who was really a great teacher, but in a different way than Professor Shankar who is definitely a more gifted lecturer and teacher), (2) anyone interested in majoring in physics who has taken standard math courses (through multivariable calculus in the either the fall or spring), and (3) anyone looking to take a challenging science course or seeking to enrich their personal knowledge of the physical laws of nature. Ultimately, Physics 201 was very rewarding for me in that I learned many of the fundamental laws of nature and built upon those I had known before, however, the class did show me that I no longer want to major in physics, but the separation is absolutely without hard feelings or regrets. I still love physics, really enjoyed learning the physical laws taught in this class, and would wholeheartedly recommend the class to anyone who is up to the challenge of Physics 200\/201 at Yale.",
    "If you took 200 and survived without too much difficulty, then TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Shankar is the bomb. He is a funny and friendly man who brings a pleasant atmosphere to the classroom. The material gets hard towards the end of the semester, but if you go to each lecture then you will be fine. Unless you are a complete hotshot and want to take 261, I would wholeheartedly recommend 201.",
    "Challenging but worthwhile, solid class. You definitely learn a lot. Though the psets can be frustrating at times, you can definitely look back on the year and be satisfied.",
    "Hard. Very very very very VERY hard.Unforgiving. VERY unforgiving.Rewarding? Maybe, kind of...There were multiple people in the class who wrote on their finals (which everyone walked out of saying they failed) that they felt bad because they didn't meet our professor's expectations for us. Do you want that to be you?",
    "My verdict: mixed. Physics 201 gave a very comprehensive overview of E&M. The introduction to quantum was also very cool, as I had never worked with quantum before. The tests were well-written. However, Shankar's lectures were often confusing (although the book is a very good secondary instructor). In addition, the problem sets were needlessly difficult, and always took many hours to complete. If you're thinking about being a physics major, this is a good course to take, and I recommend it. If not, you might as well take 180 instead.",
    "This was a challenging class, so if you're up to the challenge, you'll definitely learn a lot. That said, if you're not really interested in physics or only have to take this for a major requirement, you may consider taking a lower level physics course.",
    "Do not take unless you must - audit, perhaps, if only to listen to Shankar be delightful for an hour and a half twice a week.",
    "Incredibly tough class; not sure if it was worth taking, although Shankar is a great lecturer. The homework will take up much of your Tuesday nights, but the TAs are a great help in study hall.",
    "If you REALLY want a challenge and have a deep desire to take the HARDEST CLASS OF YOUR YALE CAREER this semester. go for it. otherwise, take 181.",
    "If you are ready for a lot of hard work, then yes.",
    "The class is fairly difficult and the homework load is very high. Take it if you need it or if you're speedy at learning physics",
    "Really hard - Shankar takes it to a much deeper level than the 200 teacher does first semester. Be prepared to work really really really hard, and maybe still not do well on the final. The finals take much longer than the time allowed, and Shankar doesn't give students the 30minute grace period on the final exam. Lectures are really dry, but Shankar does crack some physics jokes towards the end.",
    "Absolutely take this class. It will be more work than 181 (and, at many times, 261 too), and you will be frustrated on occasion. All the same, the chance to sit in a room with Professor Shankar for 150 minutes a week should outweigh by tenfold any of the growing pains any aspiring physicist would encounter in this course.",
    "Its good hard. Shankar is a great lecturer and you can learn so much from him. It is much harder than the fall mechanics course though, especially since the back quarter of the course is all quantum. I would recommend this course to anyone who has taken AP since it can really change the way one views physics\u0092 role in relation to other sciences.",
    "A great course that has some very interesting material but is at the same time very difficult and mathematically demanding (multivariable calculus should be a prereq, as line integrals and surface integrals are dealt with on a regular basis. A knowledge of diff eqs would also help a lot). However, professor Shankar is one of the big reasons to take this class - he is an excellent lecturer with a great sense of humour.",
    "Take it if R. Shankar is teaching. I went in nervous about my abilities and sure that I hated physics, and I came out still nervous about my abilities but in love with physics. Shankar is a wonderful professor with a wonderful voice. The problem sets are hard and will require at least a few hours every week.It will be harder for you (but not impossible--I made it, didn't I?) if you aren't competent with things like multivariable calculus, complex numbers, simple differential equations.",
    "Take it if you are really interested in physics and consider majoring in it. it is significantly harder than 200 I would say. Problem sets truly take forever and they are not from a book. Tests are really impossible and make you feel like shit...",
    "This class was a struggle.I had opted to take this class instead of 181 because:1) I had heard good things about Prof. Shankar's teaching (yes, he's funny)2) the course is required for my major (or 181)3) I was willing to take a challenge and wanted to try a different teaching style from Prof. Grober - (Shankar is sympathetic that some people are taking a harder class than they need to for their reqs, but he moves quickly through a lot of new material, sets very challenging psets, and did I mention that people were often lost in class?)I did learn some things, and was exposed to some cool concepts (like Quantum Mech) that I wouldn't have been exposed to so much otherwise, BUT the class was a lot of work and I often felt like all the new material was just washing over my head without being able to absorb it well, which was frustrating and sometimes made me feel I was wasting my time. If you take this, ASK LOTS OF QUESTIONS in class until you get the explanations you need.",
    "Physics 201 goes quite fast, and is only for those truly dedicated to learning the hard material. Learning quantum at the end was a highlight of the class, but in exchange for learning quantum, we proceeded through E+M at lightening speed. I would recommend this class if you like physics and want a challenging course, especially if you have taken AP Physics and\/or multivar.",
    "Physics 201 with Professor Shankar was difficult. Much more so than phys 200 first semester. The course is not supposed to assume any previous physics knowledge, but I often saw that those of my classmates who had taken ap physics had a much easier time of it. To be honest, I really hated this class during the semester, but as I went back to review for finals, I found that I picked concepts up much better and more quickly than i had earlier. It certainly prepares one for higher level physics, but I still think someone who didn't take high school physics should try 181 instead.",
    "Take it if and ONLY if you are concurrently or have been enrolled in ENAS194 (diff EQ). Then it will make more sense. Also, take it ONLY if you actually have a background in E+M (ie AP Phys) but NOOO WAAY if this is your first ever physics class and you just want to learn it with math. Also, don't take it with 6 other classes. The problem sets are really hard (but you learn a lot and use\/synthesize a lot of math concepts esp ENAS150 so it is so worth it) so budget a lot of time for them and make sure you can go to sections (no conflicting sections or classes). Good class. I don't really know what the difference is between this and 261.",
    "Yes, it is a great course, although hard.",
    "Recommended if you would like to be challenged. Shankar was an amazing lecturer and made sure everyone knew the material well. Interesting subject but only for those interested.",
    "Be prepared to work. 180 is easier. 260 is easier. Find friends who know what's going on.",
    "Physics 201 is a difficult physics course but well worth the effort. We covered electricity and magnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics. The amount of material that we cover is enormous and the homeworks are difficult, however completing the course gives you a sense of great accomplishment. Take this course with Professor Shankar if you can, his lectures are easy to understand yet he covers the material in great detail.",
    "While the subject matter is\/ can be quite interesting, I would only take PHYS 201 (versus PHYS 181) if you need it for your major. It's quite difficult and frustrating and the problem sets are brutal.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE NEVER DONE E&M BEFORE. I had never done the material, or anything closely related to it, and I really struggled. If you are not already a champ at physics, I would recommend sucking it up and going down to 181.",
    "I might in general recommend the class to a student either interested in the physics major or if they need it for their major requirements, but if Shankar is teaching it then absolutely not. His teaching style is incomprehensible and he is completely clueless about how to teach the material in a way that students can actually learn from. Overall, I\u0092d recommend taking either Physics 181 or 261 over Physics 201 if you need or want to take a calculus based physics class.",
    "The course is very difficult and is not recommended unless you feel you have a very strong background in Physics and Mathematics, in which case you'd probably be better off with Physics 260\/261 anyways. A word of warning: do not feel overly confident if you did well in Physics 200. Physics 201 is very different and far more challenging.",
    "Physics 201 is a very challenging course. The problem sets are impossible to do on your own and the tests average very low. With that said, it is a great introduction to physics and the material was very interesting. If Shankar is teaching it, it will be very challenging and a bit disorganized, but overall a fairly good class. By far the most difficult class I have taken at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend it to a student with a relatively light course load in addition to it who genuinely cares about and is very interested in the two topics covered, not just physics in general. You have to be willing to commit a lot of time to sitting down and trying to sort through the material.",
    "Physics 201 is one of the hardest classes I've taken at Yale. It's fairly well taught, just really difficult material and fast paced! The problem sets take about 10 hours each. Definitely take advantage of the help sessions the TAs hold on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights. The midterm and final will be demoralizing.",
    "I would recommend 181 unless you are up for a huge challenge. Shankar's problem sets are incredibly hard and his exams are tough as well.",
    "This is an introduction to E\/M. We touched on just about every major topic, though none of it was treated particularly in-depth. I found the material much more interesting than the contents of Phys 200, for what it's worth. I recommend this if you are looking to finish up an intro physics sequence and want a bit of a challenge. Otherwise, you can get the same stuff in 180 for less work. Also, I don't know how this course will be taught in the future, but if it is anything like my experience, I recommend having some familiarity with E\/M. I went in with nothing and often had to do extra reading in the textbook to keep up (especially with circuits).",
    "Unless you are a physics superstar who decided they didn\u0092t want to take 260, or desire a challenging, consuming, and frequently frustrating academic experience, I would not recommend taking Physics 201 with Shankar. Don\u0092t even think about taking it if you haven\u0092t done AP Physics C, and even if you get through a non-Shankar section of Physics 200 successfully, I would recommend dropping down to 181. Since the physics department makes switching between 201 and 181 painless, I would recommend starting in 201 to assess the difficulty, and if it is anything like I describe below, you should make the switch. I cannot emphasize how painful this course was for me and others not in the above categories. Shankar is a brilliant professor, and it is impressive to him give structured, uninterrupted lectures without notes. However, he seemed a bit out of touch with the pulse of the class. His teaching ability was inadequate, as he skipped steps in solving problems, assumed clarity of knowledge when none exists, and generally covered the material at a level above the average student of the class. Problem sets were ridiculously long and difficult, consuming the early part of one\u0092s week and invariably sapping one\u0092s time on Tuesday night as they struggled through the morass of complicated problems. They were so difficult they failed to fulfill the real function of homework problems \u0096 reinforcing the material \u0096 because no one could do them nor understand fully what they were doing. Both tests were too long and difficult for the time slot allotted \u0096 three people finished the midterm early, and one thefinal early \u0096 and thus didn\u0092t seem like proper assessment of our knowledge. In all, it was a miserable experience. It would have been less of an issue, and less of a critique, had the class gotten more manageable, as Shankar promised, but it didn\u0092t. I failed to enjoy the class or derive any substantial level of intellectual satisfaction from it, and as a result, unless you are one of the above three people, you should not seriously consider taking the class if Shankar is teaching.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone who has previously taken calculus-based physics in High School. Make sure you have a solid grasp of multivariable calculus before taking this course. The lectures are clear and often humorous as well.",
    "Physics 201 is very difficult.If in the off-chance you have the class with professor Shankar, you must drop everything and take it. Shankar can take all that sweat toil and tears that normally accompanies difficult calculus and make it into a good for the universe.",
    "My one and only criticism was that it was very mathematically challenging. That said, I am not a physics major and I came in with a weaker mathematical background compared to some of my classmates.Given that, I honestly feel as if the challenge of the class, while probably destructive of my GPA, was one of the singular best learning experiences I have had at Yale. My understanding of the concepts of Physics feels incredibly strong (I say this based on how straightforward the Physics topics were for the MCAT) and I know that I have become much more confident in my mathematical abilities.Be prepared to put in a lot of time into this class. The problem sets are very very long. Take advantage of any outside help you can get. It's much more worth it than to try and figure everything out yourself. Really.Also, Shankar is a baller.In sum: challenging and sometimes emotionally taxing but an absolutely fantastic learning experience. If I could go back in time, I would still choose this class over the other Physics classes"
