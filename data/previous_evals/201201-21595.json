   "comments": [
    "Relaxed class. Do it only if you want to work in the New Haven community. Lockhart is a wonderful professor. Take it only if you have the time to put in outside of class.",
    "If you are at all interested in clinical psychology, this is the class for you. The class has a placement in the community which is great \u0097 if you can, though, be sure to avoid placements at CMHC. It is boring and you won't learn as much as if you worked at Children's Home or Riverview.",
    "Absolutely yes. If you have to take a class at Yale College, this is the course to take.",
    "Good course for getting clinical practice. If you really want practice working one-on-one, I would suggest getting placed at anywhere but CMHC and New Haven Hospital, even those ARE the most convenient. It seems that students at those placements a drive away had way more contact with symptomatic clients.",
    "Don't take it unless you're 100% stoked about all things clinical psych. It's kind of a silly class.",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend taking Clinical Psychology in the Community! If you can fit an early morning class into your schedule for two semesters (it's a year-long class), I would take it. Professor Lockhart brought us bagels, tea, and pastries at every class and it was a very nice, relaxed seminar setting. The fieldwork placements were very rewarding and I loved the way it gave us the opportunity to put theory to practice--not something you can always find at Yale. The grading distribution isn't entirely clear, you will write weekly journals and semi-weekly 'thought questions'\/reading responses, the amount of reading is manageable, you'll give a few pretty informal presentations, and there's a final paper at the end of each semester. I'm not sure what the weight of each is on the final grade, but I enjoyed the year very much and would recommend it especially to all of you junior and senior psychology majors (most, but not all, of us were).",
    "The first semester of this class was much better. Second semester was just student presentation after student presentation after student presentation. The placement was cool, but it was always unclear what the reading assignments for class were, meaning no one did them, which resulted in rarely having any interesting class discussion. I'm really glad I did my placement, but the 2 hours of seminar every Wednesday morning was time I could have better spent sleeping.",
    "Definitely worth taking..obviously you have to take 355",
    "I liked the first semester better. I did not like the new format of student presentations. I felt like most of the information was lost, particularly since we were not supposed to take note",
    "Take it if you want to learn about therapy. May become repetitive if not into topic since the course lasts a year. Overall a great and relaxed course. Easy to learn a lot about mental health.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in the actual application of therapy. The setting of this class is closer to that of social work than clinician or shrink etc. but I think it gives a fair representation of what working with this type of population involves (though beware that each placement differs quite a bit, and you are stuck with what you get).",
    "This course provides exposure to the clinical setting and is particularly beneficial for students interested in working with the mentally ill population. You get to do a field placement at a mental health center working with either children or adults. I would highly recommend it for those interested in clinical psychology. It's a great way to gain experience as an undergrad."
