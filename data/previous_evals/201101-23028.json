    "I would recommend HIST 347J for any student with a desire to learn about one of the most important political entities of the second Millennium AD. It is perhaps a little too scattered, given that it covers such a huge span of both time and geography. The workload is extremely manageable, the readings are generally engaging, and seminar is usually highly productive.",
    "I would recommend it if you are okay with 1) a lot of early-modern history and 2) a very fast-paced survey of the Ottoman Empire. The Empire was around for so long that a course that covers its entire history is going to move extremely quickly, with a lot of reading, and not necessarily highlight what a polisci major, for example, might be looking for from the Ottomans.",
    "highly recommended!",
    "This course provides a great overview of the Ottoman Empire. Prof. Mikhail covers the entire empire but assigns readings that hone in on its specific aspects (such as royal women, notables, and decline). This method gives students the entire Ottoman picture as well as detailed knowledge on different elements of it. The course involves quite a bit of reading to accomplish this goal. Go to Professor Mikhail's office hours. He is always willing to talk about the course material or just chat. I recommend it!",
    "The class is interesting and informative, but for a topic so exciting the readings tended to be on the duller side. Osman's Dream, the main text for the course, was quite dull and tedious to read. Professor Mikhail is caring and wonderful, but I felt like he was just gone for the last month of classes what with his absences and the guest lectures. It took the energy out of the course.",
    "This class is about the history of the Ottoman Empire, from its origins through its end in 1923, when modern Turkey came into existence. The Ottoman Empire had a huge influence on European politics, and the empire controlled avast territory for a long period of time, so the history of the Balkans, the Middle East, and North Africa have all been impacted by the Ottoman presence. If students have any interest in any of those areas, this class is a great choice. Also, this course offers interesting insights into how the empire evolved, challenging many traditional explanations, and showing that Ottoman history is not all that simple. I definitely recommend this class.",
    "This was a very interesting junior seminar if you're into history (and not just Ottoman history). Readings were normal quantity for a history course and were generally very good. Professor is excellent in that he effectively conveys main points of topics and facilitates discussion. Only 2 assignments in the course (15 pages total) and it's a WR. The 5-pager is a creative writing piece. Mikhail is especially approachable and a young, cognizant guy. I looked forward to this class each week.",
    "Yeah, definitely. Mikhail is really cool and the Ottoman Empire just isn't covered enough in our history department."
