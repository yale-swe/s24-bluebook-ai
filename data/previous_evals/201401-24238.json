    "Esty is a pro.",
    "This course has lots to offer from politics, policy to international negotiations on climate change andenergy. This was one of the best courses i have taken at Yale",

    "Best course I've taken at Yale. Esty is a treasure.",
    "excellent course, hope other students with similar interests will benefit from it",
    "Some of the texts we read, such as Coal, didn't play strongly into discussion, but I still felt obligated to read them.Very well organized class, including the field trip, which ran like butter, and had some very interesting stops. Prof. Esty was a pleasure to learn from, and, unlike many professors who say they value group discussion, actually let the class do most of the talking."

   "comments": [
    "How engaging our discussions were; Dan's \"lecture\" style; breadth and depth of topics covered",
    "I didn't have an extensive background in energy policy, so this class was a mega energy download for me. Esty has a wealth of experience and knowledge that he brings to the table and he stimulated some lively discussion. He was also excited to put ideas from the course into practice. This course manifested both an earth day teach out and a meeting with the president (for some students) about steps Yale can take towards energy efficiency\/reducing emissions.",
    "The lectures.",
    "Daily class discussions were enriching",
    "Esty is a great speaker. Good class discussions.",
    "Professor was an incredible communicator and created a really interesting dialogue with the class on a daily basis. The law school needs more more environmental\/energy classes like this .",
    "The best aspect of the course was the discussion of trade-offs in environmental problems as a central theme. We kept coming back to this problem of trade-offs and this enabled us to analyze such a complex problem like climate change more clearly and allowed us to frame the problem differently.",
    "I loved the discussions facilitated by the class. It was a large class, but the size actually was an advantage because we were able to incorporate many different opinions into our discussions. I felt challenged by this course to think creatively and I think I got a lot out of it.",
    "All",
    "Being in a stimulating environment of students from three different graduate schools plus Yale College. Hearing firsthand accounts from Prof. Esty about his time at the Copenhagen COP and his experience working in state government."

   "comments": [
    "Sometimes we got lost in the weeds or stuck on a topic, such that the course fell behind the syllabus. I like that Esty stimulated good discussion, but I think he could have reigned us and himself in more, at times. We spent a few too many days repeating the debate between cap and trade and the carbon tax. We also spent too much time on geoengineering - that could easily have been limited to half a class.",
    "More technical details.",
    "The course set up was perfect",
    "Dive deeper on specific subjects. Esty's main value is that he has participated in backroom discussions on these subjects. Share as much of that information with the class as possible. Cover less subjects.",
    "A bit more focus on the law and legal issues.",
    "I think there should be a stronger emphasis on the solutions and also more discussion of legal tools and legislations applicable to the topic of climate change. I think there can also be more discussion of the comparative institutional analysis.",
    "The class had a difficult time moving away from policy and politics discussions into alternate ways of addressing climate problems (private sector for example), but it was still very informative and didn't repeat itself too much.",
    "Excellent so far."

I also wanted to be able to partake in discussions that include students from many different graduate schools, which indeed produced many great discussions throughout the semester.",

This was partly why Prof. Esty had the idea of putting on the \"Teach Out for Climate Change\" Earth Day event, which was a perfect compliment to the course."
