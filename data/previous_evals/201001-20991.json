    "I would recommend it as a great way to become introduced to work by a range of historical scholars, from sociologists and psychologists, to cultural and political historians.",
    "I would recommend the course--it's very informative, especially for someone for whom the material is new. It's a good survey of the view of the supernatural over the course of the early modern period.",
    "Very nice.Yes, you can learn many interesting background of that time.",
    "HI 560 explores early modern European conceptions of the supernatural and apparent supernatural happenings during this period. It raises some very important questions regarding the historical study of early modern religion and society. Students in the history and religious studies departments, in addition to Divinity students, would find this class interesting and helpful. Highly recommended.",
    "The course provided an overview of conceptions of the supernatural in the early modern world. I would recommend it, particularly if you are interested in the impact of religion and the Reformation on mentalities and social trends. It did, however, concentrate primarily on the religious and less on folk and informal \"magic.\"",
    "Yes. Well, if they were interesting in the topic. If so, then, yes."

    "It focused on a single topic and through that lens fleshed out the early modern world view at different periods and from different perspectives. Very helpful.",
    "I wanted to know some knowledge of that time, so I like it very much.",
    "It providedme with a better sense of the Reformation's impact on early modern belief and understandings of the supernatural.",
    "I study popular belief in the early modern world, so I felt this course helped me tremendously and allowed me to think of new approaches to my own topic.",
    "Please see the above response.",
    "For me, this was a very helpful class because for my master's thesis I might look into comparable ideologies and beliefs in Eastern Europe and then compare. It gave me a new narrative of early modern European history, also."
