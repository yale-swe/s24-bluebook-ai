    "TAKE THIS COURSE!! You should take the lab as well for maximum understanding\/enjoyment. You'll learn about huge parts of your daily life (plants) in a whole new light. I felt like I learned a lot from this class.",
    "A really great class. The subject matter was very interesting, but know that the tests do require a lot of time spent studying. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone, regardless of your major, but be prepared to work.",
    "Donoghue is a legend. Very rare that you have one of the most prominent researchers in a field, and that he\/she is giving a survey course on that field, and that he\/she is actually a damn good lecturer but thats Donoghue. Hard to complain about that class, BUT definitely only take it if youre interested in plants and evolution. Otherwise it could be very dry. Other downside is that there is a TON of memorization for the exams which can be frustrating when you have studied a lot, but still get stumped on questions about brutally specific details of some random plant fossil. I didnt take it with lab and I did feel like I missed out somewhat; a lot of the other students seemed more engaged with the material than I was and I think the lab played a role in that. The crowd in class is very much your stereotypical bearded flannel-wearing Nalgene-drinking EEB majors so be ready for that. I also didnt go on any of the field trips which I regret. More than anything take it because Donoghue is a brilliant lecturer, but dont expect an easy A by any means. Its not too much work though; 3 exams, a short paper and I dont think there are readings or if there are I didnt do them. Id give it an A-; probably would be an A if I were deeply in love with plants. but i guess that just speaks to the niche appeal of the class. One of the better lectures Ive taken no doubt.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Forget that trees class you may have been looking at. This course is amazing and will cure you of your plant blindness, give you an appreciation for the history of phylogenetics and botany, and, most importantly, give you a chance to interact with the coolest botanist\/paleobotanist\/phylogeneticist\/evolutionary thinker in school, Prof. Donoghue. Tests are hard but so worth it. Also, I didn't take the lab but would have if I had had the time.",
    "this class is an overview of plant evolution and specific groups and species. although there seems to be little work (a short paper and three exams), the material is rather intensively detailed. more guidance for exams, like an official study session, would have been helpful. the textbook is very dense and i didn't use it, but those taking the lab class may have found it useful to base sketches off. professor donoghue is a vibrant and easygoing lecturer and was very communicative and willing to help.",
    "You're going to be learning about the evolution and diversity of plants which sounds dry at first. However, Professor Donoghue is really fun and makes the lectures engaging. I would imagine the class would be harder if you didn't have some bio background but I'm sure it is still manageable. Fun class, not too much work.",
    "Don't take it if you're a humanities person who likes gardening and just kind of needs a science credit. It's hard and not that interesting if you're not into science. So much memorizing facts! Such boring lectures! You will not do well if you're not good at that type of learning.",
    "YOU WILL LEARN SO MUCH ABOUT PLANTS AND BE ABLE TO TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT PLANTS (like \"heyyyy did you know that raspberries aren't actually berries but eggplants are?\") AND THEY WILL BE BLOWN AWAY BY THE COOLNESS OF PLANTS AND YOU'LL BE THE SWAGGEST CAT ON THE BLOCK.",
    "Fantastic course in every way. Take it!",
    "This is a fun class! Not a lot of work, lectures are fairly interesting. Midterms and final are a bit of work to study for, and I personally found them quite difficult, but it's a rewarding class that I would definitely recommend taking.",
    "Plants are hard to trust because you can't make eye contact with them. But after this class, you'll have a whole new appreciation of their amazing world! Be aware that this course is very phylogeny-heavy (compared to some other E&EB courses like Arthropods), but there are a few lectures on more general plant biology that tie things together.",
    "A really, truly wonderful course. Whether or not plants are your thing, consider this course. Professor Donoghue is one of the greatest lecturers you'll encounter at Yale, aside from being one of the kindest and most caring professors. He's clearly invested in his students and he's passionate about plants and about teaching. There's probably not much more I can add to the other reviews. Just take this class and find out for yourself how cool plants can be! A bit of basic biology is probably necessary to keep up, and be prepared to do some rote memorization at times. But in general this class requires little work aside from showing up to lecture and being engaged. One last bit of advice: Take this course concurrently with the lab at all possible! It really enriches the experience, and helps a lot come exams. You'll have fun!",
    "Only take this class if you can also take the lab, and if you're really into plants - it's not really a \"just for fun\" course. You need to put significant time into learning the plant groups and the phylogenies. If not, the tests are a mess. If you love plants, though, this is definitely a good class, and Donoghue is great. Not much work except for two midterms, final, and a short paper, where you get to research a plant group.",
    "As a non-STEM major, I found this to be a tricky class. I thought it was going to be focused on general concepts (speciation, photosynthesis, etc.) but it was very specific and detail-oriented... you were expected to know very specific features of individual plants. That being said, this class has no homework, 2 midterms, a final, and a final paper, all of which are manageable. It's a good fifth class, if you're willing to work hard to do a lot of rote memorization about the plants. If you're looking for something more conceptual, this probably isn't the class for you. If you're not a STEM kind of person, this is a great class-- challenging but approachable, and definitely not a gut.",
    "I would recommend it - plants are cool! I took it as an E&EB major and found it interesting and standard as far as difficulty goes, but I know friends who took it for their science credit and found it much harder. The tests are a lot of straight up memorization, but that comes with the territory of an organismal diversity class. Professor Donoghue is great, he loves plants and it clearly shows through in his teaching. Definitely definitely take the lab if you can - it's just drawing plants for a few hours a week, and it makes what you learn in lecture much more real and interesting.",
    "This class is a total delight if you are excited about plants. Most of the class is spent going through the phylogeny of land plants, learning the characteristics of many groups and how they relate to each other. Day to day there is minimal work, but before tests there's a lot of memorization to do. If you can space it out or if you're a good crammer, this won't be a problem. I'm so so happy I took this class because it has enhanced my love for plants. Also I took it as a non-science major. There's very little scary science stuff, just a lot of memorization.",
    "This class is a broad survey of the entire plant phylogeny. You will literally learn about every plant. It is really neat learning about all the relationships between plants, and learning about a bunch of different characteristics of them as well. It is really fun looking at plants!! This class is not super easy, but not overwhelmingly hard either. There isn't homework, but there are several exams and a term paper. The exams get pretty specific so require a good amount of studying.",
    "Plant Diversity and Evolution is a great class! Professor Donoghue is one of the nicest and most knowledgable professors that you will ever meet. However to gain the most out of the class, I highly recommend taking it with the lab.",
    "Plants, you learn about them and then you eat them.",
    "If you're already interested in botany, this is a great class that will keep you engaged and satisfy and bolster your curiosity. If you don't care all that much about plants, this class could either get you really excited or bore you. Either way, you'll learn a ton, and it's worth it just for that. This a great class for biology majors and nature-minded non-science majors.",
    "An excellent course with tons of interesting info and a great professor and TAs. Definitely recommended if you have any interest at all in plants--you'll come away with a much better understanding of plant groups, phylogenetics, and important features, and pick up a few thousand interesting facts as you go. Professor Donoghue clearly loves the stuff and wants you to love it too, so he's always enthusiastic, as well as just generally being a good lecturer. Take the lab if you can, as it really helps to put the class info in context. Low workload. There's reading, but it's more for support and background info--no real homework, just one 3-page paper at the end of the semester (where the topic is basically \"pick an interesting plant group and write about it\")--two midterms and a \"final\" that's really a third midterm. It takes a lot of memorization, but the understanding you get from it is worth it.",
    "This was a pretty straightforward course. Donoghue is a great lecturer and has very interesting insights about all the plant groups we learn about. While the class itself is interesting, studying for the exams can be a bit boring, especially since there are a lot of phylogenetic trees involved. I did not take the accompanying lab, but I did not feel like it was necessary to do well in the class. However, it might make the material more interesting.",
    "This course was one of the best I've taken at Yale. Plants are so fascinating and strange and wonderful, and Prof. Donoghue was incredibly enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I loved every moment of this course.",
    "Please take at least organismal biology class while at Yale. This is an excellent starting point - Prof Donoghue is one of the best lecturers and kindest people you'll be lucky enough to take a class from. No prior EEB or botany experience required! And be sure to take lab with the lecture if at all possible. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Great class but beware of the tests",
    "Absolutely take it. If you need a science credit, it's a great course to fulfill it, one that will open your eyes to the massive amount of biodiversity around you and which will also function as a great introduction to evolutionary biology through the medium of discussing plants. If you're E&EB, this is a great way to satisfy the organismal diversity requirement, as well as just a great elective to take. Prof. Donoghue is superb; he's not as bombastic as other lecturers, but he has an excellent command of the material, a great lecture style, and is a fount of stories. He also seemingly has a response to every question and always seems willing to talk about the material. The workload is light (two midterms, a final, and a short paper) and not tremendously challenging, although you will find yourself memorizing stuff at times. But it's absolutely worth it. One of those courses that will change your perspective and actually make you look at your surroundings in a different way.",
    "Plant Diversity and Evolution is a class that attempts to reduce the common condition of 'plant blindness' by introducing students to the enormous diversity of plants. It takes a phylogentic approach in that it considers plant diversity over evolutionary time and marches up the tree from the first mosses all the way up to the angiosperms (ending with Professor Donoghue's favorite group of plants, the Viburnums). Throughout this phylogenetic perspective, the lifestyles, structures, and characteristics of different plant groups are discussed and compared with each other. I found the course enjoyable both because I was interested in the material and Professor Donoghue is a fantastic person and professor. However, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND taking the lab at the same time as the lecture. I did not do so and found it very difficult to memorize dozens of characteristics of different plant groups without being able to physically experience these characteristics which the lab would have allowed me to do. So in all I would strongly recommend this course given that it is taken with the lab (you also get to eat exotic plant-themed foods in the lab and draw plants and hang out with Professor Donoghue for a couple of hours each week so why would you not take it?).",
    "TAKE THE LAB!! This class is outstanding - by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and this is coming from a senior G&G\/E&EB major. Donoghue is so approachable and so darn excited to share with you everything he knows about plants (and it's almost mind boggling how much that is). Besides the fact that this course is taught by some of the nicest people in the university, EEB 246 does an amazing job of covering the history and diversity of plants and is perfect for everyone who just wants to ID plants to those with scientific interest and everyone in between. The class is totally accessible even if you have no bio background. If you have the time, my highest recommendation is that you take the lab. Once a week you get to play around in the greenhouse drawing\/tasting\/exploring plants and helps you get to know the plants and professor and TAs (ours, Miranda and Andy, were awesome) a lot better. Extra perks include day trips, my favorite being a day at the Bronx Botanical Garden. Long story short, take it take it take it."
