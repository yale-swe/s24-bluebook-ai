    "If you are ready to work, if you have an adviser who believes in you, and if you take your writing seriously and are passionate about it, DO THIS, and do it to the best of your ability. This class was the hallmark of my senior year, and I am so proud of the body of work I was able to produce over the course of the semester. I put this class at the top of my priority list each week, and it definitely paid off--I hope to utilize the work ethic and skill set I have developed this year in the future as I pursue my writing goals!"
