    "English 127 is a really great class; you get to explore important texts in American literature, and it's even better when you have a class that is insightful and eager to intelligently discuss the texts. Make sure to stay on top of the reading, and go to office hours regularly to discuss any ideas you have for the papers with your professor.",
    "This was a good class, and a good way to fulfill a WR requirement. I took it hoping to read more short stories\/novels during the semester, and I was introduced to authors I had never heard of but now want to read more of. Definitely a great class - not just for English majors. There are only three papers in the entire class - most of the grade is participation!",
    "I would recommend Engl 127 for anyone who enjoys reading and wants to read some American literature in a fairly low-pressure writing environment.",
    "It's a good American lit class. If you're interested in English or lit, then I would recommend.",
    "Moby-Dick takes a while to read, but it is definitely worth it. When choosing between sections, look at the different syllabi to see when each section is assigning Moby-Dick and make sure you don't have a lot of conflicting assignments.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "A thorough examination of the defining elements of American Literature, this course is necessarily what you make of it. From Emerson to Ellison, the material is simply too vast for any kind of systematic analysis. So, although you'll find that it offers quite a bit of tiny gold nuggets to aid your understanding as the semester goes on, most of the burden falls on you as a student to dig in deep where you want. Accordingly, I would most definitely recommend it to anyone who genuinely enjoys reading dense novels such as \/Invisible Man\/, as the workload requires quite a bit of literary stamina. Also, try to take this course with Gutkin. He is quite literally the man."
