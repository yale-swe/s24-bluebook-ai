   "comments": [
    "Multinational negotiation skill. General overview of international climate regime.",
    "I gained a deep understanding of international climate change law, especially the negotiating process. The weekly readings helped us understand the main issues of climate change negotiation, as well as the history of the UNFCCC and the many agreements under the convention. Moreover, I gained first hand experience with the complications of international law negotiations, outside just climate change. With our mock negotiations, it became just how complicated it is to reach agreement and further the goals of the climate regime. By learning from Sue directly and from her colleagues who visited class on occasion, I have a better understanding of how such laws are made and how we can find optimism despite many challenges.",
    "- Knowledge on the climate change regime - Concise, bullet-pointed writing - Public speaking",
    "I learned how to become literate in the legalese of international climate policy. I learned to be able to predict what positions various countries were likely to take in these negotiations and I got a picture of what it meant to be negotiating these policies at the time of their creation. I can now read the Paris Agreement, or the Kyoto Protocol, and understand the key parts and the key stakeholders in the negotiation of these agreements.",
    "This course is an incredible deep-dive to the world of international agreements and climate change. Learning from Susan was an enormous privilege. After taking this course, I have a much better idea of how agreements are negotiated and how different national and international interests play into the negotiations.",
    "How climate change agreements are negotiated, the key themes and debates surrounding agreements such as the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, Paris Agreement. Also learned how to craft policy memos, make legal arguments, and how to negotiate.",
    "I gained a general understanding of how international negotiations really go down, and earned skills in that negotiating process. More specifically, reviewing the history and processes of climate agreements contextualized these negotiations and gave insight to current directions climate legislation might take.",
    "I learned a lot about the developement of the climate agreement, how preceptions changed through the years and more importantly how to presuade others to support you.",
    "We learned how negotiations are conducted in general, but also the specific history to climate agreements that only people who were \"in the room\" like Prof. Biniaz could have shared. It was quite interesting to learn about the different tactics used by the countries to pursue their specific climate related goals.",
    "I learned, in detail, the full history of the climate regime, which is the series of international agreements on climate change from the UNFCCC in 1992 through Paris in 2015. Sue (the professor) had a direct role in negotiating each of these agreements and might know more about them than literally anyone else in the world, so I also learned lots about the behind-the-scenes negotiating strategies she and other countries used to get to a deal even when it seemed the many sides could never agree. I improved my skills in writing what Sue refers to as 'user-friendly' papers: short, concise memos that other people will actually read. This class is what other classes at Yale should be, and I learned so much more here than I do in other courses where I work ten times as hard. GLBL 570 teaches you how to work constructively with others to achieve societally-important outcomes, it teaches you how to write in a style you will actually use in the real world (unlike the vast majority of Yale classes, which teach you to write endlessly long literary essays nobody in real life would ever read), and it teaches you some really interesting climate agreement history along the way. This class is really well-done.",
    "I gained a thorough knowledge and understanding of how global climate agreements have developed over the past three decades. Sue brought a deep experience and expertise to the material and was able to share about every facet of the negotiating process for climate agreements have been made.",
    "I learnt how to read an international agreement, how past agreements have come about, and how to compare between different agreements. International agreements are impossible to understand without the framework that this course provided in the very first two classes. At the same time, they are not always well understood by the media and hence the public, so I came in with a very poor understanding of what it means for an international agreement to be legally binding or not, for example, and the pros and cons of different options. Learning from Sue, who was the lead climate lawyer for US State Dept through all the past agreements, also means learning a lot about what actually happened during negotiations, and some of the innovative solutions used to resolve objections.",
    "I learned how to read and analyze international legal instruments. I learned how negotiating techniques and how to use language to reach compromises in negotiations."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The biggest strength of all: Professor Sue Biniaz. She is brilliant, accomplished, and empathetic. She is a wonderful professor who makes sure that every student feels heard and valued. Other strengths: The course is structured not to be overly academic, but instead to help students understand the complicated reality of climate change law. Rather than long essays, we wrote shorter, digestible memos that have helped prepare us for the world beyond Yale. The workload is also very reasonable (perhaps even a tad too light), which ensures that students actually do the readings and remain engaged. Weakness: the workload may be too light. I learned mostly through the written assignments and the seminars, but I could have used a bit more long-term learning throughout the semester. I would propose perhaps a slightly more in-depth term paper that still remains succinct (e.g. perhaps 6-8 pages). The climate and x presentation could be turned into a 6-8 page paper and then the one minute in-class presentation. That would allow students to explore a topic at even further depth.",
    "Strengths: The professor's knowledge Interesting homework assignments Fun simulations Weaknesses: Lack of grade feedback",
    "Strengths: Sue. She's awesome. More on this later. Weaknesses: I didn't always feel engaged by the course, outside of it. During class I was super into it, but there were times when I forgot I was enrolled in a fifth class because of how rarely I engaged with the coursework.",
    "My favorite parts of this course were Professor Biniaz and the mock negotiations. Professor Biniaz has the most incredible personal experience and really knows everything and anything about international climate change. The mock negotiations were a very fun, not stressful experience. Generally, the course was not stressful and the workload was relatively light, but the payoff was high.",
    "Strengths: Lots of practical negotiation and policy-drafting skills taught; great run through of key issues in climate change agreements; Sue is a fantastic instructor and class was always interesting. Weaknesses: Could be a bit clearer about what the instructor expects from the weekly written assignments from the very beginning.",
    "Strengths: Professor Biniaz, the structure, the class length, the class size, the workload Weaknesses: I never knew what the status of my grade was, so more substantial feedback might've helped",
    "The strenghts is learning from the best practitioner in the field who can explain in depth the negotitation process. I also liked having several writing assignment instead of one long paper. I actually can't think of any significant weakness.",
    "The strengths of this course were definitely Prof. Biniaz's experience in the negotiation field, as well as our TA Zander's experience. They were able to share stories with us from their own personal experience working in the field, all of which were enlightening or entertaining. Another strength was the students in the class, which was important for our mock negotiations. Prof. Biniaz did a great job in selecting students passionate about sustainability, and it created a welcoming environment where all were eager to learn. The only improvement would be to possibly make expectations of the course work more clear at the beginning of the course. I received constructive feedback on all of my assignments, but sometimes I was unable to tell whether I was improving at my writing of memo's etc...",
    "Sue is by far the major strength of the course. In addition to being unbelievably knowledgeable and experienced, she's super smart, and I feel like she approaches the class with the same focused and goal-oriented mindset she uses to approach climate change negotiations (except the goal is teaching us things instead of saving the world from climate change). She gives detailed, constructive feedback on the assignments, keeps discussion focused on material that is relevant and interesting, and only assigns relevant readings, so they are short enough that people actually read them. I would only point out that having a grading scheme (20% participation, 60% writing, 20% negotiations) is kind of pointless when the class has no grades at all. For undergrads in particular, it could be helpful to have some grade feedback halfway through the semester that would give some meaning to these weights. But that's a very minor point. Overall, I think other Yale professors have a lot they could learn from the way this class is taught and its focused emphasis on building skills crucial to any field. In a few words, this course is all the good about the liberal arts at Yale, minus all the bullshit.",
    "Sue's experience is one of the greatest strengths. During class, she gives extremely clear lectures and answers questions very thoroughly. However, I would want more analysis of the material instead of just delivery. Not just how agreements are made, but how could they be improved. Also, while Sue gave thorough feedback on the assignments and was very generous with her time, at no point during the semester did I receive any graded work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it will be a great course for those who want to take an introductory course for climate change and for those who want to pursue career in the diplomatic field.",
    "Yes! This is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale, and the workload is among the lowest. You should take this class if you have any interest in law, negotiation, climate change, or improving practical writing skills. It is a highly rewarding course, where you learn a lot about the most pressing global issue climate change. Sue is a wonderful professor who cares deeply about her students and that enthusiasm inspires her students to become enthusiastic as well.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone looking to take a fun class and grow their knowledge about climate change.",
    "Take the course for Sue! Highly recommended.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. In this day and age, knowledge about the negotiation process of international climate agreements and the way the agreement functions is invaluableour future as a species depends on it! Sue also makes the subject fun and interesting with her wisecracks and anecdotes about the negotiation process, rather than depressing.",
    "If you are at all interested in international agreements or climate change, definitely take this course. It is a hidden gem.",
    "Absolutely, the final was a negotiation in class where people represented different countries, most fun final I've ever had while being pretty low-stress. Sue is an excellent seminar leader and has a wealth of experience and advice to give. All this while actually learning a great deal about the key climate change agreements from the UNFCCC to Paris, to future issues.",
    "Yes! The topic is niche but if you are interested you will be very satisfied",
    "Yes, I think it's a great class both for those who want to learn about climate policy but also soft skills of negotiation and diplomacy.",
    "For any student interested in working in sustainability in the future, it would be a great course to take. I think that we learned valuable technical skills of memo writing and negotiation tactics, but also learned the global perspective on negotiation through Prof. Biniaz's stories. It is a perfect class for those willing to put in the time and effort to prepare themselves for working in sustainability.",
    "Absolutely. Even if the course has nothing to do with what you are studying, climate change is relevant to your life regardless. So is knowing how to work with people across cultural and economic divides, and how to write concisely for people who need to hear from you and don't have much time. Sue has written lengthy books on climate change, and she's also written one-page memos about it for the President of the United States. Yale is great at teaching you to write the former and terrible about the latter; as a citizen going out into the world when you graduate, you have a responsibility to excel at both. The workload is also very reasonable, and none of it is a waste of time. The work is spread out throughout the semester, and Sue takes the time to send meaningful feedback on every assignment. My one piece of advice if you take the class would be to really do the readings when you are assigned to write about them: they aren't long, and in this field, detail matters, so you want to get it right (and Sue will see right through if you don't).",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Sue is a fantastic resource and the material is very interesting.",
    "Yes!!! This course offers such a unique perspective on international agreements in the context of climate change, and I recommend it especially to anyone interested in climate change at the international level. I also found the emphasis on being concise rather than writing long papers for our writing assignments refreshing.",
    "Yes, I learned how to think of international cooperation in a new way and learned valuable skills to achieve optimum outcomes of such collaboration."
