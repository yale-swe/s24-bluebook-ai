   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed first semester H&P more than second semester simply because of the books. The historiography of the fall is replaced almost entirely by political philosophy, particularly social contract theory, in the spring. that's not necessarily a problem, but I felt like the readings tended to drag more second semester than they did first.",
    "Directed Studies Historical and Political thought was an excellent introduction to a selection of works in the western canon post Machiavelli. The selection of works was thoughtful and ensured a feeling of flow and communication between the thinkers. The class was seminar-based with weekly lectures and so this class is perfect for someone who thrives in seminar settings.",
    "This course is a good introduction to great writers in Historical and Political Thought, and for those who are interested in the reading list, it is a great experience. These ideas are still very relevant today, and by discussing them in section and writing about them we gained a good understanding of different ideas and how they relate to each other through history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.",
    "An excellent outlook on Modernity and the ideas that inform politics today. It provided a comprehensive background of almost every political concept. It was so so rewarding.",
    "I would STRONGLY recommend this course to another student. I was always so excited to attend class and do the readings. The readings were pretty heavy and, when sections were selected to read, it could be difficult to truly understand the logical chain or narrative of the work. The expectations for discussion in class were rigorous and it is exciting to tackle the works with such a critical lens."
