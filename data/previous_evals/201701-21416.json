   "comments": [
    "This course is great-a real Hallmark of the Yale English department. The course goes through the entire Old and New Testaments, barely skipping any texts. The pace is feasible with manageable readings for each class. Brisman's discussions never fail to engage and instill knowledge. The assignments are also thought provoking and interesting to write.",
    "This class offered a great (secular) look at one of the foundational texts of western culture from a literary perspective. Absolutely loved it."

   "question_id": "YC409",
   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! The skills are so broadly applicable.",
    "This course represents the quintessential opportunity offered by Yale. Professor Brisman has been teaching this content for longer than you have been alive, yet somehow manages to view every idea through a refreshingly new lens. Take this class, and engage with it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. For anybody interested in multivocality, the Bible, or problems associated with revision and literary individuality, this course is an extremely helpful study in how to read well and what there is to gain (intellectually and emotionally) from the act of reading. There is a good deal of writing, and you get a lot of extremely careful feedback, both on your style and structure and on your ideas themselve. Class is well-organized, but never overly constricted, and Prof. Brisman is fantastic.",
    "I would recommend this course to any English major. Also, the pre-1800 assignments appear more daunting than they are, and this course is a great way to fulfill the requirement.",
    "Whether you grew up with the bible as a regular part of your life or are coming in with relatively fresh eyes, this course is invaluable. It provides an incredibly interesting and deeply important look at a literary canon that is foundational to the society in which we live."
