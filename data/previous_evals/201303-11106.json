   "comments": [
    "The course is a dive into the realm of Comedy as a means of cultural expression through the works of various comedians. It was a challenging task to analyze comedy's impact on our culture, and you gain exposure as to how and why jokes are funny, not just that they are funny.",
    "If you want to learn about race relations in America without becoming too depressed and\/or angry, take this course. You get to college credit to learn about Dave Chappelle!",
    "Yes. Unconventional approach to trying to understand race in America.",
    "A great class! I recommend that everyone take it, even if it's not for their major. It really helps you understand and unpack tropes that you are surrounded with in society. Laguna is also a fantastic professor, and you should absolutely try to take at least one class with him before you graduate. TAKE THIS CLASS! The workload is manageable, and because the material is often so exciting and engrossing, it won't feel like work at all! Brilliant class.",
    "Assignments are a nice mixture of comedic artifacts (humor writing, standup, sitcoms) and theory\/analysis (relating to both comedy\/comedic forms, and race). Weekly blog post, midterm paper and presentation, lead short discussion in one class, final paper. I would absolutely recommend it! It's a fun class but isn't [just]for laughs: I learned a lot about cultural studies theories, critical race theory, and the ways \"lowbrow\" culture is super significant.",
    "Professor is great, workload is up and down (there are presentations mixed in throughout the semester), but the content is amazing! Take it!",
    "Best class I've ever taken at Yale. Absolutely take it.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. I think it will be even better when it is offered again.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any student.",
    "Great Class! So much fun material and discussion! There is a reading response each week, but it is easy to talk about the hilarious material. The workload isn't bad, you have one presentation (group of 2 or 3), a paper and presentation on the internet\/comedy, a sitcom presentation with a big group, and a final paper."
