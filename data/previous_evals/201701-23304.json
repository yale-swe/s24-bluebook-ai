    "Although I personally had developed this skill in high school, this course is a great way to learn how to view history from an analytical perspective, instead of the traditional \"one fact after another\" Professor Weiss always refers to. This course will have you question the validity of certain resources and ideas.",
    "I learned about the field of environmental history! I found out how important it is to analyze societal and environmental history together, and gained many important insights when we applied this concepts to a number of historical events.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations. I learned about global environmental history and the impact of multiple factors on societies. It gave me a different way of thinking about history and made me more interested in environmental impacts.",
    "You cover a broad range of topics in this class, but overall you learn how to understand climate data and you learn about its applications to relevant archaeological and historical questions. You really look at theories that focus on exogenous forces - like drought and temperature change - in shaping the course of human history.",
    "Really, I don't think I could list all of the insight sI gained in taking this course. The most valuable part of this course was learning how anthropologists and archaeologists approach rigorous scientific study. A brilliant course",
    "Learned about the origins of human society, gained a better understandinf of how climate fluctuations occur naturally and influence social changes, learned how to frame questions when discussing climate, understood measuring standards of environmental shifts"

   "comments": [
    "This course is fascinating and very relevant. The well-organized syllabus is helpful in following along. The term assignment was fun and informative. All in all, a very enjoyable course.",
    "Professor Weiss is a terrific lecturer. I enjoyed attending his 9am class every Tuesday and Thursday morning in Krune Hall. He made the topics interesting and had great build up on important events in history.",
    "The lectures could be a little more organized and structured with a clear statement of what the class will be discussing that morning. The class could also emphasize discussions more.",
    "There really aren't any ways to improve this course. It is clear that this is the way Prof. Weiss wants the class taught and it is the best way for the class to run. This course is a brilliant, succinct and profound introduction to environmental history. The course was much more intellectually challenging than I expected, but the challenge was welcome and useful. The final report was poorly defined and I'm not sure what Prof. Weiss wanted in the report.",
    "Strengths: lectures are very interesting as is content Weaknesses: a lot of material is said by the professor and not actually notated anywhere so you really have to pay attention, no review sessions for exams"

    "This course is essentially Professor Weiss's research- if you can get to a point where you understand that drought basically caused everything in History, you'll be good.",
    "I would not recommend this course to other students. The course name should be \"The Origins of Civilization\" and then discuss how climatic events effects civilizations. It is not about a climactic history at all, but rather about the professors own theories, which are not agreed upon by many of his peers. The lectures are extremely confusing and tedious, Harvey is passionate but his fluctuations in his voice and tone are distracting and worrisome sometimes. The name of the course is not accurate of the content and the lectures are difficult to follow. This course is not worth taking unless you want an easy fifth class to never attend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Weiss' lecturing is expansive and takes some getting used to, but it grows on you. The material you learn in this course is very relevant to other fields and today's events.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all students interested in environmental history. Even if you are not an EVST major, the information is relevant and interesting. Work load is not unreasonable either.",
    "A highly engaging and interesting course with a great professor. The course allows you to acquire a new understanding of history given highly resolved climate data.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to another student. The material is interesting. Professor Weiss' lectures can wander at times, but the overarching argument is clear. The workload is very manageable and he basically gives you the answers to the midterm and final at the review sessions. If you have an interest in the history of human responses to climate change, take the course.",
    "This is a great SO credit for a STEM major. There really aren't any ways to improve this course. It is clear that this is the way Prof. Weiss wants the class taught and it is the best way for the class to run. This course is a brilliant, succinct and profound introduction to environmental history. The course was much more intellectually challenging than I expected, but the challenge was welcome and useful. If you are interested in the environment and how humans have impacted and been impacted by it in the past and present, this is the course for you.",
    "This class is interesting, but perhaps the name is a little misleading. It's definitely focused more on the origins of agriculture and it's evolution than on actual environmental history. It kind of seems like Professor Weiss just took his syllabus from his seminar on agriculture and taught it as a lecture. As soon as you accept this, the course is actually quite interesting, just perhaps not what you were looking for. Professor Weiss is super chill and there's basically no work, so it's a pretty easy class if that's all you're looking for",
    "Yes. It is very important to learn about the environment and our role in it. Less workload and truly amazing material to learn. You actually learn a ton, and you won't even realize it."
