    "Take it! The class is really enjoyable and it's not a lot of work at all.",
    "GMAN 110 is a great class if you are looking for a new language to fulfill the language requirement. I could have taken L4 French, but I am happy that I decided to start a new language instead. The workload is not bad and for the most part the tests are quite easy. You end up learning a lot of German in the semester, and overall it is quite an enjoyable experience. If Julia still is teaching it, take it with her; she's great!",
    "Well rounded intro German class. If I were to go to Germany right now, I could order in a restaurant and feel very confident understanding spoken German.",
    "German 110 is an intense introduction to German vocabulary and grammar. There is an emphasis on speaking, reading, writing, and comprehension, although reading and writing take precedence. It's a lot of work, as you might expect from a 5-day class, but certainly manageable. Plus, the German department as a whole is pretty fantastic: they have tons of weekly events and opportunities for even the most beginning of students to get involved. Basically, if you're interested in German, take this class. You will learn a ton in a very nurturing environment.",
    "This course is a lot of work and very fast-paced, but you learn a LOT of German in a short period of time, and section is a lot of fun. My German section was the highlight of my day!"
