   "comments": [
    "Easy class and you learn alot.",
    "Great class, take it with Allie because you will learn and it'll be fun! You have to a couple of singing assignment where you'll stand up in front of the class and sing, but since you'll be singing in a group it's not that intimidating at all. Definitely take it if you're looking to learn more about music.",
    "I had a fair amount musical background coming in, so this class was not too difficult, but a really good way to solidify my foundations. I feel like I understand music much better than I did before. Allie is a good section leader and very nice, so I would take her section if possible.",
    "Solid course. Expect a healthy amount of work.",
    "Great class. A lot of people take it while having musical experience, but it's still possible to do relatively well without any.",
    "Yes, but there is a lot of tedious work involved. Background in music theory or music performance would be very helpful.",
    "Definitely take this class if you have never learned anything about music before. It will not crush you with work or bore you. Even if you have been playing an instrument for years you should still take this class especially if you have forgotten or never taken music theory.",
    "If you want to learn a thing about music, then take it.",
    "yes. there is a lot of homework but as long as you read the (short) chapter it'll be easyy. learned so much in this class. a lot of people take it who already have music experience, which is kind of annoying, but as long as you pay attention you'll be okay. essentially the class is all about you and how fast you can learn it, so dont be afraid to ask questions. cuz if those others already know it they wont really care about the pace, its on them for taking the class in the first place. Alexandra Kieffer is really nice, and is really willing to help you out. she can be ditzy sometimes but it's cute :)"
