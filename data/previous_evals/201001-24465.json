   "comments": [
    "This class allows you to explore aspects of poetry that are often left out of both writing courses and traditional English classes. It was a really great way for me to explore the less analytical and less concrete aspects of my love for poetry.",
    "Take this class. Not very much work at all, but such cool work that will make you see poetry in a new way and learn about yourself at the same time. Such a cool class that you will look forward to every day that you have it. Professor Roach is awesome.",
    "Although the class provides some grounding in techniques for reading and performing poetry (through table work in a seminar room), the heart of the course is the medley of several interrelated poems that every \"scop and rhapsode\" rehearses and performs during the course of the semester. I would highly recommend this course to any one who is prepared to engage with poetry as a thinker, a performer and a listener.Professor Roach is pleasure to learn from--a brilliant, generous mind who brings enthusiasm and expertise to the discussions and critiques; he also encourages a relaxed class environment. One of my favorite classes in four years at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It has been my favorite so far and was not that much work, but was so much fun. The people in it are very interesting, you learn a lot about performing and poetry in general, and the whole atmosphere is always one of support and acceptance. I didn't know anything about poetry when I first started and that never slowed me down. I learned a lot and made some really good friends. Take it, even if you don't know much about it!",
    "Take this class! Roach is a great professor, and the class is just a lot of fun.",
    "Really delve into poetry and discuss the meaning, interpretation, and performance. Step out of your comfort zone and try performing it yourself. Get to know Professor Roach and (hopefully) Christopher Grobe as well (if he co-teaches it again!) Its really awesome. Take it if you are interested in poetry, even if you are not an English or Theater Studies major. Your classmates may be intimidating, but its worth it.",
    "If you love English, if you love poetry, if you love the way sounds work and the manner in which words collide, take this class.",
    "if you love the sound of a voice, if you love poetry or performance, this course is truly about meeting amazing Yalies and sharing twice a week something unique",
    "Poetics of Performance is an amazing class for anyone interested in either poetry-as-text or poetry-as-performance. As a spoken word performer I was challenged to branch out of my genre and infuse classical texts with the same vigor I would in my own work. This class has not only incited a new found appreciation for all poetry, but it has also strenghthened my own craft as a performer.Also, a great class to take if you have trouble with public speaking and want to overcome it. The class had such an ecclectic and diverse group of students ranging from actors to English majors with no performance experience to members of Yale's Spoken WOrd groups.",
    "Yes, take this class if you have any opportunity to do so. It is amazing and you will not regret your decision.",
    "The class is beautiful, and you will encounter amazing people and poems. The class is more or less made up of text work\/discussion, poetry slams, two short writing exercises, and two longer papers. The class manages to brilliantly teeter on the edge of academic mumbo jumbo but instead delve deep into real, honest humanity - very rewarding. The poetry performances are really cool, and each individual performance is given by a thorough discussion. Each student performs about four poems throughout the semester and then blends them into a final medley. The poems, performances, and discussions are include wonderful surprises and priceless gems such as this Joseph Roach quotation: \"Strength and vulnerability: if you can put the two together in the right combination, it will outsell Coca-Cola every time.\" Absolutely essential. For God's sake - nay, for your sake - take this class."
