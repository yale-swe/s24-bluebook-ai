   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is an interesting and diverse course",
    "Systems bio is a very laid back class where you take away as much as you put into it. It's generally self motivated (you don't necessarily need to review the material unless you find it interesting). I would definitely recommend the class to a peer.",
    "A general overview of different organ systems throughout the body. I would recommend this class to others who are entering a physiology\/ organismal biology type of field.",
    "Yes.",
    "Lectures twice a week with a 1-page homework assignment for answering a question based on lectures. I would recommend this class, just make sure to know what the professors are looking for, since it's easy for them to give Pass grades on a whim",
    "CBIO 604 is a class in which you learn how biology works at a macro level in humans. I would recommend this class to another student if they (like me) had not had experience in this kind of biology and were interested. I probably would not if they were already familiar with the subject.",
    "I would say it's a good class for a graduate student to get basic literacy in human biology.",
    "This course gives an over-view of all organ systems, detailing relevant histology of the tissues included within the organ system and the major cell types involved. Additional commentary is provided regarding on-going research in the field, often at the molecular level. I would highly recommend this course to other students in the biomedical sciences and engineering (especially engineering, as few students seem to have sufficient background in cell biology) because it gives a very nice over-view of relevant organ systems' anatomy and physiology, often putting one's own research into prospective.",
    "Yes; it is a great overall of different organ systems on a cellular level and important for understanding many lectures across diverse biological topics.",
    "I will recommend it because in the course we can learn a lot about cell biology in a tissue, organ or system level, which we cannot learn from the common cell biology."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "It helped me to understand some areas outside of my field",
    "The most useful lecture for my thesis work was given on neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Also, the exposure to histology in general was very useful.",
    "It provided me with knowledge needed for understanding how different tissue and organs work differently. It's beneficial to have a bigger picture about how a whole organism work.",
    "Not super relevant. One lecture was, the rest were not.",
    "OK not too much.",
    "Learned how events at the cellular\/molecular level can manifest in diseases and disorders at higher scales.",
    "In a sense, I took the class to increase my general knowledge about biology. My dissertation research will probably be focused on single cells, not tissues, but I still gained a lot from the class even though it will probably not be applicable to me directly.",
    "This course reviewed relevant organ systems that I am currently working. It is important for my work in tissue engineering to have a good conceptual understanding of organ anatomy and physiology. This course has helped provide a nice introductory primer for the being work of my thesis on cardiovascular tissue regeneration and engineering.",
    "This course gave me a great foundation of knowledge to read articles and attend lectures about a wide array of topics."
