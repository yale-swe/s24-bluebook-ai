    "This is not a journalism course. It's more of a history class that incorporates politics in it. You get so much from the class by just reading the assigned readings. If you're interested in the media and politics, this is a great class for you.",
    "Classics of Political Journalism is a great class with a great teacher. Expect to learn a lot about political journalism and the American campaign process along the way too."
