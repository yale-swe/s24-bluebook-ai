    "Yes. Probably don't expect your faith to change, but learn how to speak and write about it better.",
    "Take this course. At first, Professor Wiman may seem really intense. Don't get scared. He is very serious about poetry, but he is also a really lovely human being. You will learn so much about poetry from this class, but you will also learn so much about yourself. This class is as much about soul searching as it is about poetry analysis. I have come out of this class with a greater love of poetry and a better understanding of my relationship to the texts I read. What is great about Professor Wiman is he actually wants you to recognize that reading is a subjective experience. Being able to analyze a poem is only the baseline. Professor Wiman demands that you go beyond dry analysis. He demands you to absorb poems and filter them through yourself. I feel like the only way to summarize this class is through the following Walt Whitman excerpt: Have you reckoned a thousand acres much? Have you reckoned the earth much? Have you practiced so long to learn to read? Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems? Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems, You shall possess the good of the earth and sun . . . . there are millions of suns left, You shall no longer take things at second or third hand . . . . nor look through the eyes of the dead . . . . nor feed on the spectres in books, You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me, You shall listen to all sides and filter them from yourself.",
    "If you are at all interested in poetry and at least somewhat in faith, take this course. Professor Wiman is a caring and thought-provoking human being - one of the best professors I have had at Yale. Be prepared for serious soul-searching - the workload isn't large in terms of number of hours, but if you actually want to get something out of the class, you need to let the poems and the conversations access the deepest parts of yourselves. This can be tough!",
    "If you want to learn how to read and appreciate poetry, take this class. You'll never have a better teacher to do it with. If you already know and love poetry, I think this class will be even better for you.",
    "Excellent course. You'll read a number of poems very deeply, and discuss them in the context of faith. You'll memorize things worth remembering. No matter what you believe (almost all of the students in the class came from a different faith-- or non-faith-- background) you'll take a deep look at a number of things both inside yourself and outside of yourself. Please do the work; it's worth it. (Notably, this class tied eerily closely into my academic studies in American history and English, my extracurricular studies on Jonathan Edwards, and my personal spiritual devotions as a Christian. How many classes suffuse your life like that?)",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student who wishes to ask the hard questions about poetry and faith.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Christian Wiman is brilliant and a fantastic professor. His command of poetry is unparalleled and the course packet he assembled is one of the best anthologies of poetry I have ever read. His assignments are also refreshingly non-academic and I enjoyed doing all of them.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. I might even think it should be required of all first semester MDiv students so that they can realize how much joy there is in getting past some of the gaming they do in other classes on the way to their professional degree, and change a little of that culture here."
