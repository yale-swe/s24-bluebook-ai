I think that it would be really helpful for students to bring in various case studies for the class to discuss and consider. Many of the examples of leadership mentioned in the class are outdated and having students bring some fresh material to discussion would be very helpful.",
    "Chad devoted a class to hearing our feedback on what could be done to improve the course, which was good on his part. Mostly integrating the readings into the class discussion, and spending less class time preparing for the trips, and more time talking about leadership.",

    "Anyone, be it someone who worked prior to the FES or fresh from the undergraduate, is suggested to take this course. This helps in understanding actual field-level implementation. Taking this course will teach you on how to work in a team and more importantly, what are things to be done when you are in the leadership position. Authority and leadership are different. Mere possession of the authority will not make you a good leader."
