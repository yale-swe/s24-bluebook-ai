    "English 126 is one of the most important courses at Yale. Take it.",
    "English 126 is the prereq for the major, so most people will take it because they have to. Come into it with an open mind though, because it's not THAT bad. Professor Richards is an incredible professor that really cares about her students. However, if you don't like group work, you may really not like her style of teaching. You can expect a good 40-50% of the class to be spent in group work, which is good or bad depending on who is in your section. Our section was a great range of students, so the group work wasn't so bad, but be warned. Richards' strength is ensuring that every student finds a way to succeed. She's not super big on the traditional English major final, so that stress is gone. She also has a range of paper themes and topics, including creative writing and allowing for social and historical discussion, making the class feel a lot richer than the average section of this class. I would recommend taking this class, but be careful to pick the section that you're going to enjoy best. Pre-reqs are there to help you explore a major, not hate it!",
    "There are so many better English classes to take if you're not majoring, but if you are and you have to take it, take it with Professor Richards!",
    "If you're going to do the major, you have to take it, but since you have to take it, I think Richards' section is the section to take. Compared to 125, the texts are generally much more engaging, and this section's inclusion of everything from Langston Hughes to A Room of One's Own made it particularly enjoyable. Richards is definitely aware of the questionable nature of the mandatory syllabus, and does a great job encouraging people to investigate more closely some of the works rather than just venerate them. If you've yet to take an English course, this is also a good introduction -- she spends a fair amount of time reviewing in class techniques for forming arguments in papers, which can be sort of redundant if you've taken similar classes at Yale before but useful if this is your first. Overall, I would say that this section was enjoyable and rigorous."
