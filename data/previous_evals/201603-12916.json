    "Like any strong philosophy course, this course has helped me develop a more critical outlook on both the substance and the methodology of work on the topic in question. I saw the consequences of addressing questions concerning personal identity that I once thought were similare.g. the question of what (kind of thing) we are and the question of the conditions under which a person persistsseparately or in tandem. I also got a sense of the bearing that work on other topics in metaphysics has on the topic of personal identity.",
    "It is a very technical course on philosophical discussions about personal identity.",
    "This was a high-level, difficult course. As a sophomore Philosophy major, it pushed me far out of my comfort zone and challenged me to think about pretty esoteric frameworks of the self. Skills include grappling with dense, complex readings and writing coherent essays about them.",
    "A very detailed and rigorous class on contemporary philosophy of identity. Very good preparation for graduate level work in philosophy, but also a solid class in metaphysics for anyone exploring the major."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The primary strength of this course was the variety of viewpoints represented in the material. We read texts by philosophers who not only disagreed on the substance of particular issues, but on the methodology that one ought to take to approach the issues. Unlike many courses in the department, the readings drew from both the analytic and the continental traditions. The primary weakness of the course was the fluctuating quality of discussion from week to week. Professor Winkler prepared detailed handouts for each meeting, but I did not always feel that my classmates and I were up to the task. I wish the expectations for preparation before class were higher. There were just too many times that Professor Winkler would ask the class a question and be met with blank stares. The syllabus advertised that we would have a series of short response papers every few weeks, but we only completed one such paper. I do not know if assignment more such papers would prompt people to complete the reading more carefully; I worry that response papers encourage people to only focus on one reading or even one aspect of the reading at the expense of devoting attention to other readings. Decreasing the amount of reading for each week, which Professor Winkler started to do partway through the semester, might help matters.",
    "This was an excellent course. The readings were engaging, and Professor Winkler effectively guided seminar discussions--his handouts in particular were very helpful in structuring discussion. I did not find the volume of reading overwhelming and was actually disappointed to see some of the readings cut.",
    "Strengths: Good engagement with Professor Winkler, the readings holistically explored the topic. Weaknesses: a bit too much reading each week, which prevented in-depth understandings of each reading (since philosophy demands rigorous thought for even two pages of reading).",
    "Strengths: good syllabus, well-run discussions, and lively debate. Weaknesses: way too much reading to be covered in a single seminar.",
    "I think this class was great. How good the class was really depended on how well people managed to contribute, but Professor Winkler always seemed prepared with many good thought questions on the readings. Most days people had interesting thoughts on the subjects, and we had conversations that made me feel I was learning about the material (even if the learning constituted feeling like I had less of a grasp on who I\/anyone is)."

    "Personal Identity provides a wonderful opportunity to explore a series of important questions: what are we? Under what conditions do we persist? What bearing do such questions have upon issues in ethics? The sheer variety of viewpoints represented in the readings is this course's primary strength. We read extremely technical work from the contemporary analytic tradition, but also work from the continental tradition that took a broader view on the central questions. Professor Winkler prepares an extensive handout for each meeting, and if you do half the prep work that he does for the course, class discussion is riveting. Be warned, though: as in many philosophy classes, sometimes discussion is as much about issues of method as it is about issues of substance, which can be frustrating for those who want to dive head-first into these fascinating questions.",
    "Personally I think this course would fit philosophy majors much better than a non-philosophy major. It contains a lot of technical jargans. The topics could be fun if you are willing to put effort into completing the readings.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in the pretty esoteric realm of personal identity and the self.",
    "This class was challenging but worth the effort. There was a lot of reading (around a hundred pages per week) and the reading could be hard sometimes, and you would be expected to read them thoroughly in order to contribute to the classroom discussions, which could be intense and very interesting! Professor Winkler was very good at directing discussions and keeping it at a good pace. The only way in which I wished the course could have been different is that the schools of thought covered in this class are rather limited -- I understand that the topic of \"personal identity\" in analytic philosophy is a narrowly focused one, but I still think that the class would be much more interesting, and interesting to a wider audience, if it were to incorporate issues that people are generally concerned with about \"personal identity\" in our everyday usage of this term.",
    "I would recommend this both for the wicked smart authors on the syllabus and for professor Winkler's wonderful teaching style.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Winkler was excellent at explaining concepts and facilitating discussion, and almost all of the readings were interesting.",
    "Winkler is an exceptional teacher and this class is very interesting, but it is not for everyone. The class pursues a very narrow range of inquiry, almost to the point of disinterest. The entire class is structured around pursuing a single topic so far down that it becomes tedious at times. A fair amount of background in philosophy definitely helps, though you can get by with paying close attention in class and going to office hours. The class requires a lot of reading, and it is very difficult to follow discussion in class without having done the reading since the nature of the material is so specific. Other than the reading, there is little work to do in the class. The final paper is quite long, though frequent consultation with Winkler out of class can be very helpful.",
    "If you love philosophy, you'll love this class. A really great course about identity related issues within metaphysics. I took this course with relatively little background in metaphysics (though a pretty thorough background in other areas of phil) and it was a bit of a challenge to understand everything at play. The topic is extremely complex and has way more to it than I thought it would, and presents challenging concepts that require deep thought to fully understand. How good the class is does depend on whether the people in your class have interesting\/insightful contributions, but overall I found this course great."
