   "comments": [
    "Overall, I loved this class because it was engaging, had a well-chosen reading syllabus, and didn't claim to be a complete overview of its content material. I welcome that Directed Studies continues to be an ever-evolving program that refuses to leave behind the classics but also increasingly places these works in their historical context and modern context. Professor Nakhimovsky an excellent instructor that has a deep commitment to historical inquiry. He pushes his class to recognize the forces behind the works we studied and to really analyze our understanding of a work. Definitely recommend this section of DS.",
    "It is a great survey of some of the major works in political thought since Luther. Even if it is not comprehensive, it covers a good range and I highly recommend it.",
    "An excellent course -- definitely worth taking if you want to have a basic understanding of modern historical thought.",
    "Would recommend; group exercises aren't always that productive"
