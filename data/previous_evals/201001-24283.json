    "YES. take it. the opportunity to observe at Calvin Hill is worth it alone, and Carla and Nancy are absolutely wonderful. You'll get a great picture of early childhood education and your ideas of what \"literacy\" means will radically change. The workload is light and enjoyable and you'll probably find yourself wanting to stay more than strictly necessary.",
    "Yes I would.",
    "Would recommend it!",
    "TAKE IT",
    "Decent class, and different. I discovered that I was not particularly interested in \/ suited for early childhood education, so take my response with a few grains of salt. From my point of view, the observations were the most valuable component of the course. The seminars were not particularly structured, and the readings were variable in length and frequently dull (to someone who is not really passionate about this). There was very little discussion in the seminars, and student observations were rarely asked for \/ integrated. Most functioned as small, informal lectures led by one of the professors or a visitor. Also, it was a pain to get all the way up the hill twice \/ week, especially early in the morning.Only take if very interested in early childhood development \/ good with kids, and ready to make it to the top of science hill two mornings\/week in winter weather.",
    "Definitely take this, especially if you like children! The observations, site visits, and in-class discussions are fun and informative."
