    "Portuguese is a great language. I would totally recommend this class!",
    "Yup!",
    "Great language class that teaches just as much as any other language class without the stress",
    "Take this class if you want to learn portuguese!!",
    "Portuguese L1 is a very good class, and Thiago is a great instructor. I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Portuguese is very similar to spanish, even with the counterintuitive pronunciation, and fewer people take it. It's a fun alternative, especially if you'd like to go to Brazil!",
    "SO MUCH FUN! Doesn't feel like too much work, and you learn a lot. It's a good balance of speaking, reading, listening& writing. The professors are so kind. Not to mention... class activities include listening to Brazilian music and playing Pictionary in Portuguese. Seriously.",
    "Take take take this class!! I don't know about the other teachers, but if you get Thiago, you're definitely going to have a great time. Most of the learning is done in class, so there's very little homework. You learn a lot of Portuguese, and if you put in the effort, you will do well.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, FROM THIAGO!",
    "Definitely! Portuguese is becoming more and more important, and it is taught well here. If you already speak Spanish, grammar makes sense but pronunciation and differences in vocabulary can still be tricky.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, you learn a lot.",
    "Most everyone already knows Spanish, this should be a prerequisite."
