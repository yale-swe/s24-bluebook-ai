   "comments": [
    "MUST take, and I don't say courses are \"must-take\" lightly. Even if you have no current interest in child care, if you ever plan to be a parent, a person who works with parents or children, an employer, a policy worker, or a public servant you NEED to know about these issues that affect SO many people. The seminar was the most inclusive and encouraging one I have ever been in, and I actually cared about the assignments. Jessica and Janna are fantastic, and so supportive.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! So many important things to think about whether this is something you want to do as a career or just if you want to be a parent or uncle\/aunt some day (or just care about the next generation of americans). I learned so much about investing in the future of children and how important their first years are! Truly a splendid way to spend a Thursday afternoon.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. It will change your view on childcare and women's role in society and it will really cause you think more than you ever have before about issues that affect all of us or will affect all of us at some point in life.",
    "Yes! This has been one of my favorite classes. Going to this class was actually a breath of fresh air every week. If you like children, take it.",
    "If you have the chance, take this class. Janna and Jessica are two of the most caring people I've ever met, which may have something to do with their passion for childcare. Their passion for children clearly comes through in their teaching style with is hugely discussion based. Do the reading, it's always interesting and not excessive. I could go on and on about why this class was great, but you need to take it for yourself to find out why this is one of the reasons that College Seminars are an important part of Yale.",
    "This is a survey course on the issues pervading the early childhood community in the US. From parents and teachers to donors and government officials, there are many overlapping and divergent interests involved in the current child education debate. The class deals with issues around quality education which incorporates the role of the parent, the teacher and the community while issues of quantity and access remain in the hands of government officials and donors. Child education is no clearcut issue in America. We learn of its significance in the immediate and distant future of the US. The course allows us to grapple with these issues and try to formulate concrete solutions to them. The final paper is a proposal that resolves a concern raised in the class. Take it. It's one of my favorite courses yet and I'm a senior. Trust me.",
    "Definitely recommend! Consistently interesting and not too much work. Janna and Jessica make class a joy each week.",
    "If you get in, take it. Don't think twice. You probably can't learn about childcare like this in any other course at Yale. Janna and Jessica are INCREDIBLE - so kind, so inviting, so knowledgeable, so enthusiastic about childcare and its consequences for our society. They're also big deals - look up All Our Kin. The assigned reading is always interesting and never too much, and the final 15-page paper is a ton of fun to write - don't worry about taking this as a fifth class. Discussions were almost always fun and informative, although I wish Janna and Jessica would share their opinions a bit more often. (Plus, they bring snacks every class!)",
    "I would recommend it! Easy class and you learn a lot.",
    "Excellent course. The instructors of the course are the biggest strength of the course. Janna and Jessica are extremely knowledgeable about childcare issues and were able to bring guest speakers who are involved in childcare policy in Connecticut. Another great component of the course was the observation at childcare centers in New Haven! If you can get in, definitely take the course.",
    "an incredible class with incredibly knowledgable professors",
    "This is a fabulous class for anyone interested in childcare, early education and public policy. Janna and Jessica are wonderful and engaging, truly interested in student voice. Everyone who took the class was engaged and happy to contribute to the conversation.",
    "Amazing profs amazing discussions and amazing readings. Must-take if you are interested in child care in the US at all and if can get in.",
    "LOVE this class. Seriously, I'm obsessed. Reasonable workload, great group of students, interesting guest speakers who are important in the field. And Janna& Jessica are really wonderful (and they bring snacks!). They bring 2 really important perspectives--an education\/pedagogy approach and a legal\/policy approach--which gives the class a good balance.",
    "This course is a great way to learn from professionals with experience beyond the ivory tower, and the issues you learn about apply to anyone. Janna and Jessica really care about their students and about the future of childcare. I'm glad I got the chance to take this."
