   "comments": [
    "This class seemed disorganized and vague. The professor has obviously read extensively, but his way of engaging the text is too esoteric. Leadership is a practical experience, not an apriori exercise. The course could be improved by reading more from practitioners. The readings by Lincoln, de Gaulle, and Churchill were the best, but they came in the last three weeks. If you want to learn about statesmen, their visions, and their achievements, don't take this class. You'll spend your time reading about theoretical ideas of statesmanship and leadership, but without any real value until the last three weeks.",
    "A class I expected to get more out of, but pretty good all the same. Readings were quite interesting, though a lot of them focused on a particular period of British political thought, which seemed somewhat idiosyncratic. Discussions were better than average, rarely stunning. Smith is a good guy."
