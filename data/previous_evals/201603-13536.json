   "comments": [
    "Directed Studies: Literature was a very unique course, in which we read many literary works beginning with Homer all the way up to the legendary Dante. We learned how to create close reading essays based upon small portions of literary text and analyze the most important thematic concepts the Western Canon has to offer.",
    "How to take some of the most minute, obscure sections of text and use them to make an interesting essay. Also provides invaluable insights into some of the most seminal works of Western Literature, you'll finally learn why the works of people like Homer have lasted as long as they did. You also develop an eye for which parts of the text are important and which parts can be treated by skimming.",
    "This course is an incredible introduction to western literature up through Dante. In this course, especially with Professor Bender, students learn how to improve their writing of literature papers through practicing close readings. Directed Studies Literature teaches students how to read closely, analyze, and connect the works; all while helping them grow as writers.",
    "Critical thinking through inter-textual connections -- a really great learning experience for someone nervous about writing in college.",
    "I improved my writing, critical reading, and discussion skills in ybis class.",
    "This course definitely helped my writing. I worked on organization in my essays, and making complex thesis statements and arguments with supporting evidence. Professor Bender made the classical texts more accessible and relevant, which helped keep me engaged in the course.",
    "Analytical response of literary works; how to maintain a conversation about works in general, and also about specific aspects of the work or passages of the work; how to compare translations of a work; how to compare one work to other another in terms of style, themes, and lineages.",
    "DS literature is a great course for bringing reading and writing skills up to the college level, as well as gaining a solid grasp on some of the great texts in the western tradition.",
    "This class helped me read into texts and trace the conversations they were having with other texts and authors. In particular, the Lit section really helped me develop my writing.",
    "I think my essay writing improved. The specific areas of focus for each essay were very helpful. I think I learned how to better structure my essay and how to formulate a good thesis. I also think I learned how to read and understand material more quickly. Over the course of the class, I think I also got better at participating and felt more comfortable sharing my thoughts.",
    "While taking this course, I most memorably gained the ability to produce independent thought and willingly participate with my peers in the discussion of significant works of literature. The professor was extremely helpful in providing advice, feedback, and making himself accessible during office hours.",
    "Despite the hefty reading load, this class focused on drawing out meaning from small, specific portions of the text. It was a great training course in close-reading. We analyzed symbols and motifs which emerged throughout the story, and we sought understanding how the different texts we read play off of each other. The essays we had to write weren't extremely different from a typical AP Lit course considering what we were supposed to write about (comparing works, analyzing repetitive imagery, close-reading certain passages), but they were definitely expected to be composed at a much higher caliber. Across all of my DS courses, the grading of this class was the harshest, which also allowed me to improve the most. My writing style, structure, voice, paragraphing, evidence everything is criticized in my essays, but I was very grateful for this because I found this hefty commentary extremely helpful. In seminar as well, the professor would take time to discuss how to write a better paper with us and print us out writing advice which was really helpful. Along with our weekly forum posts about our readings, I felt like I grew very much in my ability to analyze literature fruitfully. I especially felt much more comfortable and confident in my ability to write an essay my first 5-page essay took me about 20 hours and my last took me about 6, and I received a full letter grade higher on the latter. So, along with a working knowledge of foundational literature and poetry, my ability to write analytical essays greatly improved.",
    "I learned to connect themes, build a strong thesis, and support my claims with evidence from the texts."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this course is very strong. Overall, the syllabus of texts we read is very broad, ranging from Homer, the Bible, Greek tragedies, and the Commedia. It definitely is a very solid syllabus and has a well-thought out paper structure.",
    "Weakness: Lots of texts in one semester, i.e. you spend two days of the week dealing with a text that some people grapple with for their whole lives. Strength: Lots of texts in one semester, i.e. you get a very broad range of texts that delineate some of the threads of Western Literature. Despite the short amount of time spent on each one, the discussions in class always go through the most important themes. Improvements: Spent two days of the week on the Gospel of Matthew, could assign another reading from the New Testament. Also please can we assign the same book for the Hebrew Bible as the New Testament cause that is a $$$ sink if I've ever seen one.",
    "The strength of this course is that it provides students with a broad overview pre-modern western literature. Because of the large amount of reading that is included, the course often moves at a very quick pace. At times, it can feel rushed and some books are only given one day of in-class discussion. While this is not ideal, DS Literature allows students to explore literature and classics, and then decide if it is something that they would like to pursue further.",
    "The online forum responses turned out to be one of my favorite parts of the course, even if at first it seemed like a very 'high school' thing to have to do. I really enjoyed the lessons where we looked at the original language of the text; more of that, in tandem with extra in-class close readings, would be really interesting.",
    "I wish we had slightly more time to focus on each work we discuss.",
    "Strengths are: the approachable and incredibly sharp professor, the works we discuss, and the direction of the conversation being directed, but not in any way controlled, by the professor. Weaknesses are: I ended up with a crowded section, I believe the largest section in DS Lit, which was completely tolerable but sometimes made for a bit of a cramped space, both physically and intellectually.",
    "The class is very reading heavy which can make it daunting, but that is the struggle with all DS classes. The discussions we had in this class were great.",
    "I really enjoyed the material we covered in this course. However, I do wish I had been able to read some non-Western Canon literature as well. I also think we moved too quickly through the course material. I don't feel like we did each book justice.",
    "This course is a great display of the unique relationships and collaborations that can be formed between Yale students and professors. The class discussions were always engaging and the literature course was an overall strong component of the directed studies program. The class had very few weaknesses; the most difficulty my section encountered was not having enough time to give these significant works the justice they deserve in class discussion.",
    "I think the most frustrating part about this course was that it was taught in a sort of random, popcorn style. As it was a seminar, we all sat around our seminar table and essentially took turns spurting out different tidbits of insight about the works. My notes were kind of a random concoction of different points which reflected the way seminars usually went. The weekly lecture for this class similarly narrowed in on something very specific about the texts we were reading and milked it for all it was worth (for example, one of our lectures was about food in the Odyssey, another was about horse imagery in the Iliad, etc.). Although this stuff can be really interesting and cool to learn about, I think it should be supplementary to the main point of the text. I still don't feel like I have a great grasp on the overall meaning\/purpose of the texts we read because we never really talked about their overall meaning\/purpose. I would have loved to sit in a lecture which discussed the broader meaning and implications of each text as a whole, but there really wasn't much of that. Maybe I'm being a little over-critical, but this is something that I missed.",
    "The weekly reading journals were a great idea because it allowed discussion to extend outside of section. I wish we had spent a little more time on the Divine Comedy and the Metamorphoses."

   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend DS to other students. It is an invaluable experience that you will never replicate during your lifetime. So, please go through the pain of the work to enjoy how rewarding each text is in life.",
    "Highly recommend taking DS - there has not been a *single* text in DS Literature that I did not enjoy (really the only part of DS where I found even a few readings that were a bit dry was DS Philosophy). Some of these texts might change your life. Don't expect that each text will be dealt with using an ultra razor thin toothcomb, however. That's really not the purpose of the course. Also very, very good for improving writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially with Professor Bender. Directed Studies, despite its flaws, is a unique experience that is immensely valuable. In this course, you will learn to appreciate the western cannon, and grow as a writer. The paper writing process is rough, and the feedback can be harsh, but in the end, it teaches you to grow as a writer and prepares you for future classes at Yale. The work in Directed Studies is manageable and the pay-off is huge. In short, take this class and take it with Professor Bender if you can.",
    "Yes, definitely. Provides an excellent base for literary analysis and thought that's always enticingly self-critical.",
    "Yes. I believe that Directed Studies is one of the best courses available to freshmen.",
    "Obviously, to take this course would necessitate being in DS in general, so I will answer this question in a more general DS way: yes, I would recommend DS, but only if you're a particular kind of person with a particular set of interests. Even if you know you don't want to major in a humanities subject, DS is a great way to get general requirements filled. The more important intellectual interest is in understanding where pivotal ideas of the West have come from, how they came to be, and who and what they were influenced by in coming to be. It's a lot of work, a lot of reading, but worth it. I don't know for sure if I'll be continuing with DS next semester, but I'm very glad I did it this semester, if only because I would have little other reason to read the works I did, and I'm glad I did.",
    "If you enjoy reading and want to improve your reading and writing skills in addition to learning a TON about the western literary tradition, I highly recommend the course.",
    "This class is great if you want to have really interesting discussions, write, and read a lot, but the workload can make doing all three well challenging. If you have a good section professor this class is so thought-provoking.",
    "Professor Bender was an amazing DS Literature professor and he really makes it easy to feel inclusive in section. He doesn't make you feel like your ideas are stupid and he makes class participation easy.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. I think DS fosters a good community of people, and I really enjoyed the books we read in Literature.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend this course simply for the syllabus, and also for the improvement of one's writing skills. The seminars were helpful to dig further into the texts, but I learn better when there is a bit more structure. DS is not for the faint of heart, but I think the extra work is very worthwhile. Especially if you're interested in majoring in the humanities, DS will ensure that you read nearly all of the primary texts that you know you should but don't quite have the time\/motivation to do so independently.",
    "Yes, we read great books and had animated discussions. The same themes pervaded many of the books we read, which built on each other continuously."
