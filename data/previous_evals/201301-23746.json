   "comments": [
    "Yes! Amazing class.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "Overall a good class. Some of the discussion topics were more interesting than the others. I personally find the theory on leadership to be a little boring. The class is really at its best when we can tie the concept of leadership to specific historical or political events. Some weeks had too much reading materials.",
    "Ethical Leadership covers various aspects of leadership in business, ranging from the personality traits necessary in a leader, to popular conceptions of business leadership, to what constitutes bad leadership. I would recommend the class if you at all are interested in going into the world of business or finance, as it is very helpful to think about leadership in that field.",
    "it's a really great class and you will want to do the reading. i really liked it.",
    "It's about ethical leadership mainly applied in the business world. We touch on politics a bit to explore different leadership archetypes but the bulk of the course has to do with ethics of businesses and the managers and CEO's who lead them. Highly recommended to EVERYONE. It's a bit frightening that you can graduate from Yale without having had to think much about the ethical questions involved in leadership. This course is a great way to fix that.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "This is a very discussion-oriented class about issues in (primarily) business leadership.",
    "Yes, the class was very engaging and informative. Readings were very interesting and workload was manageable.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "The class was an interesting discussion but I'm not sure there's any concrete thing I really learned. The readings were good.",
    "Yes!",
    "Take it if you want to think about what leadership means. And if you want to discover more about the type of leader you want to be. Because we all are leaders in our own way.",
    "This course is pretty well organized. The beginning starts a bit dry, but the theory you learn will be useful when you look at case studies or have guest speakers. Also, the guest speakers are generally pretty great! Ultimately, I enjoyed the introspective nature of this course. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m one of your business-oriented Yalies, and taking this class made me question my values and goals if I were to go into business. It has given me a new perspective on the business. I am so glad I took this course!"
