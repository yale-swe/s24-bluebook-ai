    "Jenna is wonderful in every way! The capstone taught me so much about the subject matter of Yazidis specifically, but also the more general skills of interviewing, writing about culture, navigating trauma, studying religion and ethnicity, etc.",
    "Our project focused on what different avenues of post-genocide reconciliation may look like in Northern Iraq for the Yazidi community, particularly with an eye toward comparative historical cases (i.e. in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia). We took a more journalistic approach toward the class, combining academic research with interviews of scholars, lawyers, survivors, etc."
