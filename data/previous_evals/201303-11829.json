    "Junior seminar is one of options for the requirements for the art major, and I would definitely recommend it. You'll read a lot of things you might not have read otherwise, you get to meet some other junior art majors in a small seminar setting, Anoka is a fantastic teacher, and I personally feel like I have gained a lot of focus and insight into my own art-making that I never would have had before this class. I would recommend taking Junior Seminar for the requirement.",
    "Useful to study broader things like Kant in an art perspective",
    "Not as tedious as it may initially seem. The readings are not fun, but the classes where you learn about other student's work and talk about their interests and current projects are cool. Plus you get to know the other art majors well.",
    "This, or \"Critical Theory in the Studio\" is required for Art majors. I can't speak to the other class though I assume it's pretty similar in content to the Junior Seminar. I'd recommend the Junior Seminar, largely because of how it focuses, in part, on allowing people in the major to get to know each other (well, each other's work, more specifically).",
    "you have to take it; you might as well. do the reading or at least skim it."
