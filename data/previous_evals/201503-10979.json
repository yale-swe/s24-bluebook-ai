    "great course with hard homework.",
    "Good introduction to empirical IO. Somewhat fragmented. Hard to keep up with all the various modelsweekly homework would be appreciated. Summaries are an annoyance... This course is helpful for IO, macro, marketing, and other fields.",
    "It is a course that gives a very nice introduction to empirical industrial organization at the graduate level. It is an introductory course for the subject yet deep enough for one to obtain the necessary skills to start research on the subject. I would definitely recommend.",

    "Reading more than twenty recent papers in the field, I now feel that I know something about the field compared to my close to none knowledge at the beginning of the semester.",
    "Great first introduction to the discipline of IO. Could be improved by giving us a roadmap of where we are going with the course. Currently taught as a long sequence of papers. Even something as basic as splitting the papers into categories with a title so we understand what it is specficially we are suppose to take with us from these papers would be extremely useful.",
