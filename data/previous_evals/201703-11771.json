    "This class developed my sense of harmony, orchestration, and the way composers discuss their work.",
    "I learned how to compose music.",
    "Practice with music composition, understandings of different instruments, balance in orchestration, structure",
    "I didn't know much about orchestration before this course, so I learned a lot about that. I also became better at using metaphorical language when analyzing pieces.",
    "This semester I have learned the basics of approaching composition for percussion, strings and woodwinds, as well as developing harmonic language.",
    "Better understanding of the mechanics of many different instruments in the orchestra, a more detailed understanding of the relationship between the composer and the musician, more methods for developing new compositional ideas.",
    "I learned the basics of orchestration and how to write for different orchestral instruments. I also gained practice in writing about music.",
    "I learned how to write about the my original music and I also got to practice some orchestration skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The writing assignments feel irrelevant to the course's focuses and strengths, and lectures often aren't necessary for keeping up or completing assignments. The private coaching and independent project are the best part of the course, augmented by the assignments which challenge you to grow along the way.",
    "Very good class, sometimes I felt as though the assignments were a little bit unnecessary.",
    "Excellent class overall. Only weakness would be that I like courses that are a little more structured? But really don't change anything.",
    "You really get a lot of one on one help through your teaching fellow, which was extremely helpful for me. In the beginning of the semester we learned a lot with our smaller assignments and at the end of the semester we had a lot of interesting guests. However, I feel that it may have been more helpful to have more lectures and teaching assignments towards the end; we had so many guests, it began to seem like a exhibit rather than a learning experience.",
    "I wish the course had more assignments, since I feel that I got a vague introduction to orchestration on the PEs, but could have used a lot more practice with different templates or model compositions. I enjoyed working on my independent submissions but I could have benefited from more detailed feedback.",
    "A thing I would really have liked to improve is the slow grading. For example, when doing a writing assignment, it would have been very convenient to know my grade for a previous writing assignment, to know if I was on the right track. This is also true for composition submissions and portfolio exercises. However, grades would come after a very long time, and some things would remain ungraded even after the end of the semester. A strength was that the various assignments we did were useful and definitely helped me become a better composer and orchestrator.",
    "The class is a little bit scattered. It does a good job of working on individual projects, between lessons and midterm\/final meetings. The group-work half of the class was less well-done. Sometimes the classes were mainly music theory, which was rather boring, since I was already familiar with nearly all of the material in the notes. The lectures by Yale staff were great, but the lectures by visiting composers were hit-ot-miss. The rest of the class was just student presentations, which were fun but not all that educational."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. great class, you will learn a lot.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you want to write music. It's absolutely fantastic and a really exciting approach.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I learned a lot about orchestration and you really get to go in depth with a teaching fellow about the project of your choosing. We also had some interesting special guests. The only thing that was kind of rough was presenting our work at the end of the semester, but that comes with the territory I think.",
    "Anyone who is at all interested in pursuing composition should take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any musician interested in composing who would like to get experience writing for other instruments, and any musician who likes working with teachers one-on-one on long-term projects.",
    "Yes, it is a worthwhile course for a composer.",
    "I would recommend this course if students want individual composition lessons. I work well when I have deadlines and lessons. If someone is looking to learn the basic skills needed to compose from the lectures, I would not recommend this class."
