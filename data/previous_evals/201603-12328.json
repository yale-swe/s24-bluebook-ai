   "comments": [
    "The Alternative Energy class went into excruciating detail on dye-sensitized solar cells, along with the photosystems they are inspired by, in addition to general knowledge on alternative energy and climate change, and how to model electron transfer and optimized molecular\/complex structures.",
    "The greatest insight this course gave me was how all energy production is just pushing electrons into a high energy state and then releasing that energy. In addition the analogies to biology and how fuels differ from batteries were very interesting.",
    "Scientific and statistic knowledge about energy(generating, storage and etc.). Computer knowledge on modeling these process.",
    "Some general knowledge of solar energy and cell.",
    "This class was not particularly useful.",
    "This is a fascinating class I'll definitely recommend it to other students. I've learned very comprehensive information on climate change, DSSC, PS1 and PS2 as well as how to compute bandgap and Gibbs free energy via Gaussian, all of which I believe will contribute to my future research.",
    "I believe that I learned a good amount in this course. I believe that it was a very good introductory course into alternative energy. I feel like I have a better grasp on the topic after this course.",
    "I feel like I know several fun facts, but in terms of conceptual ideas I am left without much.",
    "There was an interesting set of knowledge from social events to calculations and biological machinery",
    "Knowledge about how nature harvests energy"

   "comments": [
    "The professors are certainly very knowledgeable in their fields, and generally taught the class very well. However, I do think that the title \"Alternative Energy\" isn't a fair reflection on the content taught in the class. While Dr. Crabtree's material seemed to focus on a variety of climate change and alternative energy topics, the other three professors focused very much on solar energy. I wasn't, therefore, anticipating Dr. Brudvig to go into so much detail on the plant photosystems, and didn't enjoy that part as much...I was expecting more to survey different topics in the field of alternative energy.",
    "The course is incredibly disjointed and mostly covered topics that were out of scope for the majority of students. The homework and exams were not in line with the lecture material and no grades were given back until the very end so the class was left in the dark with how their performance was. I did however enjoy Robert Crabtree's segment and felt like he presented a ton of great information.",
    "The biggest strength of this course is also it's biggest weakness. Having four different professors means that students get four different perspectives on the same problems and this is very insightful. At the same time each section only has a limited amount of time and it seemed to me that much of this was wasted with repetitive information. I would estimate that repeated material took up about 4 classes worth of time. Better communication between professors on what they teach would be very helpful in solving this. In particular I thought we spent too much time with trivia about global warming and non-chemistry related material. This extra time could have been used to avoid rushing through crystallography, discussing catalysis in detail, or giving students a more thorough help session with computation. On that last point, the help session we received was essentially a waste of time. Students don't struggle with the actual computations. They struggle with setting up the VPN, moving between directories, submitting jobs and other basic tasks. A hands on tutorial on these points would be much more effective. In addition, giving problems which work with the given computational restraints would also be helpful.",
    "The material is very interesting, and it was great learning from four excellent researchers in the field. However, the class wasn't very organized. Some lectures were given by all four professors, and at other times there were gaps in material.",
    "Sometimes the professors speak too fast and didn't focus on these important part. I think this is because of the time limit of the course.",
    "This class is taught by 4 different professors will very different teaching styles and different fields of interest. They do not coordinate their lectures at all, which they warn you about in the first few days but it somehow ends us even more hectic than one would expect. The lectures between professors for the most part have little to do with one another, expect when they completely repeat one another. Considering the professors have such a condensed time to teach and so much that they would like to tell us, avoiding this repetition between professors would allow them to overall teach us more and make lectures that much more engaging rather than a bit redundant. Another issue with this class is the sheer amount of material that professors try to cram into only a few short weeks, which then makes it very difficult to figure out what will be tested on the exams. The exams were also consistently much harder and tested very different material than what was seen on the 1 or 2 problem sets assigned by each professor. Overall though, the material was very interesting and showed an application of chemistry that isn't found in other chemistry classes. However, steps can definitely be taken to make this unconventional class style go more smoothly.",
    "Chem 505 is one of the only classes that addresses alternative energy from a scientific perspective, so I was disappointed that such an important topic wasn't taught better. The class is taught in 4 sections, which in itself is not a problem, and the professors told us at the beginning that the sections would not be coordinated. Having sections were on 4 distinct topics has the potential to be a good model, especially with an eye towards giving us a broad overview of the current research on alternative energy. But we got 4 disjointed sections in which one professor would either not refer at all to the other professors' sections or reteach things already explained by another professor. All in all, I think the course would be greatly improved if the professors spent more time planning out the course together. There was also an issue with the assessments for the course. We got no grades back until after Thanksgiving which was really frustrating. Even when students emailed asking for grades, it took weeks to get problem sets and exams returned. Also, the problem set for the final section of the course was absolutely ridiculous. The professor expected a level of programming knowledge that we did not have. The problem set required multiple 1-on-1 sessions with a graduate student in the professor's lab to try and explain how to even download all the programs required for the problem set. Finally, the professors of the course \"requested\" that it not count as an elective for the chemistry major because it was \"not rigorous\" enough. I think a class with 3 exams, a paper, and multiple problem sets should meet the requirements for a chemistry elective.",
    "Very disjointed course. The transition from one professor to another was poor because they each have their own teaching styles and expectations. Sometimes I felt as though the professors didn't really know their audience. A lot of students in the course are taking it mostly out of interest and had little to no background in some of the topics discussed. This especially concerns the computational chemistry sections. I really struggled with those sections because the instructors gave us little or no help with the fundamentals. Computational methods are very difficult to pick up in a few week period without having any previous exposure to it. My favorite sections was professor Crabtree's. I liked the general survey of topics that he presented. The other three sections were sometimes much too specific to be able to fully grasp in three weeks.",
    "This course has an interesting topic, but having four different teachers with completely different teaching styles made it hard to follow and difficult to gain much from the course as a whole. There was also no grading feedback until the very end of the course.",
    "This class is extremely disorganized and not very engaging. While some of the professors were good, the class overall was very dissatisfying.",
    "The strengths: the information on each section was very comprehensive thus has equipped us with all-sided knowledge, having given us very broad and general insights. The weakness: The content sometimes was too much to handle and made it hard to keep up in class all the time.",
    "I thought the material in this course was interesting. However, I thought there was a lot of repetition in between professors. I also believed that the information tested in some of the sections wasn't representative of what we learned. That being said, I did enjoy this course and I learned a lot about alternative energy and possible alternatives.",
    "This course was just all over the place. It was a lot of information thrown at the students without much meat to it. There was also so much unnecessary information that when it came time for an exam, I walked in thinking I was prepared and then laughed when I saw the test because it was something completely different. It honestly felt like a waste of time, and I mean that with no disrespect to the instructors.",
    "The class seemed very disjointed and some sections really relied on others. I think the best order would have been Social, Biological, DSSC cells, Calculations. Also some sections were rushed and people struggled as a result. The calculations with the computer cluster was particular painful for people without coding experience and I know many of my fellow students just gave up on it."
