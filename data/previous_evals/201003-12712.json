    "Sadly, Professor Person will not be teaching this course next year. But it was fabulous! If you are interested in Russia\/Eastern Europe and what happened before and after the Berlin Wall, especially after, then this course is a great option.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "YES TAKE IT. The reading is heavy, but it gives you a great understanding of what's going on in these countries and also helps you understand a lot of the democratization, nationalism, and economic trends happening in a lot of other countries in the modern world as well.",
    "Not a gut course, but very manageable and VERY worthwhile. Material is interesting and not something you come across in lots of other Yale course. I would recommend this to everyone interested in the topic. The only caveat being that I think Professor Person is leaving and he was really what made it so great. Still, the course could be worth taking if you know that the next professor will also be good.",
    "Highly, highly recommend the class! Really unfortunate that Professor Person will not be back to teach it again, as he was a fantastic professor."
