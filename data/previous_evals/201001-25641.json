    "Q.10 - This course provides the opportunity to a would-be Manager to think out of the proverbial box. The course raises embracing management concerns including but not limited to, finance; forestry; economics; and leadership. It provides both a kaleidoscopic view but also a \"balcony\" view (i.e. a view from a vantage position), of people's interaction with resources and decision making. So consider it!",
    "1. Almost no reading was required for this course. Some reading material might have helped create better structure around the topics covered.7b. TA often wasn't present and didn't contribute during the class."

    "Learning the difficulties of starting a business and other aspects from the policymakers and competitors. By viewing things in different angles, the existance of many actions or organizations makes more sense to me.",
    "The stories and odd pieces of knowledge that Chad shared throughout. Ex. The answer to how concrete differs from cement. You leave the course feeling like you acquired small, random pieces of information that will prove to be extremely helpful at some point in your career, even if they didn't necessarily relate very closely with the material covered in the course.The intended practicality of the material."

    "The hardest part about the course was the shyness of the students. I think the material would have been better covered with a group of students who were discussion oriented. I'm not sure how Chad could have made the students in this class talkative.The classesv2 site should be more frequently used, which would result in less paper being handed out throughout the course.Some of the Powerpoint slides seemed fascinating, but they were hardly ever presented. Would have liked to have heard the content that went along with those presentations."

In essence, managing rersources is about time, place, context but also the manager's ability to anticipate change and growth. This course is useful in that sense and many more. Students should take the course as a framework within which they could insert they peculiar circumstances.",
