    "Definitely take this class!!! I loved the materials that we read and watched, and class discussions were always interesting. Throughout the semester we read short stories and watched films and then discussed them in class, with occasional writing assignments. It was really fun, I learned a lot, and got to engage with a lot of cool Israeli literature\/film. Shiri is awesome!!!! It's so clear that beyond teaching us Hebrew she is a brilliant academic, and it really shines in an L5 course where we were learning ABOUT literature and other cultural productions, IN Hebrew. We not only improved our Hebrew skills, and learned a lot of relevant vocabulary that helped us improve our ability to express our ideas in all our class discussions and writing assignments, but we also learned a ton about Israeli culture through literature and film, and new nuanced ways to analyze and think about cultural media. Shiri is encouraging, straightforward and fun. She also always gave us the option to submit drafts ahead of time for extra feedback to really be able to do our very best work. She asked us for feedback throughout the course to make sure the class reflected topics that were interesting to us. I have only good things to say!! I'd take it all over again if I could!",
    "This course provides a good foundation of modern Israeli culture, and allows one to engage with primary sources, such as Israeli TV shows, movies, and short stories. I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic and with the requisite level of Hebrew language skills.",
    "Absolutely take this class!!! This course was a lot of fun and I also learned a lot! The professor does a great job engaging everyone in conversation during class, and I feel as though my speaking, reading, and writing really improved. The assessments and work load is really reasonable. The material is also very interesting and enjoyable. The class dynamic is like a seminar, and you really get close to your classmates by the end which was really nice. Professor Goren is also really friendly and approachable and a joy to learn from.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! It was a really fun opportunity to improve my Hebrew while learning a lot about Israeli culture.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any other student who is looking to improve their written and spoken Hebrew and develop their language skills in a more academic setting.",
    "For anyone looking to take a Hebrew course, I would recommend this one. The material is interesting and the professor is very helpful in making sure you understand both the content and the Hebrew language.",
    "Take the class: a nice, low stress way to learn Hebrew and learn about Israeli culture. Uses a very varied and interesting set of mediums: TV, Movies, articles, short stories. The class, in a way few classes are, is fun."
