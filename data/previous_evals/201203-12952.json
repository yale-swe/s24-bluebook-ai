   "comments": [
    "Lots of reading (like any seminar) but Professor Kocher is a great, funny, and engaging seminar leader. Come for the nationalism, stay for his funny (and honestly quite helpful) drawings on the whiteboard. Don't expect to learn the Grand Unified Theory of nationalism, since each author has a different theory and there isn't a ton of continuity. You'll critique and tear down the arguments the authors make, but you won't build up over the semester to a coherent idea of nationalism.",
    "If you are at all interested in political identity or issues of political violence definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this course to poli sci students who are interested in the theory of nationalism. The course engages with some important works on nationalism. Readings are manageable and often quite interesting (though can be dry and theoretical at some points). Class discussion can be a bit slow because the time slot is early and everyone is a bit groggy. Also discussions can be a bit frustrating because we grapple with concepts that are inherently difficult to define, but obviously that's the point of the class! Also, Prof Kocher is a sweet dude. Really smart and engaging, he keeps the class stimulating and is great at picking good readings, facilitating discussions, inserting really interesting background examples to apply some of the more theoretical content, and providing great feedback on written assignments. Seems intimidating at first but is actually quite approachable and kind.",
    "This is a pretty decent theory-heavy class. You'll read a lot of important theories about nationalism (Anderson, Gellner, etc.) and then some recent case studies, a lot written by Yale professors. Like any theory, it can be both challenging and satisfying. It's likely you'd come across some of this material in other political science, history, or area studies classes, but if you really want to concentrate on nationalism as a phenomenon in a comparative context, this is the place to do it. The workload isn't too hard - just a couple of reading responses and a research paper.",
    "I would recommend this class only to a student that wants to learn how political science approaches the issue of nationalism through empirical analysis of historical situations. While the course is very theory based, you don't get to speculate or construct any coherent ideas about the books that you are reading. Instead, the class is focused on criticizing the arguments that we read without going much beyond them.",
    "This class is an overview in different schools of thought related to nationalism and ethnicity. Very theory heavy, uses case studies, but it really helps if you bring in some information from specific cases you've studied outside of the class.",
    "This was a good class to explore the foundational arguments for causes and consequences of nationalism and ethnicity, and indeed what those terms even mean. Great introductory class, I would take it again. Just make sure you do the reading or seminar will be exceedingly awkward!"
