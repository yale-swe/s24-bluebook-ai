    "More German. Better speaking.",
    "Continued knowledge of German vocab, grammar, tenses, and German culture and history.",
    "My German has improved immensely through L3 German. Before this semester, I was not comfortable with my speaking abilities. Even though I'm still not totally confident, I definitely feel as though my pronunciation and accuracy has improved over the course of this semester. My listening abilities have also improved a lot.",
    "This course goes over both new vocabulary and sentence structures in German (particularly the more complicated structures like passive) and also reviews grammatical rules from previous semesters. This course also breaks each module into the study a particular city in Germany.",
    "I continued my education in the german language and learned so much more vocabulary and grammar. My speaking and writing greatly improved and it was very helpful for practicing my german.",
    "A better handle on how the grammar works, especially adjective endings"

   "comments": [
    "It is generally a very good course.",
    "The tests were too difficult - it didn't necessarily test how much we've learned or understood from each unit; rather, it seemed as though the department was against us the whole time. The averages on the exam were very low, and the level of the reading comprehensions and listenings were above the target level for the course.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of the course and the activities we did in class. However, I feel like there could have been more drill activities to allow the students to really get a feel for the different grammatical structures we used in class. At some points the class was a little fast paced.",
    "The course is very interactive and has many great activities for practicing speaking and writing. One weakness is that some students were much better than others and it was hard to practice with them\/ they would do extremely well on the assignments.",
    "The final project would have been better if it was a paper and not a video. The video was time-intensive but I felt that I did not practice my German very much with it."

    "VIDEOPRJECT!",
    "It depends. If you really want to learn German, then yes, take it. But expect it to bring down your GPA. The German department is very harsh with grading.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who wants to enhance their German skills and range of vocabulary.",
    "German 130 is a (slightly indirect) continuation of the 110-120 sequence, with a somewhat greater emphasis on improving writing skills than the former two classes. It definitely improved my ability to speak, write, and read with some degree of proficiency. Thiti is an excellent instructor. His teaching is quite engaging, and his feedback on assignments is clear and helpful.",
    "I would highly recommend german to another student. The language is so interesting and has such a wonderful history. This course was extremely engaging and i learned so much.",
    "Yes"
