  {
   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Professor takes a complicated subject and breaks it down into digestible parts. The parts build on each other in a logical way. Weaknesses: The grading system of comparing students to each other seems unfair for those without any GIS background and\/or with little to no modelling background. The system does not necessarily reflect the level of effort and time put in by a student.",
    "All good",
    "The engagement with the material is fantastic. The only weakness I could identify is the time demand, but I also don't really see a way around that.",
    "I appreciate simply sitting down and understanding the rationale behind everything that goes behind the functions of ArcGIS. However, I think the class deserves at least a small amount of time in a lab with the professor perhaps explaining as he does in the auditorium, but with students actively performing the functions being taught and familiarizing themselves with it.",
    "I liked Dana's teaching style - I think it was interesting that it was in Burke rather than in the computer lab but I thought this method worked for me. I wish the homeworks received some grades so there wasn't so much emphasis put on the final report. And while the homeworks were not graded, I thought it put some stress to know which homeworks received what grade in the public forum of the Google Drive. I would have preferred just being sent an email about if my homework was above or below average.",
    "It might be nice if part of the course was taught in a computer lab so that everyone could practice the new skill while it was being introduced.",
    "I did not like the grading scheme of the class. The final project structure seemed counterintuitive to me. We have a final project, but instead of putting together cohesive project, we are just supposed to showcase how well we use the tools taught in the class. It would have been better to just grade the homework for an actual grade than to have our grades based off of this weird final project.",
    "The course is taught in lecture fashion, which is a difficult mode when teaching the use of a computer program. I found it hard to follow along with Dr. Tomlin in class, and sometimes he suggested that we not even try. I found this discouraging, and I did not find watching him simply click through the program four two hours an effective way of teaching for me. He almost always let us out an hour earlier as well, and I feel this time would have been productively used if we were instead working through the program together as he taught. Additionally, Dr. Tomlin changed the grading structure of the class at the end of the term, after several assignments had already been submitted. While likely this benefited some students, the chaotic nature and unclear rubric was frustrating. He used such phrases \"will look positively on your grade\" which only further added to the ambiguity as to how our grades were calculated. Finally, while I can understand Dr. Tomin's desire for some competition, his grading structure, which attempts to pit students against each other and Yale against Penn, seems unnecessary. The was especially clear in the Model Builder competition, which ultimately was biased toward the Penn students (you cannot simply \"double\" the Yale votes) . Additionally, grades should not be publicly accessible information. The homeworks provided by Dr. Tomlin , however, were phenomenal. They challenged the class, and required us to employ different skills each week. In the end, I appreciated the heavy workload, however it would have been significantly lighter if we had worked together through the program in class, as much of the time was re-watching class and attempting to follow along on my own computer.",
    "Strengths: Dana is a good\/clear instructor, and the class was well organized. Improved: About halfway through the semester the amount of information presented each class increased dramatically - I went from feeling like I had a good handle on it to scrambling to keep up. For an intro class, aimed at students with no GIS experience, it made the second half of the semester very challenging. Additionally, it would be easier to learn the material if this class was a lab class, where students follow along in the GIS lab and can ask questions in real time.",
    "I appreciated that we didn't have weekly assignments, which freed us up to focus on some interesting course projects. But, I think the grading of the weekly homework could have been integrated\/explained better at the beginning of the course. I think if we are expected to put in a good deal of work for these assignments every week, they should count towards a bigger part of our grade.",
    "Strengths: Professor Tomlin is an amazing instructor. Not only does he really know GIS, but he knows how to communicate his understanding to his students. He always began with the concepts, making sure we understood what we were doing rather than just memorizing. Weakness: Model Builder was introduced too late i the game for it to make up such a substantial part of our grade. We had no time to practice with it before a major assignment was due.",
    "Th way the course is structured, most of the legwork happens independently. Therefore, the lecture did not feel like an entirely valuable way to spend time.",
    "Strengths: Freedom to explore the GIS program, Walking through the material thoroughly in class was a great introduction Weaknesses: Not being able to use raster data and functions in the final project for credit felt restricting at times, so maybe in the future some raster basics can be covered in class as well?; it may have been helpful to go through the material together in class in a computer lab",
    "It was a high level course and an extremely large workload. Strange method of grading. I would prefer to learn in a lab setting rather than lecture. It would be more useful to focus on the skills in lab with even just a TA because I am not attempting to be a GIS specialist. Professor was funny and knowledgeable, but a lecture for GIS is not a good fit. Almost no time was spent on model builder in class despite it being the hardest part.",
    "I understand that the class is broken up into vector and raster GIS. I think it would make more sense to have a beginner and intermediate course in GIS, rather than one vector and one raster. The lecture based setting of the class does not make sense to me - this is a technical skill, and should be taught in a lab. Lecture acts to introduce concepts and then we have to figure out how to make them work practically on our own. The lack of office hours from the professor is difficult, as posting on an online platform isn't a good substitute. The workload is very high, and relentless. The only solace is that the class TA was very helpful, the handouts are decent and you could re-watch the lecture videos (which I would do and follow the instructor more slowly).",
    "Hands down, the greatest strength of this course is its instructor, Prof. Tomlin. Personally, I enjoyed his lecturing, speaking, and writing style enormously (possibly because its amazingly reminiscent of both my dad and his dad (my grandpa)). Not only did this delight me I think it may have augmented my ability to understand and retain the material that Prof. Tomlin taught, both in lecture and on written resources (like handouts). Im honestly not sure how the course could be improved I guess thats a good thing, but I feel like I should say sorry?",
    "GIS is a very old software, and Dana's strong connection to ArcMap is both a strength and a weakness. He can guide students through the program with incredible detail, but he doesn't give much context for geospatial modeling outside this software, and how to think about the limitations of the program. My background is in Tableau, and I would have liked the opportunity to extend our work into that program too. Dana's guide to ArcMap was excellent, I felt very supported.",
    "I found the format of the class to be somewhat strange. I would have expected the class to be taught in a computer lab, and having it as a lecture class was a little strange and hard to follow. I also found the public criticism of our work products (including all of our grades) to be a little odd. I liked the Piazza online forum, and found it to be a good way to troubleshoot issues. I wished that the criteria for the first assignment had been made clear to us before the assignment was due. I also did not appreciate the second part of our project being due right after Thanksgiving break. Due to the structure of the course, it wasn't really possible to do ahead of time, and I felt like it was impossible for me to do well because I was traveling over Thanksgiving with family and didn't have enough time to devote to the project. At the end of the course, it seemed like Dana was changing the grading system on the fly, which was a bit confusing. In the future, I would strongly encourage him to incorporate things like Piazza participation into the grading system at the beginning of the class if he plans to add it in later. After telling us that our homework grades would not count, he also implied at the end of the course that the grades might count after all if they were strongly different from our project grades. This left me feeling uneasy and I wished that the grading system was clear from the beginning. I also found the ModelBuilder part of the course at the end of the semester to be very confusing. I do not think that I learned nearly enough about ModelBuilder to be able to do what was being asked of us at that point.",
    "The course is very much chose your own adventure. It is a lot of work but you can spend as much extra time on it as you want, or dive down as many rabbit holes as you want to. At first I wasn't a fan of the public nature of the grading system but I understand why it is there. I wonder if there isn't a way to make it more anonymous. The homework are not technically factored into the final grade, which is frustrating because of how many hours go into them. Overall this is a fantastic course, a must take if you will be involved with maps in any way in your career."

    "If you want to learn GIS and use of Arcgis, this course is very helpful, worth a lot of workload.",

    "Know that a lot of this work will take time so be ready to commit to the time it takes to complete everything in this class. But also know there are so many resources to help you succeed, from Dana to the TFs to Piazza.",
    "If you are considering auditing this course, I would recommend that you just take the course instead. You will get much more out of it. I wish I has not audited.",
    "Audit the class and do the homework, as you will then gain the skills but avoid the confusing and stressful grading system.",
    "Be prepared to spend a ton of time outside class on the assignments.",
    "If you want to learn GIS, do it with Professor Tomlin. That being said, prepare for a lot of work.",
    "It is helpful to have an idea of what you would like your final project to be before you begin the course. Schedule computer lab time into your weekly class schedule. The tutorials are the most helpful and the reference files are helpful too. Always check piazza when you run into an error because chances are someone else ran into the problem first.",
    "Make sure you are willing to put in a lot of time to do the work. There are other options to learn GIS such as workshops, but one benefit of the course is that it forces you to do the work and learn over the course of the semester.",
    "Expect a ton of work, and not much guidance. You will come out knowing how to work with ArcGIS, but it is difficult course that requires a lot of time investment.",
    "I recommend that, if at all possible\/viable, you get ArcGIS installed onto your personal computer. Doing so wont mean that youre restricted to working on your laptop even though I had GIS installed, I still ended up doing almost all of my GIS work on campus computers (mainly because a dual-screen setup makes things SO much easier). Nevertheless, Im definitely glad I had GIS on my own laptop, because it was really nice to have the option of working off-campus when I wanted to (like in coffee shops or during school breaks). HOWEVER, if you do put GIS on your laptop, I highly recommend that you do not open it during lecture in hopes of following along with Prof. Tomlin as he does demonstrations on his own machine (displayed via the projector). It seems like a good idea, but its extraordinarily easy to fall behind as he moves through steps (after all, you have to look through dozens of buttons simply to locate the one Prof. Tomlin just found in two seconds), and once you fall behind, I can almost guarantee that you wont catch up until Prof. Tomlin stops his computer usage to talk for a while. In that time, youll very likely continue to search for that button, or make that query work, or get your map to look like his and youll miss all of his subsequent steps (of which there may be many), effectively rendering the whole follow-along-with-Dana strategy counterproductive at best. At worst, youll become a distraction to the people around you by quietly asking your neighbor to kindly point out that button or guide you through the next seven steps. All in all, I really believe that you will understand and absorb far more of the information Prof. Tomlin covers if you simply give your full attention to watching his demonstrations and listening to his lecture.",
    "Valuable for most MEMs. If you don't want to work in GIS, it's still useful because you have a better idea of what you can ask of the analyst you're employing.",
    "I would advise a student to follow along on their computer (on the ArcMap program) in class. I would also advise a student to make sure that this was the most intense course they were taking at the time, because it will inevitably dominate their schedule. I would strongly encourage students to look closely at the projects done by previous students. I would also encourage students to NEVER leave GIS work until the last minute. It will never work perfectly and technical problems do come up.",
    "To consider the greater time commitment the course will entail.",
    "Be prepared to put in a lot of hours and spend a lot of time wildly frustrated. But, if you put your time in you come out with a great, marketable skillset. Dana knows what he's doing."
