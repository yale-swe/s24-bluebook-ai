    "It is a general survey of much of the history of religion in the United States. It is, however, in no way comprehensive, and has some pretty sizable gaps. This is understandable, given the scope of the course and the huge timeframe which it attempts to cover. I would definitely recommend it to a fellow student, provided they would be able to keep up with the large amount of reading.",
    "The class was a survey of writing about religious history in America. It covered the whole of American history since the colonists arrived to the present day and many different facets of religious life, including different traditions and political considerations.I would recommend this class. It was exactly what I was expecting. Most of the books were informative and well written and class discussion illuminated the books further.",
