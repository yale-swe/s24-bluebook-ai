   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this class whether or not you are interested in American literature. I found myself reading and discussing texts I would never have picked up on my own and really learned a lot about the wide range American literature and improved my literary analysis skills.",
    "If you want to read or re-read some classic American literature, this a great way to get your writing requirement done.",
    "I would definitely recommend American lit - it's a great survey course of short stories, novels, and poetry that spans pretty much all of american history. Theres a lot of freedom with the essays and flexibility in general within discussion.",
    "Take it! The reading list is very good, and so long as you get a good professor you're assured to learn a lot. The reading load is high but definitely doable, and the papers and other work are the same way.",
    "A lot of reading (150-200 per week), but good reading.",
    "This was a good class. Reading list is pretty entertaining.",
    "Take it if you intend to be an informed American citizen.",
    "I would recommend English 127 to someone who is interested in english. It is not an easy course but it is very rewarding. Make sure you take it with a good professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It improves your writing, reading, and analytical skills and expands your understanding of American Literature.",
    "This class was a great class and a good entry-level English course. I highly recommend it.",
    "English 127 is a great course because it allows you to track the development of America through literature. It was wonderful to read novels from so many different time periods and to be able to watch the development of literature. The course does involve quite a bit of assigned reading, but it is well worth it. If you are interested in reading the works of some amazing authors, then this class is definitely for you.",
    "You read a lot of American essays, novels, and poetry in ENGL 127. The essay length and number of essays will vary depending on the professor. Definitely try to get Tom Koenigs--he's amazing. Only take the course if you're interested in reading American literature. Read the material and you'll get a lot out of the course. Some of the works we read: Moby Dick, The Great Gatsby, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, Hart Crane, Thomas Jefferson, etc. Overall a good course. And provided a nice contrast to my science classes."
