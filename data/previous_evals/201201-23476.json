    "This is a great course for music lovers to learn more about the science of the art. No real basis in physics is needed, and, as such, physics students will probably feel that the course moves much too slowly.",
    "Yes take it",
    "Professor Demers is great! She tries very hard to make class interesting for everyone. That being said (perhaps it's because this is the first year the course has been taught) but the classwork is MUCH too easy (it covers about 1% of the material covered in class lectures). I feel weird complaining about the workload being too light, but the class really felt inane at times. Lectures were always fun and interesting though.",
    "some people liked it. i thought it wasnt all that interesting since it wasnt hard at all and i didnt care for the material much - took it for credit",
    "Incredibly easy. Unfortunately, that was the defining feature of this class. It was at times quite interesting, but it was so easy that it couldn't be as interesting as it might have been. I get that it's supposed to be for humanities people who are terrible at science and that it's tough to find the right balance, but here's the thing: Not everyone who wants an easy science credit is stupid. Anyway, Sarah is very likeable and engaging, and the subject of the class is inherently interesting. It's cool to learn about how different instruments work. Sometimes the classes got boring towards the end of the semester, but this was the best effort I know of to construct a science class for humanities majors. I just wish the class had been a bit more rigorous. There's some really good math and physics in harmonics that we barely touched on.",
    "Yes, great class.",
    "Yes. Absolutely take this class. It is a great QR\/Sci that manages to be actually interesting, whilst at the same time being reasonable for someone with very little confidence in maths\/physics. Also, you get to make flutes out of PVC piping as one of the psets!",
    "PHYS 118 is a great science credit for non-science majors, because it conveys a basic understanding of key physics concepts using musical terminology and rhetoric. I would recommend the course to the student who is looking to approach physics from a practical, everyday perspective, especially if the student is a musician or music-lover, because while certain fundamental physics units which would be found in a standard introductory physics course are omitted, those that are included are framed in a very memorable context.",
    "I would recommend it only if you want a QR or Sc credit and are not particularly concerned with engaging with the course or picking up a deeper knowledge of the questions at hand. Otherwise, the class is not very satisfying.",
    "I guess I should have known this was a gut QR (I, a physics major, took it as a 5th class hoping it might at least give me music insight), but in the end, with the exception of a few topics (such as acoustics) that were handled pretty well, it was not really illuminating if you know basic physics.Demers brought enthusiasm and a lively atmosphere to the lectures, but she was a bit ill-suited to teach the class, since she is not someone who is really knowledgeable in the area of physics of music; she is clearly a particle physicist. She also often taught the class as if she was teaching middle-schoolers; she often assumed people needed review on the most basic algebraic concepts, which is puzzling given we are Yale students, and I often felt like I was back in 6th grade.The midterm was a complete joke where I think most people got an 100, but the final was a bit harder with some qualitative questions.",
    "Yes, for a very relaxed science credit. Though a bit more challenge would probably be a good thing.",
    "This was my least favorite class I've taken at Yale. The lectures were not engaging because so little information was presented. The problem sets were a joke (though who complains about an easy problem set?). This is a gut class if there ever was one, it's almost no work. Sarah Demers is awesome, but the content of the class is very poor.If you're actually interested in learning about the physics of music, don't take this class. You'll be disappointed. Take a QR that will engage you instead.",
    "This is a particularly easy science class. Some of the early lectures are very interesting and useful in giving basic information of how sound waves work and what harmony is. After that, though, it's more of a tour of \"how different instruments work\". The problem sets and tests are mostly all calculation using given formulas. It's not uninteresting, and Sarah Demers is an extremely likable and sharp professor, but it's decidedly unchallenging and most people won't walk away with much valuable knowledge.",
    "Pretty easy science\/QR -- in general, very easy math, even for someone who never took calc and hated physics.",
    "It is an extremely easy QR\/ Science credit. I would recommend this class, especially as a 5th or 6th credit.For someone who has background in physics, this class will be too easy. For someone who does not, it may be a good introduction!",
    "The quintessential Sc gut. Easier than high school physics, and with a 60-90 minute problem set each week. You basically cover the mechanics side of physics, and occasionally relate it to how musical instruments work. The lectures can be kind of hit-or-miss: Either really interesting because they are relevant to you somehow, or boring because you are just watching a computer perform 600 Fourier Transforms on a Tambourine being struck in different locations.Sarah Demers was extremely nice and was always asking if everybody was following lecture \/ understood what was going on.Also, many people finished the first mid-term (to which was allotted 75 minutes) in 20 minutes. And most had finished the final within 90. The questions on each were straight from the problem sets.",
    "Subject matter is just as interesting as it sounds, but when I took the class I didn't find the challenge I looked for. You'll probably benefit most from the class if you don't have a lot of physics experience.",
    "This is a very easy science credit. Worth taking because the stuff you learn is interesting. But it is very very easy. You can get 100 percent in this class.",
    "Physics of Music is a cursory overview of a range of topics related to the physics of sound. It is definitely targeted at a non-calculus audience, so if you have much of that in your background, you will likely find all of the math a breeze. The class never gets very deep into any of the topics, but the professor does provide suggestions for further readings if you are burning with curiosity.",
    "Physics of Music is a fantastically fun way to learn some basic physics as it relates to music. The material is not challenging and Professor Demers is a pleasure to learn from. If you've taken any physics before (or even if you haven't) you'll find this pretty easy and fun.",
    "Great class and really fun\/interesting, but ridiculously easy. If you've taken physics before, don't take this class unless you are really interested in the material, as most of it will be a repeat for you. Minimal work, but really fascinating material. Sarah Demers is a superb lecturer and just an awesome person in general.",
    "Idiotic material. Don't do it.",
    "This class was actually the easiest class I have taken at yale or probably since middle school by a long shot. You don't have to go to lecture or read the textbook, etc. If you want a gut class, THIS IS THE ONE. If you genuinely want to learn about the physics of music however, this is probably going to be a waste of your time.",
    "Definitely.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you want an easy easy easy QR or SC. There are problem sets, but there is nothing more than very basic math involved. This class is not a challenge in the slightest. Total gut, but fun nonetheless.",
    "Yes.",
    "fun intro to physics of music and learning about how sound works... i would recommend it",
    "Absolutely!!",
    "Basic physical concepts related to music and sound",
    "Excellent. Very fun. Highly recommended.",
    "This is an excellent class. Great way to learn about waves, instrument-design, harmonics, acoustics, how to produce certain sounds\/what is physically happening when sound is being produced. Professor Demers is extremely nice and considerate of student interests.",
    "Yes - great Sci credit",
    "The Physics of Music looks at the relationship between physics and music, as the name suggests. I would recommend the class, but I do wish the physics and musics were more integrated.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for a QR or Science requirement. It's engaging, and there's not a lot of work, mostly just the weekly problem sets. It's not the most serious course when it comes to physics calculations, or deeply understanding some of the music concepts, but you do get to see some of the interesting ways physics and music intersect.",
    "It's an interesting look at the physics of music, though the tested material was far more simple and easier than the material covered in class. A better assessment of our understanding of the concepts would have made the class a lot better, though I'm not complaining about the relatively easy exams. The professor is super energetic and enthusiastic, so I would recommend any course Demers instructs in the future. Easy and interesting\u0097that's a rare Yale class.",
    "If you are looking for a science credit that will make you think but will not challenge you significantly, this is a great course. With the proper effort, high marks are imminent.",
    "Yes. An overall not too challenging course, but extremely interesting.",
    "A great introductory class in Physics and Music that you can take without a great deal of stress.",
    "Great class! It's definitely a gut, so don't go in with ridiculous expectations. There are really cool demonstrations, and students are often invited to bring instruments so the class can see a graph of their different harmonic spectra, etc.",
    "Yes, but only if it was capped at a much smaller number of students (like 30). I skipped a lot of the lectures because they were up on science hill and really weren't necessary for the problem sets since Sarah posts slides online. This is a good class for music majors, musicians, and students looking for an interesting, applicable QR class.",
    "This is an interesting and entertaining course. The demos are great. However, the course does not go into a lot of depth and you will not get a solid physics background out of it.",
    "Easy QR or Science course, but also really interesting. The problem sets are really not hard at all, definitely recommend for those looking to get a requirement out of the way but learn something new, too.",
    "This is a great way to get a sc-credit out of the way. Sarah Demers is fantastic. Easy, one problem set a week; two relatively easy exams. Difficult to receive a poor grade. Difficult not to enjoy, at least somewhat.",
    "MOVE OVER MOVIE PHYSICS, THIS IS THE NEW BIGGEST GUT AT YALE. Seriously, don't take this class unless you're willing to swallow your Yalie pride because halfway through you'll get really depressed that you're taking a class that a middle-schooler could easily get an A in.",
    "This class was awesome! A perfect class for musicians who want to learn a bit more of the physics behind what they do. A few things to keep in mind: (1) This course was entirely algebra. So, if you're looking for a challenging physics class, this ain't it. However, I've heard that she might make it a bit more math intensive next year, which would either be a boon or a mark against it, depending on if you're looking for an easy credit or not. For me personally, since it's been 3 years since I've taken calculus, I was grateful, since there's quite a bit I don't remember anymore (and let's face it, the calc courses here are generally poorly taught, so only the truly tenacious will make it out of those having actually learned something. (2) This class will probably make no sense if you're not a musician. I can't fathom taking this class if you don't know music in any formal way \u0096 terms like octave, intervals, and scales will come up again and again, and if you don't understand these, I could only imagine that the class would be confusing. For musicians, this will build a lot on the music knowledge you do have. (You don't need formal music theory though - just knowledge of your instrument would be enough.) It's not enough to have a great interest in listening to music, I don't think - you have to have some experience playing it, otherwise I don't think you'll getmuch out of it. (3) We did a lot of in-class measurements and demonstrations with real instruments - that was pretty cool. (4) Prof. Demers is a particle physicist at CERN. This might seem unrelated to anything, but, this meant that she often came to class not entirely prepared, and massively sleep-deprived. (Hell, I would be too trying to do research for CERN halfway around the world.) This meant dealing with a lot of frustrations in class with setting up projectors, computers, and demos, and occasionally some data \/ equations presented in class would turn out to be typos \/ inaccurate. That said, (5) Prof. Demers is super nice and very accessible, even if she is clearly overworking herself. In sum, this was a surprisingly useful class for me as a musician and actually gave me some practical knowledge for fixing challenging problems I've always struggled with - a really rare thing for a class to do. Sure, it was really easy, and that might be enough to turn some people off, but it was very fun.",
    "Are you a poet looking for a QR credit? Take this class. It's actually quite interesting, without leaving you feeling washed up on the shores of physics despair.",
    "It was obvious for a number of reasons that this was the first year Physics of Music was taught at Yale\u0097the scope of the course wasn't entirely clear and the class generally lacked continuity. The course was EASY and is perhaps the first true gut I have taken (the midterm had 5 questions and took between 15 and 20 min). That said, Professor Demers was engaging and effective in class, though left us and the TA a little high and dry around the time of the final. I would not take this course again myself, even though I'm very interested in the subject material.",
    "Initially super excited for MUSIC and PHYSICS credit. I needed a QR badly and the Professor was very humorous and loved to show you-tube videos, which promised an entertaining science-math course. PSets were easy. Exams were comprehensive. But I think the class could have been more exciting if it involved more musical listening homework or instrumental projects."
