    "Very tough.",
    "Good mid-to-advanced-level course on introductory statistical theory. Not directly applied or useful in any way, but good preparatory work for future econometrics or statistics courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because the material was interesting, well taught, and presented at a good pace.",
    "Definitely recommend.",
    "If you're interested in basic econometric theory this course is useful.",
    "Even if you think you have taken many Econometrics courses before, it's worth it to take Don Andrew's class.",
    "Recommend. Great background for econometric studies."

    "This course greatly improved my understanding of statistics.",

    "I thought I knew quite a few things about Econometrics before taking the course, but it turns out that I only knew the tip of the iceberg...",
    "Gives good econometric theory background. Does not help yet with applied research."
