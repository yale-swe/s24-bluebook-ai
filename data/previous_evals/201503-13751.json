    "If you're interested in hip\/hop, then absolutely. You'll learn a ton if you apply the lessons and knowledge.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "This class is the best. Reach out the Professor Conway early on if you want a spot in the class. The work is minimal, but you learn a ton. To put things into perspective, we spent the first class dissecting Nas albums.",
    "Recommended. Interesting and low-stress class. Your classmates will probably be very cool and thoughtful people. Nick is a wonderful guy. So kind and humble. Knowledgable. Supportive, especially insofar as he leaves the papers and projects up to interpretation, so that you can research and do work about stuff you're really interested in.",
    "YES. Speaking as a senior, it was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you are fortunate enough to get into the class, I would definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this class. The subject is interesting and the professor is really flexible, kind and willing to let the students guide the class and assignments based on what interests them. The workload is not bad and its a class that is actually fun to do the homework and assignments for. I love that Nick assigns a creative project, because its nice to be able to explore topics through a non-strictly analytical lens, especially when the subject is art. Also you don't have to come in with prior knowledge about hip hop to do well.",
    "Take it!",
    "Very manageable; gem of the courses offered at Yale.",
    "Getting credit to listen to music and sit around and talk with the coolest professor of all time? Yes please. It's essentially like a hip-hop book club where everyone just sits around and shares things they love and just chills. Dream class.",
    "Dope take it cuz it's dope.",
    "I would 100% recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Take it if you get in. Content is interesting, and professor is great. Friday afternoon timing is unfortunate, but the class is chill, so it was fine",
    "Yes, you'll find a lot of great new music and get to talk about the artists you already love. You'll also learn some interesting historical tidbits"
