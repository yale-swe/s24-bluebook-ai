    "Prof. Maripaz Garcia is a great professor. Funny, helpful, and the best prepared. She is a very fair grader. Only thing is that (with all Spanish L1 classes) you always have at least 80% of your classmates have at least 2 years of instruction (there were people in my class that had 4 years of Spanish prior to this who still managed to stay in L1). Pace is much, much faster than any other language class I've ever taken outside of Yale, but you will learn a lot. You will just have terrible grades compared to your classmates if you've never taken it before. Take it with Maripaz if you haven't changed your mind.",
    "It is difficult but an interesting language to learn. Takes a lot of effort, but well worth it.",
    "Very good, great language to take to satisfy your requirement.",
    "It's a wonderful introductory course and provides a solid Spanish base.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student! Spanish is a very useful language and you learn a lot in just this l1 course! the daily homework helps a lot as well!",
    "I found this class very stressful mainly because I had no prior knowledge of Spanish and the grading and quizzes were way too strictly graded. Because most people in the class already know some Spanish the you'll feel lost a lot at least during the first half of the course. I recommend taking a more interesting language in a less strict department.",
    "Fast paced course, but very engaging."
