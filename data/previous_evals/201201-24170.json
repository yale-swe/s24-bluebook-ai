    "Definitely take it. It was my favorite class of the semester even though I am not in the development track of Global Affairs. You will discover an approach to development that is very different from what is taught in the textbooks and core classes.",
    "Amazing class in which you learn about how business models are helping to provide development solutions around the world. Also, you get to go abroad (completely paid for by Yale) to study a social enterprise during the summer. Doesn't get much better than that. Guest speakers from different social enterprises and social investment funds visit the class, providing many different perspectives. Take this class! Just expect to spend a lot of time finding a social enterprise and liaising with them before you depart. The class doesn't have a lot of reading, but there is a lot of planning.",
    "I would definitely recommend GLBL 315. It is an opportunity unlike any other and Bo is a great professor. The reading is reasonable and interesting, lots of guest speakers, and you get to work on a really exciting project.",
    "Social enterprises has been a fantastic course so far. This course is a very unique one at Yale that combines both a theoretical and academic introduction to the field, exposure to prominent speakers in the field, encouragement to personally explore and contribute one's perspective to the field, and of-course, mandatory field work to really see the theories on the ground. There is really no other undergraduate course like it and I feel very lucky to be in the class. The speakers and weekly discussion are fantastic, and I am very much looking forward to the summer and fall.",
    "Course on social enterprises - i.e. a sustainable strategy for economic development - the bulk of the work is developing your own case study. You learn the most through the case study, not through the readings for the class.",
    "Great course and very different to most other courses at Yale. It teaches you real \"life skills.\" If you get in, definitely take it.",
    "Take this course for an incredible summer opportunity.",
    "As a class, no. I do not think I learnt as much as I could have this semester. However, I am very excited about my trip to Ghana next week and will be better able to assess the class when I finish my fall semester. In any case, the class itself has a lot to improve but the trip might make it worth it. You choose!",
    "Definitely take it. I learned a lot about social enterprises which is something I had never heard of before. It really widened my knowledge of development.",
    "Recommended. The first semester you learn about what a social enterprise is. During the summer you do a research project on a social enterprise of your choice. The next semester you write a case study about the social enterprise.",
    "Take it!Best class in the global affairs major, one of the best kept secrets at Yale"
