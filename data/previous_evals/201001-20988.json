    "I would definitely recommend it, since the material presented in class is very useful for the students of Italian literature. Futurism usually is a little bit neglected and Professor Larkin helped us to understand its importance also on a international level.",
    "I would recommend this course to a fellow student because it allows you to see different aspects of Futurism that are normally ignored by the critics.Thanks to this class and to Prof. Larkin I now have a completely different and more deep understanding of what Furturism is. I really enjoy working on it."
