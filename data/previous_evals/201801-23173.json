    "There were some technical difficulties in communication and explaining expectations, but it made a for a dynamic classroom environment.",
    "This course's strength derives in large part from Professor Wexler's erudition and her care for her students, which combine to make her a supreme educator. The only weakness I can think of is one of which I believe Professor Wexler is already aware, which is that the expectations for the final project (and the division between formed\/found\/forged family albums) could be somewhat clearer. I also think it could have been funand potentially generativefor us to present our album projects to our classmates sometime toward the end of the semester."

    "totally. a really enjoyable course that allows your to engage with topics and materials that many other courses take. the class was diverse in terms of academic backgrounds, but everyone's thoughts felt welcomed and added to the class in interesting ways.",
    "This course's strength derives in large part from Professor Wexler's erudition and her care for her students. She knows her stuff! Students with an interest in family photography, in visual culture, in social history, or in kinship studies should definitely considering enrolling. And the album project you complete at the end is so fun!"
