    "strength - lots of insight and interesting information that probably would not have been taught if it had not been from a professor that has so much experience in the areano weakness",
    "Course is not very structured. Many Presenters use the same slides over and over. Sometimes stories can be interesting but most of the time the class is dry.",
    "Strength: a new insight from the industry, different from academic research.",
    "Great course, that provides a lot of information not given in other classes.",
    "Great professor. Could have done without the expensive textbook.",
    "It's good that we had many guest lecturers from the industry",
    "This course was interesting. Dr. Makuch provides a lot of first hand experience. Some of the material is dense, which makes it hard to follow at times. Otherwise very useful informationmy favorite aspect of the course was having the opportunity to hear guest speakers. They were all very impressive individuals with a lot of experience in the field.",
    "It was really nice to have guest speakers; some are very knowledgeable and well-known in the field of regulatory affairs.The class is very laid-back. The workload was minimum, which was a plus for second years who were busy doing their thesis.I didn't feel like learning much from this class. Some of the information was mentioned multiple times.Most students showed no interest in the subject. They were too busy working on their computer during most of the class session. No one seemed to know anything when the professor or the guest speaker asked a question.",
    "useful",
    "I love the fact that this class is very useful and applicable for students interested in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry. The professor uses current news as cases in point to keep us updated on what is going on in the field. DIA is a great resource he suggested to us too. Also, I love all his speaker lectures.",
    "focus on the content. loose at the assignments. these are the good choices because the fda is not supposed to be taught like a hard science.",
    "The professor of this class was clearly knowledgeable and friendly, but the course was not structured well. The tests focused on miniscule details rather than big or general points, which I think is key for a intro to regulatory affairs class.",
    "Very good intro to regulatory affairs. Insightful guest speakers.",
    "Great experience.Interesting stories and useful knowledge."
