    "Lots of writing (I'll let you decide whether this is a strength or weakness), kind of a \"throw 'em in the deep end\" kind of class (also up to you whether that's good or bad)",
    "Strengths: Professor Rangappa was such a great professor; she's so knowledgeable about the subject and so willing to help when students have questions about cases and how law works in general. The separation of cases by different topics is so helpful as well.",
    "Strengths Asha is really engaging. The text can be dry, but shes lively and knowledgeable. Weakness more application. A simulation would be very cool in this class."

    "Yes! Very interesting material.",
    "If you have any interest in law, policy, or national security, definitely take this course! It's very approachable, and provides a great platform into thinking about topics through legal frameworks.",
    "Absolutely would recommend. Its fundamental to understanding national security and touches on crucial philosophical questions about right of the individual vs protection of the state.",
    "Yes. You will gain build legal analysis on the political issues, which are often missed in the political science classes. Also, it will be a great bridge to your academic endeavors if you are interested in applying a law school."
