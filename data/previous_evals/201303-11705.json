   "comments": [
    "This course overviews how topics like education, gender, gerrymandering, etc. relate to distribution of wealth and democracy. Basically, it explains why there is such a big gap in wealth between the rich and poor in America and what effects that gap of wealth has.",
    "I recommend this class if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at all interested in the material, with the caveat that you should be prepared for it to be more like a lecture than a seminar in terms of opportunities for participation. That being said, Shapiro and Graetz were both interesting to listen to and the readings were consistently engaging. And the final paper also gives you an opportunity to explore distributive politics in whatever area\/through whichever lens you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re most interested in, so I think the class offers a lot despite the relative lack of seminar participation.",
    "Everyone, regardless of their major, should take this class. The information is incredibly important and will necessarily change the way you think about almost every aspect of American society. Just be prepared to listen to and learn from the professors, and good luck getting a word in edgewise between them and the section a**holes.",
    "If you were a fan of the television series, The West Wing, you'll love this class (you'll probably love it even if you weren't a fan). It gives a great in-depth analysis of many issues in american law. Each class could be the focus of an entire course or even a career. In that sense, I wish we would have had more hours in class, but the time spent there was very interesting and worthwhile. Take it! One final research project, which is very self-directed and could become the beginning of a thesis. Lots of reading, but I enjoyed it.",
    "Democracy and Distribution was definitely a very interesting class, and was one that provided a broad survey of the various issues connected to the distribution of income and democratic systems. The breadth of material covered, and the diversity of perspectives this course offered were no doubt valuable, and the sessions taken individually were wonderfully insightful. However, one area where the course could be strengthened in future years concerns tying all that we learn back to a central idea or theme, or building towards some kind of finale. I often felt that the classes were seemingly disconnected from each other, and therefore, the course lacked a cumulative end purpose. Student participation was also low in these classes - unlike most seminars - but I was alright with that because the instructors generally had very interesting and insightful comments.",
    "Discussions between Professors Graetz and Shapiro on issues at the intersection of income inequality and politics, like race, gender, the estate tax. The seminar dynamic clearly changes from year to year but this time there was little discussion with students. Little feedback from professors too, and a lot of your grade depends on the term paper. Would recommend it only for the discussions and readings, so take it credit\/d if you must.",
    "I'd recommend it, it's very important material to learn. You might be able to tell from the syllabus that the course is much more econ\/policy focused, so people coming at the problems from a more philosophical\/theoretical approach won't be as comfortable with the material. The professors love to profess, and they are really really knowledgeable so you should cherish everything they say. However, class discussion suffered because no one could really add anything to their contributions. That being said, all of the guest lecturers were fantastic, and I always left class with many fascinating questions to ponder.",
    "I thought the syllabus was excellent and the list of readings was very interesting. There was definitely a reasonable amount of reading and the classis very doable. Seminar sessions aren't always discussion based but I actually loved it when Professors Graetz and Shapiro would just talk - every class was like watching them have a casual conversation about that week's topic. They are really really knowledgeable and it's actually really enjoyable to just sit back and listen to them talk about the issues. This class really helped me understand the issues we covered in a totally new light and framework. It's up to you to motivate yourself to do the reading and work on the research paper throughout the semester (the main assignment is just a large 20-25 page paper due at the end of the semester) but if you do, it will be very rewarding (at least it was for me). I'd recommend the class but take a look at the syllabus and make sure you're okay with seminars that don't involve a ton of discussion. In my opinion it's much better to hear people who know what they're talking about (as opposed to people who don't, which is usually your peers), especially ones that are as knowledgeable and interesting\/funny as these two professors."
