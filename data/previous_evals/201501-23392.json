   "comments": [
    "I think the professor is wonderful in his disposition to teach and assist students in any way possible. His kindness resonates with his willingness to help us out in any way possible to get through the course material. However, his teaching method is quite poor and it is difficult to pay attention and fully fathom his seminars. I wish I a better description of his teaching method, but unfortunately, it was very difficult to be honest.",
    "Xi is a very sweet man but he is not very good at explaining the complicated methods topics. His slides are also very dense and somewhat difficult to understand. He always seemed reluctant to have one on one TA times and also wanted to group them all together. Some students benefit from just having one on one time with the Professor.",
    "Professor Chen did an excellent job of teaching us applicable statistical concepts and tools in SAS for analyzing data. The pacing of the course was just right. I liked having separate lectures for the lab portion and having lab immediately after lecture.",
    "Strength: the contents are very applicable for policy students. Weakness: may be hard to understand without some background knowledge of econometrics.",
    "This class was really, really badly taught. I cannot emphasize enough how awful lectures were - Xi does not present or explain concepts clearly. For me, after attending the first few lectures, coming to class started to seem pointless. I learned the material instead by going to SAS lab and office hours, and was able to scrape by on the problem sets and quizzes. All in all, a missed opportunity -- the course material is super important to policy students, but it feels like I'm coming out of this class having learned almost nothing.",
    "Great way to get us working with SAS in more than a one question at a time way. Gained a lot more perspective on the basics to consider when developing data analysis. The quiz format and preparation is encouraging and allows us to spend time actually thinking and learning the material rather than memorizing to the test. Appreciated working with a previous data set opposed to trying to collect our own!",
    "Strength: Teacher is knowledgeable about subject matter and is very nice. Weakness: Teacher speaks in broken english and with a heavy accent making him very hard to understand. The SAS is taught very poorly.",
    "I thought the course balanced modeling\/statistical theory with practical applications, and I found it to be a helpful way to learn more about SAS and running basic regressions. As for weaknesses, I thought the suggested reading was overly technical, and people may have gotten more out of the class if it were divided over two days per week, instead of one.",
    "Strengths - Applicable to working in healthcare, useful knowing how to run regressions and how to interpret them, enjoyed learning the significance of different statistical methods Weaknesses - sometimes it was difficult to follow along due to the technical nature of the material",
    "Weakness: a bit dry Strength: lots of help during lab sessions and office hours",
    "Don't necessarily feel that this class adds a ton of value for HCM students and a course focused on interpreting data and findings would be more valuable for those students rather than learning SAS, overall class attendance was quite low and slides could be improved.",
    "I really hated this course. It was confusing and really simple all at the same time. It was really hard to follow along in lecture which made the assignments really difficult.",
    "The material was difficult to understand and I do not feel like it was explained very well.",
    "the content is very good. for the future course, I think it can illustrate more deeply into the course, not just the overall review.",
    "This course was sometimes confusing as to what the goals were. This could have been improved if classes were smaller and taught in SAS lab. This class had too much time in lecture and not enough time learning skills through use.",
    "Strengths: the project to learn SAS and interpret the results. Also gives the students an ability to stay engaged with a project and subject that they're interested in. Weaknesses: some students are not as familiar with statistics\/math speak.",
    "The labs are very helpful to learn the material. They are generally clear and capture what we need to know for the test. The grading on the labs seems arbitrary- I could meet with the TAs and go through each of the answers I got from SAS, have them tell me that everything is correct, then get a 3\/4. The lectures are difficult to follow. The powerpoint slides could be improved by putting more text about the actual method for running certain regressions\/etc, rather than more equations and more math.",
    "Strengths: This course gave a broad overview of a number of methods that could be used in research. I think importantly, this class allowed me to build upon my SAS skills. I honestly left Biostatistics not feeling great about SAS, but the labs\/final project in this class really helped me to build on these skills. Weaknesses: Every week we were presented with a new topic. Sometimes I wish we had more time to cover certain topics, so we could understand them in greater depth.",
    "Good course. Lab sessions are very useful and allow students to get familiar with SAS. Lectures could be more dynamic",
    "The content in this class is difficult to comprehend when you've never had exposure to it. I wish there was an easier to learn this information, but overall, I think Dr. Chen has structured the class in a good way.",
    "I enjoyed the course. It was often difficult to follow, but after reviewing the slides after class, I understood the vast majority of the material.",
    "Strength: very good overview of analytic methods used in health policy.",
    "This course could be taught in a more organized way. I also think it needs to focus on using STATA - I have found more jobs asking us to know STATA than SAS in my job search. The course itself isn't bad, and is a good way to learn some statistical skills that are more applied for policy research, it just seems a bit helter-skelter in terms of organization.",
    "It's unreasonable that this is a requirement for policy and management. Many of us will not use SAS or complete independent research in our later work. Also, the class was not described as Econometrics, but in reality it is very much that. The class moved extremely quickly and most of us felt behind by February.",
    "A very necessary statistics course for health research students.",
    "Weaknesses: - more emphasis on mathematical underpinnings of regression analysis in class would be helpful. Texts assigned were not useful on this front. - More emphasis on model selection would be useful. Strengths - interesting lectures. I appreciate the diverse and relevant examples of real-world application of course concepts. - course material was very useful and transferrable to situations outside the course.",
    "This class was a mixed bag to me. The lectures seemed so long and hard to follow, but after doing the homeworks and studying for the tests, things made a lot more sense. Dr. Chen really tries to explain things in depth and give examples of the concepts. The struggle is that it is such a long day\/session that staying engaged is hard. Any ways to do that or break apart the 2 hour lecture would be good. Having notes for the quizzes too is a great help to understanding how the concepts work with the resources you would have available in the real world.",
    "Strengths: great and useful material covered, SAS labs\/homework, group project is great idea too Weaknesses: a more structured textbook\/reading materials to help put concepts in context",
    "Professor Xi is great but the course itself isn't structured well. Teaching SAS via powerpoint is not effective. Having smaller labs would be better and more helpful. Have weekly assignments related to the reading. Don't have section right after class - it's too long and the class loses focus.",
    "A key strength of the course is the final paper which requires students to synthesize a health services research paper as a final paper. This \"capstone\" helped me to fully deploy the course learnings whilst still taking the course.",
    "Bland. Recommend switching the class from the large lecture format to smaller sections in a computer labs. The lengthy presentations of dense text become a blur after a while."

    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0See above",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very sweet man but sometimes hard to understand and has a hard time clearly breaking down a topic",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is the most responsive, helpful professor, sending back responses to any question emailed to him within a matter of minutes.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very nice, patient and responsible!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0See above: not good as a lecturer, but pretty good in smaller settings (i.e. office hours, SAS lab).",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Great professor. Very accommodating and available to answer questions. Organized slides. Keeps things simple where others might have gone into too many complexities and confused us. His slides are always organized and he reviews the previous week's materials before beginning the next week's, so you are always on the same page. He tells you exactly what you need to understand to complete the course successfully, but also provides plenty of resources for those who what to take there skills a step further.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He's smart and capable but he needs to improve his presentations.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Incredibly knowledgeable and helpful at answering questions in class. In the future, I would suggest that Professor Xi spend a little more time giving the class a conceptual overview of what different modeling procedures are actually doing. Often, he focuses more on the pure math behind what's going on, which is necessary and helpful, but again some conceptual context would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths - Very knowledgable of the material, flexible with office hours Weaknesses - sometimes difficult to understand Suggested Improvements - presenting material in an easier to understand format could help students with the learning process",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very knowledgeable and accessible.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0approachable and cares deeply about his students understanding of the material",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He is so nice and really willing to help students and answer questions. Really responsive. But he doesn't really answer questions well. I would ask a question and then have 3 more questions after receiving his response",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen is an amazing gentlemen and a person that I feel the whole class appreciated. I feel that he makes the material much more approachable and understandable than many of us experienced in BIS 505A. To help further improve this, if there could be a way to \"break-up\" the lecture in some way, I think it would be helpful. This could come in the form of a quick 5-minute break, use of videos to illustrate the concepts (this may be difficult), or discussion, that would be great.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0The course design is very good.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: Truly cares about the students and wants students to learn. Giving the students a cheat sheet truly helps students try and solidify the information that they learned. Being flexible in the office hours was very helpful. Weaknesses: Sometimes Professor Chen teaches the material in a very scientific and mathematical way such that some students do not understand. Though, this may be due to the fault of the students not paying attention.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen is responsive to students and seems to really understand the material. He is passionate about the material and gives good examples during class and on the labs. He can be difficult to understand at times, but is generally very helpful and willing to put in time with students to help them understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0I went to Professor Chen's office hours pretty frequently for questions on our labs\/final project and he was extremely helpful!",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Good teacher. He masters every concept. He could make classes more engaging for students",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Difficult to understand sometimes but always willing to help.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Professor Chen genuinely enjoys teaching students. This is more than one can say for some other professors. He is passionate about sharing his knowledge with students and willing to go the extra mile to ensure students really understand what they are learning.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Good professor. A little hard to understand sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0He's very nice, approachable and helpful. It was sometimes difficult to understand him during lectures, and he didn't always seems to answer student questions fully. But he was very helpful during office hours and lab.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Strengths: willing to help students, flexible with student appointments, great at explaining concepts students have difficult time understanding. Weaknesses: I personally do not think this, but it has been discussed among students that some of them had a hard time understanding Professor Chen during lectures. I can relate to these students, but I can also relate to Professor Chen as a former ESL student. If language\/comprehension issues come up in other students' course evaluations, I hope they do not affect Professor Chen's ability to teach and\/or his qualifications as a great professor.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Dr. Chen really cares about the material and about students learning it. His lectures can be a little dry, but his effort is phenomenal. I think we have the right professor for the class, it just needs to be honed in a bit more to make the course run more smoothly.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Nice man, helpful in office hours, moved through material too quickly in class.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very considerate and VERY responsive to students' questions. Even on a Sunday night. The language barrier could be an issue during his lectures, making them dry and a little hard to follow. He weaves the content in a very well organized manner - maybe more effort to engage the students during lectures next year.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Weakness: -midterm questions were sometimes not clear. Strength - professor was extremely knowledgable about the subject matter, and was approachable and responsive to questions.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Aside from being an all around good guy, Dr. Chen is very intelligent. The challenge with this class is the dry material, so any way to break that up would be best. Less time in lecture and more time in lab could be better.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0A very lovely professor, however, a bit difficult to understand at times and not very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Very knowledgable. Kind and responsive to students. Primary complaint is the structure - don't teach SAS via slides. Talking in variables is not salient for students. Break up the sections more.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0Xi is the only YSPH professor that I know who shows up in the SAS lab to assist his students. He was always willing to help his students do well and master the course content.",
    "Instructor: Xi Chen \u00a0There's unfortunately a disconnect between the material, the instructor, and the classroom. The instructor is clearly enthusiastic about the material, but he tends to leave his audience behind in terms of foundation. Statistical modeling without some instinctive short-cut summaries of what's going on is unfortunately quite a bit of drag in the classroom. Moving to the computer lab for the practical component definitely facilitated more learning."

    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "Great intro to modeling and regression. Also, it was a very helpful way of learning how to program in SAS, more so than the YSPH intro to biostats class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is looking to learn more about statistical analysis and how to interpret large datasets within the healthcare industry.",
    "Required don't recommend for HCM student. Wish we could do something similar but instead learn it using Excel because those skills are more useful than SAS. Biostats is enough SAS.",
    "I really would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "I recommend this course to other student.",

    "I guess. It's not the best way to learn research methods, but it's okay.",
    "This is a good course to take to further our understanding in health services research. It is necessary in our careers to know how to read and interpret research data, as well as how those research methods are designed and conducted. Overall, a worthwhile course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning about different methods used to evaluate health policy. I found this course very useful.",

    "This is one of the tougher HPM requirements to get through. It is very possible to do well if you do the work required and spend some time with the material.",
    "Helps build analytical\/statistical skills - essential for any research with data in public health (almost anything in public health)",
    "An important course but I think the structure of the class needs to be changed in order for it to be effective. The current structure is fine for those that have knowledge in the area and can build off of it (they got 100's on the final) and for the rest of us we've never seen this before and are lost. Should perhaps be taught after more biostats courses.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It teaches regression from an applications perspective (health services).",
    "This class if unfortunately ungodly boring during the classroom component, but required. Having a group that does not try to drop off the face of the planet before the paper deadline does help the experience."
