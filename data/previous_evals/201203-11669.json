    "Literary Chinese is hard. For example, you may have a sentence that says either \"Confucius fed a horse\" or \"Confucius ate a horse,\" but after you get to class you find out the real meaning of the sentence is \"Emperor Palpatine benevolently uses the force to destroy the Jedi.\"It takes a lot of work, but by the end of the semester I could read really cool passages that have had a lot of influence in the Chinese literary tradition. Plus, some stories we read are simply awesome. From kings lacquering heads of their opponents and using them as cups to Mencius' Mother, they're really colorful.A problem is that everyone in the class comes in with different backgrounds\/Chinese levels, and I always felt like it took me longer to understand things, but that problem is in any higher level Chinese class.Professor Hunter is great. He's got a biting sense of humor that made each class pretty interesting.If you're used to the easy going upper level Chinese classes and just want to keep going forward, don't take it, but if you have a strong interest in reading important texts, do it.",
    "The chosen textbook gives us good material with which to start learning \u00e6\u0096\u0087\u00e8\u00a8\u0080, and Dr. Hunter is a great teacher. What more could there be? Dr. Hunter is well-versed and committed to engaging each student with the material. He will force you to think, not just memorize characters. I'm so glad that I began my study of \u00e6\u0096\u0087\u00e8\u00a8\u0080 with this professor!"
