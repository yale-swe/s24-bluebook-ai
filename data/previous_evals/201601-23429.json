    "This was a great course and one of the more interesting courses I have taken at YSPH.",
    "Covers a good breadth of topics and the guest lectures were a great showcase of applying methods taught in the course, but the methods lectures themselves were sometimes awkward and adapting codes for new datasets was not always well-explained",
    "This course was one of my favorites of the Semester. The professor had multiple course evaluations during the semester and really incorporated all of our ideas into the class.",
    "I'd like the code given as starting point for homework to be better organized and better documented. I'd like feedback on in-class presentations.",
    "Very important course that will build students' skills in surveillance and critical thinking.",
    "I enjoyed it for the most part. The topics we covered covered a decent breadth and were interesting. However, sometimes I felt I wasn't sure of how to apply the skills or concepts we were learning in real life. The lectures were often concentrated enough on one case study that it made it challenging to see the larger point.",
    "This class fills a nice that no other public health school class does. The skills and concepts you learn are critical to public health practice.",
    "This course was a great introduction to public health surveillance, and important methods and modeling techniques. My only critique is that it would have been nice if the lab sections were held in a computer lab, to make it easier to follow along with the SAS code."

    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is the perfect combination of knowledgeable and relatable. I felt like I was learning surveillance from an expert and really enjoyed hearing him lecture.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Very knowledgeable and great at addressing student questions, was accessible outside of class and offered useful feedback",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is the best. He was really open to all of our suggestions about how to improve the course. His methods lectures were very informative but sometimes he went through them very quickly. However, he always provided annotated code after class, which made it easier to go through and review after class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is a great teacher! very knowledgeable and willing to help!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Very kind and knowledgable of the topic. I think the material should be a bit more accessible to students as sometimes it was bit complex to understand. The methods sections also moved a bit fast. Very helpful overall and was always available to answer questions and help students.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Professor Weinberger is did a good job with the class. His lectures were organized, but sometimes lacked passion\/ variability to make it more interesting. He was very nice though and willing to answer questions \/ help people if they were having trouble.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Professor Weinberger is a wonderful professor that is able to introduce and clearly explain complex concepts while making it engaging. His personality makes a very enjoyable and comfortable classroom experience while still pushing you to master the material.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Martin Weinberger \u00a0Dan is extremely knowledgeable about surveillance and modeling techniques, and always provides helpful feedback in response to questions."

   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in surveillance epidemiology or want to learn analytical skills regarding detecting trends\/aberrations in data, I would highly recommend this course. I am not in the infectious disease program yet still found a lot of value in the course.",
    "Recommend for a thorough overview of surveillance methods but not if you're looking for a methods-heavy course",
    "The class is really well organized and well taught. I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in surveillance, not just from an infectious disease standpoint.",
    "This course was the best class I had this semester. The speakers who came into the class were all very versatile and were able to each bring great information to the course. Dan was also a great instructor and the combination of Dan and Joe teaching was very enjoyable. They complimented each other well in that they could fill in any gaps for each other when\/ if they weren't sure about a certain topic. The course was also very well rounded in that it covered many different aspects of public health surveillance. The coding can be a little difficult but both Dan and Joe are very helpful, responsive and open and always available to assist. I recommend this course to everyone in the school of public health. Even though the course is on public health surveillance, some of the techniques that you learn can be applied to many different fields\/ areas.",
    "Take this class if you need to understand the challenges of time-based data in public health (such as disease incidence trends), and cope with those challenges.",
    "This is great class to build skills, learn about, and apply methods in public health surveillance.",
    "This class good, but not great. You learn some skills for surveillance, but I wouldn't say I left the class with a new tool set that I had mastered - more that I know more about the possibilities of the types of analyses that can be done. The lectures were pretty dull for the most case. Professor Weinberger is very nice but not a dynamic lecturer.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student interested in learning how to clean and analyze surveillance data."
