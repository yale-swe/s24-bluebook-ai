    "I would highly recommend this class if you have some interest in the topic. There is a fair amount of reading for the class, but you will definitely gain a lot from keeping up with. Professor Kocher is a great professor, and is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic. If you really want to take advantage of the course and all that it has to offer, I would highly recommend meeting with him during the course of the class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to read good books and talk about them with an engaging professor.",
    "This is an amazing class for anyone interested in learning about political theory of nationalism and ethnicity. The class is structured around theory that is then illustrated by case studies, rather than examining case studies and then applying theory to them. The workload is not too great: a book a week (but only specific chapters), with four memos and a final paper. The readings are probably the best ones I have been assigned in a Political Science class at Yale thus far. Although Prof. Kocher may seem a bit intimidating at first, he is a really nice guy and a great discussion leader. The class does have a very specific focus, so make sure that you like the topic. If so, you cannot go wrong with this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in nationalism. Ethnicity does not get discussed until much later and happens so very briefly. The readings are extremely interesting and change the way one thinks about state-building and world politics. I would advise choosing the course, though, when there are a decent number of people enrolled in the course, since it is a seminar and 2 hours is an awkwardly long time."
