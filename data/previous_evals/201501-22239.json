    "The year-long project is worth it.",

    "Tough but worthwhile",
    "The course was necessary for completion of my HSHM senior thesis. It was not a course that met in a classroom with a professor, but rather, more of an independent study sort of course. I arranged to meet with my adviser on an as-per-necessary basis."
