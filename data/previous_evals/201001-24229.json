    "This is a very good introductory course for biomedical engineering. I think it gives a brief overview of what biomedical engineers do and what they study. It helps potential BME majors see if they actually want to major in biomedical engineering, so if you think you might be interested in pursuing that major, this is the class for you. Also, the lectures were straight repetition of the textbook for the course, so you don't really need to go to all of them. There wasn't that much homework (a short problem set each week) and it was an interesting course.",
    "This course is definitely a good one to take if you are considering BME as a major. If not, another science class would be better to take because this course dives into a few intense topics pretty quickly, but as a future BME major it really helped me develop a passion for the subject and realize the incredible things going on right now in the field. We had great guest lecturers who told us about research opportunities, and it really helped me to see the full extent of what the BME program has to offer here at Yale.",
    "Take it.",
    "Yes. You will not feel dirty for having taken a gut and suddenly you'll feel like you actually know something about all those articles in the Science Times. This class fives you literacy for the future of medicine.",
    "BENG's strengths and weaknesses are both derived from it's attempted discussion of the entire field of BME in one semester. The information covered can be brilliantly interesting, but at the same time, after completing the entire semester I feel like I only know a few topics at a strong level of competency.Professor Saltzman is caring, genuine, and affable. He cares for his students. At the beginning of the semester, he took careful time to learn each of his student's names, which I feel to be an wonderful sign of commitment and courtesy not afforded by manyof Yale's science professors.I thoroughly enjoyed many of the activities in section, and I enjoyed the no-pressure feeling that came along with it (unlike most labs which are graded harshly). I do feel that several of the activities were trivial (e.g. the skittle activity) but on the whole I found the experience very much worthwhile.",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are a biomedical engineering major or are strongly considering the major and have a strong science background. The class is advertised for non-science majors, but it is not designed that way. The problem sets require physics and biochemistry skills that are not taught in class or in the textbook.",
    "Yes. It is a great class.",
    "No. Though the lectures in the latter half of the course are interesting, the course is more of a pain than it's worth. Saltzman is a great lecturer and nice guy, but his textbook problems are often poorly worded and leave out necessary variables to solve, making it necessary to visit TFs even if you more or less understand the material. Also, the final paper is graded by your peers- take that as you will.",
    "It is an intro course about BME topics. I would recommend it to people who do not want to major in science, though.",
    "Strengths: Professor Saltzman's lecturing style and accessibility, the TAs helpfulness, section (informative and low-stress)Weaknesses: problem sets aren't related to the lectures or to the tests, the tests are much more demanding (in terms of breadth and depth of memorization required than one would expect, given the level of detail in lecture)I would recommend the class with hesitation -- the tests are very demanding and the problems sets are not especially relevant (the are much more math-y than the lectures and tests), which is annoying when they are so time-consuming.",
    "Good course opining up your experience to BME. Worth taking for anyone.",
    "I think it is not as much as a freshman intro class as it is a non-science major survey class of the field. Since biomedical is a relatively new and still evolving field, which I think sort of explains why the course isn't structured that well. For example, compared to an intro to philosophy class or something, there just isn't an established way to organize BME. It wasn't really the order of topics, but more so the the format of the course. Such a huge part of the first midterm was about cellular and physiological principles, which was pretty much completely review if you have taken AP bio, and maybe a tiny chem or physics. The p-sets were not very helpful in understanding material, since they covered the \"math\" portion of the course. Often, I was convinced that they didn't even really make sense, and there could not be right answers. I suppose the material could be very interesting, especially to someone who does not have a background in it. However, as a probable-science major and someone who took all the science APs in high school. The class was boring and not very rewarding. The sections were sort of worthless, although fun at times. The class is very accessible, as shown by the seniors in our class who have likely never taken a science class, but probably enjoyed the course. I also think that peer-grading of the final papers is not the most ideal way to have papers graded. Ultimately, the professor assigns your paper a letter grade, but that is heavily based on the peer evaluations and peer grades. For example, I realized afterward, that I might have graded on a harsher scale, relative to how everyone else graded.",
    "YES!!!! Great course! It was well taught and the sections really complemented the course! Great for science majors and non-science majors alike!!!!",
    "If you are interested in the field you should definitely take it"
