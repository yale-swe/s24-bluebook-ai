   "comments": [
    "Some ideas about how to organize a museum exhibition",
    "This class helped me to think critically about museum collections and their displays. Further, this course provided me with new insights on how collections are built and objects acquired. I also learned more about Ancient American cultures, their worldviews, and their artistic production. This course also gave me the chance to interact with objects through handling them.",
    "In this course I learned so much about writing for the museum. I not only learned about ancient American art, but also engaged with intensive research and writing. Although we only ever wrote up to 500 words, Professor Miller definitely emphasized editing for clarity. I believe this is a skill that is useful in future courses. I know how to better condense information to write clear and concise paragraphs that have all the information a person with no background would need to know.",
    "I learned how to cater my writing to wider audience. My ability to synthesize my thoughts into cohesive arguments grew tremendously. I also learned how to read objects like academic articles and feel more comfortable working with and using an array of sources, be they images or articles, in my own research.",
    "I learned of the art of the Ancient americas, particularly focusing on the Olmecs, Aztecs, and Mayas. This course taught me of their art in addition to its presentation in museum collections. Through assignments, I better learned how to write for an exhibition style presentation of art.",
    "First off I learned how to closely examine ancient American objects, a skill that can be extended to examination of other objects. The gap in my knowledge of Spanish America was filled, that of the pre-colonial period aside from basic knowledge of the Olmec, the Maya, and the Aztec. I touched ancient objects and did whole projects on Moche vessels and Aztec featherwork, two topics about which I never thought I would learn anything. I learned how to appreciate a whole new field, art history, and as a first-time art history class taker and YUAG gallery visitor, I discovered a new thrill in studying the art of the ancient Americas. My ideas of writing also vastly changed - writing for the public was a brand new skill for me in this course, and I learned how to make every word count.",
    "I learned about the art of Ancient America. I also learned about creating museum exhibits. I learned about the challenges reconciling a western viewpoint with non-western art. I also learned about the need for and conditions under which art restitution occurs.",
    "This course provided an effective survey covering Olmec, Teotihuacan, Aztec, Maya, and Andean art. I also came away with a greater appreciation for the curation, collection, and preservation process."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Mary Miller is a legend in her field and a very dedicated instructor. It was a good opportunity to be able to use the YUAG's resources and go to New York with her. Having said that, dedicated interaction does not necessarily translate into good instruction, and there were a number of structural problems with the class which could be improved upon: 1. the class operated on too many tracks: it was at once an introduction to Ancient American Art, an exploration of museum studies (public humanities), and a seminar in writing for a public audience. As a result it was unfocused and lacked scaffolding. 2. the class had too diverse a group -- students with ZERO background in the area, grad students, undergrad majors. As a consequence, I didn't always feel we were always on the same page in the class. 3. Professor Miller was great at offering ideas for the assignments, but less effective at providing feedback: all I felt I learnt was that I shouldn't use the passive voice. Nevertheless, I want to put on record the fact that I think Professor Miller is a great person. Perhaps she was the main attraction of the class -- being able to observe a great mind (if also a flawed mind) up close.",
    "This class was wonderfully taught and incredibly engaging. Professor Miller made herself very accessible to students, and she cared deeply about each student's engagement with the class. She created a positive classroom experience and encouraged students to ask questions and think critically. A fantastic class! I would have benefitted from more background information (dates, locations, significant events..) on the cultures studied to help put the course materials in perspective. The grading of written work was a bit harsh. Also, the directions on assignments could have been more clearly communicated. That being said, Professor Miller was always happy to meet with students and answer any questions.",
    "The course was a bit disorganized and I often found that the expectations for assignments were unclear. But, the course was also very dynamic in that we had guest speakers, presentations, objects, and museum visits. I was always engaged.",
    "This course is strong because it is well taught, has a passionate class of students, and directly engages with objects. One way this course could be improved is to provide a grading breakdown earlier in the course so that students better understand expectations. I would also ask for clearer instructions regarding certain assignments since some assignment instructions were somewhat vague.",
    "Strengths: Firsthand encounters with objects. Working in the Gallery throughout the semester (how lucky we were to have the ancient Andean textiles on display this semester!) instead of being cramped inside the classroom all the time. GREAT feedback on all assignments from Prof. Miller and Andrew (our postdoc), who were always responsive to anything you needed, either by email or in office hours. Fun vibe throughout the semester - this is serious study, but it's not at all dry. Weaknesses: Some weeks the readings didn't seem relevant to the seminar. Discussion sometimes felt tedious, that it would be better if Prof. Miller and Andrew jumped in and took over instead of having us guessing for way too long.",
    "The strengths were Professor Miller's knowledge and love for the art, and our \"hands-on\" interaction with it in the gallery classrooms. The main weakness was that I found not all assignments were clear, but Professor Miller made herself available to clarify and aid us in our writing.",
    "Strengths: opportunity to work closely with objects from our collections, as well as be guided by one of the top scholars in the field in Prof. Miller Weaknesses: slightly disorganized in terms of the topics we covered; it would be nice if each week led more naturally to the next week"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "No, not really unless you have background in Ancient American Art.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who doesn't mind a class with not a ton of structure.",
    "I definitely would recommend this as you learn so much about the ancient American world. Before this, I knew very little about Maya, Inca, Olmec, etc. but now I feel I got an in depth view of these cultures. I was surprised at how much I learned and knew at the end of this course.",
    "This course is very challenging in nontraditional ways. You have to tailor your writing to be accessible to a wider audience, which is a very important skill. If you take this course, you will learn how to work with actual materials and objects, which is a tremendous pleasure--one that you might not get again. Take this class, if not for this reason alone.",
    "I would recommend this course because the material is extremely interesting, you literally get to handle ancient objects, and the professor is extremely knowledgeable. I would say though that the professor has high expectations regarding writing, and the assignments are short exhibit pieces so they are inherently difficult to write. Be prepared to improve as a writer if you take this course. Overall, it was a wonderful experience.",
    "Absolutely. You're not going to get to touch ancient Moche vessels or Olmec bird heads anywhere else (yes, touch, firsthand, up close and personal in class, a backstage look at the YUAG). The course will push you to work a lot outside of class (say hello to Haas, your new study spot), but the effort is worth the wonderful discussions in class. Each week there is something new to discuss and something new to see. The course is totally accessible if you have no knowledge of the region or of art history. Mary Miller will make sure that everyone is on the same page each week, and she is a true gem to listen to and talk with each week.",
    "I think this is a wonderful course for anyone who has an interest in Ancient American art, and museums and exhibitions, regardless of their prior experience in these subjects.",
    "Yes! Miller is an amazingly passionate professor, and as a student you get to explore pieces of the YUAG, touch them, study them...amazing for anyone interested in museology.",
    "Yes! The course is a unique opportunity to take a art history class that also draws from anthropology and archaeology with one of the greatest scholars in the field."
