    "Microbio lab is a lot like genetics lab, but much better. There are only 4 reports throughout the semester, and they're based on multi-week experiments. The labs are generally fun and always informative. Generally, the spend a fair bit of time discussing the medical applications of the techniques learned, which is great for a class that's 99% premed. Overall it's a solid choice for your second bio class for the major or for premed.",
    "Yes, one of the better bio labs i have taken so far.",
    "great lab. take it",
    "Yes. Do it; it's an easy, interesting, and rewarding lab.",
    "This is a good biology lab. The labs are actually pretty interesting and sometimes fun, and they don't usually go too long, especially towards the end. The assignments aren't too bad, although the grading is a bit nitpicky. I would definitely recommend this lab.",
    "If you can take this course, definitely do. It's by far the best lab I've taken at Yale. Professor Dawson is nice, and the work isn't too bad. All of the experiments are also very interesting and relevant for actual biology research.",
    "A lab that was really fun to be in (cool experiments) and really not fun to be registered in (vague lab reports and arbitrary grading). Hopefully they'll fix what's wrong and let the great experiments that Dawson has designed shine through.",
    "I would recommend it if you need a lab credit. Labs usually don't go past 5. Workload is ok, but sometimes the grading is rather arbitrary to create stratification.",
    "Yes, it's a fun complement to the course.",
    "I highly recommend this course. Doable assignments of reasonable length and interesting material.",
    "Good lab course. Not too much work, but not incredibly boring, either. Pretty similar to genetics lab, but I think easier, especially if you've already taken genetics lab and know what to expect.",
    "This is a pretty good lab class that covers very interesting lab techniques. You learn staining, identification, etc. very well. You also work with a lot of different bacteria. But the grading is rather arbitrary.",
    "It's a great course I would recommend it. You get to learn things that you can apply in real life, conduct experiments that bacteriologists actually conduct, and apply many things you learn in microbiology course. Also, the grading is fair and quizzes, etc. are straighforward."
