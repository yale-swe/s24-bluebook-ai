    "What a great course! You will go through all of the grammar for the first half of the course, and in the second half, you will translate short stories, poems, etc. We learned a ton about Yiddish culture, literature, and history. I genuinely looked forward to this class all week!",
    "TOTALLY PHENOMENAL CLASS; if you have any interest in Yiddish at all, definitely take it. It's incredible what we were able to translate only a few weeks in!",
    "Great introduction to Yiddish! A nice review of literature and poetry and provides great insight into Yiddish culture. Was a bit more linguistic than anticipated but a wonderful class with a great professor nonetheless. Take it!"
