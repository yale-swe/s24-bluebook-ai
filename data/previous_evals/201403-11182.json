    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class to another student unless they freakin love political philosophy and YPU-style philosophical discussions. The class was like a half normal people, and half people who whisper sweet nothings to their intimates about Kant in their free time. You can probably do better than this class. (Though, in fairness, this was it's first year, so it may be better next year.)",
