   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Series of small deadlines helps keep projects on track. One thing I especially liked: asking us to come up with three topics in August\/September took the pressure off trying to come up with a single perfect project. Weaknesses: I thought the course was designed very well up through the November proposal. However, being asked to turn in yet another proposal in December, when I did not receive any feedback on my first proposal, was slightly frustrating. I might have responded better to a request for a \"progress report and plan for December and January\"",
    "Strengths: good structure around the research process. Weakness: the only real mistake was that one class where we accidentally spent the whole time on individual project updates.",
    "This course could be strengthened if we got more detailed feedback about our literature review, research design and proposal draft. While the adviser is supposed to provide guidance and advice, it would have been great to get Professor De La O and Stokes' feedback on these documents.",
    "Strength: We all come out with a paper draft Weakness: The process of research and writing is very different across sub-fields so it is difficult to standardize a curriculum. We can end up accidentally leaving too many people behind, or doing some students more harm than good. Improvement: I really like the structure, but I would recommend that professors defer more judgement to project advisers, especially on projects outside of their primary substantive and methodological expertise. This class should also have two leaders with different primary substantive and methodological expertise. Speaking of diverse perspectives, there are 39 tenure track Yale political science faculty listed on our website and we have two professors who have both already taught core grad classes to our cohort. I haven't even met all of our professors, and many of us have had three classes with professor Stokes. In the future, I would highly recommend exposing students to more of our large community through course requirements.",
    "May need to be flexible across students, some of whom may be behind or ahead of the average student in the course.",
    "While it was good to have semi-frequent deadlines to keep the work on track and ensure the receipt of feedback along the way, I think it would be better to have less structured assignments (e.g., allowing one to turn in the portion of the paper drafted thus far in place of an updated research proposal, or to perform and report initial data analysis in place of an updated lit review) so that these deadlines can fit better into each person's work style\/type of project. Additionally, I didn't find the project updates in the full class sessions to be very helpful - it's hard to get\/give useful feedback based on only a brief project summary so I think time in the full class sessions (as opposed to the small groups\/the days we split into two smaller classes) would be better used discussing the publishing process in more detail. While we did have one day about publications, we didn't spend the full class session on the topic and I think the extra time would be very useful.",
    "I am very glad to have a schedule with due dates and deadlines to keep me on track to finish this article. However, I received very little feedback from the professors during the semester. I did not receive comments on the research statement or the first draft of the research proposal. Because I didn't receive any feedback, I had trouble revising my proposal, and completing the assignments felt like checking boxes rather than substantive progress on the project."

    "An essential first exercise in getting your hands dirty with your own research.",
