    "I didnt learn much of anything",
    "None. I learned nothing.",
    "I think that this class taught me a good deal about the basics of Calculus with a focus on limits, derivatives, and integrals. This course provided an overall fundamentally sound basis for calculus.",
    "I learned how to calculate derivatives and the basics of infegrals.",
    "In this class, I cemented my past experience with calculus. Before this class, I thought I had a good knowledge of Calculus, but I realized that many of the foundations of calculus I had not yet learned.",
    "Not many bc I had already learned this math and accidentally enrolled in the wrong lvl. But I think calculus gives us a good understanding of how to think about problems and learn gumption when we r stuck to solve them.",
    "I learned about limits and integrals, including new ways to evaluate them.",
    "Probably should have a calc background before taking this course.",
    "How to understand functions.",
    "I learned a few things about calculus 1.",
    "I learned a variety of theorems in calculus and the underlying concepts behind key topics in introductory calculus, from evaluating the slope of a curve at a given point to understanding how the area beneath a curve can be determined using Riemann sums.",
    "It basically helped me refresh my understanding of Calculus AB.",
    "This math course allowed me to learn calculus concepts, as well as expanded my knowledge in terms of how I study for math as well as being able to know how to relate things to math.",
    "I learned about basic calculus concepts such as limits, derivatives and antiderivatives.",
    "Pre calculus concepts",
    "Learned all about derivatives and beginning of integrals. Very heavy on knowledge of theorems and why calculations are the way they are.",
    "I acquired knowledge about derivatives and integral calculus and how to implement that knowledge."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Good course if my teacher would have actually taught the course well",
    "There are no strengths to this course. Everything about this class is wrong. Instead of teaching us calculus and how to do problems, the entirety of the class is based on how equations were derived 400 years ago. We never learn how to apply anything taught in class. We waste 50 minutes every other day on where these equations came from rather than learning how to do the problems. 90% of my notes were completely useless when it came to studying for tests or doing problem sets. This class is more geared towards math theory rather than application. This makes for quite the challenge when given a question where we learned the very basic first step and the rest you have to figure out on your own. It's like learning addition for the first time by having a teacher explain how the concept of addition was derived for 45 minutes and then having 2+2=4 be written on the board. After learning the most basic version of that problem, you're given the hardest possible version that any could ever come up and are expected to just pull it off on your own. The problem sets are unnecessarily hard only adding to the confusion of this class. I may only be a first year, but I guarantee that this is the worst class offered a Yale University. My name is Andrew Schuler and you can ask me at graduation in 2022 what's the worst class I ever took, and my answer will undoubtedly be Math 112.",
    "Strengths of this course included the great peer tutoring available to help with any questions that were needed. Additionally, there was always a thorough number of practice exams and study sessions to prepare for the exams. Weaknesses of this course included limited office hours\/ office hours that were not at a good time for most students. Additionally, the material seemed a little rushed at times, especially during the end of the semester. Finally, the first problem set which was about pre-calculus had no explanation for it, so it was very confusing.",
    "The teaching was distant; just being lectured to the whole time didnt really help my comprehension.",
    "I thought the class was fairly straightforward. I wish there was more in class interaction with the instructor rather than him just going through his lecture notes.",
    "My teacher was very monotone and I didnt love the actually classes themselves.",
    "The course had very good peer tutoring, but it moved very quickly.",
    "Strengths were knowing the material and weaknessses are the tests.",
    "Could maybe be improved by more emphasis on problem sets and less on WebAssign.",
    "This course is lacking in so many ways. Three days a week I would waste an hour of my time to go to math lecture and listen to a grad student read off notes and expect 30 students to immediately understand how to apply the concept or theorem he simply wrote on the board to actually conceptually difficult problems. I could never do a problem set on my own and the masses of students who attended peer tutoring to receive answers proves that I was not the only one. There was not enough outside help and asking my instructor for help was useless because he could not wrap his head around the idea that a person could not automatically understand math.",
    "Strengths: builds a strong foundation on the theoretical nature of Calculus I. Weakness: I wish the course involved more computations\/problems involving more calculations.",
    "I think a strength would be the amount of out of class practice we had. I think a weakness would be the length of assignments sometimes",
    "This course is difficult and can often involve a lot of complicated concepts that are not taught in depth because so many concepts are being taught at once. I think that the exams were also graded harshly. The way that I learned math allows student to explore different ways of solving problems, but I felt like this course forced students to have a formulaic understanding of math where it was that if one did not solve something a specific way, it was wrong.",
    "Strengths include peer tutors help with psets and very helpful review sessions. Weaknesses include the ridiculous grading of tests, impossible psets, and challenging webassigns.",
    "Strengths: the webassigns recapped each class well Weaknesses: focus on theories and lack of examples solved in class",
    "Lots to learn but can also be repetitive. Webassign sucked and sometimes answers were wrong just for incorrect format. Lots of time on webassign for small percentage of grade.",
    "The strengths are that it's intensive and provides a good calculus base. The weaknesses include the teaching, webassign, problem sets and lack of feedback. I think this could be improved by moving away from more in-class interaction and feedback from teachers."

   "comments": [
    "No, I think the course was good but the teaching in my section was very poor.",
    "No. No one should ever have to take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who just needs to fulfill a basic QR requirement. This course was not terribly hard, and the workload was reasonable. I do not believe that this is a good course for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of calculus though as this course is just a rough overview.",
    "Yes, basic necessity in order to take other math courses or science classes.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who is not sure whether they should take Math 112 or math 115. This class will definitely help you succeed in 115.",
    "No. The material, despite not being very difficult, is overcomplicated when it is taught, and there is very little engagement with the students enrolled in the course. Would only recommend if you plan on taking Math 115 and upwards but need a refresher before going into higher classes.",
    "Maybe, if they like math or are interested in taking it to get a prerequisite for another thing.",
    "I would recommend this course because it offers useful information that applies to a wide variety of majors.",
    "Yes if you love math if not take math lower",
    "Yes. I think it was a fine calculus class.",
    "No I would tell other students to avoid math intro lectures at Yale if they can.",
    "Yes. The course is very organized and the workload is challenging but very reasonable.",
    "No, unless it was required as a prerequisite for something.",
    "If you have to.",
    "If you are stem yes, if you want to continue math yes, if you're not good at math and don't need it, no.",
    "Not really. This course did not provide me with a good understanding of calculus (most of what I learned was from self-study with my textbook) and took time away from my other studies."
