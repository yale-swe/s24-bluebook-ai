   "comments": [
    "The main text for the course is Maimonides' Guide for the Perplexed. We went through the text pretty thoroughly and its always nice to study a great thinker in depth. The course also touched on a number of important themes: Athens vs Jerusalem, methodology for how to read an ancient text etc",
    "If you're looking to study a medieval thinker and you already have exposure to medieval Christian thinkers, this is definitely the class for you. It's also a great class to take if you'd like an opportunity to explore \"big questions\" (nature of God and man, death, the afterlife, etc). Great professor, very positive experience.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class - Prof. Citron is a fun, engaging and thoughtful teacher and the material is really interesting. Discussions were on topics like the kind of claims we can make about God, how Maimonides views questions of theodicy\/providence and the afterlife. We cover a lot of ground at a surprisingly deep level given the breadth of the material. There are weekly reading responses on 50-80 pages of reading, but not very dense reading. The final paper is about 20 pages and Prof. Citron is very helpful\/responsive throughout the process of writing it."
