   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about reactor theory and (in depth) water quality control processes. I also learned an introduction to wastewater control processes\/a distinct look at aeration basins and the place of bioorganisms and substrates in this process.",
    "I learned about the different types of water treatment processes and the basic calculations behind these mechanisms.",
    "I developed a solid basic understanding of the processes involved in treating drinking and waste water, and became more familiar with manipulating mass balance equations. I have already applied what I've learned to outside projects, which is always so exciting!",
    "This course was most successful in teaching how to think about problems. We developed a systematic approach to engineering problem solving.",
    "Specifically, how to design water treatment plants. More broadly, how to design systems along the lines of transport and transformation. We derived and applied equations that described how a particular process worked. We learned how to define control volumes, figure out what was changing, how it was changing, what was staying the same and why.",
    "Gives a valuable and apparently pretty practical perspective in designing water treatment plants, and how different unit operations involved in water treatment respond to different reactor designs. Also provides a good introduction to other concepts widely used in environmental engineering contexts, like biological and chemical oxygen demand as a way of measuring a substance in water."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved the course. It was very reasonable workload-wise and was also had reasonable and manageable exams. The course material was interesting, well taught and flowed together well.",
    "I liked the straightforward setup of the course - each lesson and class were well-planned and made sense within the context of the course. I also liked that Professor Kim gave us a quick stretch break in the middle of each class, which really helped me stay focused. There's not much I could recommend for improvement. Maybe more in-class physical examples?",
    "Loved this course overall, definitely helped me with calculations, which is the most important part. The one thing I wish I had come away with is just a slightly better understanding of what it all meant in the real world. For example, we did lots of problems with and without sludge recycling in the last unit, but we rarely compared the results of the two or tried to optimize r for a set of parameters, which I think would have been interesting. It also would have been neat to follow to the concept of a real reactor as CSTRs in serious throughout later units a bit more, because to me that seemed like a really key concept to stay grounded in the real world that I could have used a bit or reinforcement on. Also, Professor Kim and the textbook often talked about computer models. I understand the logic of learning how to do everything on our own in order to understand the models later on, but for some reason I was always super curious about what these models actually look like and how they are used. Even just demonstrating one relevant calculation using one on the projector would probably have satiated this thirst. In general though I really did love the course, which is why the only things I can come up with to improve on are really minor details.",
    "The strengths were that the professor was very involved and interested in the material, and that the problem sets built upon the class material. However there was sometimes too big of a gap between the class material and the problem sets leading to sometimes confusing problems.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kim! He is such a caring and wonderful teacher. He wants to know us as people, not just as students. It's such a refreshing environment for a STEM class. He is really great at explaining the concepts in a way that is understandable. He is also really understanding and gives us breaks every class so that we can stay awake and attentive. Weaknesses: Sometimes a little dry because how much can one person really care about sedimentation?",
    "The good: Professor Kim's lecture is great--he takes a pretty often bland course subject and tries to make it as engaging as he can. Lecture and course content is pretty straightforward and reasonable. Professor does the derivations, you copy the notes. Professor Kim has at least one lunch with each student in the class. This is a really nice to get to know him to the point where you feel comfortable just talking to him about anything. The tour of the water treatment facility on Whitney Ave is awesome, and is definitely, absolutely, not to be missed. It's really cool to see what you learn in class actually applied, and you get a sense that the problems you work in class aren't that far off of the real thing. The bad: The course is not really structured off of a book or set of notes online. You basically go off of Professor Kim's notes only, and it is easy to get messed up if you make a mistake in class\/if a mistake or change is made that you don't notice. He says there is a book, and you might be inclined to buy the book, but don't bother. He really only follows it for one chapter, and he posts that section of the book. It was held in the small, windowless, fluorescent lamp-lit dungeon that is that room next to Davies. I had another chemical engineering class there right before, and by the time this class came around, I was a little checked out of being in that room."

   "comments": [
    "Professor Kim is an amazing teacher who genuinely cares about his students. The course is very well taught and manageable and I would recommend it to anyone who can take it (it's a great ChemE elective).",
    "This class is a great way to learn about the mechanisms behind wastewater and drinking water treatment. It's an engineering class, so it's mostly quantitative, but Professor Kim always keeps the material fresh and exciting. He also really makes an effort to connect with his students, whether that's inviting them to lunch or holding review sessions (one had donuts!) before each test in his office. I liked the straightforward setup of the course - each lesson and class were well-planned and made sense within the context of the course. Also, we visited a drinking water plant in New Haven, which was a fun field trip! Overall a great course.",
    "Yeah for sure. I mean most people are in the class because they have to be, but to be completely honest I would have wished I could have taken it even if I weren't an environmental engineering major, because it was such a cool way to understand the water that we interact with every day and often take for granted. But maybe that's why I AM an environmental engineering major. Anyway, good pace, lots of opportunities to check learning and ask questions, definitely would recommend. Water is actually so interesting, and I'll make far fewer assumptions when I drink from the tap now. But I would totally recommend this course to people outside the major as well, for example if you're interested in development, even from a policy side, it could be a really great way to understand what it actually looks like to provide clean water to people.",
    "I would recommend this course to engineering students thinking about more of the applications of engineering in the real world. Other engineering classes are sometimes disconnected from real world applications. This class has direct links to water quality and the field trip to a real water plant was both interesing and useful.",
    "I wouldn't take this course unless you're an enve\/cheme major because how would you apply this otherwise? But with that said, it is definitely one of the better courses in the major. Very very cool concepts and helps you develop skills to think about any sort of system. I love Professor Kim! He makes the course. What an incredible man.",
    "Of course, this is a wonderful course to take as a Chemical Engineering elective. The course material is a little dry at times, but it is a very good way to be introduced to concepts relating to reactor design, and how that should be tailored to the desired process."
