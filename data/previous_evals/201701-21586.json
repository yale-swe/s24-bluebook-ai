    "The course was very well organized and had clearly defined topics for each week's discussion. The only thing I would say is that some of the weeks had unrealistic reading assignments--I don't think many students would have the time to read several 30-page papers on top of a book in one week."

    "Good class with interesting topics, I really like Professor Hersh.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, except Professor Hersh is leaving! I loved taking it with him because his area of research was this specific field, and he had a lot of interesting anecdotes and insight that helped supplement the class greatly.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class (if it's still around). The readings are great but plentiful on average. Prof. Hersh is engaging and has done some wonderful work. Discussion is usually thought-provoking. There are interesting guest lecturers (one from industry and one from the more legal side of things). Prof. Hersh isn't worried about sharing his opinions but will also listen to yours. Three 5 page papers, a weekly paragraph-long reading response (useful if you're not big on speaking in seminars), and an in-class presentation. The papers are tougher than you think. Each is unique and Prof. Hersh has a very specific set of stipulations for you (stipulations that he only explains verbally). You'll need to adjust to his style of writing (he doesn't like adjectives, quotes, etc.). He also grades anonymously and quickly. You'll get very thorough feedback and learn what is expected of you fast."
