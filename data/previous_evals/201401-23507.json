    "I would summarize this course as a history of Jews in Muslim Lands between the 7th century and 18th century (early modern times). The focus is not really on Islam per se, but rather how it shaped and influenced the development of Jewish practices and thought.",
    "An interesting class if you are interested in the subject matter and the art of studying history. If you do not care about Jews, Muslims, or the politics of Empire I would shy away from it though.",
    "Take this class if you genuinely are interested in the material. I really loved this class, but I also feel that it was only worth my time because I was willing to put in the time to look at the primary sources and pick a paper topic I really cared about. Professor Marcus is fantastic and I definitely recommend this class for those considering it.",
    "Don't take it.",
    "No",
    "I would say if you want to take a history class that doesn't take much work then take it it is a good fifth class",
    "A manageable class if you do all the readings and take good notes - but there is a lot of reading to do!",
    "Do not take this class......it is HORRIBLE and the professor is HORRIBLE.",
    "Decent preindustrial credit. Interesting.",
    "Good class. Learned a lot and pretty relevant to understanding the current ME conflict. Expanded my knowledge.",
    "Take it.",
    "If you're looking for a low-stress history class, take this course! The workload is light (two mid-terms and a 10-12 page paper, plus no section) but the material is quite interesting. I think some people managed to get by without doing the readings, but if you're truly interested in the subject then you'll love the readings, which are mostly primary sources (letters, poems, etc.). The paper was a great opportunity to try your hand at interpreting some of these sources because as Prof. Marcus will tell you repeatedly, you are not to use any existing scholarship to craft your paper. This class really sparked my interest in medieval history, and I'm so glad I took it. If you take it, just be sure to attend every lecture!",
    "On the one hand, it is an easy course with little homework. On the other, the lectures are terrible-rambling and disorganized-the readings provide no insight on the topic (you must attend the torturous lectures), and you leave the course with little relevant knowledge about the interrelationship of Jews and Muslims (presumably a major reason to take the course). I am now armed with some trivial facts about the period but would not recommend the course.",
    "Good class if you have a background or interest in the topic. Otherwise, pretty relaxed survey course.",
    "Yes I recommend this course. It is not too difficult. The workload is manageable too.",
    "If it were to be more streamlined, yes I would recommend it. I learned a lot from the course, and I want to visit the Middle East to see everything that I learned about because of it. However, I would avoid this class until the kinks are worked out.",
    "If you're sincerely interested in the material, I would recommend to take it Credit\/D (or at least start Credit\/D). It's very hard to know what prof. Marcus expects and how he will grade things, even if you do all the work. The material is actually good! But if you're looking for an easy class, don't do it.",
    "Eh. The material is interesting, but if you treat this as a gut class you will get killed- Marcus gives out C's and worse to people with subpar exams and papers and a lot of the class dropped. It is definitely possible to do well, but be very careful. 2 hour exams (non-cumulative) and a paper that is easy to write were very nice.",
    "Good class, but you'll need to pay attention (no FB, shopping, reddit or any of that) since the class is more like Professor Marcus sharing a story with you. I would recommend it 100%!"
