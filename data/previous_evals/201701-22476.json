    "I am very grateful to have had a chance to be Professor Brisman's student, and to be in the company of such strong minds. We had a very powerful class--the discussions were vibrant and the members of the class were passionate about the course material. Strengths: I appreciated Professor Brisman's balance between sharing his own thoughts (more like a lecture) and inviting the class to share theirs. Our class was a healthy hybrid of professorial knowledge and student conjecture. Professor Brisman also encourages students to visit with him, which I found helpful--he makes himself accessible. Weaknesses: I think the class could have been stronger if Professor Brisman had cultivated more of a discussion among the students, rather than a question-and-answer style back and forth between the students and himself. The best seminars I have been a part of have turned into conversations between students, rather than timid references back to the teacher. Though I respect Professor Brisman's knowledge and I understand that he doesn't want our comments to stray too far from the interpretive mainstream, I think the class could have negotiated better between the two extremes."

    "Yes, if you have some background in Victorian literature\/poetry. This class requires a high level of engagement and can be challenging, especially when it comes to writing papers (Professor Brisman maintains high standards for essay-writing). But the exposure to some beautiful ideas and high quality poetry is worth it."
