    "This is a good intro into some of the skills required for industry engineering jobs.",
    "This class was mainly focused on the ASPEN program, that allowed students to model a chemical plant. We learned about theoretical considerations that chemical plants might have to manage in the real world as well.",
    "Some familiarity with Aspen, how to translate kinetic data into reactor sizing and selection of operating conditions, heat exchanger sizing. Practice giving technical presentations and answering questions."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The classes and lectures did not feel relevant and helpful to the overall project. More classes designed to work with the Aspen program and meet with students frequently would be more helpful.",
    "A greater focus on learning ASPEN software would have helped as the textbook material was often unrelated to completing the senior project",
    "This course is a decent capstone to the engineering major. It is a fair amount of work, especially at the end, but if you are in a good group then it's not really a problem. There are 7 presentations throughout the semester, so if you dislike public speaking this course will challenging. The worst part of the course is all the time you will spend trying to figure out how to use the ASPEN software that is necessary for the project. On the positive side, the only work you have to is the project itself. There are no problem sets or tests. Teams are randomly assigned, which can be good or bad depending on your teammates. If you all work hard and stay on schedule, this course will be a very manageable.",
    "This course was completely focused on the term project. This was helpful because we could devote all of our efforts to the project instead of worrying about weekly problem sets in addition to the project. I feel like we were able to have a much more complete project because of this. However the project was on a program called ASPEN and we had no experience with this program and only a couple of instructional days reguarding it. If the final project was entirely based on the ASPEN program, it would have greatly benefited the class to have more days learning how to actually use it.",
    "The main strength of this course is that it is the most application-focused ChemE course where in theory, students have the chance to pull together all the theory courses and do some real chemical engineering. Working in small teams was also a good experience for learning how to have effective team meetings and manage team dynamics. Although the framework for this course is good, the course was poorly organized and executed. A lot of learning was possible in this class because of the project itself and because the students put a lot of time and effort into finding online Aspen tutorials, setting up office hour meetings, reaching out to other resources, and just trying different things to make it work. And while initiative on the students' part is expected and like any class finding the right information on our own is part of the learning process, this class could have done so much more to facilitate efficient learning. For example, the lectures could have been relevant to the project if more time was spent helping us become familiar with Aspen, or if we were given class time to complete design steps that were described to us in lecture. Outlining the textbook or telling us general hazards or properties to consider is a waste of time. The hard part is turning back to our design project and answering \"Now what?\" or \"What's relevant here?\". Or even if the the professor feels strongly about having a traditional lecture, the lectures should focus on technical topics we are less familiar with like the design of heat exchangers and compressors. Or even take a more practical look at sizing reactors and separators (because we focused more on the theory in kinetics and separations). The design guidelines we spent hours and hours copying down are common sense and often not directly applicable to unique bottlenecks in a project. It might also make sense to omit the complicated economic analysis of the plant. Unless there are going to be assignments with feedback that teach us how industry does economic analyses, I think it's too much to expect students to figure it all out on their own and basically teach themselves something that was casually glossed over in class. The only reason why I knew how to new present value calculations and to think about capital costs, O&M costs, ROI, etc. is because I took an SOM\/FES class where these concepts were explained and discussed and because I had psets where I could reinforce what was taught in lecture. The way economics was presented in this class was more like showing us what existed than actually teaching it to us."
