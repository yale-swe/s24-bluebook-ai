   "comments": [
    "Take this class. Excellent teaching from Michael Zimm, interesting course content and a brilliant review of Latin. Class tied in well with history and linguistics, and covered a range of authors. Very fun, large focus on translation which helped my Latin enormously. Would recommend to anyone considering taking Classics, or who wants to become better versed in Rome's history. No complaints about this class, very happy to have taken it and all the more confident in Latin because of it. 10\/10.",
    "Yes, this is a very good introduction to complicated Latin and a good follow-up after AP latin in high school.",
    "Absolutely recommend this class. A great look at Roman texts on their founding myths, in passages from some of the most seminal texts of the Latin canon over a large time span: Virgil's Aeneid, Livy's Ab Urbe Condita, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Fasti, and Ars Amatoria, Propertius' Elegies, Sallust's Bellum Catilinae, and Augustine's De Civitate Dei. Very feasible amount of work: approximately 60-90 lines per class (meets twice a week), 4 small quizzes, 1 midterm, 1 8-10 page paper, and the final.",
    "If you took Latin in high school, this is a great incremental step up to college level. However, you have to do work outside of the class to get perfect understanding, and you might feel like you have to pester the teacher to be prepared for the tests.",
    "411 is a lot of translation, though the stories from the various authors are similar in that they're all related to early Rome. So in that way, it's an interesting look at how Romans viewed their foundation, but know that the course itself focuses much more on the Latin itself than on any historical components. The workload is significant but not impossible; if you took AP Latin, you'll find it similar to (though probably more slightly more difficult than) that.",
    "Latin 411 is a rigorous but worthwhile examination of Rome's founding, from many varied perspectives. I would highly recommend it!",
    "LATN 411 is a great course. It's difficult if you feel uncomfortable with grammar or if you struggle to memorize vocab, but it's taught at a very manageable pace.",
    "Unless you are extremely passionate about translating latin and that alone, I would not recommend this course! Though Professor Zimm is a fantastic teacher, the class focuses very little on background in the classical world, and is almost exclusively for those who enjoy reading pure latin.",
    "Latin 411 is a very interesting course. The different texts are well chosen and interact very well with each other. I would recommend this class to people with a good foundation in Latin, such as AP Latin. The amount of work is pretty challenging. I would recommend any student who takes this class to review a lot. But overall it was an interesting class that made me glad I took Latin.",
    "I would strongly recommend it as a bridge course, for the reasons I described above. As a full L5 class, it's probably a little less work than most others, so a junior or senior who's already a Classics major, familiar with the authors and texts, probably wouldn't get as much from it.",
    "A difficult course, but good for an introduction into college-level Latin for students who have taken the AP. If you take the time with the readings (and do them consistently--not just the night before), you should appreciate the material, do well in the class, and find some authors you really like that you can then explore in more depth in later classes. I would suggest it to any person with good high school-level preparation in the classics, as I had, if they are willing to work hard. The assignments are mostly consistent--mostly long translations--so do not take this class if that does not sound right for you. There is also one paper, for which hard work and good citations should be enough to do well. Students are graded on class-participation: in-class translation, but not harshly."
