    "I would recommend ITAL 120 for a fellow student. Italian is a great language to learn. Class difficulty varies greatly among teachers, so do your research! Overall, it is a very relaxed classroom environment. This course can be a lot of work and the tests are not easy...beware! Italian is a great language!",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. Fun, small class size, smart kids, not too much work.",
    "I think Italian 120 is a good continuation to first semester Italian. However, at times I wished I had taken intensive Italian to learn more at a faster rate.",
    "This course is a lot of work, but its really rewarding. As we complete learning the grammar, we discuss culture and the world a lot: this is quite entertaining and a great way to learn.",
    "Absolutely. This class is great and sets you up perfectly positioned to do L3\/L4 abroad during the summer or continue your studies the following year."
