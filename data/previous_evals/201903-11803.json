    "Strengths: the pacing of the course was perfect & the topics we had to speak\/write\/read about we're relevant. Weaknesses: deadlines were changed often\/last minute a couple times, so it was difficult to keep important dates in check.",
    "Very fun and engaging course. Instructor Quang is an expert in his field and makes each day enjoyable.",
    "Strengths: Vietnamese heritage speakers will become more rooted in their culture and improve their Vietnamese speaking. Reading and writing skills are also developed and practiced regularly. A schedule is provided each week with assignments due and content to be covered in class. Weakness: Sometimes, the schedule isn't closely followed and it isn't clear which assignments are due and on what day.",
    "Collaborate with students on the homework and get a tutor from the CTL! It makes the class more easy and fun",
    "The class is taught by an engaging professor and benefits from his humor and energy. The class can be better structured and the assignments can benefit from more clarity and instruction."

    "I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to improve their Vietnamese."
