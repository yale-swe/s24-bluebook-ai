   "comments": [
    "I think it was a very good course. The pace of the course was adequate for the people with some statistical background and those without any. Personally, I had a lot of problems adjusting to SAS. Perhaps next semster, the professor could seek for additional workshops offered by services on campus to help provide more information on programming and working with SAS.",
    "Strenghts--Instructor presents information in a clear manner.Weaknesses--Most of the TAs are extremely unhelpful to the point of being rude in the SAS labs. They don't do the lab beforehand and more than once my section was instructed on the wrong way to do a lab which is extremely confusing. In general, the TAs were unhelpful, lacked confidence and didn't know how to teach material. As the instructor seems to rely exclusively on the TAs for any assistance outside of class, it is important to have good TAs for this class.",
    "Strengths- having homework problems helped with understanding and applying what was learned in class, lab time was helpful for getting questions answered and learning SAS, it was helpful that the instructor hand-wrote notes instead of using powerpointWeaknesses- none",
    "very practical, too early in the morning",
    "Good.",
    "The in-class instruction is excellent. The TA sessions are designed to reinforce what we learn in class as are the homework assignments. One major weakness of the course is the TA sessions for SAS. They did not always clearly and concretely connect with what we were learning in class.",
    "strengths: fundamental course, very helpful",
    "I think it would be helpful if there were weekly review sessions that were led by the TAs. Attendance could be optional. Reviews could be held on Wednesday afternoon or Thursday after the two lectures for the week, and would be an opportunity to go over another example of what we had done in class that week. Large lectures in Winslow do not provide an environment where it is easy to ask questions. Office hours would be more helpful if TAs had review material planned, instead of just waiting for people to come to them with questions.",
    "The labs were disorganized, and it was a little unclear what the assignments required, and what needed to be turned in. Most of the time I just figured out what was going on with other students, as opposed to looking at the lab descriptions or power points. The descriptions and power points could have been combined so you don't have to flip back and forth between SAS, word, the lab descriptions and the powerpoint, etc.",
    "strengths- office hoursweaknesses- too much content too little time",
    "Strengths:1. TAs who help students2. Sheets are given at class if students didn't print out handout3. Claus' humorWeakness:1. Overhead is hard to read with handwriting2. Classroom environment is too dark and class is held early(This allows an opportunity for students to dose off)3. SAS was difficult to fully understand",
    "moved through content very quickly. slow down !",
    "There is a disconnect between the material covered in the text book and the material covered in the lecture. It would be helpful if the class was more coherent in that the homework questions more closely reflected the information that we're responsible for. Since the instructor writes the exams, it would be helpful to complete both questions in the text book and questions written by the instructor for homework.",
    "It is unfortunate that this class is so early in the morning, but it is certainly a useful course once the concepts begin to sink in. I am left feeling at the end, however, that I may need to take the second semester in order to really understand statistics.",
    "Ok",
    "Overall the course was quite comprehensive, but if I didn't already have a solid foundation in statistics from undergraduate classes then I think I would have struggled. The material was covered at a fast pace.",
    "it's very useful, yet the way of teaching is too traditional.",
    "The course was helpful overall. It would be better if powerpoint slides could be used instead of a projector.",
    "it is useful",
    "I enjoyed the course, and felt that I gained a solid biostatistics foundation. The SAS lab sessions each week additionally provided me an excellent introduction to SAS.",
    "The homework and lab work was well organized and complimented the lectures well. It could be improved if it wasn't so early in the morning!! (I know it'll never change but it has to be said.)",
    "The course was well designed, not too fast paced, and a good introduction to biostatistics.",
    "The lab is helpful, but the lecture is a bit confusing sometimes.",
    "The Biostatistics course was well presented from an introductory standpoint; as someone who had not taken a biostatistics course beforehand, but who had research experience in the field, it was a good way to learn the basics of programming and calculations necessary for conducting studies in public health.",
    "Good introductory course. It seemed like the lab instruction from the Teaching Fellows was rather varied.",
    "The course was well structured and organized, but I found the content to be lacking. I understand that since it is the first intro course that the material needs to be accessible to everybody, but I found the content very elementary. Since we only have four semesters in the program, I would have liked to move a little faster through useful material.The lab could also have been better integrated into the course content. The contents of the lab never caught up with the content of the course, and I would have liked to become a bit more proficient in SAS by the end of BIS505A.",
    "strength:necessary, lecture is clear and understandableweaknesses:homework is easy, but SAS lab is a little bit harder and may need more time. exam is much more difficult than homework, so lack of sufficient practice.",
    "I waived this course",
    "I would like to have more help from the TF's regarding book work. There was little explanation of questions on this end.",
    "Weaknesses:The set-up of the class is difficult in that the instructor tries to teach biostats and hypothesis testing without really starting with testing for assumptions of normality and variance. So, you are starting all of these things without actually testing to make sure you can even run the hypothesis test in the first place. There is little discussion of the underlying concepts in biostats, how we do things and why we really do them.",
    "I wish there were better instructions on how to do the lab report. Also think homework # 4 should be due before reading week. Also I could not read the teacher's handwriting so I could use the slides posted on classesv2.",
    "The course is extremely challenging for anyone who has not already taken a stat course, and starts with the assumption that students are generally familiar with statistical notation and concepts, which was not the case for me and for others I know who took the course without a background in stat. I got outside help following the midterm and that was helpful, but it took me probably the first half of the course to begin to understand much of the material.The SAS component of the course is extremely difficult if the TA doesn't help his\/her students with understanding the point of the programming. My first TA was really unknowledgeable and didn't seem to want to help students during the lab, because she was too worried about \"giving us the answers\". I switched to another session with a different TA, which was better, but still difficult, especially in the beginning.",
    "good to have the skill of biostat and sas.it will be even beter if more sas samples with explanation can be givenand the answers of other questions(rather than homework questions) after chapters can be given as reference or practice.",
    "Strengths: Good support system with the TA's in the course.Weakness: Would recommend using the same formulas as the textbook, rather than introducing 2 different formulas or symbols.",
    "The lab sessions (with Connor Essick) were very helpful. He explained things very thoroughly that we may not have had time to go over in class in greater detail and explained SAS excellently. That was very helpful for the course. Overall, i thought the class was well taught. I do think towards the end when OR and matched studies were discussed and as they related to SAS, tha tthey could have spent a bit more time on them.",
    "The tests were much different than the material emphasized in class",
    "The course was designed well, but SAS sucks.",
    "Over all, I felt this course was good. I learned a lot the detailed process of how to set up hypotheses test that help me on reading SAS output.",
    "The course presents the material in an accessible way and the combination with practical SAS assignments is great. The expansive homework assignments render this a very work intensive course , but I assume that is the intention of the core courses.What is somewhat upsetting is the variation in grading the homework. In itself one observes substantial variation (~10%) in how the work is reviewed depending on the TA who grades the assignment. I believe this is already mitigated through having one TA grading an entire set but the variability from HW to HW persists. This is probably inevitable given the number of people taking the class. That said, it would be appreciated if methods applied in the homework and graded as correct, should not lead to a loss of points due to \"inaccuracy\" in the mid term or final.These comments are meant as suggestions \"on the margin\" for future courses. Overall, a good learning experience.",
    "This is a very useful course, especially when it is related to the epidemiology course material occuring simultaneously.",
    "Lab was difficult, I found that to be the most frustrating part of the class, not the lecture.",
    "I really liked this course even though it was hard for me since I do not have a statistics or math background. The text book is amazing, it is full of examples so it is easy to see how the theory of statistics can be applied to real world problems. One weakness though was that we did not check the homeworks with the professor like we do in Epidemiology. They just posted the answers on the website. However, going through homework would have been useful to better understand our mistakes.",
    "The course contents were good. Although it was taught in a way, that students were expected to have a prior biostatistics course. Certain concepts were not taught from the basic level.",
    "It's a necessity. Good basic stats information although honestly lab was useless and a waste of time.",
    "I thought this was a pretty good class, especially considering it's a large lecture-based math class and was taught at 8:30 in the morning. I learned a lot throughout the semester. The only thing I didn't like was all the SAS and computer lab stuff, but I understand why it was included in the course.",
    "It would be better if the expectations for the lab write-ups were more detailed and specific, so that expectations were clearer.The professor presented the material in a clear and understandable way. The homework assignments helped to reinforce the information.The SAS manual was not as helpful as I thought it would be, I would make it optional for students to purchase as most of the information is provided in lab or can be found in the help section of the SAS program itself.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this course. I feel like I have a very solid understanding of the material. The lectures were very clear and easy to follow. Although the labs themselves were clearly presented, I still don't feel like I know how to use SAS well. Also, the resources under the course website needs to be better organized.",
    "Appropriate content for the course.Strengths: straight-forward material. Appropriate lecture format.Weaknesses: organization of course materials--a course pack of handouts would be much preferred to individual handouts. organization of ClassesV2 website--put documents in folders to make them easier to locate. lab was disappointing. i wasted a lot of time using Google to find SAS code. seems like the course and TAs could be more helpful with the appropriate code so we could focus on the interpretation of SAS. textbook was disappointing.",
    "strengths- great professor, claus really knows how to cover the material efficiently and in an witty and fun wayweaknesses- some of the material in homeworks or in SAS was not applicable to course and what was expected of in evaluations\/examinations",
    "Exempted from this class",
    "Overall, I found this course to be very helpful in presenting the fundamental equations and concepts of biostatistics. I think this course could benefit from better SAS lab explanations.",
    "I've had biostats in undergrad, and for some reason the way the course was structured made it a little more difficult to re-learn the concepts. For the amount of material we covered, it would almost be better if we could do an intensive 2-3 week biostats course followed by a one week intensive SAS course during which we covered everything (for non-biostats concentrators). Otherwise, offer a Biostats 101 bootcamp before school for those without a strong background, and only do a 1 semester course of biostats. Overall I re-learned the core concepts, but the SAS lab was not very valuable.",
    "BIS505a covered a adequate and useful amount of material, not too many concepts and not too few. The labs were very useful for learning SAS, but were at times it was unclear or quite confusing what the lab questions were asking us to do. TA office hours were not managed well, and often there would be many students all trying to get their questions answered, with very little TA management of flow of questions and answers. Multiple times I went to office hours and was not able to get even one question answered.My only complaint about the course structure itself was that I found myself often lost in a sea of concepts, with no big picture to help me categorize what I was learning. It would have been very useful to have a slide or two that gave a picture of all the major statistical concepts that would be covered in the course. If these concepts were arranged in some sort of chart or tree that we could then check off as we learned them, it would help us place the concepts in a conceptual map.",
    "For a statistics class I really enjoyed it,",
    "Strengths: The instructor stuck to the syllabus and each lecture covered the intended topic assigned for that day. The instructor was open to questions after each lecture. The book was helpful in complementing the lecture. Office hours with my TA was especially helpful. He was great at explaining and addressing questions I had.Weaknesses: I have never had any formal training in SAS, so coming to SAS lab was sometimes frustrating. I felt lost because I had no idea where to start and what code I should first use in order to generate the necessary figures and data to answer the questions that were asked. Moreover, the lab questions were sometimes not clearly stated; so there was a little bit of confusion as to what was asked of me to answer. Luckily, I had a great TA that was hand-ons and patient; so, he was really helpful in lab! Additionally, I thought that the notes from class, the lab power points and other important notices (i.e. practice exams) could have been organized better on the classesv2 website.",
    "I think it covered all the basics. However, the lab component isn't done as well. I'd prefer a 1\/2 credit course for the lab component.",
    "The way the material is presented in class is hard to follow- she was very sporadic and notes never seemed to follow logical order. On the other hand, SAS handouts presented in class were extremely helpful and probably the most useful part of the class. She was very informative about reading SAS printouts.",
    "The class was a great introduction to biostatistics. The examinations were fair, and the homework assignments gave good preparation for the exams.",
    "Good introductory course. Think perhaps, it's quite difficult to teach to those of us who have never had stats and those of us who have some stats background at the same time. I surmise that one of the most important skills we'll need when we walk away from YSPH, though, is an understanding of SAS and I do not feel like this class prepared me to that aim. To expect the teaching assistants to be responsible for preparing us to use SAS efficiently and effectively is shortsighted. The MPH is supposed to be a professional degree, and not a philosophical one, so the emphasis should shift a little to skill and not the theory of biostats. More SAS should be worked into the curriculum of the course itself, not just the lab sessions, and I'm afraid to say that Dr. Claus' antiquated projector slides are probably not the appropriate avenue to introduce more SAS.",
    "good",
    "The course was really helpful, and helped me to understand some of the basic statistical concepts in detail.",
    "One strength was the quality of the lectures. She was very clear and methodical. The textbook material complemented the classwork well. The homework assignments also helped to reinforce the concepts. The lab hour was short and lacked in instruction. There could be longer lab periods and better prepared teaching fellows.",
    "Solid class, overall. The material was generally presented in a clear and straightforward way.However, it would have been nice to have a bit more practice applying the concepts. I hadn't taken stats before, so I had difficulty with a few of the concepts (although the course didn't require much previous knowledge, to be fair).",
    "The instructor did a fantastic job of explaining course material in a very simple-plain language way that made the information easier to follow,However, the lab sessions weren't always as helpful, in terms of more careful instruction\/guidance given by the TAs.",
    "Professor Claus focused on ensuring we understand the broad concepts and tested it us fairly on our knowledge of them. I originally was most concerned and wanted to take this class least, but she really made the material easy to absorb and I don't think it could have been taught better.",
    "I found this class to be better taught than previous statistics courses I've taken as an undergraduate. (My experience, however, is no doubt tinted by my previous experience -- years ago -- with most of what Claus taught.",
    "Weakness: No intentional overlap with epidemiologyStrength: Public health related curriculum",
    "Problem sets are very helpful, and the course provides a great overview of introductory statistics and SAS program for public health professionals.",
    "This course made me rediscover my love of math, something lost in college, something not seen since high school. It was very challenging for me, make no mistake, but once I would have a breakthrough with a particular concept, I really enjoyed working through problems and feeling accomplished with my success.The one exception to this is SAS; I wasn't able to retain much week-to-week from labs and I still find that program to be completely confounding.",
    "Very structured and organized. homeworks and assignments are fair.",
    "This is a good introductory statistics course. I think students are exposed to thinking in a statistical way and get good exposure to fundamental concepts.",
    "Excellent",
    "strengths: thoroughweaknesses: TA not helpful, instructor went through material too fast, instructor did not give credit where it was due on exams",
    "An enormous strength of the course was Dr. Claus' teaching style. Unlike other professors who just slap up a power point and proceed to read off of it, Dr. Claus simultaneously writes on an overhead while teaching students.",
    "Strengths: great resources\/scanned docs on classesv2, great TAsArea of improvement: possibly giving an overview (a macro-view: when to use this test statistic and how it relates to the big picture) at different junctures of the class would really facilitate better understanding of the material beyond just knowing how to calculate a particular test statistic."

It would be helpful to have some kind of notes outline\/skeleton at the least to be able to fill in\/clarify parts of the lesson instead of worrying about getting things down. As for the notes that were scanned, these were sometimes difficultto go through because there were no comments\/notes clarifying what certain problems\/concepts meant.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is rather humorous and clearly knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Sometimes she goes too fast when explaining certain concepts.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor speaks slowly and seems very approachable, and seems receptive to input. It would be useful for those who don't have a backgroundin stat to have an additional class or two (even if it is outside regular class time, taught by someone else if necessary) going over the basics of stat and statistical notation (e.g. sigma, p-values, mu, and many other things that were very unfamiliar), so that we have a better sense of what it is that we're studying.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Clause's class is well-organized and interesting,she is humorous and can bring fun to the class. It's helpful to listen to her lectures and the handouts are really useful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Good instructor. Very sympathetic to students needs.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I thought she readily available and always made sure to ask if we had questions during the the class time or to schedule an appointment with her.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was an excellent lecturer but the course website was unorganized.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is good.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is a good instructor. She speaks slow and explains each step of the process.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The monotonous style in delivering the lecture material makes it somewhat hard to engage during the lecture. When approached with questions regarding the material, one senses a certain unwillingness to consider the student's perspective. For example, there are different - accepted - ways the subject represents concepts like confidence intervals or statistical tests. However, not following the exact specifications introduced in class is not accepted. This appears somewhat dogmatic and is not necessarily enhancing the learning experience.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I have had some exposure to statistics so the material was not hard to grasp. The instructor had much concern for the course and enjoyed her lectures.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor is amazing! She is very open to students\u00b4 questions and she actually makes biostatistics seem like a fun subject.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Professor Claus is great at lecturing and explaining the material. Very approachable and helpful. I liked that she posted lectures online although sometimes I can't decipher her handwriting at all.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a good teacher with a nice sense of humor. I think she understood that the majority of people in the class had to take stats and were not planning on doing much with it after it was over.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was very straightforward with the information and provided a lot of examples which were helpful.I don't really have any critiques or things to improve.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an excellent professor. She explains the course material very clearly. Her exams and homework are very fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Engaging lecturer. Hand-writing is not easy to read.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor took the time to explain things in class and was always happy to answer questions. The use of overhead slides was a bit antiquated and occasionally led to some confusion when something would be written incorrectly on the transparency, but otherwise it didn't impair learning. Dr. Claus was comfortable in the classroom and even entertaining sometimes. She did a very good job lecturing overall.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Exempted from this class",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a great professor. It was clear she had a very thorough understanding of the subject and was interested in presenting us with the key concepts theoretically as well as how they can be applied in the real world.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The course instructor is great- very difficult to teach biostats in lecture format to such a large group, and it was done as best as possible. Even though the notes were hand written during class in order to better follow the student's pace of writing, it was still too fast at times. Otherwise wonderful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor was clear and for the most part covered the material in a straightforward manner. Her wry sense of humor helped to break up the monotony of the statistics lectures. She had a clear grasp on all concepts and was able to explain them well.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Sometimes hard to follow but in general a good professor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is an excellent teacher and kept me awake during an 8:30 lecture, this is no easy task.As a mathematics teacher, her style of lecture is perfect for the subject. Step by step Dr. Claus would break down various statistical equations and had the patience not skip any steps she considered to easy or redundant.I find this very important because I have had instructors assume their pupils have the same base of understanding of a math concept as they do. Often it has resulted in skipping intermediate steps in solving an equation and resulting in frustrated students.This is all that can ask for in a math teacher, and Dr. Claus is an example others should follow.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is witty and makes statistics fun. I love her jokes.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Strengths: The instructor was open to questions after each lecture. It was great that she made handouts available (e.g. printed them out for her students) for those who attended class.Weakness: Sometimes she would lecture really fast and thus jump to another sheet of paper to write her notes without letting us the time to copy down her notes from the previous sheet. Although she would post her notes, her handwriting was sometimes illegible, so it was hard to figure out some of the words. Additionally, I thought that the notes from class, the lab power points and other important notices (i.e. practice exams) could have been organized better on the classesv2 website.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor explained the information well given you read the text book readings. Often, I did not have questions right away and it took me longer to digest the information before having questions.I think the lab component with SAS could be done better in terms of prepping for the lab and lab write-ups.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was an overall good teacher. I enjoyed her wit and sense of humor through dealing with some pretty boring subject matter. I think the most helpful thing would be more readable notes and answer keys to practice problems. All in all, I think she was very true to what she taught in the midterm and final exams. I did not think grading without partial credit is necessary however, especially if you miss the first part of a 40 point question.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus explained things clearly in class, but the notes provided were difficult to follow, and sometimes it was necessary to look at the textbook extensively in order to understand what we were discussing in class. Her tests and homework assignments were somewhat time consuming, but very fair.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is fine. Her projector slides are difficult to follow and her notes are pretty much useless, but she does a relatively good job of lecturing for this class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0very humorous and clear",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She is an excellent instructor. Very detailed, and always helpful.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a very good instructor for this course. She is brilliant, explains the concepts well and adds some humor to the morning! I never used her office hours but I imagine she was available and open to questions.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus' straightforward, good-humored style was a nice way to start the morning on Mondays and Wednesdays. She's a good teacher with no major weaknesses.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Can teach more each class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Has a great way of communicating information that is easy to understand and digest.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Very impressive professor, excellent at explaining the material and created an enjoyable class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0I found Claus' explanations of statistics to be fine. Do not expect to be able to skip class and understand her notes whatsoever.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Teacher is very knowledgeable of what she taught, also a very enthusiastic person.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0The instructor shows her extensive experience in teaching the course,and her teaching style is excellent. It would be more helpful if there were more office hours available for students to ask questions and interact with the instructor.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Prof. Claus is hands down the best teacher (and here I must emphasize TEACHER since I can't type in italics) I've encountered so far at YSPH. Others lecture with prepared PowerPoints, but Prof. Claus really explains (again, EXPLAINS) the concepts, drawing things out, answering questions, and really putting things in accessible terms. She focused on what was really important, didn't waste our time by forcing us to memorize what would belooked up in the real world, helped us to build practical skills and familiarity with SAS printouts, made her expectations perfectly clear, and tested us on what we were taught and what we had practiced. Her pace, demeanor, and attitude of teaching were all exemplary and I really feel like I am coming away with a lot from this course. Thank you Prof. Claus!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Teaches very well. Lectures are informative. Understanding and kind to students. But I felt the professor talked to us as if we are high school students.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus is professional, approachable, and a really good lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0She was very clear and illustratively re-emphasized her points.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0see above",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Claus \u00a0Dr. Claus was a wonderful professor!"

   "comments": [
    "A good tough course for someone without much prior knowledge of statistics",
    "I would recommend it by far. It is very applicable for the field and an excellent course to refresh statistical skills.",
    "It is s required course so there is no choice.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was nice to have a course with quantitative aspects. I would definitely recommend this course to other students, it is an important building block for public health because biostatistics will be used in almost every field.",
    "great way to learn SAS and understand basic statistical evaluation techniques",
    "Very useful but trying at some points.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to other students with the caveat that they should be prepared to \"shop around\" for the best TA. Since the TA's are so integral to the learning process in this class, having an excellent TA or having a bad TA can make or break your learning experience.",
    "very useful course, I highly recommend it.",
    "This course covers statistical methods for analyzing data gathered in public health studies.",
    "Most of the first years have to take it, but I would say that it is a good foundation in statistics and really solidified my knowledge of it, so it was very useful, and I would recommend that other students take it.",
    "it is a lot of time and very difficult materialyou need friends to help you understand as the ta's are not always easily approachable and the instructor can be difficult to ask questions to",
    "I would say that the course is quite rigorous. I would recommend to to do the problem as the lectures proceed since it is very difficult to reapply topics discussed later. Also, office hours are a great resource.",
    "important but not an easy course. hopefully will retain it enough to apply.",
    "Yale College students might consider taking this if they are interested in a career in medicine or public health.",
    "Ok",
    "Useful",
    "It a core course and i think all public health students should take it. It's not fun, but it's useful.",
    "This is a fundamental course for any public health student, especially those aspiring to conduct research.",
    "It's a great course. I'd recommend it even if that student could test out. The SAS lab was very useful.",
    "Yes, this is overall a good course. The homework assignments are very time consuming so get a head-start on them early as well as the lab assignments. Use TA office hours for help. Also exams are open book, so understanding the concepts are better than memorization which helps you learn more.",
    "The course could have been more intuitive.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student; it is a good introductory course and the material is presented clearly. Dr. Claus is also very willing to help students throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course, although I'm guessing anyone who is thinking of taking it probably has to. I had a pretty extensive statistics background, but this was a great refresher and a good transition from statistics --> biostatistics.",
    "I would recommend it as a solid foundational course, although I would forewarn a fellow student that the information presented is not very in-depth.",
    "you have required to take this course! study SAS more hard!",
    "I waived this course",
    "I just think the course could be more appropriately organized and logical in its set-up. Also, the lab sessions are not really good for teaching people how to code inSAS well. One hour once a week is problematic for gaining a deeper, more intutive understanding of SAS.",
    "This course requires some additional study time outside of class so be prepared.",
    "It is a necessary course for the MPH degree, but I definitely struggled a lot with it and did not enjoy it. I'm glad that I have a basic understanding of statistics now, but I felt so stressed out throughout the entire semester, particularly during SAS lab time, that I wish it was not a requirement of the degree program, or at least not in the first semester.",
    "yes because its the basic skill we need to have for future study in epi and data management",
    "Mandatory course, but not too painful. Would recommend, course was challenging, but certainly informative.",
    "This course is an introduction to Biostatistics. If you have not had statistics in a while or if you hav enever taken it, it is a must. Also if you are unfamiliar with SAS, I would take it as well or at least audit the lab sections as SAS compared to other programs (SPSS for what i was used to) is very different. While it can be self taught, it is nice to have someone explain the intricacies to you.",
    "It's required.",
    "Yes.",
    "Course covers the basics of statistical concepts and techniques well. Certainly a building block for extracting as much out of the overall degree as is possible.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to all students in public health, as the statistics learnt here are sufficient to assist in the basic analysis of epidemiologic data.",
    "Yes, I would recommend. It is important to understand biostatistics and am glad that I have been learning about SAS as it an important program. Lab would be the most difficult component of this course, the lectureswere not difficult for me.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Although if you do not have a statistics background it may be hard at times, it is a valuable course for any future MPH. The teacher is approachable, fun and very solid in her knowledge. The book is very straightforward. The homeworks may seem like a nuisance, but they help you to keep up with the material. To future students I would like to let you know that SAS may appear confusing at first, but once you start to get used to it it becomes a really useful tool, it just takes time in class (and outside class) to learn its tricks and become more confident at it.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student as it forms the basis of any research study or analysis.",
    "Necessary introductory statistics course. Learn to read\/cope with her handwriting early on. Go to lectures! Suffer through labs.",
    "Good class, sucks that it's at 8:30, but I learned a lot and didn't think it was crazy hard or anything. Recommended",
    "It is required, so there is not much room for recommendation. I would let them know that the professor is great and very clear in her presentation of the information. She is approachable and clarifies information readily. The labs can be difficult, especially if you are new to SAS, but go to all of the TAs to see which one is most helpful for you.",
    "i didn't love the course, but it is a requirement for MPH students. i think that it is necessary for next quarter's biostatistics, but it wasn't a stellar course.",
    "This was a basic introductory statistics course targeted towards use of statistics in health-related areas. The instructor taught the course well and made it seem easier than I otherwise would have thought it would be.",
    "Exempted from this class",
    "A necessary course for understanding the key concepts and equations behind biostatistics.",
    "In-depth intro. to Biostats. I would suggest everyone take it unless they have a VERY strong biostats background or do a thorough review prior to Spring semester. Some of our classmates opted out because of previous courses, but I think they'll be at a disadvantage come semester 2, especially if they haven't used SAS before. Not the most fun course, but valuable and necessary for foundation.",
    "This is a key core course that I would not test out of unless you have a clear grasp of the basics of both statistical concepts through simple linear regression AND a good working knowledge of SAS. Although I had taken grad level stats before, I found this course very challenging and very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course to people without any statistical background and students needing a refresher.I would recommend everyone to take the lab and learn SAS.",
    "I would recommend this class to other fellow students. I had taken a biostatistics class before, but I elected to take it again because I wanted to get exposure to SAS, which I have never used before. Although being new to SAS and programming is frustrating in the beginning, I believe that this class is essential to my personal academic growth and development. The quantitative and technical skills that I have gained from this class could be apply to my future public health projects\/assignments.",
    "The text book is not very informative but the course itself has been very useful in reading papers and in discussion with fellow scientists on analysis data. I would recommend it based on Elizabeth Claus's teaching and the concepts learned in the course.",
    "The lecture is useful, good idea to attend, The SAS section is hard- you will spend a LOT of hours doing the work for the class. Don't expect to learn SAS with this class- the TA's are unable to help, so homework is a good time to teach yourself how to use SAS.",
    "very good",
    "Yes, definitely if a student is looking to learn basic statistical concepts.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biostatistics I. The class provides the foundation of basic biostatistics. We covered the statistical methods and when it is appropriate to use them. The course provides beginner knowledge of using SAS to analyze data.",
    "Solid introduction to Biostats, with a good and sympathetic instructor. I would recommend it (especially if it's a requirement).",
    "Great instruction by Dr. Claus! But choose your lab session carefullyas the TA can sometimes make or break the experience.",
    "It is required, but Claus is great.",
    "A good introduction to statistics and SAS asapplied to health issues. I would recommend it those in my situation -- having had statistics previously but not a clear recollection or grasp of what was taught in that course.",
    "An overview of fundamental principles of statistics.",
    "I enjoyed the course very much, and the computer labs for SAS were especially interesting for me. This is a good introductory course. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Fellow student, you don't have any choice whether you'll take this class or not, but be glad: you'll be challenged, you'll learn a lot, and Prof. Claus tells some great jokes.",
    "It is a good introductory biostatistics course with fair amount of courseload. I recommend it for anyone who has never taken such course before.",
    "This is a very good introductory statistics course. Dr. Claus presents the material in a clear and effective material. Her lectures are very useful -- to learn the material as efficiently as possible for the exam, I highly recommend attending lecture.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because the student will learn the basics of statistics which he or she will need to understand in preparation for higher level classes",
    "The course is a strong introduction to biostatistics.",
    "Intro to Biostats I is an essential class and is foundational to learning about test statistics, p values, regression etc. I would recommend taking the course but caution that at different junctures of the class make sure you know where the particular test statistic\/calculations you are doing fit into the bigger picture. This way you'll be better prepared for the test. Also, make your own notes because though it is open book, the time for the exam might not be enough to flip through the book."
