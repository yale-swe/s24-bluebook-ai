    "I strongly recommend Korean 120 to anyone who already took Korean 110 or who placed into the class and is interested in Korean. Professor Choi's teaching style is slightly different from Professor Lee-Smith, but you will grow to like the class and the teacher. The workload is not bad at all, and as long as you keep up with the assignments and vocabulary, it will be a pleasurable experience.",
    "I would definitely not recommend this class to fellow students because I didn't feel like the classroom environment was conducive for learning a language.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It makes a great and manageable fifth course, and the department is great as well."
