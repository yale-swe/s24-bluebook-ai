   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It is interesting and one of the more fun classes I have taken at Yale in terms of the assignments.",
    "Total gut class, take it for an easy grade.",
    "A fantastic overview of everything you need to know about food policy from a liberal side of view; most conservative points are also represented, but I recommend supplementing with some outside reading, especially of works by conventional farmers.",
    "Fun class to learn about topics currently being discussed in the food industry and regulatory agencies.",
    "Yes I would. Just realize that this is not a got class. There are a lot of readings that are tested over, and the final project can easily sneak up on you.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to others. Just be prepared to read a lot of articles prior to each class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, I think it might be my favorite class I've taken atYale. I would 100% recommend it to everyone - I am a biology major and I found it amazing, and it is so relevant to ANY major, so I would recommend it to any type of student. The material is extremely relevant to so many aspects of academia and real life, and I truly found every topic we covered extremely interesting. Dr. Brownell is obviously the most prominent name in the field and he knows SO much about absolutely everything. I cannot even begin to describe how amazing it was to take a class with someone so knowledgeable and clearly dedicated to his field of study. He truly knew how to get everyone interested and motivated and each of his lectures promised to be more captivating than the last. By the end of the course, I left feeling like I knew so much more about such a wide array of topics - from advertising, to eating disorders, to hunger to politics. Definitely, definitely, definitely take this course if you have the opportunity.",
    "The Psychology, Biology, and Politics of Food takes you through the major issues and questions involving food that face consumers and the industry today. We covered the agricultural revolution, GMOs, concentrated animal farming operations, eating disorders, nutrition, health, hunger, the economics of food, advertising, big businesses, nutrition in schools, the environment, high fructose corn syrup and the corn system, government, and change. There were a lot of assignments for this class, but the final project was an awesome opportunity to get creative and I wound up really, really enjoying the work for the class, even at then end. There's an in-class midterm and final. Kelly Brownell is great and an expert. I would recommend this course.",
    "The work is not hard. a short op-ed, a project of your choice, and a midterm and final that were not too difficult. Material is interesting, but Prof. Brownell's presentation of the material is very biased, so it seemed a little too much preaching at times, even for someone who agrees with him.",
    "Proves that food dictates our world",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is not too much work (all of the work is near the end of the semester). It is a great 5th class, and you might find, as I did, that the material is actually very interesting.",
    "YES good as it sounds",
    "Psych 123 was a good class that covered interesting issues and inspired me to want to get more active in reforming the food industry. I would recommend to anyone interested in food policy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was a great class that is important to know for life, not just for a grade. The material will cause you to change your diet or at least consider it, and it is interesting.",
    "A low stress class that teaches you a lot of life knowledge. Take this if you are interested in the food you eat. A lot of opinion is involved, but the class will leave you feeling inspired to change our food system.",
    "It was cool information, very easy.",
    "Professor Brownell is leaving after this year, so I'm not sure if it will be offered again. If another Professor picks it up, I'd wait to see how they are before taking it. Brownell definitely made the course what it is.",
    "Definitely take this!",
    "Take it! If you go to class and take good notes, you're pretty much guaranteed an A.",
    "Easy course, fun topics. Definitely take it if you need a 5th class.",
    "Great class, would def recommend it.",
    "Great large lecture. I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The lectures are interesting although their is no wifi in the room. Make sure to start the final project early because it is a large amount of points.",
    "I would recommend it if they are looking for an informational course on the current food environment, and the relevant issues in the field. Really an eye-opening class.",
    "Definitely recommended as a human being - these are pressing issues you should have an opinion about!",
    "Gem, really interesting information and not too difficult. Fun projects and enjoyable lectures.",
    "Yes. Awesome class.",
    "Great class, super interesting, will really change how you view food. Not a ton of workload, but very backloaded, expect to work a decent amount in the last 4 weeks of the class.",
    "You should definitely take this course. It is not very difficult, and the material is fairly interesting and intuitive. You should probably go to lecture though as the exams are fairly specific. The reading is only really mandatory if you don't attend the lectures and if you want to incorporate it into your concept sheet.",
    "Great class. Easy to do well in. You'll learn a lot if you put the effort in.",
    "An eye-opening course about everything food. I would recommend this to any student -- food and what goes through your body is important to know!",
    "Food psych is a class that focused on the study of issues related to food in the world currently and over the past few decades",
    "Amazing course. Very interesting and it is really helpful to go to class and pay attention. You do no really need to take notes as the slides are online. If you don't go you won't know what the slides are referring to when you study. The midterm is HARD. Concept sheets and projects are graded easily.",
    "Yes! TAKE THIS COURSE. It is so fascinating, and not a huge amount of work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Brownell is very knowledgeable in his field - it's too bad he's moving to Duke after this year. Very rarely do you find a class at Yale that covers the subject of food so completely (marketing, policy, etc.), but it's a subject that affects everyone and therefore one that shouldn't be missed. You should know what goes into your food!Grading wise, the class consists of a midterm (20%), weekly concept sheets (15%), an op-ed (15%), a final project (25%), and a final (25%). If you keep up with the readings you won't regret it. You'll get out of this class what you put in.",
    "Definitely a great filler class--pretty easy workload and the tests are doable. A very interesting topic and very relevant to society today. Everyone should take it before they graduate!",
    "Solid class. Workload is manageable and class is pretty interesting. Recommend it.",
    "Take it- whether you fall into the track of psych, bio, poli sci, or other, this course really is all-encompassing and will make you think about aspects of everyday food in a new light. Make sure you eat lunch before class though, because it always made me hungry.",
    "If they offer it again, it won't be with Prof. Brownell who is going to Duke to head up the public policy school. But Brownell's class was interesting and really made you think critically about how public policies affect people. If the professor is anywhere close to as established as Prof. Brownell(which is unlikely given his credentials) then take it.",
    "Somewhat boring due to the material",
    "I would recommend this class but Brownell's leaving. Hopefully another teacher steps up to teach a similar course because this is a topic is everyone should learn about.",
    "Completely straightforward class. The material is interesting and there is certainly a lot of it, but otherwise, it actually reminded me of a high school course. Show up to class and take notes. Exams are as straightforward as they get. Reading is assigned, but only one question per exam will deal with the readings, and it won't be on something obscure.I need a social science credit, and this was as good a credit as any.",
    "Good topics but Brownell has a monotonous voice and it can be hard to stay awake in class.",
    "Everything you could ever want to know about food! I find the topic fascinating, and extremely relevant in today's modern age. Totally recommend it--although I realize that might not be helpful, since Kelly Brownell isn't returning to Yale next year.",
    "So interesting. Not that much work. Good 5th class.",
    "Yeah go ahead and take it. I took it CR\/D and it was a perfect class for that",
    "Interesting course that is not much work at all. Just study for the midterm and final and you will be fine. The final project was very fun to do! definitely recommend the course!",
    "A lot more about the politics of food rather than the psychology or biology part. Guarantee it will permanently change the way you look at food and your interaction with it.",
    "This is a fun class, interesting material.",
    "GREAT CLASS. You learn about every aspect of food, from food and addiction, to GMOs, to how law is written and food controversies. Each class was packed with a lot of information, but concept sheets, the final project, and the two tests were generously graded. The readings were actually super interesting, too.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if only for the reason that they will look at their food and their food choices in a different way once the course has been completed. It is very practical for everyday life and was a great class to take.",
    "its easy if you find it interesting, all you have to do is pay attention and do the assignments, and you'll do well",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course. Interesting stuff to be learned.",
    "I took it to fill a hole in my schedule and it was a really nice surprise, I never skipped a lecture and because of that I was pretty set for tests. It's easy, and you will usually leave each class having learned an interesting thing that really does matter to your life!",
    "This course was awesome! The material is so fascinating and covers topics in politics, the environment, biology, and more. Each class was unique and interesting. It's also great taking a class from a Professor who has truly made an impact in his field. The assignments are all enjoyable and not overwhelming. Great class!",
    "Yes. If you eat food, you should be very interested in taking this class and learning more about the industry. It is well-taught and you get to do a final project that can be anything you want.",
    "Take it! It's relevant to everyday life and not too hard.",
    "Highly recommend",
    "This course talks about relevant issues in society relating to food and will benefit you when you are older and shopping for food.",
    "This is a great class if you're interested in public health policy or learning about ways to be more active in your food choices. It's not a gut though so don't take it for an easy A",
    "Best course I have taken at Yale so far. One of the courses that actually leaves something with you, not just a grade.",
    "Interesting class about important and relevant information to our society today. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Easy, interesting, awesome class.",
    "A good class to take if you're interested in the body& its relationship with food!",
    "It's a good class on a super important\/relevant topic. It's as hard as you want it to be (as in you can put a lot of effort into weekly assignments\/the final project if you're into it) but it's honestly very easy to get an A. Ideal as a fifth.",
    "Basically it covers everything related to food, food production, food consumers, food industry.. It touches a little on psychology, but overall was a good course that I would recommend! Not your usual psychology course.",
    "Best class at yale, take it take it take it!",
    "I do not think this course will be offered again because he is leaving, but if you have the opportunity definitely take it. It is surprising how much I learned by taking this course.",
    "Yes. The material is pretty interesting, if not just generally important. There is a big workload (weekly responses, midterm exam, op-ed, final project, and final exam) but grading is ridiculously easy. It's definitely a great fifth class.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you're EXTREMELY interested in food policy in modern America",
    "Good class, recommended.",
    "You'll learn about public health strategies at encouraging healthier food consumption. Lots of relevant material without too many requirements and nothing taxing. The guest lecture with all the monks was really interesting, but I don't know if that will happen again.",
    "Yes absolutely, take this course. It is a must for all Yale students.",
    "I loved this class! Definitely take it. Weekly assignments really boost your grade, as they aren't challenging and keep you on top of the reading.",
    "It is an interesting class with a relatively light workload. The midterm was extremely difficult but everything else was fair and easy as long as the work is put in. I recommend it in that I learned to view food and public health in a different, more detailed light. The guest lecturers were interesting and knowledgable as well.",
    "Take it but don't bother showing up. interesting material, lectures are boring beyond comprehension",
    "Yes! It is an interesting course for pretty much everyone",
    "Yes, I would 100% recommend this class to any student. It is really unfortunate that Professor Brownell will be leaving Yale as he made this class fabulous. Great professor, interesting material, learned a ton.",
    "Definitely! One of my favorite lectures at Yale.",
    "I would recommend it as a good fifth class. The material is mostly issues you've probably heard a little about before, but it's nice to learn about them in a formal classroom setting. The workload isn't super heavy though, which is nice.",
    "Great class. Would recommend",
    "This is a great class to take if you are interesting in learning about relevant food issues. It is not an intense work load, but it does require an understanding and attention to key topics. I would definitely recommend taking this course. You will learn important information that is very relevant to our world today.",
    "This was such an incredible class. I think I have learned more practical knowledge from this class than any other at Yale. Every American should be required to take a course on nutrition education. I took this class as my fun extra class and ended up loving more than any of my others. This will totally change the way you think about food.\\TAKE IT",
    "Comprehensive discussion on the psychological, biological, and political aspects related to eating. Focuses more on psychology and politics. Topics range from calorie counting and mindless eating, to eating disorders, to obesity and diabetes, to food insecurity and malnutrition, to the Farm Bill.Workload: weekly 1-2page concept sheets, midterm, op-ed, final project, final exam on last day of class",
    "It is a very fun, informative class. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYC 123 to everyone. Although it is listed under Psychology really anyone can take this course. It's a very practical course. A lot of what I learned in class I can apply in my daily life. The course has changed the way I think about food and diet. Not only does the course make you think about your personal food choices but also the role of the government and food industry and how we as individuals can improve our food environment.The grade for the course is based on: weekly concept sheets, an op-ed, midterm exam, final exam and a final project. Noneof the assignments are very difficult. The final project is completely open ended and students can decide what they would like to turn in as their final project. For more information on the course, including syllabus and assignments check out the course website: https:\/\/webspace.yale.edu\/psyc123\/",
    "Material is very interesting and relevant.",
    "Only if you're really interested. Otherwise it is a lot of work and not very interesting.",
    "Definitely take this course - it is a great intellectual food experience. But if you are definitely not interested in food politics, skip it.",
    "An absolutely phenomenal course. Yale is losing a great in Brownell",
    "The best lecture class I have taken at Yale, hands down. Assignments encourage creativity, professor acknowledges his bias and encourages students to formulate their own opinions.If Brownell wasn't leaving, I'd say take it. His open-mindedness and real world assignments made the class.",
    "TAKE IT. Great class, Brownell is top of his field and very clearly knows his stuff. I loved it. It's not hard at all if you pay attention in class and\/or do the readings (usually one of two will do). The midterm might be hard but the rest of the stuff that comes after it compensates for that.",
    "Great class.",
    "This course is definitely worth taking and you will take everything you learn into the real world. I would have to say this is one of the most fascinating and enjoyable classes at Yale (at least that I've taken so far).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student because it was so interesting and the assignments were creative and really comprehensive. The class taught important lessons and made me more aware about the food environment that we live in.",
    "You learn a lot",
    "It is a course every student should take.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. I learned so much this semester - information that is just good to know as a person and a citizen. It is not a gut - there is a lot of information, and there are regular assignments. But what is great is that there is a lot of freedom in the assignments to focus on what interests you the most, and I am proud of the work I produced this semester.",
    "I would recommend this class. Not a lot of work, no section and the lectures are very interesting. We eat food every day and yet we never think about it. Great class",
    "Easy class. Information not that new or surprising, cocktail party material about how terrible the food\/meat industries or the food environment are. I'd recommend only if you need an easy class to satisfy requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "It's an extremely interesting class and changes how you look at the food systems in America. Highly recommend it!",
    "Take it! It will teach you so much about big food, you'll never be able to drink soda the same way again. Prepare to have your mind opened.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes. Great class interesting and not too taxing. Just go to class!",
    "Without Professor Brownell, I wouldn't recommend it. He's literally the authority on these issues, so the chance to have him as a professor for a semester was great. Now that he's off to Stanford, however, that major benefit is gone...",
    "Great class that I totally recommend to anyone who likes food!",
    "I recommend this course if you want a big lecture class that is easy to follow and certainly enjoyable. It is not a particularly hard class but required sufficient effort to succeed in.",
    "Lecture twice a week, weekly one-page reading responses, two midterms, an op-ed, and a final project. This class required more work than I had expected, and we covered a lot of topics so studying for the exams was cumbersome due to the breadth of the course. Many of the topics were really interesting, some were less than interesting, and others were so-so. Overall, I enjoyed the class, and I feel a lot more knowledgeable about where my food comes from, policies affecting food and health, and how the food industry operates.",
    "easy, interesting, and important. take if you can.",
    "Definitely!! Interesting class on multiple levels. You'll learn much more than you'd expect.",
    "Definitely! It's one of those classes that really teaches you useful information to be an informed modern citizen and consumer. The workload is also very reasonable.",
    "This is an amazing, amazing class. Definitely my favorite class taken at Yale. It's not a lot of work, but that's not why I liked it so much--the work was so worthwhile and actually productive to learning. I enjoyed every single moment of this class--whether I was doing the readings (which were all super interesting and relevant), sitting in lecture (which was so engaging), or doing the super cool and creative assignments. It's a shame that Brownell is leaving and won't be teaching this anymore, because he's such a genius in this field (and actually an awesome lecturer too). But the topic is cool enough that if you're interested, you should definitely take it no matter the instructor.",
    "Take it! Great course",
    "Definitely take this class! It is fascinating for anyone with an interest in food and food-related issues. The class is very well structured, and we learned about various important issues pertaining to food, such as food policy, sustainability, and eating disorders. It is not a super demanding class, but I definitely got a lot out of it. You have a midterm, final, an op-ed to write, and a final project. Both the op-ed and final project leave a lot of room for creativity (I did a painting for the project) and were really enjoyable and interesting. Professor Brownell also brings in a lot of guest lecturers who are experts in their fields, which definitely adds to the class.",
    "A class about different aspects of food. Very relaxed lectures, reading responses, and final projects. One of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "Survey of important and relevant food issues.",
    "It was a good course that I would recommend as a fifth credit, I do not think I learned enough to take it as one of four classes, but it's good for one of five classes",
    "Absolutely. Everyone should take it because it is interesting and relevant.",
    "All my life I have dealt with high cholesterol, diets, and food stamps. This class explores a lot of important issues that are relevant to everyday life decisions!",
    "Wonderful professor, brilliant mind, and not too heavy workload. Fascinating material as well. Very sad he's leaving, as I'd recommend this class to all of my friends",
    "Yes! It won't be offered again.",
    "This course is a great introduction to understanding food as a social, political, and economic issue and the reasons for the current food environment. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in food policy, activism, or sustainability. Definitely not a gut, though the workload is very manageable.",
    "A must take!",
    "Psychology 123 is a fun and interesting class where you learn about issues that affect you every day. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in food issues\/food policy. It's interesting and not hard at all.",
    "Take it",
    "This class was an interesting elective for me, I took this class without filling any requirement, just for enjoyment and interest. All in all, it was my most interesting class of the semester. The work load is reasonable, just make sure to study for the tests. I would recommend this class to fellow students.",
    "One of those classes that will change the way you think for the rest of your life. If you go to lecture and engage with the material you'll have a really rewarding experience. That being said, you get as much out of it as you put into it. There are a few small assignments here and there, a midterm, a project, and a final. Relatively easy but SO worthwhile.",
    "Really good classVery recommended",
    "Yes because It had been my favorite class at Yale",
    "Yes!",
    "absolutely--really enlightening",
    "This class is an overview of a startlingly relevant issue. A lot of topics are covered, some only briefly and without getting past common knowledge; however, when a topic is given enough time to go into detail that is not well known, it can be eye-opening. There are a lot of readings, some of which are really interesting and some of which are really long and tedious explanations of studies with obvious results. The class is not that much work and is a great fifth class.",
    "It may sound like a lot of work with the weekly concept sheets, op\/ed, midterm, final paper and final exam, but really it's quite manageable and a really interesting course. I'd recommend it even to people who aren't majoring in psych, like myself.",
    "Good credit\/d class. Didn't go once...passed",
    "Excellent class with very interesting information. The professor's opinions are clear but he's careful to present both sides fairly.",
    "Interesting and engaging class, makes you think about what you eat and what role you play in the food system of America",
    "Yes because it touches very important aspects of everyday life&gets yo you thinking about the things that surround us every day",
    "Very interesting class, I learned the most in this class out of any second semester class I took. Definitely recommend it, as the topics covered are very relevant to our daily lives and our futures",
    "Psych, Bio, and Politics of Food was a great class. Before the class, I was familiar with the health and environmental hazards of the meat industry. While I was a little disappointed Kelly did not go into this topic more, I learned a lot about other food controversies that I don't think I would have been exposed to otherwise. I found the reading responses (about 8 total) forced me to stay on top of my readings, which were really integral to the structure of the class. Likewise the op-ed project and the unconventional final project (for which you could basically do anything you want) gave students a more exciting way to engage with the material. There was a midterm and final exam, which weren't too hard. While I still have questions in my mind about why Kelly has omitted a whole lot of discussion on the meat industry, I see that he has focused instead on his expertise. He is a renowned scientist and activist in the field of public health, and I would definitely recommend his class.",
    "Great class with a manageable amount of work and interesting assignments. The TAs were fair graders and you can learn a lot about nutrition and the food industry through the lectures. Definitely recommend, though Professor Brownell is leaving so it might change in the future.",
    "Take this class if you're considering it! The tests require some memorization, but it's not too bad because they questions test knowledge that you should not and not random details. There's usually at least one question based only on the reading and not the lecture so make sure you know the general idea for each reading!",
    "Interesting information and great guest lectures. More work in the second half than first half of the semester.",
    "This class is very interesting as it deals with very current issues dealing with food policy, food agriculture, and many current controversies in this field. I liked reading current articles each week. This class is overall easy, however, the midterm and final were a bit more challenging. This class was really enjoyable and gives you freedom to write\/ research food topics that are of great interest to you. There are many different sides\/aspects to this field.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student. This class teaches you about our diet and public health and how it all relates to our actions. It is very life applicable and encourages one to change their diet and better the human health.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class to another student. Something different",
    "Highly recommend it - I think it is both an enjoyable and very important class that teaches about an issue that everyone should know about.",
    "You learn fascinating things about the food industry and food in general! This course reminded me of Intro Psych in that the material was generally interesting and applicable to my life. I see examples of the concepts Professor Brownellteaches all the time in the dining halls, and I feel more conscious of what I eat. The workload isn't bad at all: one concept sheet per week, a midterm, a final, and a leniently graded final project. There is a lot of reading, but if you find yourself a little behind on them, it's no big deal. You're really only responsible for them on the exams.",
    "Not a gut. Interesting class on food (I mean, how much food sucks nowadays and how we're getting fat and unhealthy) besides some borign talk on agriculture.",
    "This is a great overview of important issues exposes us to the field of public health and the interactive effect of multiple disciplines on the food environment",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! Its a course that will change the way you think about the world and about eating.",
    "Good class but information is a little intuitive and tests are focused on unexpected things",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS.It is fascinating. Even if you don't end up changing how you think or act about the issues, you are sure to learn a lot. It isn't a lot of work and is so worth whatever time you put into it.",
    "Good class, pretty easy topic. A lot of it is common sense, but with some evidence backing it. Very little work involved, and the slides are online if you dont make it to class. There is no section which is also nice.",
    "Great class!! Interesting lectures and leeway to pursue whatever your specific interests are.",
    "Food Psych is an amazing class. Not a lot of work, lectures are great, the Professor is amazing, and you learn so much. Take the class!",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. Professor Brownell is the world's leading expert on food related issues and nutrition, and this class covers such a wide-range of fascinating material. I really loved going to lecture; it was always interesting, and the course gave me an incredible background on a variety of different food-related issues. Other students in the class constantly raved about how good the course is, and I couldn't recommend this class more highly. Take it. You will love it, and learn a ton. It's an amazing experience.",
    "This course is an excellent overview of the food industry. While some of the topics seem like common sense, I learned a lot about food policy and marketing. The workload was reasonable, but review the readings carefully for the midterm and final.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially if you have an interest in the food climate of our country\/the world. I consider myself to be pretty knowledgable about food, nutrition, and the environment, but I still feel like I learned a lot.",
    "This class examines the many aspects of our modern food environment. These aspects include food safety, public health, sustainable agriculture, modern agriculture, food politics, and future challenges.",
    "An intriguing intro to the origins of our food and the current dynamics of the food industry today. I definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "This is an engaging lecture course that covers some of the most important issues of our time. It crosses disciplines and gives students a strong foundation in the modern food landscape, and the ratio of intellectual reward to boredom\/busy work is very favorable. Absolutely take the class, and then maybe dedicate your life to the issue.",
    "An amazing class in an amazingly important topic at this time. It is an absolute must take (if someone really good comes to teach it in place of Brownell) and if not then maybe it's not worth bothering.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone with minimal knowledge of current food policy and nutrition issues, as it is very basic, though informative if you don't know much going in. May be boring to students with a more in-depth or sophisticated knowledge of the US food system."
