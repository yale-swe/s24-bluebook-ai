    "Greek L2 was taught by George this semester who has, fortunately, taught Modern Greek formany years. I found George's teaching style to be very different from Maria's (Greek L1), but one that was definitely for the better. George elevated the intensity of this class to a more conversational and grammar-heavy course. With biweekly quizzes (1 on vocabulary and 1 on grammar), I have to say that I learned a LOT this semester. Vocabulary quizzes often covered 100-200 words, but this studying was made up by simple homework assignments on nights that weren't dedicated to studying for the quizzes. Overall, I would highly recommend this course for anyone looking to learn more about Greek culture and Greek language. George was fantastic!"
