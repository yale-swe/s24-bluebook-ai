    "The material is very interesting and important. I loved all of the readings, which I've been wanting to do for a while, and this class provided the perfect setting to dig into such formative thinkers and their texts. Generally, the people in the class were smart and genuinely invested in the material. Basically, it was a very reasonable amount of work for a lot of reward. Lectures could have been presented more clearly\/with more structure, but section made this class special. Hari was an amazing TF and the students in my section were great. It was a great time to take this class considering what's been happening on campus this semester. I'm glad I took the class.",
    "It's a great fifth course. There was a take home midterm and a final paper. It can't really get much easier than that. And the material is really interesting and relevant to today's society. Also, the discussion sections were awesome and made the course. I would encourage students to take it.",
    "Historical and theoretical overview of the concept of nonviolence, as framed primarily by Gandhi and King, as well as other intellectuals and practitioners. If you are interested in the material, it's a nice comparative perspective that continues to be relevant today.",
    "It is a really comprehensive look at the theories and history of both Gandhi and King with a (sadly a bit short) section at the end to see how this compares with other nonviolent movements. I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. I think it not only teaches you incredibly interesting history but also helps you challenge your preconceptions about peace and nonviolence and analyze current conflicts through the lenses of the past.",
    "A solid survey of the philosophies and ideas that motivated Gandhi and MLK during their respective nonviolent movements. You will read lots of letters, essays, and books written by Gandhi and King, and you will discuss them in detail during discussion section. The vast majority of what you get out of this course will come from these readings and section. Unfortunately, Professor Mantena is an inept professor who is disorganized, dry, and unenlightening. Her lectures are a bland summary of the weekly readings, and I found it wholly unhelpful to attend if I had made even a cursory attempt at reading the weekly material. That being said, I still got a lot out of the course form the readings, my TF, and my classmates. Niloufer and Hari are incredible TFs, and you will learn a lot from them as discussion leaders and as people. In terms of the material, I would have appreciated more thorough discussions of arguments against and issues with nonviolent civil disobedience. At times, it seemed like we took for granted that nonviolence is the most moral, just, and effective form of resistance. In reality, there are significant issues with nonviolence, just as there are with violence. Overall, I would recommend.",
    "Yes, take it. If you care about peacemaking, rights, justice and such topics.",
    "This class was especially interesting because of everything that was happening on campus. It gave much needed perspective on the idea of nonviolence and how nonviolent movements succeed or fail. The section for this class was by far the best I've had at Yale. The workload was light and lectures were engaging enough.",
    "Take this with reservations. The nonviolent resistance theory was fascinating (if you did the reading, which you can get away with not doing), but it also was skimmed over in most of the course (the bulk of it focused on Gandhi's and King's writings, which were somewhat repetitive and less rigorous from a theoretical standpoint). Meanwhile, authors like Gene Sharp, Shridharani, etc. who had more developed, structural grasps on nonviolent resistance as theory were crammed in and given little weight, which made it difficult when writing the final exam and midterm paper, which asked highly theoretical questions in a way that Gandhi's and King's work did not adequately address. However, the workload was relatively light (just those two assignments, and participation in section), and you can get away with not doing most of the reading. Also, beware that Professor Mantena is not a particularly gifted lecturer and is certainly the most difficult to follow professor I've had. Her slideshows are gimmicky with little actual information, which is incredibly unhelpful since she rambles in class with little coherence. She definitely knows the material, but I get the sense that she's really not comfortable behind a podium. Half her sentences are halfway uttered before she stops abruptly and then changes direction of her thought without completely the previous one, making it difficult for even students who paid a lot of attention to understand what she was getting at.",
    "Worth taking for a variety of reasons. For those with a passionate interest in the subject, the readings are exceptional and provide a wealth of information. For the rest, the class offers a unique combination of a light workload that still leads you to retain a good deal of useful and interesting knowledge the take-home midterm and final paper both draw on lectures and course reading, allowing you to condense and demonstrate knowledge in a low(er)-stress context. At times the lectures and slides dragged on me, but the material was neat and very relevant in the modern world.",
    "Great information, great readings, very applicable during this past semester with everything that occurred on campus. That being said, Professor Mantena was a poor lecturer, making lecture not only boring but also not beneficial. Information is good, however, so take the course and be sure to take advantage of the readings.",
    "Not worth it. The class doesn't have much work, which attracted me at first (participation, take-home midterm, final paper), but Professor Mantena is a boring lecturer who speaks in a monotone. I really enjoyed my section (Hari Ramesh was a fantastic TF), but if you really want to take this class, make sure you can handle it by shopping a lecture or two and deciding if you can really be engaged.",
    "Yes! Relevant class that isn't terribly difficult.",
    "10 out of 10 would recommend. Great class for student organizers.",
    "Overall, this course provided a thought-provoking, if repetitive, look at the theoretical and practical underpinnings of nonviolence, an important element of political philosophy. The section was great--perhaps the best section I've had at Yale, with engaging discussion and good structure. The lectures, though, stumbled over themselves a bit and repeated a lot. This course tried to do a lot: comparative politics, political philosophy, and history, and ended up overreaching a bit. Still, a fairly good look at the subject.",
    "Definitely take, easy class and very interesting",
    "This is a fine class, but do know that it is quite political science-y in that much of what the course deals with is theoretical: It is the POLITICS, not practice, of nonviolence. If that sounds like your jam, go for it.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! I learned a lot about Gandhi, and about the actual strategic and principled rationale behind nonviolence as opposed to the superficial idealized portray of nonviolent movements. The assignments were interesting and worthwhile. The lectures were a little scattered, but I definitely learned a lot.",
    "This course was okay, but honestly not my favorite. I think lecture could have been better organized, and the thematic concepts we visited got very repetitive by the end. Professor Mantena has clearly thought about the content deeply, but her course lacked shape and purpose. My section, however, was FANTASTIC, so if you decide to take it, try to get Hari Ramesh as your teaching fellow.",
    "Great class & introduction to nonviolent resistance theory. Take it!",
    "Interesting, important, and necessary to take especially with all the conflict going on today. It explians nonviolent politics and its strategies through two of the most successful nonviolent leaders, and it shows you the difference between violence and nonviolence, as well as the importance of it. I had a great experience because of a wonderful TA and Professor Mantena is wonderful!",
    "This class was excellent. Professor Mantena takes you through the histories of several notable social movements, centering largely on Gandhi and King, and provides a space to become acquainted with the history and theory that guided them. But it pushes further into thinking what the role of nonviolent direct action is within political theory and democracy more generally. For anyone interested in political movements and their study, this is an essential introduction point.",
    "Take this class if you want to get engrossed in the writings of Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (as well as earlier figures such as Tolstoy, and King's contemporaries such as Stokely Carmichael and other black activists). Lectures tend to be interesting, but discussion section is the real highlight. The TA's are excellent facilitators and the discussion moves easily between discussions of political philosophy in the figures' writings to analysis of contemporary social movements and instances of nonviolent action. The workload is not too difficult, but you can get a lot out of the class if you do the readings and challenge yourself in section. Definitely worth shopping to get an impression of the themes and the Professor's style!",
    "An ok class with a light workload. Be warned that the material can feel very abstract and lectures are sometimes hard to follow.",
    "Great class, lectures are a little boring but the material is worth it. Learning more about the influencing political thinkers and philosophy's on Gandhi and King was key to understanding their own theories and practice. When we actually got to their work, it was amazing what we learned in observing and reflecting upon the texts. This class is great for really understanding political organizing and learning more about these great leaders that you cannot gather just from learning about their movements.",
    "I would recommend this class but with a couple qualifiers. The lectures are a bit scattered and by the end seem a bit repetitive. However Prof. Mantena has a lot of really interesting thoughts and draws some interesting conclusions from the readings. The class is well crafted and even without the lectures you can follow the general arc. This class had the ABSOLUTE BEST SECTION I've been in. It was a great mix of leading and letting the students munch on the material and mull over the theory. The exam and papers aren't bad. I got a lot out of this course and think that it is a very well timed course for current events.",
    "Yes! its an amazing class and very relevant to today especially what is occurring right now with the Black Lives Matter.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload is very reasonable and the material is very interesting and very relevant. Professor Mantena gives good lectures that are interesting and easy to follow, and the TFs were excellent. Very solid course."
