   "comments": [
    "This was an eye-opening class that changed the way I think about race, class, ethnicity, and gender. I enjoyed learning about different cultures, the difficulties they faced, and how groups were able to challenge these injustices.",
    "I learned about the tactics involved in social movements. By analyzing nonviolent resistance movements, we can better determine the efficacy of a movement. I learned to pay attention to patterns and general trends.",
    "I learned about new ways to think about social movements\/revolutions and the strategies they can use.",
    "How to think critically about developing a social movement",
    "I learned how to create an effective political and\/or social movement. Using both the works of scholars and by looking directly at case studies, I was able to learn why movements fail and succeed in different circumstances. I learned about all the key elements of a movement: choosing a topic to mobilize people around, who to aim the movement at, coming up with an effective solution, how and who to mobilize, and tactics.",
    "The course provided a good historical overview of main revolutionary movements and mobilizations. It also discussed different political models and theories in relation to those movements. The course is writing and reading intensive and helps you analyze and respond to readings. The final project is designing your own social movement and applying what you learned. Lots of good tips for activists trying to get involved.",
    "In this class, I really enjoyed learning about the inner workings of social movements, both in theory and in practice.",
    "I learned alot about the injustices of the world and just how to get a movement going, which was interesting to learn about.",
    "How to better understand non-violent movements and the theories behind them.",
    "I come from a community that faces great institutional oppression, as well as grass roots racism from white aggressors. There aren't a lot of effort to enact change. It was refreshing to learn about successful and unsuccessful movements and why they were so because I come from a place of unchanging stagnation. The class has motivated me to work towards a better community back home and I've taken measures to work with youth because of what I have learned in this class.",
    "I learned a lot of applicable skills concerning non-violent protest, and what has historically worked and what has not.",
    "In this class I learned about the history of social movements and the sociology behind behaviors within social movements. We also learned about tactics and philosophies regarding revolution."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I liked that the class covered a lot of material. I wish we had spoken more about healthcare inequality however, because I believe it is a significant historical injustice that has and needs to be contested.",
    "I think the class did a great job of facilitating active discussions even though it was a lecture class. Since I took the course writing intensive, I found section to be very helpful to discuss the readings that were assigned.",
    "Could use more work in small groups and engaging discussion. Really liked those more intimate classes.",
    "The course is good overall and Professor Wood varies what we do in class which is nice.",
    "Strengths: Engaging readings Engaging course material overall Course well-structured thematically Weaknesses: Lectures a bit too fast to take effective notes (it would help if lecture notes were posted prior to the day of the lecture) A lot of material to cover Vague assignment instructions (for readings and for essays) and not much guidance",
    "The course is sort of organized like a high school class, which has its good and bad points. It's fairly easy to do well if you do all the work for it and study for the exams, and the course is very clearly structured. However, some of the grading is unfair (three response papers are graded on a 3-point scale but weighted a large percentage of your grade), and even the non-writing section of the class is very writing intensive. Additionally, it's hard to be engaged in the class if you don't have any personal experience with the topic.",
    "This course is amazing in terms of the topic but I think that the class isn't as organized as it could be, which made it very difficult to learn in.",
    "More of an emphasis of current movements. As well as more in depth studying of multiple movements.",
    "The strength of this course is the material, how it is taught, and who is taught by. Who wouldn't want to learn about how to overthrow oppressive regimes, especially during the Trump administration. It is taught in a more hands-on inclusive manner than most classes at Yale. There are a lot of movies and small group discussions that help students learn from each other's insights and not just purely from the words of the professor. This is not to say that Prof. Wood and her team this semester were not amazing. Their ability to address questions and facilitate an efficient learning atmosphere was great. The weaknesses of the class were that because of how long some assignments were, in comparison to how they were weighted in the grading scale, resulted in very little incentive to turn in quality work.",
    "The course was focused on non-violent protest, and I would have liked to learn about more violent protest.",
    "The class had great content and a great professor, but the assignments are scattered and not constructive.",
    "The topics are interesting and the lecture style is engaging. There could be more direction on what is expected of response papers and essays. Although there is a lot of note taking, this professor knows what she is talking about and clearly is passionate about the subject."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I think everyone should shop this class if they are interested in looking at different cultures from a unique perspective.",
    "I think this course was important to take especially during today's political climate. Also, taking the course writing intensive, gave me the freedom to explore topics that were not fully covered in the lectures. If you are not a fan of learning about social movements, I would definitely not take this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course to someone looking to examine social movements from the political science perspective",
    "It is a great course for an overview of social movement theory.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend to anyone who is even remotely interested in social or political causes. The course flipped my perspective on movements: organizing an effective nonviolent movement is like war in terms of strategy and is much more complex than it seems. This course not only made me appreciate movements but also gives so much practical knowledge on how to convince people, galvanize people, build community, and other skills useful, but not exclusive to, organizing a movement. Professor Wood makes it clear that she wants us to come out of this course as well-equipped activists. At the end of each topic, Professor Wood always includes \"Takeaways for Activists\" or something along those lines. In reading response papers and tests, there are always essay questions that ask us to synthesize and even apply the material we learn in class to a cause of our choice. As someone interested in activism, I loved this course. Also, almost all of the course materials are posted by the instructor or could easily be found online or borrowed, so I didn't have to spend much on course materials.",
    "If you're passionate about community movements, revolutions, and protest, this is the perfect course for you. I'd say the course is around half history and half political science, and there's an element of personal involvement with it that's especially good if you have experience with such movements. However, if you don't have too much interest in the topic, don't take the class!! Even though it's not difficult to do well, you won't have the same type of connection with the material as other students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in social justice, or anyone who disagrees with social movements\/protests in general.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class if you're not taking it for the WR credit. I took it and had to do less writing but didn't get as much as I wished I had.",
    "Yes. It's a very good class for people who are interested in organizing and how best to do it.",
    "I would love for all of my friends to take a course like this. It works as a \"Enacting Social Change For Dummies\" that is very awesome to experience.",
    "If you have any interest in protest, take the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in social movements and history.",
    "Take this course if you find the subject interesting. The style of the classroom is engaging, but there is a lot of reading and material to cover."
