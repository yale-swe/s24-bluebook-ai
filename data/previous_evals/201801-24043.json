    "The course exposed me to readings on indigenous land-use that I may not have otherwise engaged with. Topics included: research biases against indigenous cultures, histories of erasure (especially in New England), and challenges to incorporating traditional ecological knowledge with western science. Through reflective discussions, I gained deeper insights from the reading and learned a from peers.",
    "This reading group represents the start of my journey to decolonize my education and learn about indigenous land use practices. I learned so much about methodologies, ways of thinking, and frameworks to inform my progress.",
    "This course really opened my eyes to a lot of issues surrounding colonialism and indigenous people in through US history through to today. In addition to this new knowledge, I feel more prepared to talk about these issues after discussing them with a small group.",
    "The way that I understand the dominant culture, both historically and contemporarily, has shifted dramatically thanks to this course. I've learned a lot about the nuanced ways in which many Native Americans interact with white culture and are subjugated by it, as well as the ways that some Native Americans interact with the natural world and with the land. I now see omissions and erasures everywhere I look, where I was blind to them before.",

   "comments": [
    "Very well. The readings and discussion helped me probe more deeply into topics I encountered in my own research. I found this class very helpful.",
    "This group became so much more than I expected. Getting to come up with our own reading list and syllabus was really freeing, and we wound up spending a lot more time focusing on background knowledge and history than we had planned to. This was incredibly helpful, and I think it was the best part of the experience. I will continue to expand on that knowledge.",
    "My expectations were to learn more about physical signs of, and detail about, indigenous land use on the landscape, and instead the course ended up bringing in much broader perspectives. I really enjoyed everything that I got out of this class.",
    "Very well. I didn't realize just how much reading would be involved, and I had a hard time keeping up with the reading requirements, but this was a good challenge for me. I loved how the conversations we had in the class were reflected back in the greater community conversations that have been happening at FES about race and white supremacy. When many of my schoolmates were saying \"wow I hadn't thought of that before\" during a community dialogue, I was often thinking \"we actually discussed this with Marlyse a few weeks ago,\" and was able to move more quickly from just learning to synthesizing and analyzing and to move towards a deeper understanding due to the background learning I had done with Marlyse.",

   "question_id": "FS1004",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the strengths of the class were in the course topic, readings, and discussion. As apparent in the school-wide conversations and community meeting towards the end of the semester, addressing issues of Native history, erasure, and inclusion is very important. As the class was new, the course could be a little more organized in terms of reading selection -- making sure to set a solid grounding of history and having each week build on the next.",
    "The main strength of this group was the people in it. We all brought different knowledge and interests to the experience, and I learned so much from what we came up with.",
    "This was the first time that this course happened, so we were trying to write our syllabus as we went. A result of this is that it was sometimes unclear what the readings were until the day before we met, and we often wandered off-topic (or topic-adjacent). This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and can easily be improved upon and likely will if the course is taught again.",
    "I loved meeting with local Indians and hearing their stories. There's nothing more powerful for me than hearing directly from people about their lives. In many ways I'm glad that before meeting anyone, we spent weeks internally discussing and reading and learning, so that when we did meet native Indians, we were more prepared with questions and hopefully less likely to be hurtful or insensitive. This class especially gave me an outlet for slowing down, thinking critically, and re-evaluating the culture of education that we've developed in North America, but that I struggle with."

   "comments": [
    "Be prepared with comments and questions going into class. Also, if you're in charge for selecting the week's readings, be intentional about finding a reading that would be both beneficial to the group and well written (there's so much literature out there). Having or sharing a couple prompts to focus the readings could be helpful as well.",
    "I would love to see more students engaged in these topics, and I hope that the theme of indigenous land use can be carried forward into future semesters at FES.",
    "I would highly recommend it. I learned a lot and enjoyed the small group atmosphere of the discussions.",
    "Take ANY class with Marlyse, you will NOT regret it! I use strong language and capitalization because I mean it! Marlyse is incredibly thoughtful and more caring about creating a just world and an inclusive community than any other faculty person I have met at Yale.",
    "Take this course if you want a clearer understanding of how Native Americans shaped the landscape of the Northeast"
