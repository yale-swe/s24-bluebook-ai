    "Fun if you are genuinely interested in the assignments and material.",
    "ENGL 121 Food Writing was one of my favorite classes. Definitely consider it if you are a foodie. As an added bonus, we were given ipads to use for the semester.",
    "Writing about Food is a really fun class. Professor Stuart is great, and she really knows what she's talking about, and if your class is a fun group of people it will be time well-spent. Don't expect to get all A's though because the grading is tough. Take it if you're interested in learning about food culture in America.",
    "Ok. Not phenomenal.",
    "This class was a good class for those who enjoy cooking, eating, or just food in general. We covered four unique ways if writing about foods and read many interesting and informative pieces along the way.",
    "I came into this course off the English 120 high, and quickly became aware that not all Yale English classes were created equal. The very specific subject matter, though interesting to write about at first, began to feel very limiting by the third essay. The class was disorganized and poorly run\u0097many of us didn't know what was expected of us on our group project until soon before it was due. Still, if you're extremely interested in writing about food and feel you have a few awesome food stories to tell, you would probably enjoy this class. Most of the readings are awesome, and though you can get away without doing themor watching the movies for the most part, if you have time, they are a way to at least discover some good food writing through this class. (There are also a few in-class tastings and a class meal, which are awesome!)",
    "Simply the best topic to write about: Food. The professor is extremely accommodating, provides fantastic critique of your papers, assigns engaging readings... The only shame is that this class was only a semester. By far my favorite class at Yale, and this is from one who dreads writing papers. Papers had focuses such as history of a cookbook, personal food history, and food culture... Research was interesting to conduct, and it was a fantastic learning experience approaching writing from very diverse angles. TAKE this CLASS.I don't have to push for you to take it, actually, because there are often many people on the waiting list and if you happen to be one of the lucky fifteen that make it, keep your spot or it will be gone.",
    "English 121 is a good introductory english course that focuses on writing in a specific domain. This section with Professor Stuart on food writing was very good and definitely worth taking. There were great readings and interesting essay prompts, along with much eating and enjoying. If you have the opportunity to take this and are passionate about food (you don't have to be a great cook) then this is a great class to take.",
    "Fantastic. Take it."
