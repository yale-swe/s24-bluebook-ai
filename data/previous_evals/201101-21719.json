   "comments": [
    "A hodgepodge of financial markets \/ econometrics papers.",
    "Great class, but be prepared to do a lot readings and have a solid background in finance, hopefully from a summer internship.",
    "Great primer on financial regulation and crisis. It explains why we have gotten into various problems and how regulation has sought to address it but still fails to anticipate the next one. It's a definite must for anyone going into finance or interested in why we have financial turmoil in the world periodically.",
    "I would highly recommend this seminar to any economics major. The topics covered in this course are so incredibly relevant and excited, especially in the aftermath of the recent crisis. At a time when the global economy is still trying to stabilize and when a lot of financial regulations are still being hashed out, why wouldn't you want to take this course? Sigga is so smart and always comes extremely well-prepared for class.",
    "Sigga provided interesting background regarding the relevant debates. She was able to give us information that we wouldn't have otherwise encountered, by virtue of her past experiences. Yet, I don't feel that I've learned anything substantive - only that I've been exposed to debates that will inevitably turn out to be short-lived and only of concern to the immediate present.",
    "Yes, interesting topic and manageable workload.",
    "Take it if you like finance, and if you have a fairly solid background in financial theory and financial products. You should also have some background in econometrics, because a lot of the papers involve complex regression analyses. There are about a 100 pages of reading a week, so if you understand the basics, this class should be a fun way to complete your senior seminar requirement!",
    "This was a very interesting seminar for anyone who wants to know how the financial system operates and what the problems with it are that people talk about. It is also a very good class for anyone going into banking in order to have a better idea of how the banking system works and what the concerns with it are. The work was manageable (weekly readings, a short presentation, a paper and a presentation on your paper topic). Each class meeting started with short student presentations followed by a mixture of lecturing and discussion."
