   "comments": [
    "I mean, you have to do it, so there you go.",
    "It is required, if you are a history major.",
    "Make sure to get a draft done before Spring Break! That way, you can have an actual vacation. The essay is due only two weeks after you get back from break. Although it's a lot of work, ultimately writing the senior essay is rewarding and I'm glad I did it.",
    "Basically, I wouldn't recommend it because I think the way other majors do it (i.e. in seminars, with closer discussion\/supervision) is better. But if you're a history major, you have to. At least you're done in early April!I don't like the history department's policy of making the senior essay a mandatory independent study. I felt like my advisor was not very involved in my writing process, and it required a disconcerting amount of self-direction. I did feel a real sense of accomplishment when turning in my senior essay, which was great. However, I don't think I learned anything through the independent process that I couldn't have learned in a seminar setting; in fact, having more people with whom to discuss my ideas (instead of just hoping my advisor liked them at our relatively-infrequent meetings) would have helped strengthen them and increase my confidence in them. I would recommend that the history department consider allowing majors to complete the essay in the context of a seminar instead of an independent study. Even allowing seniors to take a history seminar first semester and then keep expanding their seminar paper into a senior essay over the course of the semester would be much more fruitful.",
    "The senior essay can be a great exercise if you let it be. Here's how you should think about it: you have a full year to study any topic of history with any professor you like. If you think of it in those terms, you'll have a wonderful experience.",
    "Not the most fun, but you have to do it.",
    "It's the senior essay.",
    "Obviously this question does not apply because all history majors must write a senior essay. I will say, however, that I think the major should contemplate whether this should be the case. Some majors have an honors thesis, which is what I think the history major should do and then the history department can devote more attention to those who really want to pursue independent research and maybe even get grad students involved.",
    "It's a really fun process. Start working early and get it done in small chapters. Also, choose your advisor wisely; mine was great and it made a huge difference.",
    "Obviously this class is not optional if you're a history major. My only advice: DO NOT save everything for second semester. If you spread the work out over both semester, the last few weeks will feel like a victory lap rather than hell",
    "Well, you have to do this, but I had a lot of fun writing my senior essay. Glad I did it!",
    "The senior essay is required for the major, so you don't really have a choice. I had to wait to get access to some archives so it was a bit of a crunch for me. But I'm proud of what I came up with and very glad I did it.",
    "The senior essay is a great chance to conclude your career as a Yale history major! Even going through it, I sometimes felt like I didn't care, or I was dreading working on it, but I'm incredibly happy looking back on the work I did and the final product. I'm glad I was pushed to do it.",
    "Do you have a choice ;-)? Seriously, though, it's a great opportunity to push your limits and explore a topic of your own choosing. You're in control, so pick something you like and start early.",
    "N\/A",
    "It's the history senior essay, jeez. Like it or not, you're writing one.",
    "If you're a senior history major, then you should know what to expect by this point. The Senior Essay is a very tough assignment, and you should definitely treat it as a separate class and work on it each week. Take it from someone who didn't do too well: the senior essay can be a very rewarding part of your Yale experience, but very depressing if you don't put in your all. If you're considering the history major, let this be a word of encouragement: the challenge is worth it if you're up to it! And for the history majors themselves, good luck!",
    "Um, yes if you're a history major and want to graduate.",
    "This is the reason that you become a history major. Rewarding and fun, especially if you can do serious research over the summer (although it's not necessary).",
    "I would NOT recommend the history senior essay to another student. It was much worse than my senior essay experience in another major, and there is very little support for history majors. It is definitely worth considering switching majors because this is such a bad experience.",
    "n\/a.",
    "My senior essay is what I am most proud of from my time at Yale.",
    "The senior essay is a terrific opportunity, and I found it very rewarding. The most important thing second semester is to stay excited about your topic and your essay, and forgive yourself for mistakes and imperfections rather than using them as an excuse to procrastinate. I also recommend seeking out people other than your advisor for advice (other professors, grad students, etc.). I had opportunities to talk to people who had expertise that my advisor didn't, and I think that if I'd taken advantage of that instead of chickening out it would have pushed my essay farther.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it--it is one of the things that makes the history major great. Identify new sources if you can. If you have the chance to do more modern history and can conduct interviews with key figures, I would jump at that opportunity. Work with an advisor that you like--a big name doesn't much matter. If you can actually get substantive work done in the first semester, you will be in great shape. I did most of my work (aside from interviews) in the last month before the essay was due, and it worked out well but it was quite a push. Spread it out instead, enjoy the process, and get your advisor an early draft...Or make sure that you don't have any plans for spring break.It's a great culmination of your academic experience at Yale."
