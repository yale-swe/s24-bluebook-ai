   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this course if you can get in, but know that you have to put in a lot in order to get much out of it.",
    "Fantastic--you learn a lot from hill.",
    "Absolutely. The work is stressful because it involves public speaking and on the spot speechwriting assignments, but there's not much work outside of the classroom. I was a bit nervous coming into it, but I found that I quickly became comfortable and even close with the other members of the class and would definitely say I am much better at presenting myself to a group on short notice.",
    "I wouldn't recommend the course unless you fall into any one of the following category:1. Want a credit without doing or learning much of anythingI took the class because I was interested in what I though the content would be, but it ends up that there just isn't really any content. And don't bother taking the course if you just want to fawn over Charles Hill because it's taught kind of like a lecture. Instead: just go to his office hours.",
    "A great chance to grow as an orator. There is a lot of chance to practice your speaking ability and get feedback from other students. There will be some study of historical great speeches, but the focus is really on personal growth.",
    "A lot of peer critiquing, less focus on fundamental art\/science of speech making, but a good survey class that gives a comprehensive understanding of oratory and how it has changed.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. If you can get in, you should take it.",
    "Yes it's a fun interesting course!",
    "Yes. A different approach to teaching, a different approach to class, and altogether better for it. If you can, do it.",
    "Definitely worth taking of you have the chance.",
    "Great, fun course. Give speeches, listen to people give speeches, and read great speeches. Also a primer in basic communications strategy. Totally a good choice.",
    "Yep, great senior year elective.",
    "Excellent class. Professor Hill will give you a great insight into real live politics in Washington DC!",
    "Yes. If you're scared of public speaking, it's a wonderful challenge."
