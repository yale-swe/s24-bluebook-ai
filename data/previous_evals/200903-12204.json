    "Great Class-- I have gotten a much better feel for the culture and society through our readings and discussions than I ever could in another class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student-- fun, interesting and engaging as well as pertinent to more than just German learning. It has constant essays but isn't much work besides that and you get into the flow of things pretty easily.",
    "great if you only want to write",
    "I would definitely recommend it. This course was really good. It really helps you build up your vocabulary in the political sciences. I feel like after this class I will be able to have a conversation in German about politics. The course also gives you a good understanding of the general German political thought and culture. It was a great class! The workload is not that little. You need to write an essay every week but at least they are 2 pages long. Also they are usually about the current events so they are really interesting. Professor Niesz is great. He is very excited to teach and be around students. He makes everyone participate in the class. He has a very constructive approach to correcting students' accents. The also brings really interesting articles to class. He talks about current German politics and also explains the history that lead to the current situation. I took both of his L5 classes and enjoyed them a lot. He is just great.",
    "This is a good course for maintaining your German, and working on any habitual grammatical mistakes. It will also greatly expand your practical German vocabulary if you want it to. This is a fun class whose workload consists of weekly short essays on various topics.",
    "Take it if you want to strengthen your reading and writing skills in a low pressure environment. Herr Niesz is a funny and compassionate man.",
    "This is a current events class that strongly emphasizes written and read German. I would recommend this class to any student who has an interest in German media, and would like to improve his writing.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course. It was a great way to learn about german culture and politics while greatly improving your reading and writing skills."
