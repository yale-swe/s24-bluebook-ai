    "Yes! the best class at Yale to make you a better writer!",
    "English 120 was basically a draft and a finished draft each week. Homework involved reading and thinking about some of the best essays ever written (think New Yorker, Harper's etc.). Class alternated between discussing these essays and getting more out of them than you ever thought you could, and then workshopping eachothers' essays. I've never loved workshopping essays too much, but this class totally changed my mind, and having the privilege to read other Yalie's outlooks on aspects of life was very rewarding!",
    "120 is a tough class. Your writing skills will be called into question from the very first essay you submit, but at the end, you'll be a more competent and confident writer. Wepler is a great prof, but he's also a tough grader. If you're looking for a good grade, you need to put in an immense amount of work into your essays. Even then, you might find it difficult to break through that B+ barrier into A territory. I only did that halfway through the semester.Overall, I loved the class, but my GPA didn't. Still, a good experience, and I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "120 is a class about writing about oneself and about life as it is. We read great authors like Foster Wallace and Gladwell and your writing gets WAY better. I would completely recommend 120!!",
    "I would recommend this course since it really helped me with thinking and writing.",
    "English 120 14 was a dynamic, fascinating, engaging class. The workload isn't light, but it isn't impossible either. I would recommend this class to another student, as long as that student enjoys the writing process.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to someone looking to improve his\/her writing skills, especially in the area of personal essays and creative nonfiction. Ton of interesting reading as well, rarely felt tedious.",
    "A course any student at Yale should take before they graduate.",
    "I enjoyed the class very much, and I think my writing improved significantly over the course of the semester. Professor Wepler gavespecific, thoughtful feedback on my work, and the defined structure of each essay unit gave me time to think carefully about my writing. The required readings were not only helpful, but almost universally delightful, and I found class discussions to be enjoyable as well as productive. The class was a lot of work: a rough draft or final draft plus a style challenge every week, three one-page response letters and an out-of-class conference every other week, readings for every class, and the occasional brief presentation. But Professor Wepler is a great discussion leader who devotes incredible time and energy to the course and is always willing to answer questions or meet outside class. If you do the readings and put in the work, this class will be a productive, rewarding experience.",
    "This is a fabulous course that every Yale student should take before he or she graduates. It is just plain fun.",
    "English 120 was my favorite course of the semester, and I would absolutely recommend it to another student. The class focuses on creative nonfiction writing\u00e2\u0080\u0094we read essays by prominent authors and then write our own essays (5 or 6 depending on the professor). I thoroughly enjoyed all of the essays that we read. Class discussions typically focused on analyzing the literary techniques used in the essays and discussing how to apply these to our own writing. I would particularly recommend taking English 120 with Professor Wepler. He is extremely enthusiastic, and the class was always lively and entertaining because of this. Professor Wepler did a fantastic job of guiding the discussions and keeping them flowing, while still giving us the opportunity to focus on what interested us most. Professor Wepler required us to meet with him after each rough draft to discuss ways to improve our essay, which I really appreciated. His advice was extremely helpful and insightful. Professor Wepler seems to really love teaching the course and helping students with their writing.I looked forward to coming to class every day. That being said, what you gain from this class is entirely dependent on how much work you put into it. Writing the essays takes a lot of time and effort, particularly if you really want to improve and produce the best work that you can. The class discussions are dependent on the contributions of the students (in our section, they were almost always very lively and stimulating). I feel that I improved a great deal in my ability to construct an essay and consciously employ writing techniques to achieve a desired effect."
