   "comments": [
    "HIST 641 is a reading and writing intensive seminar that interrogates the comparative and entangled histories of the Atlantic World until the mid-19th century.I would highly recommend this course to my fellow students, but would warn them in advance about the coursework.",
    "I'd recommend History 641 to any student interested in empire or in early modern Spain\/Britain. As someone who'd never studied Atlantic history or empire before, this was an extremely informative class, but I know that I could take it again next year and get as much, if not more, out of the course - I'd recommend it either as an introduction or as an opportunity to approach early modern British\/Spanish history from a new perspective.",
    "I would recommend History 641 as an excellent opportunity for agrad student to challenge themselves and expand their knowledge on Atlantic World History. Sometimes the weekly responses seemed a bit much, although ultimately the weekly responses allowed students to become better prepared for class.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student. It combined the separate histories of the British and Spanish empires with considered attention to comparative, Atlantic and Imperial historiographies. The weekly subjects and readings were well-chosen and class discussions were interesting. The document collection offered a chance at primary research and the final essay provided an opportunity for detailed study of a particular historiographical question.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, although I would certainly be forthright about the workload. It's on the more reading intensive side!",
    "Yes, I would recommend it for the reasons exposed in the other questions.",
    "It is a great class but also very demanding one. I would recommend it to anyone interested in early modern history."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal about the histories of the early modern British and Spanish empires. I also learned how to craft a comparative research question\/argument and a comparative historiographical essay.",
    "After taking this course, I feel that I have broadened my depth and breadth of knowledge on Atlantic World History. Other faculty members recommended that I take this course when I was shopping at the beginning of the semester, and I'm really glad that I challenged myself and that I learned a lot about the British and Spanish colonial empires. The class also offered appropriate conference opportunities on campus, and the faculty members frequently encouraged students to become involved in the field outside of class. While this field is likely not my dissertation subject field, I still feel that I greatly benefited from taking this class.",
    "The course provided me with a deeper knowledge of Atlantic and Imperial historiographies. The document collection and final essay were useful means to gain experience of primary research and explore historiographical issues witha comparative method. The course contributed to future research plans through its focus generally on the British empire and more particularly on eighteenth-century political economy.",
    "I was introduced to very interesting questions, problems, and comparisons that deepened my knowledge of History and will undoubtedly contribute to frame my dissertation.",
    "Great readings in political economy. Not necessarily related to my field, but made me curious about an amount of topics."
