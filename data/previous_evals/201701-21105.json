    "You learn how to create a project from the bottom-up and see it go from an idea to a fully-fledged body of work, which is super fulfilling. It is a lot of time (I dropped society after winter break for it), but it is an immense feeling of accomplishment and a great piece of work to publish or use for grad school applications.",
    "I learned how to produce substantial academic work and give effective presentations, all with the support of a great cohort and wonderful TAs and professor!",
    "This class taught me more than most at Yale. It's totally independent but you receive a lot of mentorship along the way.",
    "I conducted research on my own. That was an experience."

   "comments": [
    "Incredible professor & TAs - super engaged and helpful and willing to meet for many hours outside of class.",
    "This course was super helpful for keeping me on track with my thesis and giving me the tools I needed to be able to complete it effectively. I also liked the emphasis on the process and how our cohort and department could support us on the journey. Although sometimes the assignments didn't totally fit with what I needed to do for my thesis, overall they were helpful.",
    "The second semester course was a bit more intense than first semester, but it really helps you kick your thesis into high gear. The class is super supportive. The check ins really helped in keeping you accountable with reaching certain milestones.",
    "Strengths- teaching team, structure of course Weak- long time to receive feedback on assignments",
    "The community and collaborative aspect were strengths. At times, it felt more therapeutic, which I guess has its advantages."

   "comments": [
    "It may seem like a daunting task, but write a thesis!!! It is so rewarding and working with your cohort and Dr. Papachristos make it even better :)",
    "All sociology majors should take this. The intensive major is absolutely worth all of the time and effort.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Writing a year long thesis is a challenging but super rewarding experience.",
    "There is no greater feeling than producing your own piece of research."
