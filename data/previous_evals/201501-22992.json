    "I would recommend it to anyone who loves music and enjoys collaborating with other musicians to produce great music.",
    "Chamber Music is a great way to play music at a high level in a relatively well-organized fashion. The coaching system is wonderful: our coaches were consistently excellent and pushed us to play more musically and thoughtfully than we had before. Sometimes you get stuck with a bad piece, but I've gotten to play wonderful music each time.",
    "The course is great but depends on the players around you. If there's a mismatch it can be frustrating. Make sure to audition with players who will understand and follow class commitments.",
    "I would say it is the greatest chamber experience available in any university. I would definitely recommend",
    "Best opportunity to play chamber music for undergrads. Take it!",
    "A lot of fun and very chill!",
    "This course is a must for serious musicians at Yale.",
    "Musi 221 is a great class that helps one hone his chamber music skills. It provides a great deal of freedom to students and allows them to do what they want with the class. I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "Overall, a good opportunity to prepare and perform chamber music. The graduate students and professors are attentive and helpful during coachings, and you can learn a lot about music and preparing chamber music from them. The class is very much affected by the group one is placed in at the beginning of the year. The professor sometimes favors certain students and it's quite clear which groups she expects to perform at a high level and which constitute \"the rest\".",
    "If you're interested in playing chamber music seriously",
    "If you get in, take this class! It is so worth it-- the coaches are excellent and the chamber music rep is great. One of your coaches will be Wendy or Joel, and the other will be a grad student from the music school. I recommend trying to get a pre-formed group for this class to make sure people in your group are on the same page about how serious they are about chamber music. It obviously also helps with establishing a good group dynamic early on.",
    "If you like playing with others and meeting other musicians, absolutely take this course.",
    "Yes, I recommend this class. Take it if you like playing chamber music with the added perk of getting credit for it.",
    "YES i would! and i have! how fun to have a class dedicated to learning and making music.",
    "I have loved my time in chamber music. It's a class that is both low key (you figure out your own rehearsal schedule and making music is the best!) but you also have to perform well! Take it if you like chamber music or want to explore playing it for sure."
