    "This course provided valuable information on writing a scientific proposal. I learned the overall grant review process and gained experience in writing a scientific proposal about my own research.",
    "Excellent preparation for qualifying exam and prospectus",
    "I learned about the components of grant applications and keys toward effective scientific writing.",
    "I learned, in short, how to write a grant. Specifically, I learned what all the different parts were, and also the nuances in each of these parts.",
    "I really gained a thorough understanding and ability to write a grant with a high probability of receiving funding. This class also really helped me to develop my own project, and have feedback from a variety of sources.",
    "I learned what goes into a grant application for the NIH. By the end of the course, I had an F31 application to submit."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the small group workshop sessions where we provided feedback to one another. It was also helpful to go over examples of grants as a class. I think the structure of the course could be improved -- there was one class that focused mostly on planning and scheduling as it relates to grant writing. This course occurred relatively late in the term, and would have been more useful early on.",
    "Strength: excellent structured content and frequent writing feedback Weakness: peer review feedback could be improved by including exchange of written feedback, expected input of advisor should be clarified and communicated to all advisors",
    "I really liked how the class was really hands-on: each of us developed a proposal on our own thesis project as the semester progressed. We also received ample feedback at each stage of our writing. It was great to see a proposal develop from the initial brainstorming stage to a final draft. To be completely honest, I was taken aback by the amount of work involved for this class (granted all the work was completely worth it). I expected the writing to take a lot of time, but I was really surprised by the huge amount of reading involved. Maybe in the future it would be nice to let the students know the summer before that ample background reading is expected from this class. I would also suggest changing the time when the class is held. For ExPath students, we have RIP talk Tuesday morning from 9:30 to 10:30 am. Having the class at 2:00 pm created a 3.5 hr that I really wanted to use effectively. But I was also didn't want to start any experiments during that time period for fear I would not finish on time. Thus, I procrastinated a lot of my writing to that 3.5 hrs...",
    "I thought this course was very strong. I think any improvements, such as going over the bullet outline before completing the bullet outline in the beginning of class, would optimize the efficiency of our learning",
    "strengths: -almost all of it! i think the process was really great, and definitely gave enough time to complete each part of the grant However, I think it would help to have a little more time at the very end, before the final draft is due. It would be nice to have the peer review more in advance than when we have to send a draft to the faculty writing mentor (other students' PI).",
    "I thought this was an excellent course and should be required for all graduate students. The course went through a lot of nuances in science writing that students don't normally learn in a formal classroom setting. The class was well organized. I did not like the one class about \"Getting your grant submitted\". I thought everything that was taught could have been covered in 15 minutes. I also think if we were ahead of schedule by a week, we would have had more time to rework and refine our drafts. I felt really rushed at the end."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!",
    "Should be a component of the qualifying process for all BBS students by default. This will facilitate standardization of the qualifying process between departments which is currently highly discrepant.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It teaches grant\/scientific writing systematically, which is not something we can get from other places. The CTL workshops are good, but they are presented under separate topics. And they often lack the hands-on aspect that we get in this class. However, I would also make it clear the amount of work expected. I feel this is a class where you get what you put into it. And it is a waste of both the instructors' and the fellow students' time if insufficient amount of work is put in.",
    "Yes! Most useful class I've taken at Yale so far",
    "excellent course, and a very important skill to have as a grad student!",
    "Yes. I think this is an excellent course for students interested in continuing in academia."
