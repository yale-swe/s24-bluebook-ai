    "It is similar to other Hindi levels, but based more around readings and discussions and with the addition of native speakers. If you are a non-native speaker (like me), the native speakers can be really intimidating and the class can sometimes be really frustrating. It often felt like I was putting it way too much time on relatively simple assignments. It helps to have other non-native speakers to figure out the assignments with and I'd consider looking into getting a tutor, as well. The class can be fun and interesting (lots of interesting topics discussed), but is also somewhat harder than earlier levels.",
    "Hindi 150 is different from the previous hindi courses because it focuses more on socio-political issues in India. It's a very interesting course, and it's a great opportunity to continue your Hindi education.",
    "If you've taken L4, prepare yourself for this. There are native speakers in the class (which can be sort of cool but also very discouraging) and pretty difficult readings which I think a lot of people flat-out don't do and lie about it. Still, Hindi is a beautiful language and Seema-ji is great - grading remains the same, but it's definitely a challenge. Hopefully there is a way to reformat the course such that both native speakers and non-native learners can both be served adequately.It's also definitely more work than the previous two years!",
    "Yes!",
    "If you have an interest in enhancing your skills in the most spoken South Asian language, than Hindi L5 is for you.",
    "Yes, your hindi ability will improve, but the class will not take over your life like many other advanced language classes. Much of the class is conversation-based and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to those who want to get a more holistic closing to their study of Hindi at yale.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Seemaji is awesome."
