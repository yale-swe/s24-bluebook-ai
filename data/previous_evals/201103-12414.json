   "comments": [
    "You really need to learn a CAD program to succeed as an engineer. You should definitely take the course.",
    "Yes--its not a particularly fun class and Solidworks is extremely frustrating, but you'll learn a lot of practical 3D CAD skills for future use.",
    "If you want to learn Solidworks, you should go for it. Be prepared to spend large chunks of time on the problem sets doing nothing while Solidworks runs.",
    "if you want a job, learn some sort of CAD program. might as well be solidworks, which is what this course teaches.",
    "This class teaches you something very few other Yale classes will: a concrete, marketable, and well-defined skill. You will learn SolidWorks design and analysis very well. I would recommend this class even if you have CAD experience, as the analysis aspect is usually new for people and makes up the bulk of the class material. That being said, be prepared to have frustrating SolidWorks-hating bug-fixing tantrums.",
    "A great survey of Solidworks. A little heavy on the analysis side of things, but certainly a class you must take if you don't know any CAD software."
