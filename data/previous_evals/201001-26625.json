   "comments": [
    "Immense subject matter. It was broken down poignantly and effectively to convey maximum overarching knowledge.",
    "The material and sequence was great - but felt a little front heavy due to the trip in the middleof the semester.",
    "Following on the very beautifully presented overview of Italian Landscape from the previous semester, the British Landscape course was engaging and clearly sequenced. The breadth of material covered and the clarity of the weekly lecture notes was astounding.",
    "Everything in the course was meticulously planned out to great effect. the lectures tied in extremely well with the trip to England. The syllabus was logical and easy to follow. the class notes for each class were a great help as well.",
    "The material was presented in a very clear manner, with each week presenting a body of material that was relevant to the last.",
    "This course was very clear and thorough but also intensely interesting. The incorporation of past student projects as well as paintings and drawings proved very fascinating and successfully communicated a complex narrative.",
    "the course is great -- the trip was a highlight; it really brought the material to life and made it much easier to read\/write about. it took some time away from the midterm because we were in transit, but it is critical.",
    "Bryan is one of the few teachers in the school who uses the ENTIRE class time to lecture. Other professors should take note. Bryan is always prepared and well organized and provides the class with lecture notes for each class. Also noteworthy is the fact that Bryan planned a week long trip to England for the entire class. The trip was amazing and went incredibly smoothy, all thanks to Bryan."

   "comments": [
    "To learn about British formality and mimicry. They were met and so much more.",
    "I expected to learn about landscape design in Britain and it was met. Bryan's is one of the few courses where you leave with more actual KNOWLEDGE than you came in with.",
    "My expectations for the course were to begin to understood the thematics and design criteria underlying the design of british landscapes over the past 3 centuries. My expectations were more than met by this course.",
    "Met and exceeded!",
    "My expectations were exceeded. From the rome seminar, the Italian Landscape class and this one I have learned so much from Bryan. Class was always enlightening and a joy to go to.",
    "I expected this course to provide me with a body of knowledge that was interesting but also relevant to my design ambitions. Landscape architecture is a powerful aspect of our careers, and learning from the most heroic figures in landscape history influenced the way I approach my own work.",
    "After Rome and Italian Landscape History, I had very high expectations of the course. Experiencing the gardens personally was an incredibly effective tool for understanding the material from the lectures. This course offered a very unique opportunity to both understand and experience a long list of English gardens.",
    "my expectations were high because hist. of italian is so good -- and they were met.",
    "I knew this course would be incredible and it was. Bryan's two courses, Italian Landscape and British Landscape, are among the best courses, if not the best courses, taught at Yale School of Architecture."

   "comments": [
    "Very valuable for the experience of a trip with one of the foremost experts on the subject is an experience I came to Yale for.",
    "This is a great course and I feel that I have learned so much about British landscape design. Bryan's lectures combined with actually walking the gardens themselves are among the most influential experiences of my time here at Yale. Amazing course - Bryan's Italian\/British combination should be available for all students to experience. Really sparks an interest in and and understanding of LANDSCAPE in a way which is rare at Yale.",
    "I had never studied landscape design before and feel now that I have a reasonable grasp on the history of the subject. I would rate the value of this course as one of the highest at Yale.",
    "This course, along with Italian Landscape, has given me a knowledge-base to draw from for my own studio work. The historical understanding of landscape design has proven very useful in determining design solutions. In addition, I doubt I'll ever forget this course and accompanying travel.",
    "this course is important because it, along with italian, is one of the true history classes taught at the school. these classes present material and then allow for a lot of interpretation. unlike theory courses, there are myriad possibilities for exploration and few expectations for paper topics.",
    "As noted in the above responses, this course was a highlight of my three years at architecture school. In fact, it is one of the best courses I took during my 7 years at Yale, undergrad and grad. I am sure that what I learned in this course will influence my future practice in a variety of different ways."

   "comments": [
    "Very effective. Thoughtful, considerate, there for the student, obviously very knowledgeable.",
    "Bryan is an excellent lecturer and very helpful one-on-one as well. He is well versed in the history and is able to connect it to the present day as well. Probably the best seminar instructor I have had at Yale.",
    "Bryan Fuermann is a dedicated and incredibly effective teacher. I learned a great deal both on our trip to England and while in the classroom. I looked forward to learning from Bryan each week.",
    "Bryan's teaching is very good. He is always extremely well organized and researches every inch of the topic he is presenting on. If he doesn't know the answer to a question he will research it and get back to us. He is completely devoted to the class and it is a great treat for the students.",
    "Professor Fuermann was one of the best and most effective educators that I have encountered at Yale. His dedication to the subject matter and his students is evident in the intensity of his lectures and commitment to become acquainted with each and every one of his students. He clearly loves what he teaches, and it is apparent each week. Our trip to the UK over Spring Break was incredibly organized and a fascinating experience.I am grateful for having professors like Prof. Fuermann, as it truly makes our time at Yale unique.",
    "Bryan is a very articulate and knowledgeable expert on landscape design. Anyone lucky enough to take his course will learn tremendously from him.",
    "byran is an incredible teacher to lectures from memory -- it's pretty incredible. he also has a keen memory for students' work and abilities.",
    "I already commented on this, but Bryan is one of the best teachers at Yale. He actually takes the full two hours to teach. Most professors lecture for about twenty minutes and then hand it over to a student presentation. I learn from my classmates in studio, but I want to learn from my teachers in seminars. Seminar teachers should follow Bryan's lead."

    "None",
    "The trip falls at a strange time where we have covered much of the material but not all of it. Bryan tries very hard to introduce all of the gardens we will visit before we go but maybe this might sacrifice organizing those first lectures around themes, which forced the course to lack some of the clarity in the Italian landscape course.",
    "I would suggest maybe a few more very light assignments during the semester. I think this would keep people engaged and focused on the material.",
    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale so far. I really appreciated Bryan's enthusiasm for all of the subject matter as well as how in-depth he went on all the material. Definitely one of the best courses the architecture school offers. Thanks for everything Bryan!",
    "no suggestions",
    "None! Course is fabulous as is."
