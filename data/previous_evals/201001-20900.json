    "Beowulf and some shorter poems: an introduction to Old English epic.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for any student who wants to read Beowulf.",
    "Overall, this was a fantastic course. I liked how much of the focus was on the text itself--there was secondary reading, of course, but the vast majority of the class was spent just with Beowulf in front of us. There is a lot of reading to stay on top of, and you have to know Old English pretty well, but other than that the workload isn't too bad at all.",
    "I would not recommend ENG 501 for the faint of heart, nor for anyone with little foreign language requirement. The translation pace is grueling and though Professor Frank is understanding of those who fall behind I imagine it would be truly challenging to fall more than a class behind in assignments. With that said, it is an enormously rewarding class and there are rewards for those willing to make the commitment."

   "comments": [
    "While Old English is not my specific area of interest I feel that this course will serve me well in the future, not only in my oral examinations for the department but in my professional career as well. While my proficiency may not compare with an Anglo Saxonist, I do feel that I could confidently teach a Beowulf class in translation and incorporate my knowledge of the original language into the course. I think this skill may prove useful should I teach at a small liberal arts college which may expect its late medievalist to teach Beowulf as well."
