   "comments": [
    "This was a good class. Keep in mind that this is an oceanography class, not marine biology, so it was more about how the ocean works and what regions have a lot of productivity\/biomass and why. That said the material was really interesting and it is cool to have a working knowledge of the drivers of the ocean. The workload seemed like a lot at first (5 quizes, midterm, final, blog post, writing assignment (~3pages)) but was ultimately very manageable.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in oceans and have realistic expectations of what biological oceanography is, take this class!",
    "Incredible! Learn so much about biological oceanography- from ocean currents to climate change impacts to ecosystem structure. Professor Decker is a fantastic teacher. Take it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, but not if they are looking for something one level above bio or general ecology. It's a pretty basic survey course and won't necessarily teach anything novel, just a cool way to understand the oceans. Professor Decker is not a very engaging lecturer but she is a great person and clearly knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. If you can handle a somewhat dull lecture, you'll be rewarded by the cool stuff you learn about and by the field trips! Would take again.",
    "Definitely take this if you're at all curious about life and systems in the oceans. It's a great introduction that manages to avoid being introductory, by teaching some real knowledge. The workload is very manageable and the field trips etc are great fun (though not mandatory if you have other things that clash).",
    "EVST 400 is a good introduction to oceanography. You cover everything from macro geophysics to fisheries and climate change's effects on marine systems. I would say this course is not too hard but also not very easy, but if you're interested in the ocean and think the field trips sound interesting, definitely try to take it!",
    "A great background course if your already interested in the ocean. Focuses on trophic dynamics, circulation, and atmosphere-ocean interactions. The main broad concept I took away from the course was the enormous degree of interconnectedness between different marine systems. I am thankful for this profound and beautiful understanding.",
    "This class is really fascinating IF you find the topic interesting and stay engaged during the lectures. If you're not really into learning about the ocean's physical\/biological processes, you'll find the lectures really dry (I definitely saw people sleeping at times, which is embarrassing in such a small class). You have several quizzes throughout the semester that keep you on top of studying for the midterm and final (all of these are written fairly and are straight-forward if you study...the quizzes are easier than the exams though). We also had short presentations and annotated bibliographies on the topic which were actually really fun because you got to learn a lot about a topic that interests you specifically. Overall it was a great class--the field trips were cool, Mary Beth Decker is incredibly knowledgeable and kind, and the material was interesting.",
    "An interesting course if you're interested in the material. Prof. Decker is great, very supportive and knowledgable. The field trips are also cool. However, take note - THIS CLASS IS CAPPED. This wasn't advertised pre-shopping period, and so a ton of people showed up on day 1. It was capped at 15, although I think 18 or so ended up in the course. Though this makes sense because of the trips, it's a bummer that the only marine biology course for undergrads at Yale is not only capped, but gives precedence to graduate students. So, just keep that in mind. But definitely an informative overview of issues around ocean science and management for those who are interested. Probably wouldn't recommend as a science credit if you aren't interested in the material, since it does expect legitimate work."
