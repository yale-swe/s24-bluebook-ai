    "The class contains a lot of useful information but Feng teaches VERY quickly so it's hard to absorb in class. Psets are definitely your friend because that is where the understanding comes. Labs are also helpful occasionally, but mostly they require a knowledge of circuits that isn't taught in class or in the book so hopefully you have helpful TAs. The difficulty of the course SKYROCKETS after midterms so be prepared.",
    "The labs of this course is definitely one of the strengths of the course. One weakness I would say is the lack of feedback from problem sets."

    "Yes this course contained great content and was generally good. It's a very hard class that it taught WAY too quickly but my guess is if you're looking at taking it you are either an EE major or interested in EE in which case I think it's worth getting the content of the course."
