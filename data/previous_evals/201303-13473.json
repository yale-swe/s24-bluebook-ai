   "comments": [
    "Of the 14 classes that I've taken so far, this has definitely been the most valuable for my personal growth in writing, as well as putting together my thoughts, logically, etc. Make sure that you get a professor who's passionate about writing well. If he\/she goes out of his\/her way to help you write better, you'll grow a lot this semester.",
    "English 114 26 is great for any student with an interest in modern technology and consumerism, as well as any student with a desire to improve their writing skills. I would definitely recommended this course to fellow classmates.",
    "It is a fun course that deals with advertising and consumerism through the ages, often tying it back to contemporary society. I would recommend this course to anyone.",
    "I really really enjoyed the class",
    "I came into the class with the goal of learning more about academic writing and by the end of the semester I think I have achieved that goal and have a better idea of how to write in that style.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student seeking to establish a strong foundation in writing. It is a great freshman class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class, because I could see my writing improve a lot. The subject of the class was also interesting at times. We had a lot of essays to read about consumerism, but the discussion in class were engaging and rich in content. It was a insightful subject, because consumerism takes such a big place in our life. I really liked the fact that the class was small, because we could ask as many questions as we wanted, and we could give our opinion while listening to others. I would say that sometimes the readings were long and cerebral, but the workload diminishes as the semester ends. The participation from the students is key for you to like this class. My classmates were really fun and participative, so the class was super interesting. In addition, Mr. Willson was funny and comprehensible. He was a good discussion leader. I would definitely recommend this class, since it prepares you for all the papers you'll have to do in your Yale career. And it is an easy class.",
    "yes, because I believe it is one of the most rewarding classes at Yale especially as a Freshman."
