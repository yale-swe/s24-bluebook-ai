    "Although this course is meant for ROTC midshipmen, I would recommend it to other Yale students that have even an inkling of interest in the Navy\/armed forces. Its a good gateway course if they are considering taking Navigation\/Sea Power etc.",
    "Learn all about the military and Navy\/Marine Corps specifically. It's a great way to learn what people are talking about when referring to the military.",
    "NROTC requirement",
    "Naval Science offers an engaging introduction to the United States Navy and Marine Corps. We had some awesome guest speakers talk about the Army and the Air Force, as well as the different service communities open to NROTC Midshipmen (surface warfare, aviation, submarines, special warfare, and the Marine Corps). If you are interested in learning about the military or participating in NROTC, I highly recommend that you check out a class or two.",
    "Summary: Navy stuff. Lots of it.Recommend: Are you joining the Navy? If so, yes. If not, but you have a deep infatuation with the Navy, also yes. Otherwise, not really a point."
