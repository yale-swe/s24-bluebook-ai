    "Excellent course and extremely interesting. Personally, I wasn't as compelled by the extensive nature with which we explored the political side of things--a more cursory exploration might have been sufficient. But overall, incredibly interesting and well-taught.",
    "overall great class!",
    "Incredibly well-led course with topics relevant to healthcare management.",
    "I LOVED This class - wouldn't change much about it.",
    "The classes and material were presented in a logical and engaging manner. Class participation was organic and helped to enhance the experience.",
    "Too many lengthy readings, which can have the cumulative effect of deterring us from doing any of it. Class discussion was great, and Professor Schlesinger is extremely knowledgeable and engaging. The group project has been difficult, because group projects are difficult, but generally speaking both major assignments would be improved by slimming them down in length and scope.Overall, great class. Glad I took it (even though I want to push my group members out of a window!)",
    "This class was amazing. I learned much about politics and the interplay between policy and politics. The readings were also worthwhile and while the papers were some of the most difficult assignments I have ever attempted, I felt as though they were incredibly worthwhile.",
    "Excellent course",
    "Strength- Instructor is totally committed to the course.Weakness- Too many readings per week",
    "I thought this course was fantastic. I did not miss a single class, not because I necessarily was fearful of being penalized, but because I truly loved going to class. I had always said I was not interested in politics, until now. I found the subject matter to be fascinating, and I felt like the course was great preparation for what I hope is a future career in policy writing.",
    "Teacher cares a lot but readings were very dry and difficult to remember or understanding",
    "Great course, but slightly difficult to follow\/apply classroom learning outside for international students",
    "Good course!",
    "excellent - learned so much in this course regarding health policy and the structure was very simple - intelligent professor and chalkboard. you will walk out knowing much more regarding health policy just by attending lecture.",
    "Very well structured and extremely informative.",
    "Great course! Comparative examples from international health systems could have been integrated into course.",
    "Strengths: interesting, sometimes difficult to see how to apply the principles because the course is very \"broad picture\" oriented.Weakness: a little hard to make up material if absent, since there is no slide deck.",
    "Its fantastic. Dr. Schlesinger is thorough in his topics and does a great job of challenging students and making them feeling like they are offering worthwhile feedback (even when they are not!)",
    "Very interesting and useful course. Would be helpful to take into consideration individual contribution for the group project. Also, would be more helpful if there were draft deadlines for the final group project.",
    "4 of 6 classes had group projects Spring semester. It was nearly impossible for us to find a time to meet outside of class. I didn't learn much from the group project. I rushed to turn in my part of the paper by deadline.I would suggest reserving the last 20-30 minutes of two or 3 classes for groups to meet, since it is known the likelihood all group members will be available for discussion is maximal.",
    "This course provided great insight into the US political system and health policy. It was fantastically put together. It could utilize the TA more often, however.",
    "More frequent assignment to process the information"

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and engaging. Made an effort to encourage student participation, and provided helpful printouts and resources to make the discussion an informed one. We learned a lot, but as mentioned before the reading load could be a bit extreme.However, the insistence upon extra sessions (at arbitrary times) to discuss elements of the project assignments was extremely inconvenient, and for many of us did not fit into our schedules at all.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a gifted lecturer and excellent professor. I was so impressed that he took such time to grade all of our assignments and give personalized feedback. Class was always engaging. One of the best professors I have had at YSPH.",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very dedicated, friendly, approachable",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a wonderful professor. My favorite thing about him is that he can have an idea of where the class is going (more like an exact plan i.e. the class summary posted on the board to start the morning), yet can incorporate class feedback and discussion in a way that always leads back to his point regardless of a student's input. I find his lecture style engaging and thought-provoking. I also have always liked when professors take notes with you throughout the class. I thought the course was well thought out and well paced. I would definitely love to take more classes with Mark (and will).",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Good!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0mark is not only a very smart man, but he is able to articulate his knowledge to his students - which is a rare breed to find. he doesn't deviate much from his syllabus and each week, he is prepared with handouts of charts\/stats (not notes) supporting his lecture. he involves the class to participate and encourages us to come to the revelation on our own, along with his insight on how politics work within the healthcare realm.one of the best professors i've had since i have been here!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0He has a very different approach to teaching, which was very new to me. However, I found the course to be challenging, but I came out of the course with a better understanding of the material.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0No weaknesses in my opinion.A great professor. A good mentor and very responsive to students needs. He really cares that students get as much as possible from the course. He's not an aloof professor and is willing to get involved with students' affairs to make sure everyone is on the same page in group projects.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Strengths: organized and interesting lecturer, has a good knowledge of the contents of the readings assigned and incorporates them into the lecture seamlessly.",

    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very helpful and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0OK lecturer. Some of the topics were boring. Some of the information seemed very dated as presented. (Perhaps policy hasn't changed much in decades.)Didn't always answer questions to my satisfaction.Only has office hours to meet 3 days a week. It was sometimes difficult to work around that schedule.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was fantastic for the semester, clear in his teaching, easy to connect with and understand, truly a fantastic instructor."

    "Very helpful for a more in-depth look at the behind-the-scene, political mechanics of health care in the U.S.",
    "great for students who want to know more about american health politics.",
    "The class is the most reading intensive I have taken at SOM or YSPH, but the materials are well selected and provide fascinating viewpoints on these topics. I came in with interest but little background in policy, and this course effectively filled the void.",
    "Completely worth taking!",
    "Wonderful course that allows you to think critically and creatively about health policy. The readings are equally as engaging as the lectures.",
    "Worth taking, helps you develop a nuanced understanding of health policy and policymaking generally in the United States. Lots of reading, but if you hang in there you will learn a lot. Lectures are engaging and worthwhile, and the professor makes an effort to keep you involved.",
    "boring",
    "Absolutely recommend. The writing assignments are some of the most comprehensive and thought provoking exercises I have ever done. Great course!",
    "Useful course, very different from other policy course taken at YSPH",
    "This course is about learning how policy and policy-making is influenced by politics, procedures, federalism, and many other factors outside of the actual content of a bill or other legislation. It involves readings, but class is interesting and engaging (and it is possible to participate) even without doing the readings ahead of time. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; it was the most thought-provoking course that I took this semester.",
    "I would not make this class mandatory because it does not perfect knowledge of policy.",
    "Excellent course if interested in US policy",
    "Recommend it if the student has a background in the US political system.",
    "definitely recommend!",
    "ESSENTIAL. Take it. No questions asked!",
    "Highly recommended, because the course is interesting, not just useful for understanding the intersection between health and government in the US.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the class. It is a high level course that tackles not just relevant, but crucial topics necessary for consideration by any professional.",
    "This was a required class. I would not recommend it as an elective. HPM 510 is better.",
    "This is a course that all public health students should take. You really gain a rich understanding of the politics of health and governance of health policy."
