   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The readings are entertaining. The breakdown of the class into different themes of writing every week really helped to single out what it is that makes a story tick, so to speak.",
    "Excellent intro creative writing course.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. This was the best class I took this semester, and one of my favorite classes I've taken so far at Yale. Strengths: you read a lot of good contemporary fiction, and discuss stories from the point of view of a writer looking to improve craft. The class makes you write a lot, which is great: it allows you time to devote to your creative writing. You also receive detailed feedback from your professor and peers about one story, which is helpful. Weaknesses: can't really think of that many! I wish it met more than once a week, and maybe it would be good if we did a bit more workshopping, but that might change the nature of the class.",
    "I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in writing fiction for the first time or trying to sharpen his or her skills at writing fiction. But don't take it if you're not going to give the readings and the writings your full attention because the results of class are all about how much effort you put in.",
    "Yes, if you get in, take this class. You read a lot of short stories. You write two of your own with a major revision of one of them (at least that was the structure of our class). I feel like I know more about writing and reading in respect to writing now that I've spent a semester doing just that.",
    "Awesome class to improve your writing by seeing what works in published short stories.",
    "This class was the highlight of my semester, is certainly one of the best experiences of my time at Yale, and has absolutely changed me as a writer and a person. Professor Jamison is incredible, and the work was a pure pleasure every week. I'd advise anyone who wishes to apply for this class to make sure they have real time to dedicate to the assignments - not because Professor Jamisonis overly demanding, but because the potential for growth and exploration in this workshop is enormous, and the work can yield so much if you just give it the time it deserves.",
    "I wholeheartedly recommend the class.",
    "I would absolutely vehemently recommend this class, or any creative writing class with Leslie. She is not only incredibly intelligent (the conversation is so full of insight and interest that you want to hear every word), but also incredibly kind and generous. This latter creates an environment of such mutual respect and general goodwill as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never felt in a seminar (and that I imagine is even more rare \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and vital \u00e2\u0080\u0093 in a creative writing seminar). I always looked forward to this class, and even wished it would go on longer or meet more frequently. The readings are a pleasure, and will help you have a better understanding of (especially contemporary) literature, even if you know it well already. On that note: I am an English major with a hopeful Writing Concentration, but I know that even kids with entirely different backgrounds, taking this class more for fun, loved it, so I feel good recommending it to basically anyone. Leslie truly cares about her students. She writes extensive comments and is always willing to meet; your writing will improve if you want it to. Take this class!",
    "Take this class! Take it take it take it. Leslie is a fantastic instructor- smart and funny and always willing to help. Reading Fiction for Craft is a combination of discussing short stories and then writing and workshopping your own. I have learned so much about fiction and writing this semester- this class was a joy."
