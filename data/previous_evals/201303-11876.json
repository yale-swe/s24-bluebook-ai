   "comments": [
    "This is a really interesting course to take. Professor Faison is an engaging lecturer and is good at leading interesting discussions. Weekly p-sets are not too much work. Great way to get a writing credit if you are a more science oriented person (or visa versa). Great way to learn some basic topics in astronomy without the material being too heavy.",
    "It's a really great class if you're interested in Astronomy and questions about life in the universe! I was surprised by how technical parts of it were--this isn't at all a class about UFOs. Remember that it's a writing credit, though! There's more reading and writing than you might expect, but as long as you keep up, it's fine. Dr. Faison was very understanding and grades problem sets really easily.",
    "It's important to know going in that the class focuses on Astronomy and Biology (and very little on conspiracy theories, UFOs, etc). I'd absolutely recommend the course if you want to get a better sense of Astrobiology.",
    "Take it if you like the topics and are up for interesting readings, weekly writing problem sets and papers about extraterrestrial life.",
    "ASTR 030 isn't a class on aliens and it's not sci-fi, so if that's what you're looking for, it may not be for you. If, on the other hand, you want the hard science behind whether extra terrestrial life exists out there, then this class is excellent. It combines astronomy, astrobiology, biology, and chemistry to look at how life came to exist on the earth, and whether it could form again somewhere else. The most interesting unit is the last one on SETI (search for ET intelligence), which delves into the possibilities of how intelligence could exist elsewhere, and how we could contact them.",
    "The Search for Extraterrestrial Life is an informative and intriguing course. Though the title might say otherwise, little green men are not the main focus; ASTR 030 is comprised of three major units - a brief survey of astronomy, the definition and origin of life, and SETI research - all of which are presented in an accessible manner. Reading Contact and watching the film at the planetarium were also enjoyable. Discussions are relaxed and the problem sets are not too time consuming. Professor Faison's enthusiasm for the material is infectious. Take this course if you are interested in biology or astronomy, or just love Carl Sagan.",
    "The science of searching for extraterrestrial life. I would recommend it to anyone interested in astronomy, or related sci-fi topics (although the whole course generally stays in reality and doesn't really go into the fiction).",
    "ASTR 030 was a great course - a great introduction to the field of astrobiology. It was structured into the 3 sections to give us a taste of each side - Astronomy, Biology, and SETI.It's a very interesting topic and a great seminar to take. Faison is a good professor and enthusiastic about the material.",
    "An interesting class that mixes both science and philosophical thinking to analyze some of the questions that have been asked for generations, such as \"Does intelligent life on other planets exist?\" The class was fun, with lots of discussion. Highly recommended if you're looking for an interesting class that doesn't have an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "I would highly recommend this course because the subject matter was something I had always been interested in--I was able to enjoy this class purely for its content since it's not a requirement for either my major or Yale College. The workload was easily manageable and the outcome of each class was unpredictable as it was mainly led by class discussion.",
    "most of it is very scientific, so i must reiterate that you are unlikely to enjoy this course if you're only interested in the philosophical side of SETI. We only did a tiny bit of that at the end. I really did learn a tone about the formation of the universe etc so it was a great class.Workload wise, I found the problem sets a bit incessant, but that was probably more to do with me not being that interested in some of the topics it was on. However, some of the questions did repeat themselves in some ways and to start with, it was difficult to know how much detail was required to answer them. The reading was interesting, but you could probably get away with not doing most of it. The mid term was fine, and the final paper was almost enjoyable due to the freedom we had to choose the topic.",
    "Excellent course if you need a writing or science credit; it's incredibly interesting and Professor Faison is a great instructor.",
    "Not a BS science class. You should be interested in the biology and astrology of life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who gets into it. First you must be warned that it is not a scifi\/pop-culture class about UFOs or how aliens built the pyramids. It it an intellectual class that is highly scientific in its question of where we might find life beyond our planet. That being said it was still incredibly interesting and enjoyable. The readings are somewhat long, but usually worthwhile. If you have any interest in space, the stars, or extraterrestrial life, I highly recommend this class.",
    "A really amazing class, particularly for someone who has a budding interest in astronomy and doesn't know quite where to start.",
    "Great class on a fascinating subject! Looking back on it now, I think the most valuable thing I took away from the course was a new respect for science (and scientific thinking). I mean, I guess I've always respected science, but this class made it exciting in a way my high school science courses couldn't. Professor Faison is a great lecturer who is very clearly very knowledgeable and engaging, bringing a lot of enthusiasm that made the class quite enjoyable."
