   "comments": [
    "I learned some introductory knowledge around queer studies, but it was mostly just through having read foundational texts.",
    "I learned about different ways to process and read gender theory, which was really helpful. Professor Fischel also works to make sure that we cover a broad range of topics, so you will have a good basis for WGSS courses going forward.",
    "This class introduced me to interest texts and dynamic ways to analyze important issues in queer studies",
    "I learned how to write a 1-2 page paper, which is quite hard to do.",
    "Introduction to gender\/sex studies and gender\/sex politics, coverage of some canonical texts in the discipline",
    "I developed a ton of skills relating to reading, analyzing, and interpreting major theoretic works.",
    "Much more nuanced understanding of theories surrounding sexuality and gender, and major ideas in these fields",
    "I learned a lot about early feminist theory, LGBT theory, gender theories, and critiques of all of these things from inside and outside of their movements. We worked collaboratively, which was new for me at Yale.",
    "Very little"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the engaging topic material and the small seminar setting. The weaknesses are lack of organization and minimal help in understanding dense reading. Improving these would be helpful!",
    "Strengths- reading response papers, creative final project Weaknesses- not enough class discussion in the beginning",
    "The readings in the first half of the course were heavy, and it was difficult to see how they tied together. The second half was markedly better, the readings were super interesting. The class was primarily sophomores I think, which contributed to the awkwardness in speaking up in discussion.",
    "Strengths: Interesting reading and content, dynamic students that created an enriching classroom environment Weaknesses: The class structure was no conducive to learning or discussion, the readings were often overwhelmingly dense and lengthy, and I never truly grasped what the professor wanted out of assignments",
    "Strengths: readings, snacks, prof. Fischels dog Weaknesses: quantity of readings because we often couldnt discuss everything; canvas discussion\/Facebook posts because it seemed redundant and unnecessary work outside of the classs.",
    "The course covers a lot of important ground, but depth was often forfeited for breadth. Depth was possible for some topics but at the cost of some students losing their grasp of the material (especially with Foucault). I think some of these problems could be relieved with a more curated syllabus.",
    "I wish the course had a little more scope as a whole: it felt a little like every week was a totally new thing. I think it would have been helpful to have each week's theme be even more distinct, or maybe connect the themes together. I learned a ton, and loved being in class, though.",
    "Very fascinating course, love Professor Fischel's style for running seminars! Class discussions felt natural and instructor worked very hard to make it a comfortable environment for everyone to share their ideas",
    "Strengths: this course had great readings, amazing class discussions, interesting outside-of-class meetings and film screenings, and snacks!! Weaknesses: occasionally, there were too many readings to be able to discuss all of them fully in class, and I think that Professor Fischel clearly had his favorites, which we could have focused on rather than spreading ourselves too thinly. Also, the Foucault and Freud which was piled heavily at the beginning was very difficult to understand, and although it helped us later in the course, we did not discuss it fully enough at the beginning to really get the nuances of their arguments, which would have been helpful later.",
    "The course has potential but is poorly structured, with all the readings dumped in one place and little time to engage with them. Class discussion was often stagnant and poorly managed"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course. There's a lot of reading, but that's normal for a once a week seminar, and you get to build a really good foundation of knowledge for future WGSS courses or to bring into other topics.",
    "Yeah, you learn a lot of interesting things. Midterm is collaborative which is helpful.",
    "Perhaps. An interesting course and syllabus entrapped in a fraught pedagogy. The readings were interesting, and I am glad that I took the class so that I am well-versed in queer theory and lit. However, the class discussion was often a flex of who could impress the professor with their comments, rather than a critical engagement with the text. The class was also quite scattered. All said, the professor is extremely nice and willing to help.",
    "I would recommend because its such a different take on WGSS like the things that we read did include Freud and Foucault, but also readings I never would have thought to consider WGSS. All of the readings were so diverse, and I felt brought a different perspective to WGSS.",
    "I would recommend this as an intermediate introduction to gender\/sexuality studies for majors and non-majors.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to another student. It was a fantastic experience, and I can't wait to take more similar courses. That being said, I wish the course was better facilitated for student learning.",
    "Not unless you have to take it for the major",
    "Yes, very useful class for gaining better perspective about very important and relevant topics",
    "No - please find another way to fill your WGSS requirements"
