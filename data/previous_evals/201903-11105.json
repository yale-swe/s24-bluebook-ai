   "comments": [
    "Social and cultural history of photography; interdisciplinary readings (good mix of hist. of sci., art hist., anthro in addition to general history)",
    "I learned a great deal about the early development of photography and about the ways in which photography has been deployed as and for the purposes of science.",
    "I developed a broader understanding of the history of photography and its relationship to scientific methods",
    "I feel I gained a thorough understanding of the histories of scientific photography as well as the key polemics accompanying scientific photographic production and analysis both in the past and today.",
    "This course exposed me to a reservoir of scholarship that deals with visual materials and their aesthetics in scientific investigations. By putting up archival objects every week, it also helped the students to inspect concrete materials in relation to the scholarly texts. And it offers a road map that helps students to navigate the archives at Yale.",
    "This course shed light on the conflicting stories told about photography and the ways in which its study\/implementation shifted\/determined how it was perceived and theorized by scientists, artists, and the wider public."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Good variety of readings, interdisciplinary approach; archival visits Weaknesses: Sometimes unclear why certain readings were assigned;; readings often weren't discussed in a way that required actual grappling (engagement was at the level where one could come to class having just glanced at the readings)",
    "One of the course's greatest strengths was the diversity of topics covered under the same theme of photography and the sciences - expanding our understandings on both. I also appreciated that the course held off and covering some of the more conventional theoretical texts on photography until the end so that we could evaluate them with a more objective and scientific perspective on them. At times the course felt like it had too many readings (especially when on occasion they were somewhat repetitive). The amount of reading at times made it difficult to more closely engage with one or two texts, which might have been more productive.",
    "The student presentations were always very strong. I liked that we used primary sources in class. We didnt always discuss the readings in depth, so it sometimes felt like we didnt touch on everything in the class discussion",
    "The course was really excellent. It was extremely hands on, interdisciplinary, and enlightening with regard to the nature, archive, and evidentiary status of photography.",
    "For many weeks, the reading load was far too heavy for the students to effectively engage with the texts.",
    "This course really helps students to get a grasp of the relation between photography and the sciences. It offers a very new perspective that students in both the history of science and art history do not usually get. And it emphasizes empirical studies. Students engage with archival materials every week. The conversations and discussions over these materials are unique and thought-provoking. I like the readings that the class offers each week. However, I do feel that there might be too many pages because, in each class, we do not really engage with the readings enough. I wonder if there can be fewer readings and if during the class discussion students can then discuss the texts more, and focusing on practical aspects. for instance, might it be possible to discuss the research methods that the authors employ? or the draw out the debate that the authors engage in? Because the class group is very diverse, it will also be useful to draw out the conventional understanding of the photographic medium at the beginning of the class in each discipline.",
    "The syllabus for this course was diverse and thought-provoking. Certain weeks, the readings felt a bit repetitive; I think that trimming the readings would allow students to read key texts more carefully. Visiting archives and focusing on Yale-specific materials is a real strength of this course. I really appreciated opportunities to talk to archivists and look at primary-source material!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, interesting and fun. Great if you're interested in \"archives\" on a meta level.",
    "I would definitely recommend to other students. I think it is a great addition to anyone's knowledge on the history of photography.",
    "Yes, especially if the student were interested in the history of art and\/or history of science.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to any students who deal with photographic materials in their studies because it offers another kind of understanding of photographs that they cannot get elsewhere.",
    "Yes. I really enjoyed the intersection of the history of photography and the history of science in this course. This class is very well suited for students who are interested in photographic theory -- complicating\/investigating questions of medium-specificity and photographic discourse -- as well as exploring how particular technologies affect the sciences."
