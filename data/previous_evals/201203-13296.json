    "Good gut class, don't have to do the reading. Pretty easy, don't screw up on the tests and you'll be fine.",
    "Fun way to learn about ancient Greek\/Roman myths! Read a lot of well-known myths, Ovid\/Homer\/etc, as well as some lesser known ones. Classes were mostly lectures, but sections were usually small group discussions about specific mythical topics. Great class if you're into mythology!",
    "This class may not be the most interesting lecture that you ever take, but you do learn a great deal about the gods and concepts surrounding classical mythology. Definitely recommend for anyone with any interest in literature or the classics!",
    "I would not recommend this to a fellow student. I wanted to get a classical foundation, but I feel only slightly more knowledgeable. We read a lot but I feel like there was a disconnect between reading and in class work, and there was never any demands asked from the reading so it often fell to the wayside when other classes were busy.",
    "This was a fantastic course. Prof Loney and the TFs were great, and the selections we read were interesting and worthwhile. It also was easy to keep up with the lectures even without doing all the readings. This class was the breather that allowed me to keep my sanity among all my pre-med requirements. I wouldvery highly recommend taking this class, I learned a lot about a fascinating subject without a lot of stress.",
    "Classical Mythologies is a broad survey course of Greek and Roman mythology, focusing on the Olympian gods and the heroes of epic poetry and tragic drama. This course seems to be one of the Classics department's few introductory survey courses, so it may be a good choice if you are interested in Classics or a related field. For those not planning to study Classics, it is a course with a very reasonable workload and quite interesting material. There are four short papers in addition to a midterm and final, with several flexible topics available. There is also an optional museum trip that I highly recommend, especially because it can substitute for one of the papers."
