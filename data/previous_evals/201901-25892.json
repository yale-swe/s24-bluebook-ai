    "I learned a lot about the newly emerging, interdisciplinary field of Transgender studies. There were a lot of interesting readings and the response papers helped me tie the different themes together and critically analyze the themes we were engaging with. We had some very interesting speakers who worked in Law and healthcare related to Transgender care and this helped communicate the urgency and relevance of the theory we were learning today.",
    "an overview of queer history and various theories that pop up during certain eras",
    "I learned to much not only about trans history but also how to conceptualize (or not conceptualize!) trans identity. This class ended up having so much academic and personal value to me"

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths- very interesting readings, kept tying the theory back to current events to keep things relevant and interesting, some very interesting critiques of academia and the way we treat the subjects being studied were brought up which are really interesting and these critiques can be applied to pretty much any field. The speakers were relevant and interesting Weaknesses- there were often too many readings assigned in a week and we couldn't get to all of them in our discussions which was unfortunate.",
    "This course invites students to develop what I thought was a comprehensive understanding of how trans theory has evolved to its current form, so it's strong content wise. The Beinecke runs, which were held to assist us through a writing assignment that involved archival research, were extremely helpful. The thing I struggled most with this course was the amount of readings, but that's more of a challenge than a weakness.",
    "Overall I though the course was very well structured, although I do wish we had spent a little more time on the subjects we ended up covering in the last 2 weeks of class. While I understand the importance of reading old medical texts in the beginning of the course, I think it wouldn't hurt to cut down on them a bit (or just assign parts of readings instead of all of them) in order to make room for more imaginative work later on"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this is an extremely well-taught course that can serve as an introduction to Transgender studies which is really important and relevant today. The skills gained from this course- understanding the critiques of contemporary research methods in science and Humanities, critical analyses of texts and themes, etc. will be useful in any field. This was an intellectually challenging but very enjoyable experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to people who are looking to enhance their pre-existing understanding of queer theories and trans studies.",
    "YES. I think everyone should take this course, but especially if you think gender is super weird!"
