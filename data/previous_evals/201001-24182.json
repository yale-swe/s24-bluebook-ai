    "I would recommend it to architecture majors who have a strong area of interest that they would like to explore for a whole semester.",
    "Not what the blue book describes, very out there but if you are interested in new architexture, take it!",
    "A great course that you have the opportunity of creating your own structure as a class depending on each student's topic choosen at the beginning of the semester. The course structure was a balance of students power-points, prof commentary, and group discussions. Although I did wish to hear more from Prof Britton b\/c she really is so knowledgable. You really get out what you put in as you have to do a presentation, midterm paper, and final paper all on the same subject. All in all it was a really cool class that opened my eyes to all these cool connections. Would definately recommend it if your are willing to invest the time",
    "This was a student-driven seminar about the intersection between architecture, modernity, and religion.",
    "YEs. If you are VERY interested in the subject."
