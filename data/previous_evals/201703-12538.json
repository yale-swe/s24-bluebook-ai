    "One of the greatest things about this course is how Professor Raab makes use of the resources at Yale (at Beinecke, YUAG, Medical Library, etc.): often students are not quite aware of the collections our university has. But that's just one thing; the syllabus was also great, and the discussions were very interesting.",
    "The course provided a rich exploration of the topics related to memorializing the Civil War, but the conversations developed ideas that were usefully applicable in thinking about cultural memory more broadly. The use of archival materials and university collections added a lot to the course experience.",
    "- great integration of Yale art exhibitions and special collections resources - well organized syllabus - strong seminar discussion - conversation often became narrowly focused on the artistic process and neglected exploring the implications for current day debates about public commemoration of the Civil War"
