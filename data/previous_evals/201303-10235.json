    "If you have to take it, then so be it.",
    "Math 115 is a standard college calc course. It will be frustrating at times, but it's a good class if you need the math credit or just want to continue your calc education.",
    "Take it if you want to take higher level math courses, but don't look forward to it.",
    "I would definitely take the course if you have a tutor and\/or are confident in your abilities to teach yourself much of the material. It is difficult if you have not taken BC prior. Many people in the class have, so they have already been exposed to the material.",
    "This was one of the worst courses I have ever taken. The instruction was a joke: the teacher read us his lecture notes for 45 minutes three times per week, writing on the board almost every word he said--even \"we can call this\" and \"sometimes it is useful to\". This was not teaching. It was an attempt to download information in the most archaic and unhelpful way. Anything that I learned I had to teach myself using the textbook or online resources.Coming from a good high school math class, Math 115 was a rude awakening. I was used to a class in which the teacher engaged with students to assess their understanding. This does not mean asking, \"Are there any questions?\" Because students either think they understand things or are too timid to ask as many questions as they need to clarify their misunderstandings. What is needed is, first, more regular assessments, so as to provide an opportunity to regularly assess students' progress, and, second, a different classroom model, in which time is spent working through problems and letting students get comfortable with a topic before moving on.What I hated about this class was that it was not really about mathematical thinking. It wasn't about how one uses math as a thinking tool. It was instead about learning what one needs to know for the exams. It was completely and utterly uninspiring. It was, in retrospect, the worst educational experience I've ever had.If you can test out of this class do it. If you do not need to take this class, don't. It was torture.",
    "I loved it!",
    "Learn integrals in the beginning which is mostly review from Calculus AB. The second half is Taylor series and it was hell.",
    "If you need to take for a math credit it's a doable math class.",
    "Math 115 was very difficult if math isn't your strong suit\/you are spread thin due to other hard courses. Getting extra help like tutoring was essential in the class. The problem sets were very manageable. The exams were hard and had low averages-in the 70%",
    "I think this class is a good one to take if you have already taken Calculus BC. Many friends of mine who had not previously taken it struggled a bit through the class. Overall, it surveys the topics in Calc BC but goes far more in depth, so I felt prepared while challenged at some points in the course.",
    "I would not really recommend this course unless it is necessary for a major. I think that the content is difficult to grasp, and the book is not easy to navigate. If someone is a math person, they might be able to easily understand everything, but even people who were good at math in high school did not do well in this class. The class was not fun, and the content wasn't fun either.",
    "I don't love math, but this course was pretty good.",
    "Mid level calculus. I would recommend it if you place in and\/or have taken calc BC but don't feel great about it, or have and want a bit easier a class."
