    "Take it for the science fiction books. Grimstad's a pretty relaxed and knowledgeable lecturer, and it's a great excuse to read. Papers can be kind of stressful, but no matter what final grade I receive, I'm glad I took the class.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken. Professor Grimstad is well-read and is a great literary scholar and philosopher. Discussions often go off tangent but that's what makes him a fun professor. Upon finding Lays chicken and waffle flavor, to his disbelief, he spends 15 minutes of class rambling how absurd the world is and came up with the idea to project our own eccentric ideas for the future invention of science fiction. I love his natural talent for linking the most dissimilar things and his sense of humor. Upon his own pun, he said \"Haha that's punny. Come on, give myself some credit, I am an English professor, I love to play with words.\"He is really encouraging especially on papers. You might or might not like his grading policy because your first essay will be a trial essay for him to know your writing aptitude and for you to know his grading style. This means that he gives greater emphasis on your final paper, which isn't too bad (7-8 pages), rather than equivalent percentage on each of the 2 other papers. This class moves really quickly and be prepared to spend time reading the books on the list. You'll know a great deal about science fiction from its inception to its modern conception (snippet: C.P. Snow's 'Two Cultures,' 'Frankenstein,' Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde, Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Arthur C Clarke, Turing's and Searle's essay on AI, Vonnegut, Philip K Dick, Borges, Gibson).Definitely take it if it's offered again, even if you only have the slightest interest in science fiction, because Grimstad will introduce you to a great deal of great writers too. He will share his passion for Poe and Borges with you. The \"The Matrix\" movie screening with pizza party was awesome.",
    "It's a really fun class that's less focused on developing literary analysis skills than it is on having interesting, wide ranging discussions about cool topics. The readings are really diverse (for example, the Origin of Species, Turing's famous essay on machine intelligence, some Poe stories, and The Matrix), and you're essentially free to right about anything that interests you for the essays.",
    "English 115 Science (or) Fiction is a fairly standard intro literature class. Take this class if you like science fiction, because the readings are appropriate and well selected. I would recommend this class to another student looking to satisfy a writing or humanities distributional requirement. The class is well paced, a bit intense in the volume of readings, and has four papers. The class will give a unique perspective on the genre of science fiction.",
    "Prof. Grimstad is amazing. Workload is manageable. Good class overall. I didn't grow much as a writer though.",
    "A lot of reading but the books are really interesting. But the papers are hard because there is no rough drafts.",
    "This section with professor Grimstad was really great. I improved a lot as far as writing goes. Also professor Grimstad is very insightful and as a result class is very enjoyable. I looked forward to going to class every week. Also the readings are very interesting too.",
    "English 115 03 is a literary seminar where you read many classic science fiction novels and scientific works. You discuss their significance to the genre and subtle hidden messages for readers to discover that are within the text. I would recommend this course to students that enjoy reading and want to improve their critical thinking and writing skills and style."
