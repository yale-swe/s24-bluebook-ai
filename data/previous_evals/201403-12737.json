    "Miki made Math 120 a great class! She really gave us a sense of what abstract concepts (like curl and divergence) and theorems physically mean. She clearly prepared lessons well, starting with examples that relate to what we already know and moving on to progressively more challenging examples in a way that was easy to follow. This definitely helped us achieve a good understanding of the subject matter. At the same time, don't despair if you don't get Miki! Friends say that a couple of the instructors really aren't that great, but there are also some (even grad students) who do a great job! So just shop their classes and see if it works for you.",
    "I took this credit\/D\/F because I wanted a multivariable background for another class. I'm very glad I took it credit\/d because 120 is an incredibly frustrating class. Miki made it more tolerable, but if you haven't taken multivariable before\/aren't as mathematically minded as some, the class can be miserable. If you can find a QR credit in something more relevant to your interests, hold off from taking 120 and do that instead.",
    "I would recommend this class only for someone who needs it to fulfill a major requirement, or someone who genuinely enjoys calculus. Don't take it out of some feeling that you need to continue along the track you were on in high school; it's not worth it if that's the only reason. The final exam was awful. I literally cried walking back from it.",
    "Overall it's a great class to take. Some topics were difficult, but there is plenty of help available.",
    "I took this course out of curiosity and because it was a requirement for the Electrical Engineering major. I had done single variable calculus in high school but not multivariable. If you are into math, then this course is really interesting and quite challenging at some points (never too much). A single variable background is definitely necessary. But this course was fun.",
    "Pretty much what I expected. Don't miss lecture, and if you have a bad instructor, sit in on Miki's section. Ample practice for tests and the homework is manageable.",
    "Math 120 is a relatively straightforward multivariable calculus class. I had Miki Havlickova and she was amazing, but as I saw during review sessions, some of the other teachers were frankly unqualified and seemed lost. Apparently some sections are even taught by grad students. I would recommend students to definitely take this class if they can get into one of Miki's sections, and if they don't, they should do the class for shopping period and see if their professor\/teacher is competent or not.",
    "I actually looked forward to 9am Math 120 with Miki. She made a difficult subject interesting and almost fun!",
    "Math 120 is definitely a grind. I took the class because I always liked math and felt confident of my abilities. This class completely destroyed that feeling. The material is tough and many of the students have taken multivariable before, making the curve that much harder. I would only recommend this class if it is required for your major or if you have some sort of affinity for complex, theoretical mathematics.",
    "It's a gut course teaching important math topics. I do not know how applicable this knowledge is to me being a chemical engineer, but I do recommend this course.",
    "I would only take this course with Miki or if you've taken Multi before. I've heard lots of people have a really tough time in other sections. Get help from peer tutors\/coaches! They're super helpful.",
    "Obviously not a class to take casually, but if you did well in prior math classes, you'll do well in this one if you're willing to put in the requisite time and effort.",
    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student because I enjoyed the class. I think it was a rewarding class because you cover a lot in the semester and learn a lot.",
    "Personally, I enjoyed the content that was taught in class. I did not find the content too easy nor too hard, and I think it's a good place to start as a freshman.",
    "Definitely! It's a very challenging course that was competitive (especially because of how many people had already taken multivariable calculus). It taught me how to study hard for a test, and I'm glad I took it this fall. It is a lot of work, though.",
    "Take this course with Miki if you can, though the other professors seem very good. Be aware that it is hard. I got a 5 on BC calc and this class was much harder than I thought it would be. Not too taxing timewise though.",
    "I summarized the course above, but I would definitely recommend Math 120 to other students. For students who enjoyed single-variable calculus, this course would be a comfort zone. Even better, after BC Calculus or Math 115, this course provides a mathematics experience that requires a higher degree of concept mastery but that places less of an emphasis on rote memorization.",
    "All in all, math 120 is more about computation than application or mathematical understanding. Though mentioned, the meanings of equations, their proofs, and their real life applications were given very little attention. Rather, the homework felt more like learning by rote memory. If you are mathematically minded but have not covered the material before, the course may waste a lot of inefficient time (for me, 5-7 hours a week) without much reward. If you have faith in your math, for understanding, consider math 230 (or frequent office hours in math120), and for applications, consider physics 260. The professors do a great job in the review sessions, gathering all necessary equations and mapping out the theorems. Professor Havlickova (Miki) is extremely helpful and fantastic in maintaining a good pace with a friendly atmosphere.",
    "Math 120 is a fine introduction to Multivariable Calculus. However, try very hard to get a good teacher and, if you have the opportunity, try to get Professor Havlickova--she is an excellent lecturer. I will say, the class does not have a great curve--if any at all-, mostly due to the fact that so many students in the class have already taken a class in multivariable calculus. Also, the midterms are only 6 questions and 25% of your grade, this means each question is more than 4% of your grade! Missing one question can be deadly. Furthermore, don't expect this course to be a rigorous introduction to the subject, but it is overall a fine introduction to the tools of multivariable calculus.",
    "This course will provide an solid introduction into multivariable calculus, which will have many applications in higher-level math and science courses. If you receive the chance to take Math 120 with Miki, please take it!! Simply put, she is a phenomenal professor who cares about the subject and her students! If your choice is between ENAS 151 and Math 120, consider what courses you want to study in the future. Math 120 will provide the foundational math skills, but the applications of the material might not be initially explicit. Overall, this is a great course, with Miki helping make it a thousand times better."
