    "Learned a lot about different aspects of public health and controversial topics such as vaccines, cancer screening, and the history of the tobacco industry.",
    "I gained an incredible respect for, and understanding of, the global healthcare system, and everyone who works within it. I learned all about the history of treatments and diseases, and now understand how they affect us today.",
    "I gained a vast knowledge of topics in public health, scientific journalism, and associated topics",
    "Critical analysis of scientific papers and medical reporting, research skills",
    "I learned about some of the world's most common medical and public health-related issues, such as infectious diseases, cancer, tobacco, etc. I learned how to analyze scientific articles for credibility and accuracy.",
    "Various facets of public health, issues surrounding them and an overall enrichment of many topics affecting the world today.",
    "i acquired the ability to throughly analyze scientific papers and understand the flaws that come with them. Also, our discussions into current issues in public health allowed me to have more insight in this field and is definitely something I look forward to exploring in the future."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths are that the small class size and relaxed nature allowed for class-led discussions, but weakness is that most of the homework that class discussions were based off of were readings. Many of the readings felt repetitive.",
    "Strengths - manageable work - different final project (wikipedia article) - incredible topics - knowledgable professor Weaknesses - none that I can think of",
    "It was a little bit freeform, but that was kind of what made the class so great. It gave students room to apply the skills they learned to their topic of interest in the final project.",
    "This class was really helpful in exposing multiple issues at a surface level, with some being more deeply explored and analyzed than others. However, the class discussions sometimes dragged on longer than needed. It could be improved with more interactive and diverse activities so that not each class is the same.",
    "Professor Bazell is very monotone in the way he teaches and not that engaging.",
    "More structure for improvement. I believe it to be taught by a good teacher and a fun environment.",
    "This course was definitely based on student discussion which allowed us to lead the class and have very insightful conversations. Aside from that, I believe a large part of the course depended on powerpoints, which I think sometimes may not be effective at getting to the point for the subject at hand."

    "Yes, the course gives a good introduction to many healthcare issues and the things that have been done to combat them. Discussions are very fun and the readings are very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are looking for a low-stress course in which you will learn a little about different topics in public health. It is a good overview of current issues in the field.",
    "Yes! This course expanded my general understanding of global health, and the state of our world today. Whether a student is a STEM major or not, they could gain a lot from the course.",
    "yes!",
    "Yes. YES! It was such an interesting experience to critically analyze different levels of scientific reporting and was a low stress environment that valued involvement over teaching to the test.",
    "I would recommend this class to other freshman looking for a foundation on medicine and public health. As someone who was not sure if I wanted to pursue studies in the health field, this class definitely gave me an exposure to many interesting subjects in the field that I never knew much about.",
    "Do not take this course if you actually want to learn something. Take a cool English class instead--though this class is not that much work in the end, there are definitely WAY better classes out there here at Yale.",
    "Yes, it is a great course to expand your horizon and be introduced to many different ideas and issues that you man not be exposed to in a classroom.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class to another student because it is based on student discussion. For anybody who has a deep interest with public health and the other subjects it intersects with, this a great course to be a part of."
