    "Challenging material, but engaging. If you need a pre-1800 don't get it here- the additional assignments make the already heavy workload of the class extremely hard to manage (especially if you are taking 5 classes). The class was, that aside, a good one. The perfect solution for someone who has always wanted to study the Bible in a literary rather than a religious context. Very thoughtful instructor. Brisman has a penchant for using humorous metaphors that actually do a great deal of clarification of the sometimes confusing material.",
    "The Bible as Literature, this year, was a course in which my peers stimulated me and Professor Brisman taught really well in a strict, intent, but also gentle and understanding way. I sometimes had the thought that we were bound and involved in a very meaningful convenant ourselves. Although I'm more interested in the application of the Bible to current affairs, what we did in class was interesting to me still. We look at different translations of the Bible and compare translations, and discuss the authorship, narrative structure, and intellectually problematic portions of the text.",
    "Take it! In terms of content--even if you come from a familiar background, you'll learn so much about how to read the Bible as a literature. You'll find interesting resonances all over the Bible, write a couple of papers about topics that intrigue you, and learn about a few crucial lenses through which to view the text. As an English major, I think this course will open up new insights to me in other courses (for example, there was a cool connection between an Exodus passage and the Canterbury Tales!). In terms of instruction--Professor Brisman is a very warm instructor who may seem unapproachable only because he's such a brilliant man. In reality, he's kind-hearted and patient, and very willing to work through problems with you. It might take a few class sessions to understand\/appreciate the anecdotes he tells in class, but I know I'll miss them--plus, they actually helped make some concepts clearer. As a final note: it's true that Professor Brisman has a very targeted approach to directing the class through passages, but I was actually grateful for that teaching approach because there's no way I would have found all the intricacies\/insights if the students had been responsible for leading discussions. And if Mr. Hurshman is the TF again, make sure you get to know him! He gives very concrete yet insightful comments. In terms of grading--there's no need to worry about Professor Brisman's unique policy of not marking the grade on each essay. He makes it very clear that you can ask for your grades if you'd really like to know. In general, his policy is to weigh more heavily the 2 (out of a total of 3) essays that were better. There's also one way to improve your writing: meet with Professor Brisman and Mr. Hurshman during their office hours to get solid guidance.",
    "For those of you who have not read the Bible before, make sure that you understand the project of this course. Rather than trying to consider the broad thematic trends of the Bible, or asking how the text has been read over time, Professor Brisman dwells on the ways in which passages are rewritten in different parts of the texts. It is an endless exercise in close reading, while looking at how the different authors of the Bible altered one another's stories. Brisman is a strong instructor, one who leads the class firmly from one book to the next, and he brings in many lovely anecdotes of his own to make the class seem relevant. But despite the strong feedback and strong teaching, I found the course's central question to be boring after a few weeks; for another kind of course, try \"The Bible\" with Kristen Hayes.",
    "I took ENGL 395 because I had never read the Bible, and I believed that the Bible was a text that every educated person should read. The Bible, as it turns out, is unbelievably complex and fascinating as a book, and the class helps illuminate the questions that exist on the text's grammatical, narrative, and structural level. We only read tiny corners of the text, but I do feel as though the class gave me an introduction to the age-old questions that have puzzled Biblical scholars and theologians and believers.",
    "\"The Bible as Literature\" is a great course if you're looking at reading the Bible in a narrative sense. In the class we read almost the entire Bible, seeing it through the lens of the writers. We asked ourselves why a certain writer would phrase a verse this way instead of that, and what exactly a certain translation would mean in the original Hebrew, what it would mean for those reading it at the time, etc. This is a fascinating course, great for anyone regardless of being religious or not. The work load is not too bad; there is a lot of reading, though (several Bible chapters for the next class), and three essays. Professor Brisman is pretty flexible when it comes to paper topic and length.",
    "Good class, a lot of work. Interesting perspectives on the bible.",
    "A must-take for anyone interested in the Bible. I took this course after Christine Hayes' RLST 150 course on the Bible, and it was definitely still valuable; you analyze things from a very different perspective and Professor Brisman brilliantly relates the biblical material to the modern day and to great literature.",
    "Definitely take this course! It's super interesting and a really great introduction to the Bible. There's not a ton of work (only three essays, reading, and a couple of assignments), and the professor is so awesome.",
    "This course is a wonderful introduction to the old and new testaments. Take it if you're not familiar with the Bible; take it if you're familiar with the Bible. This is the sort of course I can imagine taking over and over again. It contains such a deep well of material and insight!",
    "Yes, but be warned: if you're an English major doing this for a pre-1800, the writing load practically doubles. That said, those are ungraded, and I found all 5 of the pre-1800 assignments pretty fun and satisfying. This class really challenged me in the way that I read the bible, and I had a hard time writing the papers and participating in class fairly often. Brisman is an experience though, and his TF Mr. Hurshman is great. Very manageable reading load also."
