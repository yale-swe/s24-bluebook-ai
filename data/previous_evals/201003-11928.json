    "This class is a true Gem (haha). As a freshman with no geoscience background, I found the class to be both interesting and managable in terms of work. The teachers are wonderful, the material is intersting, and there is no need for a science background. Most of the class is papers, reading responses, and presentations. Plus, it's cool. Where else can you learn about telling the difference between nuclear explosions and earthquakes in terms of seismic waves? This is a great way to get a science credit!",
    "I really liked this course. Besides that fact that everyone will do a double-take when you mention that you're taking a course with \"forensic\" in its name, the course material is deeply absorbing and all-round interesting. The professors teach clearly, make their expectations known and provide a lot of help if you ask. Every week there is a student presentation on a case study, such as detecting clandestine nuclear tests, detecting clandestine graves, detecting clandestine food adulteration... you get the idea. The discussions are interesting (but that depends on your classmates). Plus, you get a better understanding of how the scientific community works. Really cool. Take this course.",
    "Ultimately, I didn't feel that I learned anything in this course. The class is structured so that you have a few classes of general lectures presented by each of the professors (and those classes were generally of high quality--I don't object to being taught), but the horrors came in the form of the case studies. One or two students would present a case study supposedly introduced in the lecture, and then they would ask \"discussion\" questions. The class would then sit around the table and exemplify why Yale is criticized as an Ivory Tower. Students would generalize about topics with which they had no experience or understanding in a desperate effort either to convince the professors that they had read the (poorly written) scientific papers for that day's discussion or, at the very best, to mask general apathy for the subject. (I will admit that I was complicit in this competitive discussion--I do not blame the students, but rather the course design. It encouraged \"analysis\" without ensuring that we knew any scientific basics. The only defense to this argument is that the course was not meant to teach anything other than how to discuss basic facts of the scientific method with an average educated person. If so, then I guess I signed up for the wrong class...). The case studies (and other presentations), ate up something like 14 or 15of the 26 total class meetings.Because the grades are paper\/presentation based and not exam based, I don't feel as though I have anything more than a VERY general understanding of the techniques used in Forensic Geoscience. It also would have been nice to know how I was doing (grade-wise) during the course. I guess I'm glad for the Science credit, but I would never take this course again.",
    "This is the sort of course that you can do well in without putting in much effort. However, you really do want to take the initiative to look stuff up yourself and learn more about the scientific techniques because it's really cool stuff. Lecture can be a bit slow and discussion to humanities-based but take it if you are interested in learning about a new field in science and willing to put in a bit of effort. It's one of those classes that's as great as you make it.",
    "G&G 240 is a mix of teacher lectures and student presentations. Each lecture covers scientific principles (ex. wave propagation, isotopic ratios, stable isotopes) and then each student presents on a specific case study. The case studies are definitely what makes the course stand out. I loved the studies that dealt with human provenance (not quite CSI, but still very, very interesting!), as well as those that talked about telling fake artifacts from real artifacts and detection of clandestine graves. Some of the case studies, specifically one on conspiracy theories about 9\/11, were a little bit weaker, but overall they were very interesting and informative. Each student presentation is a fair amount of work, but you only present on one case study. For each student presentation there are readings for the whole class that you read, summarize, and pose questions about to be handed in as homework. A good portion of the student presentations is spent discussing questions you had about the case, which is a great way to get to know the class and to look further in depth at the issues. There is one term paper which is a lot of research and work, but you turn in a rough draft that the professors give great feedback on and everything is spaced out well.",
    "It is a very good course, you will learn a lot and I would recommend it but know it is a lot of work if you don't know a lot of geology coming in.",
    "I generally did not enjoy this course. It has an awesome description and sounds incredible, but the material and teaching style are pretty problematic for the following reasons:- You learn about a topic in a lecture format, and then get a bunch of readings that apply that information to a case study. For the most part, these readings are either way too technical or way too skin-deep. There are a lot of charts and tables in the reading that you have no way of understanding with the little preparation that you get, so most of that papers go way above your head unless you have prior experience in the field. The other readings are sort of like \"look, science!!!\" and do not actually engage with lecture topics beyond noting that the methods discussed are being used.- Grading feels totally arbitrary, and I often felt like enthusiasm was rewarded more than insight. There is a constant and perverse incentive to make what you are saying sound 'scientific', even if only very superficially so. This is true of the course paper, too. I often felt like I was writing a good paper or making a good comment in class that occasionally had to mention \"data\", \"methods\", etc. in a very insincere way just to be taken seriously. The class didn't seem to know if it was a science class for scientists or humanities majors, and I rarely felt like the level of science being presented came even close to matching the pretense at scientific instruction going on.- To the extent that we reached any conclusions in the class, they were really lacking in any content. \"science should get more funding\", \"people should be more scientifically literate\", and \"sometimes you operate with uncertainty in science\" were among these simplistic conclusions, and they came up frequently enough to be frustrating.- The deadlines for the term paper are way too early in the semester, and you get a GRADED DRAFT! There is no point to a graded draft - it is detrimental to the entire writing process, and a totally arbitrary way to grade. Plus, who writes their entire paper a month in advance? The due date for the final paper is also before reading period - prepare for end-of-term stress.- The weekly responses are a huge pain and mostly BS. You are asked to \"provide analysis\" of scientific papers in an area you have only heard a one-hour lecture on. Please refer to my above comment on the frustrating amount of pretense. I can summarize these papers based on what I have learned, but I cannot evaluate scientific work that is still above my head without really speaking above my ability to comment, and that is bad form week after week.All of this aside, the professors are very helpful and very good about responding to problems and concerns. I am sure that the class could become better with some comments like these and evaluation after the first run, but there were some glaring problems. It's an innovative idea for a class, and I hope they can find a way to turn it into a really well-polished course.",
    "A good science course for non-science majors, but still contains a good amount of scientific reading. You're not obligated to understand everything you read, though, so in that way it's an ideal exploratory course.",
    "great Sc credit. A lot of the class is discussion based. No p-sets!",
    "It's a decent course. The format can get tedious after a bit (lecture followed by student presentation each week) and I found the weekly case study write ups to be a pain as the class went on. The readings are interesting and its definitely different than other science classes at Yale, so you might want to investigate it. The professors are both very nice though and they are excited to teach the class. Geology is a fun and interesting field that most people at Yale ignore, so maybe check it out. There is really nothing to do with rocks in this class.",
    "No. It's a new course, so it needs a few more tries before it gets good. I also think it really needs a lab. By the end of the course, I thought the reading responses were really annoying, because we're \"discussing\" and \"criticizing\" things we really don't have any legitimacy to discuss and criticize. I learned about so many cool investigation methods, but I think a reading list of all of those scientific articles would have gotten me all the information I wanted.",
    "It was a survey of different types of geologic research in the forensic science field from fraud to warfare.I would definitely recommend it, especially to non-science majors as a nice interesting discussion based non-intimidating science class",
    "Take it! It's a friendly, relaxed science course that is very accessible to non-majors. The professors are nice and will teach you more than you ever thought you could know about nuclear treaties, dead bodies, and WWII. The small class size is an extra plus, and it was somewhat self-selecting because of the 9am start time. If you'd prefer to take your science credit seminar-style with papers and presentations instead of midterms and finals, this is a great class for you.",
    "This was the first time this course was taught and I wouldn't recommend it if I thought the professors wouldn't make changes. The syllabus was a little under-developed and the schedule wasn't well thought out (graded draft of final paper due before Thanksgiving, class meetings at 9am during reading week, etc.) The forensic methods and their case-study applications were very interesting, but eventually repetitive. The professors are a reason to take this course, they are friendly and flexible. I think this course has potential to be great - worth checking it out.",
    "Yes. As far as G&G courses go, it's on the more elementary side (one lecture a week is from the professor, the other is a student presentation). Great for non-science majors who need a Sc credit; may be dull for science majors, especially those in G&G. Minimal work (just a couple of articles a week to read and write up, a presentation, and a final paper)."
