After reaching, a presentation by the company representatives where the whole process is explained, so that in field even if not audible, students will still know the process. A 10 minutes discussion after reaching back to campus on the learning from Site visit."

The tours vary significantly in style and content so if you go into a site expecting it to be similar to one of the prior weeks you are probably wrong. It helps immensely to be prepared because then you can take in the maximum information and you also know what questions are important to ask."
