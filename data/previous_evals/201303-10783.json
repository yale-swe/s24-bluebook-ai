   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend CHNS 150 to another student. It is a very hard course, but it is well worth the effort, as it will definitely improve the language abilities of a student with any background in Chinese. Although the 3 quizzes a week and numerous homework assignments in addition to the enormous number of vocabulary can be overwhelming at times, every assignment has a purpose and all help to improve some aspect of language ability.",
    "If you've just come back from China the summer before, expect your speaking skills to greatly decline and the amount of work to stay constant. The amount of work technically drops, but it's the same if you consider you're learning that much and still have 3-4 other classes a semester. Chan and Wang Laoshi are awesome, they make class fun most days, and are always willing to help during office hours. Worth taking.",
    "I would recommend it. Coming back from Light, it is a little frustrating because you lose fluency as you progress. Every day at L5 is a lot, and something definitely to be considered.",
    "If you don't have a problem learning 80 words a week, then I would recommend this class, just be prepared to do a LOT of work.",
    "If you are trying to become fluent in Chinese this is a good class to take. It is a lot of work, but the routine makes it slightly easier after the beginning.",
    "A course that will really take your Chinese to the next level. It is a lot of work and a large time commitment, but I think that it is really worth it."
