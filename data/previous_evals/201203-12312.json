    "Astronomy 110 is a basic level astronomy class that teaches about planets and stars. It was divided into three portions, the basic intro to astronomy portion, the planets portion and the stars portion. I would recommend the class to a very specific type of person (the type of person that wants to fulfill a QR requirement without having to do much math), but I would dissuade anyone who was actually interested in astronomy from taking the course. I found the introductory and planets section fairly uninteresting. I really enjoyed, however, the stars portion. I found it really fascinating.",
    "I would recommend this class for non-science majors who have an interest in astronomy; it's heavier on QR than expected but not difficult.",
    "Large quantities of work, but nothing terribly straining. Someone who'd never taken a science class before would do fine. Assignments and test just take a little time. Solid way to knock out your QR.",
    "I would not recommend this class. I would describe it as not very challenging material, but very hard to do well in.",
    "Absolutely not. Louise Edwards is atrocious and the course material is a bad combination of boring and hard.",
    "You learn more than you think and do about the same amount of work that you'd expect. You also learn more than you thought you'd learn.",
    "It is not a gut class, but the work is manageable. I would recommend this to someone interested in astronomy but not physics, or someone good at math who is a humanities major.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in Astronomy or someone who needs and interesting QR or Science requirement.",
    "it's good for a QR or SC credit, and the subject is legitimately interesting if you pay attention to it. it's easy to get bogged down or fall behind with the math, though.",
    "Astronomy 110 is about PLANETS and STARS. I would not recommend it if you are looking for an easy QR\/SC credit. There is a lot of regular work. While the material is not very challenging, the tests were very hard. I did not think this was a 'gut class' by any means.",
    "Probably not, although it is not very hard. My advice, if you need a Sc, take a Sc. If you need a QR, take a QR. There is not very much use for a class that has both.",
    "Strengths of course:-The material is all AMAZINGLY interesting. Planets and stars are SO cool and change the way you think about the universe and the sky. I also found the level of science to be such that you learn all the cool things that scientists do without spending a lot of energy doing them, which is really interesting.-There are a lot of opportunities to reinforce knowledge, through problem sets, quizzes, in class work, reading, and lectures.-Prof. Edwards is SUPER passionate about the course (gives out NASA stickers!) and really generous in terms of answering questions or being willing to meet.-Going to the observatory is cool!Things to know:-The class is really not a gut. There are a lot of small assignments, and you are responsible for A LOT of information on tests. Sometimes the information seems to be too granular to be useful, and you wish it were more big picture. There is also a lot of reading and you have to do all of it.-There is a lot of math on the assignments, but not practiced in class. An improvement for the course might be to do more math problems in class to help prep for the exams.-I would have loved more math in lectures and more math on tests so that we do bigger-picture short-answers rather than the sometimes too specific multiple choice.",
    "Good introductory astronomy course; very appealing to humanities majors trying to finisha QR\/SC credit.",
    "Planets and Stars is a good way to kill a science credit if you're not a science kid. It's not quite a gut--do expect to have to do some work to keep up and understand things. But the material is pretty interesting, and as long as you pay attention in lecture it isn't hard to do pretty well.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. The grading was strange and the questions asked on exams were much more difficult than the practice questions asked in class or on problem sets.",
    "This is definitely not a gut at all, but it's not terrible to take as a QR. It's manageable if you do the reading, go pay attention in class, do your quizzes on time. A lot of little annoying things to keep up with, midterms are hard, final is hard, but it's not too bad.",
    "Astronomy 110 is an overview of the planets in the solar system and the lives of stars. The course starts with a background of basic principles, including Newton's laws and the nature of light. It then moves on to describe the planets and concludes with the lifespans of stars. There were four problem sets, weekly online quizzes, two midterm exams, and a final exam. I would recommend ASTR 110 for a fellow student. I liked that there were multiple assessments throughout the semester so that your grade did not depend on one test or assignment. I also really enjoyed being able to go to the planetarium to observe the moon.",
    "I heard this class was a gut. That's a myth. By no means can you barely study. It gets highly detailed. Algebra beats calculus any day so take it for an easy QR credit not Sc. I'm sure there are some interesting and easier science classes if you're not that into science. And if you are doing it for the QR, you should have some interest in the cosmos. How planets got here and how scientists use tools to verify stellar observations was really neat. It makes the highly detailed equations and science bearable.",
    "A class that teaches fundamentals of the science and math of planets and stars. It's hard, so I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if they're looking for an easy QR. It's not.",
    "Yes it is an interesting and engaging course",
    "The title of the course -- Planets and Stars -- pretty much explains what you study in Astro 110. We talked about our own solar system, and the evolution of stars. Work-wise it's pretty low-key: shortweekly quizzes online, four problem sets (not math heavy), two midterms and a final. Its not a difficult course as long as you pay attention in lecture and do the practice problems before exams, but the material is really interesting. You don't have to do the reading unless you don't pay attention in class.Definitely recommended -- an easy science credit for not too much work, about a fairly interesting topic.",
    "good class. have to go for participation but dont have to go to section. 2 midterms are not bad although final is difficult",
    "I would recommend it only if you really need a QR or Science credit. The math is not difficult at all, and the concepts are relatively simple until you get to the last unit. Even then, it is more than manageable.",
    "A science credit that's not too much work. I had never learned about astronomy before, so while the course was relatively easy, the material was at least new... I couldn't bring myself to take a gut in a topic I had already covered in high school, so it met that need for me. Plus learning about space is pretty cool.",
    "This class was terribly taught. It was boring, irritating to attend, and misleading. The class was taught as a joke, but the quizzes and problem sets (and midterms!!!!!) were next to impossible. This was unfair to students because we never learned the material we were expected to understand. She told us that the final exam was cumulative; it wasn't. It was just on the last 4 chapters. The entire class wasted HOURS studying for 16 chapters that were not on the final, and I'm sure that all of us failed the final because of that.",
    "I would definitely recommmend this course. It was very enjoyable for me and I found the content interesting. There wasn't too much reading and there many areas in which to strengthen the overall grade. if you have very little astro background, with a little Physica and are interested in the stars - this is a great course. It is also very useful to gain a QR credit. The content is enlightening, but be prepared for the Math to get a little tricky towards the end of the semester.",
    "If you're looking for a class to fulfill one of your science or QR credits, this could be it.",
    "Don't expect this to be a real gut. There is a lot of tedious memorization. You also never learn the math in class and are not expected to do it until the exam, which is pretty annoying.",
    "This course is not amazing or anything, but it's a good way to use a science credit to learn a lot. There are four problem sets, weekly quizzes, two midterms, and a final, though, so it's quite a bit of work. Lectures are boring but you need to be there to do the clicker questions. I learned a lot about astronomy though.",
    "For any student looking to fulfill their science requirements in a way that is both interesting and challenging (without being too difficult), I would suggest this class. The lectures follow the textbook fairly well, and the course takes a trajectory through basic astrophysical concepts on through the nature of the solar system, stars, and finally with black holes. There were four problem sets over the course of the semester and weekly quizzes, as well as two midterms and a final. The information is interesting and digestible enough so that, so long as one keeps up with the notes and the reading, the assignments are more than manageable.",
    "I would recommend this class IF a student has a specific interest in the material being covered. It's not exactly a gut course as some people think it is, though it is certainly easier than some other Yale courses that you could take for QR credit. It takes dedication and can sometimes be very frustrating. Professor Edwards can be inconsistent in how engaging she is during lectures, and if you're at all like me sometimes you'll be bored, othertimes you'll be on the edge of your seat. It's a good class, but it's not one of those classes that you should take for an easy A, or that you need to take before you graduate. Take it if you're genuinely interested. You do learn a lot about the universe and contemplate the world around you.",
    "I found Planets 'N Stars to be a fascinating class. Throughout the course of the semester, P*n*S really probed the depths of astronomers' knowledge about the universe, and it was sometimes difficult to expand the mind enough to accept the size of the celestial bodies discussed. The observing sessions teased us with worlds we could never reach, until finally P*n*S built up to an exciting climax of information spewed forth at the final exam.",
    "It's an ok course, the professor had a few good slides prepared but the assignment and quiz evaluations could be improved. Take it if you need a Sc, QR credit but there are far easier and more well-organized courses out there",
    "This class is a good overview of astronomy, and is great for non-majors. I would avoid taking the class with Louise Edwards, though.",
    "Yes if you need a science credit.",
    "I took this class looking for an easy QR credit, but it was not easy. Here's why -- the material itself is not very hard, but Prof. Edwards did not adequately teach math concepts to the class before giving us problems to solve on the problem sets, midterms, and final. It was ridiculous. I would take this class if you're already good at math because you're definitely not going to learn how to be good at it from Prof. Edwards.",
    "This is a introductory course, it touches on some of the most interesting aspects of astronomy and the workload is manageable. The grading is fair, but the tests are sometimes difficult.",
    "Take it if you don't mind spending time learning about the Earth's tides, Jupiter's moons, Saturn's rings and other things like that. But yes, you do learn some amazing facts about the universe, although all that can be found in Wikipedia as well.",
    "This class is definitley one of the harder science classes designed for non-science majors. The material is interesting enough but the workload can be pretty big, especially when you realize around midterm #1 that you are responsible for every chapter in the textbook you \"cover\" (barely) in class which ended up being around 20 total for the semester. Also, QR problems were a huge part of the class but were esseintially never practiced in class so the types of QR problems you were expected to know how to do was something you just had to sort of figure out on your own. In my opinion\/experience, if was never clear what we should be studying, synthesizing, and expecting as exam material so I spent a lot of time teaching myself from the textbook to a minute level of scientific detail concepts that were completely irrelevant, while ignoring others that didn't seem so important given the amount of attention they were given in lecture but ended up being mentioned frequently on the test. Perhaps these aspects depend on the teacher--with Edwards, I was just constantly frustrated with a lack of clarity I felt pervaded everything in that class.Main takeaway: if you're looking for a gut science class, do not take this one. If you have the time and energy to put into it (aka teaching yourself from a book) then you may as well become an astronomy major; otherwise, it's so not worth it.",
    "I strongly do not recommend this class. If you are looking for an introductory level science credit, look elsewhere. This class was poorly taught, in many ways resembling a high school course. There were lots of small assignments that were tricky, repetitive, and failed to help you learn anything. The professor's lectures were terribly organized, and the class rarely seemed engaged in the material. The exams are confusing, the curve is minimal, and you leave this class feeling like you've wasted a small bit of your Yale education. There are many other science credits that are more worthwhile. I suggest you look at those instead.",
    "Hmm, this class wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t exactly a gut. If Dr. Edwards is teaching it again, then the course has pretty easy grading (everything above 90% was a straight A). However, there is a LOT of material. The problem sets and tests require you to read the majority of the chapters in the textbook, which almost felt like a bio textbook in the level of descriptive learning (eg you have to learn the descriptive features of 4-6 of Saturn\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moons). There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good deal of reading and memorizing.4 psets, 2 tests, 1 final, participation, and 1 outdoor observing session. Tests are all multiple-choice with some math questions at the end.Dr. Edwards was a very motivated and engaging lecturer; she does her best to make the lectures entertaining, interesting, and Bill Nye-ish. The material itself is cool too: you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn about the Earth, moon, solar system, and stars from birth to death.Overall, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad that I took this class. It fulfilled both things that I was looking for: 1) easy grade if you try hard, and 2) fun and interesting material that you might actually use one day in a conversation. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re willing to do the reading, then take the class. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how you could regret it otherwise.",
    "If you are genuinely interested in astronomy and need this as a prereq, go for it; however, if you are taking it as a gut to fulfill your Sc or QR, consider finding a class with only the designation that you need, rather than attempting to cover both skills and mastering neither here.",
    "Only take this course if you are really confident in your algebra\/math skills, will actually put in a decent amount of effort, and can come to lecture each week (participation points are counted here via clickers). If you can do all those things, you will do well. But, this is not really a gut class so don't treat it that way.",
    "I enjoyed learning the material a lot. It's interesting, and not too math heavy. I'd definitely recommend it for anyone who finds astronomy at least somewhat interesting\u00ef\u00bc\u0081",
    "I would not recommend this course. I'm sure it may have been simple to some students, but it was a frustrating experience just for me to get a QR credit. I would have dropped the course if I had the knowledge I do now."
