   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student. I loved being able to study one particular tradition, the Faust tradition, as opposed to doing a survey course on a topic. The emphasis on oral examinations and participation was a great exercise that I haven't been able to practice in other courses and even as a senior I benefited from focusing my work in that realm.",
    "Yes. Most of the works are interesting, and the discussions are literary as well as philosophical and political. However, the class would not be enjoyable unless you have good classmates.",
    "Undoubtedly the most unique class I have taken at Yale. Centered primarily around discussion of the texts and surrounding criticism. There are reading responses due throughout the semester (to help with discussion) and a short final paper. The midterm and final are both oral exams, which is a refreshing change. I would recommend the class only if there are less than 10 people taking it. All in all, a great class thanks to the format and teacher.",
    "A wonderful seminar, Dr. Hagens Faust class is as much a course in comparative mythology as it is in literature. It has a strong oral focus, which, though different from most other Lit. courses, I quite liked. Overall, this course is ideal for anyone interested in learning more about the fascinating story of the medieval German necromancer, who has captured the imagination of some of history's greatest playwrights and poets.",
    "Take the course if you're at all interested in Faust, or if you're not; the reading skills andspeaking skills that this course teaches are useful. I enjoyed coming to each class."
