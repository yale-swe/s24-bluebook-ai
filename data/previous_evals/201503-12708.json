    "Class of fun experiments with long lab reports that take quite a bit of time. I would recommend it to anyone that loves physics.",
    "PHYS 206L is much better than 205L just by the fact that you can pick your labs from a very interesting range of projects. The only downside and why this class is annoying is that the lab reports you have to turn in every week are consistently very long. Mine varied form 4-6 pages single spaced with figures every week. Other than that the labs are generally stress free (if you can get Anthony as your lab TA you definitely should he is the best!) which actually again is very TA dependent from what I have heard. Although particle accelerator lab is very fun, it is a very hard write up. Would advise against!",
    "You should take this class if you want a decent introduction to working on physics experiments. It's better than 205 by a lot, although it's more work and should be considered a full credit.",
    "This is a solid class. Fun experiments, but a fairly serious amount of work. I spent 7-10 hours a week on the lab reports. I especially enjoyed the superconductivity and electron charge-to-mass ratio labs; definitely do not try to do the transistor lab.",
    "111 THIS IS A SUMMARY. READ IT! STRUCTURE Weekly labs, with one lab report due at the beginning of the next lab. Unlike 205, you will be done with lab in less than 2h30 hours every single time - being consistently done in less than 2 hours. You get to pick a partner and the labs you will be doing in the first week of classes. *TIP* pick a friend as a partner. It will make your life much easier, as you will be spending a reasonable amount of time analysing data with your partner. There are 9 (maybe less, see section below) lab reports, each one worth 20 points. NO FINAL - you will be done by the beginning of reading period. LABS TO TAKE AND NOT TO TAKE (Notice that there are some 2-week long labs. These will have only one slightly longer lab report, which means you will have less than the normal 9 lab reports due.) If you talk to a couple of friends who took it, they will tell you exactly which labs to pick. As far as I remember, these are the ones NOT to pick (either too boring or too unstable and not exciting): *NOT TO TAKE -Electric Dipoles -Any lab in the mechanics section -The oil drop one *TAKE THESE -Nuclear scattering -Planck's Constant -Charge-to-mass ratio -Fourier Analysis And others (sorry I don't have the list anymore)",
    "It's a somewhat fun course. I would say that it's worth it -- if you are a physics major, you want to take this lab course. It should be a full credit.",
    "This is cool course. You pick a partner on the first day and stick to him\/her throughout. There's a lot of experiments for you to choose from, so you can work with what you're interested in. Lab reports are written as homework, not in class, so that takes up a decent amount of time. I believe grading differs a lot between TAs. Overall good course, it's cool to see the theory you've been working with in action."
