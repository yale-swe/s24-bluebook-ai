   "comments": [
    "The class was broad enough that I felt like I had a fairly decent idea of the field of music cognition, and Professor Quinn is an interesting lecturer. However, the class material was fairly dull. If you're looking for a class to fill a cognitive science requirement, this one isn't too much work (except for the exams, which are surprisingly difficult), but it's not a really fun fifth credit.",
    "Music Cognition is a really cool class! Especially if you have some musical experience, you learn a lot of interesting things about the actual processes involved in listening to music in our brains. This class is actually quite technical; at times, it feels like a science class.",
    "Trying to answer the question, \"why do we have music?\" but ultimately never answers it, which is frustrating. You focus on brain structures involved in music, different kinds of tuning, cross-cultural music differences, rhythm and meter types, and the evolution of music. I wouldn't recommend the class unless you're really really interested in the material and don't need outside encouragement and inspiration. I'm very glad I took it Cr\/D.",
    "Amazing course! It's not easy, but not impossible, and the content is extremely interesting. Ian Quinn clearly cares a lot about course evaluations because this class looks like it's improved significantly since the last time he taught it. The readings are kind of bad, but Professor Quinn does a great job synthesizing the material. Take this course if you want an interesting SO credit!",
    "Music Cognition is a great class for those serious about the subject. It is a \"legit\" course, so keep that in mind as you are considering it.",
    "Fascinating material for 2\/3 of the semester, taught by a very good speaker (Professor Quinn) who is incredibly knowledgeable and very involved in the field. He teaches with a mix of lectures, discussions, and lots of interesting demonstrations. The exams aren't easy, but the workload isn't that bad (reading studies and the textbooks can be pretty complex at times, but there's not too much).",
    "This course is good, but not as inspiring as it sounds.",
    "Music Cognition is an interesting topic, and the class covers a nice variety of material. Unfortunately, because of the nature of the field, it's mostly a lot of information about different aspects of music cognition (absolute pitch, rhythm, music vs language) without answering the big picture questions (why do we enjoy music? How does music affect us? Why does music exist?) Granted, the class does cover these issues, but doesn't necessarily get to the answers.",
    "Take it if you love music.",
    "The class is somewhat disorganized and more heavily dependent on a music-theory background (at least for the first 2\/3 of the course) than professor Quinn let on. The tests were curved fairly but were quite difficult -- among the hardest I've encountered at Yale. But if you can get behind IQ's test-making philosophy and have some music-theory background, I would recommend the class overall.",
    "a course that presents a broad overview of some of the mental processes associated with the interpretation of music, interesting for both musicians and nonmusicians",
    "cons:1. although only reading music is necessary, if you really want to learn from this course, you should have some background knowledge in(in no particular order) (1) music theory, (2) linguistics, (3) neuroimaging, (4) research methods in behavioral psychology, (5) evolutionary biology. otherwise you'll be not only missing out on the salience of each of these in relation to music cognition, but you'll be inclined to make overly simplistic generalizations that may mislead you in your struggle to make sense of unfamiliar material.2. i've never taken such poorly written tests. professor quinn writes tests that are suitable for exam times of twice the length as the regular lecture time (75 minutes), resulting in extreme pressure and reliance on test-taking strategies (i.e. only choosing the most \"expensive\" questions and leaving many \"cheaper\" questions blank; cost-benefit analyses a-plenty), rather than the actual knowledge and understanding of the material. obviously the curve makes the grades fair, but you know you should revise your test-writing strategies when your highest scorer (who receives an A, of course) completes only ~80% of the exam. the largest part of each test is a fairly standard term identification. however, each term is worth 4 or 5 points, with the maximum number of points only being given to the best-in-class answer. if you're not in the top 2 for that term, you only get 3\/4 or 4\/5 points.3. because of the hodgepodge of different majors represented, class discussions or lecture___hole questions are often unproductive.pros:1. there's a reason why this class is cross-listed in cgsc, and that's because of its interdisciplinarity. if you do have academic experience in all\/most of the subfields and an interest in music, this class will change the way you think about our cognitive experience in life as musical beings. invoking lines of evidence from so many seemingly disparate fields really unites the study of music faculty in humans and provides a stellar example of the study of cognitive science!2. this class requires you to be on your academic feet; you must always be suspicious of questionable conclusions drawn by researchers. in this way, you will really get to refine your ability in scienitific inquiry and engage with the material.after having taken the course and having forgotten about all of its weaknesses, i really value the time spent in this class!"
