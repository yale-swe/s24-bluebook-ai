   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're interested in the subject matter, but be prepared to be bored in lecture.",
    "Great course if you are interested in developing economics. You are able to see what's happening in developing countries and how can you help them improve their situation.",
    "There is nothing to be gained from this course",
    "Yes! This class is awesome. I can honestly say that I enjoyed writing every single paper, which is rare. This is one of those courses where I felt like I actually learned a skill that I'm going to use in the \"real world\" when I decide what NGOs I eventually want to donate to.",
    "Yes, but it gets boring in the middle.",
    "Great Class! Would recommend people to take this course as the lessons learned here extend beyond the course to other courses and in life.",
    "Take it. Worth the writing credit and not hard. Learn a lot",
    "This class explained how to look at NGOs and other charity organizations and be able to tell the impact that they are having. The skills you learn in this class have many real world applications and I would recommend it.",
    "This is a great class. Perfect for econ majors who aren't as into number-crunching. You will have 3 papers (2: 5-7 pages, 1: 9-12 pages) that are really fun to write. You mainly learn about market failures and how NGOs try (and sometimes fail) to address them. Prof Karlan is an NGO superstar and is great outside of class if you need any help with your assignments. Overall, great and relatively easy econ credit.",
    "This is a great class. The material is fascinating (it's the first time I was able to get excited about econometrics, and I hated that class). Prof. Karlan is brilliant and a leader in his field, so taking a small lecture course with him is a great experience, anyway. You'll spend the majority of the course studying evaluations of various NGOs and charities (Prof. Karlan produced many of the evaluations, himself). This is a great class, I highly recommend it to any Econ major. It also requires no math.",
    "I would recommend it anyone who is interested in development economics and understanding impact evaluation techniques.",
    "A really good class on the nature of poverty and the ways in which we could alleviate it. It's a manageable class as long as you constantly ask how market failures (mainly information asymmetry and behavioral) could manifest in the actions of people in the developing world.",
    "Interesting",
    "The class itself really isn't that useful - you don't learn much by going over cases of how studies were conducted since it gets repetitive. A lot of the stuff is common sense and what you don't know already you could get just by reading More Than Good Intentions and Poor Economics, both of which are easy reads and much more interesting than lecture. Dean Karlan is big in his field but a very disorganized and not super effective lecturer. I didn't learn much of anything in this class. Easy writing credit if you're looking for one"
