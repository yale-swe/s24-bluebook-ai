    "Definitely. It is necessary for the chem major and premed...good luck!",
    "Only take it if you have to because you're a bio major or a sophmore chem major because you learn very little knew things about chemistry",
    "Much less work than Rablen's class but also the material kind of stinks, and Crawford hates teaching.",
    "Chem 230 is probably a required course for you (if it's not, I wouldn't take it because it's a lot of work and not that much fun), but it's probably one of the better required courses in science. Professor Crawford is pretty fair in his tests and psets, and his lectures cover a lot of mechanisms, although sometimes the boards--all 6 of them--get jumbled with large molecules and electron-pushing arrows going all over the place. But it's cool seeing the individual steps of pathways that you learned big-picture in biology class.",
    "You're probably taking this as a pre-req and it's a hard one. You can do it, just make sure to give yourself time to study.",
    "Take second semester freshmen orgo if you have the option.",
    "I mean you're probably only taking this because you have to so....",
    "I thought this was a good class. It would have been nice to take a traditional Orgo 2 class before this class, but since Yale doesn't offer one, this class was pretty good.",
    "Only take it if you have to (i.e. Premed or Chem major or some kind of science requirement for engineering, etc.)",
    "A very well taught class, obviously take it only if you need to.",
    "I wouldn't not reccomend this class to another student, as I assume if you're looking to take organic chemistry you're doing so because you have to and not because you want to. Though this course has its flaws, if you're deciding between Freshman Orgo and this class, I'll say that I do not regret switching from Freshman Orgo first semester to this class second semester.",
    "It's a solid class. I just crammed all the mechanisms into my head the night before the test and copied them down 10 times each. And then during the exams, I wrote the mechanisms down for the 11th time. The exams are regurgitation so as long as you memorize everything you'll be fine.",
    "A pretty poor orgo course in terms of teaching actual fundamentals; you do learn\/memorize how to push a lot of electrons, which is useless. I started getting a better grasp of actual concepts towards the very end, but again, it would have been much simpler to teach fundamentals from the start. However, the course is not difficult and Crawford is a decent lecturer.",
    "Fantastic, fascinating class that goes into the organic chemistry of key reactions in your body. Crawford is an excellent professor and the tests were very fair, focusing on the cofactors that he outlines. Take it.",
    "CHEM 230 is a boring course. I am not premed, and I took this course out of interest, and sincerely regret it. The focus is on premed subjects and the MCAT, and the work consists solely of memorizing reaction mechanisms and regurgitating them, even though the professor insists there is no memorization in his course. Do not take unless required.",
    "This is a difficult class. I would not take it unless you have to. It takes a while for things to click, which can be a problem if they click after the exams. If you are interested in chemistry, the material is interesting enough.",
    "Crawford is a really good professor. He makes his expectations clear and the mechanisms aren't too difficult. Orgo 2 was definitely more interesting\/applicable than orgo 1.",
    "Standard orgo class. Class itself was fairly boring and less organized than Chem 124 (Freshman Orgo I). Midterms ranged from being quite easy to being extremely difficult. Overall a fine orgo class probably made as painless as possible. Crawford is a cood lecturer who did the best to make the material as engaging as possible. He can be a bit disorganized at times though and it isn't always clear what we're responsible for knowing for the exams.",
    "I would definitely recommend Chem 230 to students who are STRONG in 1st semester organic chemistry and who have a true passion for learning about super cool, awesome stuff about things I never would have thought I would end up taking as a freshman!",
    "If you are dedicated to chemistry and biology, this a great course to take. If not, the stress might kill ya.",
    "It's a pretty good class and I'd say just as challenging as first semester orgo, but in different ways. There's so much electron pushing and becoming familiar with different mechanisms. But, it's not a bad class and from the past orgo II classes I've heard about from past students, this class is pretty good.",
    "I would recommend this class. I took it with Crawford. He was a good lecturer and made very reasonable tests and problem sets. I was amazed by how much I had learned by the end of the year. It does require a lot of studying, but the material presented is interesting.",
    "CHEM 230 may be tough and hard core, but I clearly learned a lot. Also, it is not as much of a memorization- just make sure you understand the mechanisms and you'll be fine. THings will not make sense in the beginning, but you'll find yourself understanding all of them by the end of the semester.",
    "would appreciate if prof crawford could synthesize and present the material in a cleaner manner. it is often like poking a needle and hoping you hit the right place. we had graded psets that required knowledge of a concept he did not teach, and partially review in lecture after it was due. he is difficult to reach for office hours. try to find a good TA who can reteach the material in a more laid-out, precise way. the textbook is terrible and does not give detailed explanations. one cannot learn by reading the book. so a good TA or the internet will be your good friends. however, the upside to this course is that he gives focus sessions when he tells us what concepts we should study for the exam. very helpful.",
    "Yes, take this class. I enjoyed it. Took Freshman Orgo before this, and while that class was good too, I liked this one better because 1) less work and 2) relevance. It puts things into a different perspective when you realize that the electron-pushing actually matters to your survival. And Prof Crawford was a good lecturer and responsive to his students' concerns. Very doable.",
    "Good course. Managed to memorize the mechanisms of a dozen or so pathways. You have to take this if you're premed, and this is probably better than the freshman one cause freshmen are crazy.",
    "Know your mechanisms. Take really good notes. This is a shitty pre med requirement that is harder than what most people say. Make sure to rewrite all the mechanisms multiple times before each midterm. also, Crawford is a disorganized lecturer. Make sure to go to section and ask TAs often about the key points of the lecture. Lastly, the textbook is useless. Studying your notes should be your priority.",
    "If the professor is Crawford - yes! There's not better way to take a second semester of orgo. He's engaging and covers only the most important subject material.",
    "Kind of a cool course, be prepared to work hard but it's worth it.",
    "Yes if you are interested or need to learn about the organic chemistry of biological systems then this is a great class for you.",
    "Take if you have to, but it IS a very rewarding class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to take orgo. It's also your only option if you are not a freshman. I was in freshman orgo first semester and switched to this class, which I think was a good idea. Because I like biology, I found this class a little more interesting than freshman orgo I. However, if Jonathan Ellman is teaching freshman orgo take it for sure because he is an amazing teacher. Crawford was very good as well so if you have to take Orgo II then definitely try to get him (unless you can get Ellman).",
    "You gotta take it anyway, might as well take it with Crawford.",
    "A survey course of some prominent biological processes, with heavy emphasis on carbonyl\/imine chemistry and cofactors. Crawford will tell you that it's not a class about memorization..that's not true. However, the key to success in the class is making the memorization as easy as possible by understanding intermediate concepts. So, with effective studying, what you used to commit mentally as \"deprotonate here\" or \"attack there\" can be gradually expanded to \"make enolate\" or \"transiminate,\" which condenses steps and greatly reduces the mental load. Take it with Crawford - he tries his best to not make the class a pain and is very clear about what you need to know, as well as having an offbeat sense of humor that you'll miss. If I could have offered myself one overarching piece of advice beforehand, it would have been nearly every step you do in the class needs either an electron sink or a good leaving group, so allow that to constrain the possibilities when you're working out mechanisms.",
    "Orgo II is very different from Orgo I, but good all the same. I would say that it is easier in some respects since it is less memorization, but sometimes it is harder to know what you should be getting out of the lectures. Professor Crawford was a nice guy and a funny and interesting lecturer. I would recommend Orgo II, though I assume that only students who actually need it as a requirement anyway would be taking it.",
    "I definitely enjoyed CHEM 230. I thought it was a really cool application of organic chemistry, especially as an MCDB major. However, the transition between 220 and 230 was drastic at first, as 220 teaches you about in lab reactions, whereas 230 teaches you about reactions in biological systems which use different chemistry and often do not adhere to the same constraints. As far as the course goes, it's less structured, jumping around in the textbook. The psets and exams were fair and Crawford is a solid professor.",
    "A great class, definitely take if interested in chemistry or for premed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for premeds because it is extremely interesting to see the specific mechanisms underlying the biological concepts. I took the intro Bio sequence this semester as well and found that they complimented each other quite well. The course has a lot of memorizing of mechanisms involved, but over time you come to see patterns. People have said - and I agree that the course seems to be jumping around at times e.g. you have random reactions to memorize that sometimes you can't tell where it fits in. I also found that the text book is not THAT useful, because Crawford focuses on only SOME reactions and if you read every mech in the book, that is completely unnecessary. Go to discussion sections - they really do help.",
    "It's all right. A good amount of figuring trends out and memorizing steps on your own. Once you get the hang of it, it can be fun. It's not thrilling, but it's not the terrible orgo class your dreading.",
    "CHEM 230 is very rigorous but also very rewarding. The emphasis is on cofactor chemistry, which seems like a departure from 220 when really the mechanisms and chemical principles are all the same. Crawford is a clear lecturer who demands a lot from students, but also makes his expectations clear and is a fair person. His classes really are pretty compelling and he makes a real effort to connect course concepts with medically relevant issues. Definitely take this semester of orgo with Crawford if you get the chance.",
    "Difficult- involves a lot of memorization during the midterms. But at the end of the course, I felt like I had learned a lot and a lot of concepts came together.",
    "An excellent science class. Definitely take with Crawford if possible -- he is a clear lecturer and his assessments are, for the most part, very fair (although the final is quite difficult). He very clearly lays out what he wants you to learn before every exam, which is much appreciated.",
    "Chem 230 doesn't teach traditional test-tube organic chemistry. The entire class focuses on biological pathways such as the citric acid cycle, glycolysis, protein synthesis...etc. I enjoyed the material because it covered pathways that are relevant to life. Take this class if you need to for your major\/ preprofessional program or if you are interested in metabolism.",
    "Chem 230 was an interesting course, but it could have been taught better. There are only a few pests and they are short, so the homework is not a lot, but you WILL have to memorize tons of stuff for exams. He says that you do not have to memorize, but you will because that is just how you can learn the mechanisms when none of the rules from CHEM 220 apply inside the body. I am unsure as to why we spent 2 weeks discussing mass spec, since it did not really relate to the rest of the subjects we discussed. It would have been better to slow down during the middle of the semester instead of rushing it to discuss mass spec at the end. I also feel that Professor Crawford could have provided students with more resources, since he had few office hours on campus, did not respond to most piazza questions, did not come to proctor exams, and did not host review sessions for struggling students. The TAs only had one office hour per week, and it was not during the evening so it made it difficult for students to seek help. The peer tutors were fantastic and did most of the helping though, so definitely go to them for help!",
    "This is a horribly difficult and awful class. It is essentially biochemistry. The entire class is just route memorization (no matter what the professor and TAs say every student just memorizes everything) and this makes the class really difficult. I can honestly say that despite the fact that I devoted so much time to this class, I feel like I did not learn anything. I would not recommend this class to another student. It is horrible, poorly taught, difficult (unnecessarily so). DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!!!",
    "A great class with real-life medicinal applications to organic chemistry, something that is lacking in first semester orgo. Although Crawford says not to memorize, for the midterms definitely memorize the mechanisms, but for the final understand the key concepts. Crawford is an excellent teacher that lets you know exactly what will be on the test, with no curve balls at all. Definitely take this class!",
    "For a course that I expected to hate, Chem 230 was pretty enjoyable. There wasn't nearly as much work as in Chem 220, yet I felt equally in command of the material. In this course Professor Crawford integrates real world applications for the mechanisms that we go over. Although it would have been nice to have a few more sample problems, Focus Sessions a week before the exams helped to streamline the material. I thought that the final was difficult; however I did not believe that it was unfair. I did not find the book helpful, rather I depended upon the notes I took in lecture to prepare for the exams.",
    "Not a bad class! If you enjoy chemistry or need this for pre-med, definitely take this. Professor Crawford was straightforward and helpful.",
    "After taking CHEM 220, I personally saw myself improve much more in 230, which was formatted in a way that I think helped me grasp the concepts better. There are 5 problem sets over the semester, and having problems to actually work out, compared to online psets like other chem classes, really helps. The exams parallel well what's actually taught in lecture, as long as you make sure to keep up with knowing the different mechanisms, as general reactions tend to reappear across pathways. Having 2 midterms and a final helps spread out what you're graded on, and the format is consistent across them.",
    "The bane of my existence.",
    "If you need to take this class do it - you need to do as many practice questions as possible with these cofactors. These examples can be found in the cycles (fatty acid synthesis etc). Look at the general outlines and then you will see the co-factors. Follow those examples and you'll be able to find the patterns to the co-factors. It sucks but you just have to do it. Keep following examples and you'll get there.",
    "Although this class has improved a lot since its open-book days, it still focuses quite significantly on memorization. It's not actually ridiculously challenging, but it can be kind of hard to memorize so much material. There are five psets, three midterms, and a final exam, with no dropped lowest score. I suppose it is kind of a useful introduction for biochemistry, from what I've heard. However, it's not really organic chemistry, I feel, since we focus so much on biological pathways. I would recommend it, I think Professor Crawford was a pretty good instructor, although some of the TAs were quite unsympathetic (as evidenced by their curt and sometimes unhelpful responses on piazza).",
    "Just write out mechanisms again and again till you have them memorized.",
    "You will probably take it because it is required for pre-med, but unlike other pre-med reqs, this class is very interesting.",
    "Take if premed!! Take the time to learn the material rather than purely memorize it and try to read the Loudon textbook material so you don't miss out on any important chemistry covered in other orgo classes.",
    "No one who doesn't really need to take this does... I would not recomment it for a fun class because it's so mentall and emotionally difficult.",
    "you're taking it because you have to. you probably don't have much of a choice.",
    "If you're taking CHEM 230, you probably don't have a choice. Get ready to work hard, long hours to understand the concepts. It's not impossible. It's just very difficult.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 230 on one condition: that the student sincerely wants to retain the information he\/she learns in this course and wants to apply what he\/she learns to retainable information. Many mechanisms were simply unable to be remembered beyond this course, so be prepared to learn information you will forget. In order to get something out of this course, you need to be disciplined enough to learn on your own and find ways of retaining the information. Otherwise, the course itself will be largely recalling and forgetting. The textbook also explains very little, so a lot of individual study and initiative is needed. But if this course is studied effectively, it can be very relevant and applicable. It's what you make of it!",
    "I would not recommend this course to any other student. It does not teach you anything particularly worthwhile. Every mechanism in this class could be looked up in a book or online. You aren't able to predict any reactions without a clear guide as what to do or without having memorized it before hand after this course. It cost me a lot of time to memorize everything before a test. Also, after taking CHEM 220, you've taken all the organic chemistry of two semesters at many other colleges. As it is, this class isn't worth the time and stress put into it.",
    "I don't think many people choose to take organic chemistry. But for those who have to take it, this class is definitely the one to take. I definitely learned a lot, and Crawford is pretty solid.",
    "Studying for this class is a lot of work, in part because of the lack of resources provided. It's also very biological, so if you're a chemistry or chemical engineering major, you might start to wonder why you're struggling through it. Other than that, the teaching is fair but not great, and you probably don't have much of a choice about this class so I wish you the best of luck.",
    "Orgo II was by far the most challenging course I have taken at Yale but at the same time it was the most rewarding. Crawford was a very good and clear teacher and his exams were all fair. The class had a lot of content and even though they say there won't be a heavy emphasis on memorization, there is. However, the final exam required little memorization, but rather relied more on your understanding of concepts. It was amazing that after taking the class, on the final exam I was able to figure out mechanisms that I had never seen before just using my understanding of the mechanisms I had learned before. It's an incredible class that will push you and make you realize what you are capable of. I would definitely reccomend it!",
    "... I know no one will take this course unless they have to, but just know that very little thought is necessary to do this course. Just take 3 hours a day and browbeat it into your mind. Memorize every mechanism, don't think at all, because if you try thinking, you'll get it wrong. Some things make sense, sure, but a lot of it doesn't, and the reason why is because \"biology does whatever the hell it wants\". Jason does a good enough job given the parameters of the class. However, I dislike the class on principle, because it emphasized memorization rather than critical thinking for the most part. Jason is pretty cool though. Knows a lot and did convey it well. The premise of class was just unfortunate. The class is complete BS and is arbitrary beyond belief with how grading is done. You can not know entire parts of a mechanism and only get 1 point off or know most of it and get 7 marked off. Who knows what the hell you'll get in this class. Take it to find out, I guess..",
    "Chem 230 is an interesting way to apply organic chemistry to biology. You get to learn about entire mechanism in the body.",
    "You're premed, chem, or biochem if you're taking this, but if not, good job on exploring organic chemistry for fun. Mad respect.",
    "As you might have heard, CHEM 230 is unique among Organic Chemistry II courses. We learned about organic chemistry as it related to biochemistry. This class is definitely a lot easier than Freshman Organic Chemistry II, although granted we learned a lot less than students in Freshman Orgo. The workload is relatively light (five PSETs, weekly discussion sections (not required), and a final exam). The course content really isn't difficult at all. My one complaint about the class is that the textbook wasn't very helpful-- it skipped several steps in many mechanisms, and had some mistakes.",
    "CHEM 230 is a pretty good second part of orgo. The material presented is initially pretty dry, boring, and seemingly irrelevant. Basically, at the beginning, Crawford presents a whole bunch of reactions and makes you memorize them, which seems incredibly pointless. Towards the end of the course, you begin to see all these reactions in actual biological systems, which I thought was super cool and interesting. Crawford is a pretty good lecturer and is actually reasonable in assigning and testing on material.",
    "Take this over 124 if you can, especially with Crawford. Great material for an orgo class, clear instruction, interesting applications.",
    "It is a orgo class. It is going to be difficult, but I think the overall benefit is very rewarding.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed CHEM 230. Although it required no doubt a lot of work, the course was well taught and organized. Professor Crawford did an excellent job of going through mechanisms in detail and contextualizing his material. He was a great, thorough lecturer. Nevertheless, as orgo, there was still a lot of material.",
    "This course is a great second semester organic chemistry course for biology-oriented students. Definitely take it with Professor Crawford! His lectures are actually very interesting and he moves to the chalkboard quite a lot. Definitely take very good notes because psets and exams are based on mechanisms that he will draw out on the chalkboards. I felt the workload of this course is definitely do-able as long as you put in the time. You\u2019ll definitely find yourself copying your notes over and over to study for the exams, but the material covered is much easier to grasp. I had a great time in this course!",
    "Chem 230 uses some of the concepts learned in Chem 220 and applies them to learning metabolic pathways. I would recommend this class.",
    "Challenging (read along in the textbook and try your best not to miss classes), time-consuming (so make sure to allot time for it)",
    ". Chem 230 is an absolutely terrible course. If you are thinking of chemical engineering or chemistry, do not be afraid to take freshman organic chemistry in lieu of this course. Despite whatever reviews there are for that course, I can imagine that it will not be as bad as the sheer memorization that is chem 230. If you are a biology major, by all means, go ahead: you are in good company.",
    "I did not enjoy second semester of orgo with Crawford nearly as much as first semester with Rablen. First semester orgo is like learning a new language: you get a feel for the subject's beauty, and they start you out with a basic vocabulary in order to slowly build up to larger concepts. Second semester orgo is like reading Crime & Punishment in Latin with only the knowledge that \"Lux et Veritas\" means \"Light and Truth.\" You are basically expected to memorize every mechanism without any real understanding of the background or underlying concepts. Grading seems a little unfair, with exam questions often going beyond the scope of what is covered in lecture, and with time limits so strict that many students choose to simply memorize every possible mechanism in order to be able to regurgitate them faster. The book is not very helpful\u2014the class skips around in it a lot, and the mechanisms don't even correlate with what Crawford teaches in class all the time. The book even has some basic things screwed up, like the structures of some amino acids. My advice: study hard, study often, go to every lecture, memorize all that you can, and never, ever, fall behind.",
    "Professor Crawford definitely made Chem 230 more enjoyable than I anticipated. His problem sets are reasonable and his tests are fair. Although Chem 230 was quite different from the pure organic chemistry of Orgo I, I definitely enjoyed learning about the various ways enzymes and proteins in the body alter molecules and environments in order to carry out certain reactions.",
    "If you're taking this you're probably a premed... It's a requirement, sooooooo have fun!",
    "If you're interested in how glycolysis, fatty acid synthesis and peptide synthesis work, take this class! After spending hours learning these pathways, I definitely feel like a biochem badass.",
    "Do not take this class. This is Biochemistry, not Organic Chemistry. If you're a freshman, do yourself a favor and take 125 (unless another teacher is teaching this class). The class is really lecture focused, if you get lost on the lectures, nothing can help you (no piazza, no TAs, book ain't helpful). It's also all about memorization. So much to memorize before tests. You also don't get to drop tests or psets. Take 125. Don't take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for a fellow pre-med. It helped me to realize that being a doctor is the path I want to take.",
    "A great class - gives a valuable perspective on organic chemistry in terms of important biological reactions. Professor Crawford is clear, organized, and explains concepts well.",
    "This is an intro chemical biology class. It has an intensive focus on organic chemistry as it applies to biological molecules and the pathways they are involved in. I think that if you want to see how organic chemistry works in living systems, this class may be a little more interesting that a traditional Orgo II course. The material covered is a little all over the map, but it is undoubtedly very useful -- I spoke with a biochemistry lab I am going to collaborate with this summer and because I took this course I was able to understand the research being discussed.",
    "Good course, probably easier than first semester. Workload isn't ridiculous, but you never know with the level of difficulty of the exams. Just have to be ready for anything. Overall I'd recommend, especially with Crawford.",
    "This class is a great representation on how Yale needs to do better. This class is for pre-meds, its a bio-chemistry class with lots of memorization and little for you to actually understand. So simply, its sucks and is a sad excuse for an organic chemistry 2 course.",
    "Organic Chemistry of Biological Pathways is a good second semester organic chemistry course, which is based in cofactor chemistry.",
    "CHEM 230 is an overall good class. The tests are written so that if you put in enough time memorizing all of the mechanisms, you will get a good grade. If you're a pre-med, taking it with Crawford will result in a higher than average grade but you will learn less than you are supposed to for a traditional second semester of organic chemistry.",
    "It's hard, but do-able. Learn how to study early on, otherwise you'll be in big trouble. Also, hopefully you're good at taking tests fast because that's a lot of what you'll be doing for the midterms.",
    "Take it if you have to. Paul Rablen and Chem 220 was better!! If you do take this class, you will be fine though!!",
    "As a prerequisite for medical school, this class does it's job. I can't really say how it compares to the other organic chemistry course taught, but in retrospect, I'm not sure I learned that much chemistry. It was actually only a few chemical concepts repeated in different contexts, and anything that was new usually had to be memorized as it's own specific mechanism. If you are genuinely passionate about organic chemistry I would probably go with the other course. If you do decide to take this course, make sure you stay on top of the work, even if the exam seems far away because material piles on really quickly and the professor often doesn't give it enough time in class. Also, going to section is incredibly important because any material that is unclear in class (there will probably be a lot) is usually cleared up here. It is very helpful to have a good section leader because they can often give out the exact questions that will be on the exam if they have already looked at the exam. Finally, there are no practice problems presented before an exam (besides in section, which can be rushed, and a few textbook problems, which are generally not representative of what we would be expected on an exam) so it is important to learn the material thoroughly the first time it is presented.",
    "This is a well-taught course that really helps the premed student understand why we have orgo chem in our lives.",
    "Even if you don't have to take it, such as being E&EB non-premed, I'd recommend it. Many of you are forced to, of course, and to them I'd say: don't be scared. This is the course that turns your learning in CHEM 220 to a practical understanding of the body. It's a bit difficult at first, because you'll be throwing out some of what you learn in CHEM 220. But you'll know how a bunch of chemical reactions in the body work, and you'll be able to diagram precisely how sugar becomes fat (among other things) at the end of the course. All of which is pretty amazing. It's not too challenging on the p-sets (although the grading was tough), and the midterms and finals are either pretty straightforward or really challenging. Prof. Crawford is pretty good too; he does a good job of being understanding, and he's very clear in his expectations and is enthusiastic for you to learn.",
    "230 is a good option if you are interested in biology, because it teaches you the intricate mechanics of how biological pathways work, and you are given context to reactions. It is a difficult course, so make sure that you start studying for exams early (this is not a course for which you can cram), and practice pushing arrows through mechanisms a lot so you know them well. Focus on the cofactors, especially for the final. As someone not studying biology, I still found 230 to be interesting, since the reactions were within the context of real processes, and since the course taught a lot of organic chemistry, too.",
    "It's not that bad, I promise. Go to lectures, stay on top of the material, and get help when you need it."
