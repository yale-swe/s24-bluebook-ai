    "Absolutely take this class. Best class I've taken at Yale. Really interesting readings, lively, thought-provoking class discussions, Andy is a thoughtful, smart, generous professor... Take it!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS, ALL OF YOU. This was the best class I have taken at Yale, and is an experience I wish every student could benefit from. The syllabus was stellar, my fellow students were incredibly engaged, and I left every seminar exhilarated, often continuing discussions with classmates as we walked home. Most of this has to do with this class' amazing professor, Andy, ie the greatest dude I have ever had the pleasure of learning under, guiding and pushing discussions, but giving students most of the speaking time -- knowledgeable, engaging, and genuine. He demanded from the get-go that we give this class our all, and it was worth it. This class has changed the way I approach thinking about the American man in the landscape, and opened my eyes to how fundamental the idea of wilderness is to the American imagination. Take it.",
    "Absolutely. This class offers a chance to think about wilderness in a variety of ways. If Andy Horowitz is teaching it again, DEFINITELY take it. I loved this class. Best seminar I've had in awhile.",
    "This is hands down the best course I've taken at Yale. I think it's hugely contingent on the professor though. Andy Horowitz is amazing. I've never had an instructor like him. He was so excited about the material, not to mention funny and always available to help. The material we read spanned from Christopher Columbus' diary to Thoreau and Emerson to James Fenimore Cooper to Edward Abbey. It covered everything and was interesting and illuminating and absolutely wonderful. You pick your paper topic (15-18 pages) and every week have an installment of progress so that you keep on track. Though it was a lot of work (200+ pages a week), it was actually super interesting. BEST CLASS EVER.",
    "Weekly reading of primary and secondary source documents and a reading response. The reading is a lot ad it is pretty intense. However, it's really really interesting.",
    "Take the class, you will remember it, be stimulated by it and carry it alongside your journey through Yale and beyond for some time.",
    "Thoreau. Roosevelt. Emerson. Leopold. And much much more. Great class if you're interested in the material! Attracts great people.",
    "I cannot recommend this class enough.",
    "This is unequivocally the best class I've taken at Yale. Amazing syllabus, brilliant students, fantastic professor.",
    "I'd recommend it super highly. A seminar with somewhat heavy reading designed to look critically at the idea of wilderness as it developed throughout American history. Lots of reading, which you will do out of interest, and a long final paper.",
    "Obviously."
