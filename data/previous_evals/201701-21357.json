    "I learned more about writing in this class than I had in years of high school. Throughout the semester, we explored the aspects of great essay writing.",
    "I became a better writer in literally every way.",
    "This was a fantastic course in which I definitely improved my writing skills. I highly recommend taking this class over Engl 114 or 115 if you are over \"academic writing\". This course challenges you to write about your own experiences and about people and places that you know. The writing that you do in this course has a lot of freedom and is more similar to the type of writing you may come across in the New Yorker or the Onion. I highly recommend this course -- especially to those who already have a knack for writing!!",
    "I gained many of the skills needed to write New Yorker-style essays.",
    "My writing skills definitely improved thanks to this class."

   "comments": [
    "Very organized and very clear expectations. Weakness? Projected too much of personal politics within discussion that could\/should have focused more on writing itself.",
    "Honestly I don't think this course, or Professor Andrews, had any important weaknesses to speak of. English 120 was well-structured with appropriate readings and essays which hone the writer's skill in all of the important ways. The workload was perfectly balanced and class time was well used. I learned a ton. I don't have a whole lot more to say.",
    "The course is great! I think the way it is organized to place an emphasis on different types of writing is highly successful! Kimberly was great! She was super engaging, friendly, funny, and patient with the class! She will be missed!!",
    "I believe the teaching style of the course was great! The mixture of literary analysis, skills development and lecturing was spot-on.",
    "This course was generally structured well. I liked how the reading were tailored to specific lessons on writing. Perhaps the only drawback of this method was that we often got sidetracked into analyzing parts of the readings that weren't really relevant to learning how to write, by which I mean we sometimes dwelled too long on the content of the essays over the style."

   "comments": [
    "ENGL 120 is generally a fun course. You write in a variety of styles in a low-pressure environment (well, more low-pressure compared to other Yale classes) with many other students similarly seeking the same environment. And you definitely improve your writing skills.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students, regardless of whether or not they are pursuing the English major. Just thinking about and having intellectually stimulating discussions about real people, places, things, and issues was a joy and pleasure -- learning to emulate these techniques was fascinating as well.",
    "Definitely! I learned so much from Kimberly, even if her selection of class readings seemed a bit biased.",
    "Everyone should take this course. This kind of writing is an incredibly valuable skill and Professor Andrews did an excellent job teaching it.",
    "This was a fantastic course in which I definitely improved my writing skills. I highly recommend taking this class over Engl 114 or 115 if you are over \"academic writing\". This course challenges you to write about your own experiences and about people and places that you know. The writing that you do in this course has a lot of freedom and is more similar to the type of writing you may come across in the New Yorker or the Onion. I highly recommend this course -- especially to those who already have a knack for writing!!",
    "Yes--a very fun English course!!",
    "Yes. It's a good way to do a writing credit, as the readings are short and fun, and the writings themselves are more enjoyable than a typical academic lit crit english essay. It's also a good way to improve your expository writing, as having to submit either a new or revised essay (nearly) every week forces you to become an efficient and effective writer!"
