    "Dr. Tschudi and Melanie are the best",
    "This class was boring but necessary because I did learn things that are important in conducting research. Some of the guest lecturers were very dry and people seemed to have a hard time paying attention. Maybe more time allotted for questions and discussion would make the course more interesting.",
    "Pretty useful in that letting us know something about honor code, academic conduct.",
    "So, I think this was actually a good course for first year PhD students to tackle a bunch of issues that they'll confront in their careers. It was also the ONLY time when early current PhD students are in one place together. While it seems like it largely exists to deal with NIH requirements for funding, the forum turned out to be a useful one for at least my cohort of students.",
    "Helpful in highlighting ethical and other situations we may encounter as we move forward in our careers.",
    "Very, very useful and helpful course\/seminar. Not what I was expecting based on the title, but very practical.Would have liked to have had access to presentations through classesv2.",
    "Strengths: discussion of interesting and mostly relevant issues for PhD students.Weaknesses: more case examples and discussion could be nice",
    "Learned a lot",
    "very useful!",
    "This course was a basic overview of topics in research - ethics, peer review etc. It accomplished what it set out to do and was not burdensome. Overall, I think Dr. Tschudi's approach was great.",
    "I thought that some of the topics were actually quite useful."

    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Chris is a great, sympathetic and avuncular teacher. We're lucky to have him as the director of the PhD program. He clearly cares about graduate education, which for some professors at Yale is something they don't really care about (i.e. they want grants and publications, students' welfare is secondary).",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0I thoroughly enjoy listening to Dr. Tschudi. He was very informative and I appreciated learning about his experiences as a researcher.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Excellent instructor, very approachable and sensitive to students' concerns.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Chris did a great job. Was sensitive to students interest and lack of interest in the topic.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Nice instructor",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Dr. Tschudi was responsive to students and respectful of our time. It is clear that he cares about the personal and professional well-being of EPH graduate students.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0Dr. Tschudi is a wonderful lecturer.",
    "Instructor: Christian Tschudi \u00a0I appreciated Chris' openness and candid responses to student questions."
