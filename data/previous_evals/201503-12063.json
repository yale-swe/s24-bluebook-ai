   "comments": [
    "Take it! Mme Cadieu is super nice, welcoming, and so knowledgeable. If you like modern novels and the French language, it's the perfect course for you",
    "I would absolutely recommend. It is a lot of work to read roughly one French novel per week, and you won't get much out of it if you don't keep up, so you do need to put the effort in. If that doesn't scare you off, then by all means, absolutely take this course.",
    "This is a great French literature course especially if you are interested in learning a lot about contemporary French literature and the whole culture around it. The syllabus was great, Prof Cadieu is very full of energy and passion for the subject. The papers were a bit tricky because Prof Cadieu was looking for a very particular kind of writing which I think she could have helped her students with a bit more.",
    "Highly recommend! A great, modern syllabus and an engaging, passionate instructor. Heavy workload (extensive reading each week - you'll want to do all of it because it's so good!)",
    "Great class. (Especially after the Modern French Novel lecture, btw) To second what I've heard so many people say, Prof. Cadieu is the best. She'll tell you where you need to go with your reading (and theory, if applicable) to make it better. Upper level students, especially, her diagnostic skills in this regard are so valuable.",
    "Yes I would recommend this to another student. Overall, the syllabus was good and the discussion were sometimes interesting. Professor Cadieu is a good seminar leader.",
    "Really interesting survey course of what's happening right in France and literature",
    "Read and talk about contemporary French novels.",
    "FREN 233 is an overview of contemporary French literature. It covers most genres from the past twenty years, from autofiction to minimalism. It also talks about how literature is portrayed in the media in present-day France. Though there is a good amount of reading, the workload for the class is not bad, only a few papers and a group presentation. Also, Professor Cadieu is the absolute best professor ever. I would take this class again without hesitation."
