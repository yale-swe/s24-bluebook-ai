    "Yes, I would recommend this class. You will learn about IR theory, game theoretic ways to think about war and conflicts, and causal inference. Your research design will improve because Prof. Dafoe also teaches methods well.",
    "I do recommend it because it helps you develop research and theoretical skills if you\u00c2\u00b4re interested in becoming a scholar.",
    "A lot of reading, but totally worth it. Super super interesting, and the paper was really fun.",
    "Yeah, good class, take it if you are interested in the subject of reputation in international politics. It is a narrow topic, but an in depth study.",
    "Broad overview of the literature in the field of reputation. Much more mathy and model based than you would expect. Good, but not necessary, to have some game theory background",
    "Yes, I would recommend it"
