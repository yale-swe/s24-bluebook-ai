    "NOT a gut",
    "This class is not a gut. It was much harder than I expected. Lecture was interesting, but the weekly problem sets would have been pretty impossible if my section leader hadn't been so helpful.",
    "Very worthy science credit.",
    "Nope, would not recommend. Terrible course, too much work, Faison is boring, exams are either too hard or too easy (and thus the curve is god knows where).",
    "I'd summarize this class just as I did before: a fun class with an excellent professor. It's not a cake walk, but the workload is not too demanding, especially since the TAs will essentially give you the answers to all the problem sets if you can just find an hour every week to go to section. I'd recommend this class to any person who is interested in getting a QR or SC credit out of the way, but would still like to learn something interesting and useful.",
    "Take it. Understanding the universe is an important piece of knowledge. Nothing too mathematically challenging, mainly qualitative.",
    "Astronomy 120 is a good science class for people who aren\u0092t particularly skilled in the sciences. Dr. Faison turns difficult textbook material into understandable pieces ofknowledge. The course also had a logical progression that helped us to arrive at the big ideas for ourselves. I was able to successfully explain the potential heat death of the universe to a friend in about three minutes, so that might say something about what non-science walk away with after taking this class.",
    "I would recommend it perhaps if there were better discussion sections. Expect to rely on teaching yourself.",
    "Take it! It's a great overview of all the big concepts in astronomy (except planets). I thought it was fascinating, and the math is very simple.",
    "A lot harder than advertised during shopping period. Problem sets aren't that bad if you work with someone else and go to section (the TFs basically give you the answers if you ask for them--not the best in terms of learning the material, though). Lectures are more or less interesting but not all that helpful for psets. The first test was a rude awakening for me (and I think for a lot of other people as well). The second test wasn't as bad, but the final was cumulative and seemed surprisingly difficult. Everything's curved, at least.Basically, being forced by Yale College to take a QR out of some misguided notion of academic breadth is a miserable experience. Galaxies and the Universe is no more miserable than any other QR you might take.",
    "Take it if you are really with QR\/science stuff or if you are willing to go to section to stay ahead of stuff.",
    "Solid introduction to the structures of stars, galaxies, and the universe. If you took Planets and Stars, note that Galaxies and the Universe covers some of the same material at the beginning, with the result that it moves a bit faster through the later material. Prof. Faison is a great lecturer. If you're even vaguely interested in astronomy, definitely consider taking this.",
    "It's a good class for SC. You get the credit and lots of good knowledge about our Universe. If you're not looking for a gut science class, I recommend it. (This class involves weekly problem sets, two mid-terms, and a final. By no means is this class a gut.)",
    "I would recommend Astronomy 120 to anyone who is is interested in learning about astronomy and cosmology and who wants to be introduced into Relativity in a relatively approachable way. If you enjoyed Astronomy 110, I would recommend taking this course (and not just because the first half of the semester will be easy to breeze through because the first chunk of material is very similar to 110.)",
    "No, I wouldn't take this. The problem sets are tricky each week; the tests are very difficult; and it is quite a feat to not fall asleep in lecture. It expects you to be able to grasp and apply lots of math and physics. Yep, don't do it. Stay far away.",
    "Don't take it. It's listed as an intro to astronomy type course, but it's actually very difficult.Problem sets are WAY too much work. No way I'm recommending this class or taking another intro to astronomy class.",
    "This class is very good. The professor's lectures are engaging and the material is quite interesting--stuff every educated person should probably know. A great science credit. Be warned, the first midterm is a bit hard, but the other two tests are a piece of cake.",
    "If you took Astro 110 already and need another QR\/Sc, definitely take this. Astro 110 gives you a good base of understanding and made 120 a lot easier for me than 110 was.",
    "Great class if you want to know the origins and evolution of the universe. The quant part is pretty simple, but understanding the physics is the key.",
    "It is not a GUT class! It is a ton of work. If you are looking for a class that's a ton of work or you are interested in astronomy, i guess you can take it.",
    "Professor Faison is an engaging and entertaining lecturer, as well as very kind and accommodating. In addition to making the material very accessible to non-science people, he also makes it very interesting and thought-provoking. Sometimes the material gets a little too dense, but you're not expected to be responsible for such material on the tests typically. Definitely not a gut, but not hard if you keep up with the problem sets and go to lecture.",
    "If you took physics in high school and want to know more about our universe, take this course! If you're not that interested and are looking for a science credit - beware. This course is not as easy as one may think!",
    "I would recommend Astro 120 if you're going to do the work. It really makes a difference whether you go to lectures and sections and do the reading or not. The professor is really engaging and lectures are fairly entertaining. Plus, section is optional, and it is a QR that says you don't need calculus and actually means it!!",
    "I would not recommend this course to a fellow student. There are far better QR fulfillments and this one just takes up too much time and energy to be worth it.",
    "Astro120 is a HARD class. Definitely not a gut. There is lots of math and some difficult concepts. The problem sets are LONG but if you have someone to work with (like I did) they're not too bad. Tests were generally easier than the problem sets. Would definitely recommend going to lecture\/section if you can. Overall, this is not a bad class, since Science\/QRs credits are never easy, but you definitely need to put in the work if you want to do well.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students, though I am a graduate student at the Divinity School. It provided a great comprehensive elementary understanding of astronomy. It is, however, a substantial amount of work and cumulative. Therefore, I would only recommend it to someone who is genuinely interested in learning about astronomy.",
    "Good class to take for a science credit. There isn't much math though, so if you're looking for something more quantitative and less theoretical, this isn't really the class for you.",
    "Do not take this class. While intended for non-science majors and ostensibly only a survey course, the psets required up to seven hours of work. The math was simple, but because the course attempts to cover every possible Astronomy topic, each week feels like starting over. Concepts were not covered in sufficient depth for comprehension, and while Faison is a very nice guy, he did not adequately cover the material in class and could not engage the class in lecture. Sections are 'optional' but necessary to do well on problem sets. However section leaders are not prepared to teach the material. They act almost like tutorswho look at the problem sets for the first time during section and often don't attend the lecture. Taking this class was a painful experience.",
    "If you are looking for an easy science or qr credit, do not take this class. The material was interesting, but sometimes the problem sets could be a pain in the butt. If you genuinely want to learn something about astronomy, take this class. I think I definitely took this class for the wrong reasons, so the p-sets weren't a priority. Consequently, the exams tended to be a little difficult for me.",
    "Tough class but unfortunately probably one of the best for non science majors. Very scientific language that becomes really confusing the third week in. Problem sets are manageable if you go to section and have a study group, but the exams are really tough.",
    "I took it because I needed a science credit but I didn't want a total gut. This class is definitely NOT a gut. It makes you work and the material is hard, though interesting. My problem was that I have a strong aversion to chemistry, and I was looking for more of a physics course, which astronomy was not. Overall, a solid course with great professors\/TAs and you can get help is so many ways if you're struggling.",
    "it's not a gut class",
    "Great if you want astronomy\/cosmology without all of the math.",
    "If anything about space and galaxies interest you it is a great class to take. You feel like you learn new things and better understand the Universe. The math isn't too intensive but you have to know when to apply the formulas. Besides that it was one of the better classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Not easy, but not too challenging. A good QR for those actually interested in science.",
    "ASTR 120 is very doable for those who consider themselves at least somewhat capable in math; it doesn't require any advanced mathematical concepts (calculus), but it's good to be comfortable with basic algebra.I'm very glad I took this course. Some basic understanding of our universe and how we fit into it has intrinsic value, and there's no reason it's any less important to understanding the human condition than, say, Plato or Aristotle. Faison is quirky but always knowledgeable and kind, and presents the material in a very manageable and understandable way.",
    "If you think stars are pretty and cosmogeny (the study of the origins of the universe) is fascinating, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. You will spend the first five or six weeks ruining your favorable impressions of astronomy on solar evolution, or the many various and boring changes which stars undergo through their lifetimes. Those lectures are UNBEARABLY BORING. Only the last few weeks of the course are cool. Don't be wooed by the beautiful star pictures. The lectures accompanying them will ruin all their wonder for you. If you're looking for a QR, this is not it: there's way too much (incredibly boring) qualitative material you need to memorize; Calc 115 (or Syntax, or Logic) would be MUCH easier (and probably more enjoyable).",
    "Yeah, why not? You look at beautiful pictures of the universe. Cosmology is cool.",
    "Maybe. If you can motivate yourself to go to class, then yes.",
    "The course is a rigorous examination of astronomical concepts and content, with difficult and pickily graded problem sets offset by good opportunities for extra credit. If you're not a math person, this will not be an easy class, but it may be your best chance at squeezing in a QR or SCI credit.",
    "Great course, outstanding lecturer, indispensable material. Regardless of your career, this knowledge will make your life better.",
    "Don't take it for your SC. Don't take if for your SC. Don't take if for your SC.",
    "This course starts off from fairly easy subjects but gets gradually harder as the semester goes on. Don't expect it to be an easy course and prepare to put a significant amount of work into it if you want to do well in this class.",
    "Great introduction to astronomy, especially if you're interested in the subject but are not a science person."
