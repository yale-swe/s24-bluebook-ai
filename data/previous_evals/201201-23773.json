    "TAKE THIS IF YOU GET IN. The class is awesome--you gain real skills because Professor Smith has been in the real national security policy-making world (look him up). The readings are great, and the memos are fun to write and you learn a lot, whether you realize it or not.Also, we had unbelievable guests to the class: New York Times national security\/foreign policy correspondents, assistant secretary of defense, (not to mention the Deputy National Security Advisor!)In terms of workload, it's not bad at all. Readings not totally necessary although they're worth it, and 2 big papers and an in-class presentation. This is a must-take.",
    "The national security apparatus uses the media to advance its policies, and the media influences the national security debate and policies themselves. Anyone that is interested in national security or the role of the media should take this class. One of the best seminars I've taken in my four years at Yale.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this course. The readings were engaging; Prof. Smith was easily accessible and personable. We had amazing guest speakers from the government and prominent media publications come talk to our class. There was a substantial amount of reading, but it was informative, and there was only one midterm paper, final paper, and a team presentation. I would most definitely recommend this course.",
    "I really enjoyed this seminar. The class is set up so that the Professor leads class discussion every other week. In the off weeks, student groups facilitate class discussion and lead the class for the day. I thought that was a GREAT idea...it kept the classes interesting and ensured that everyone participated. Professor Smith is a really nice guy too! I would definitely recommend taking the class if you are interested in national security and current events. There is a lot of reading, but it's all relevant.",
    "A fantastic class. The readings are interesting, the professor is great, and the class discussions were engaging. However, one or two people often dominated discussion, so it rarely ended up having much to do with the reading.",
    "Good course. Classmates were not as vapid as in other sections (that's a complement, not condescension!), and the professor was knowledgable and pretty hands-off. I mean, if you love Barack Obama - and if you go here, you probably do - this is most definitely your thing. As many clips as we read, though, the course is not so media-focused:more like from the perspective of the establishment, how do you deal with the media?Wish we didn't have to read Tom Friedman's book, though. Dear God. It's like reading a Tom Friedman column over and over, only he quotes other people (among them CEOs and 12-year-olds he finds especially profound) at \/extreme\/ length.",
    "This is a really cool seminar. It's a good overview of US Security issues, but it isn't boring because of the media twist. Smith is a really chill, cool guy and the discussion was entertaining. Readings were generally super interesting and not too long.",
    "Everything about this class is wonderful. You emerge with solid knowledge of world events and you get to meet an awesome professor. I literally cannot think of a reason not to take this class.",
    "The course was great in that we got to skype some leaders in the political and journalistic world. However, I felt that we never really engaged with theoretical material to back up the assumptions we were making beyond the first week. As a result, the lessons of the class became very surface level and each session a replica of the one before it. However, you do get a survey of some of the major political issues going on today.",
    "I'd recommend it.",
    "Take it for the guests. The guests that coming in are incredibly interesting and engaging."
