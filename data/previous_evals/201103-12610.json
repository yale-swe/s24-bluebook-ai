   "comments": [
    "Take this class. Whether or not you have written before. Such a great into to writing plays. I had written plays before, and this class was so helpful to me, especially because of the reading list and the discussions of the plays on the syllabus. I learned so much from this class. It can be a bit frustrating to only get to workshop 18 pages of work total over the course of the semester (as opposed to his class in the spring, where you can workshop closer to 100 pages of work), but you can meet with Professor Margulies outside of class to make up for this shortage. SUCH a good class. Everyone in the class was obsessed with it.",
    "If you are remotely interested in playwriting, TAKE THIS CLASS. It's capped at 12 people, making this an intimate and very personal experience. The readings are fantastic and the structure of the course is brilliant. You write a one-act play by the end of the semester, and every week 3 people present the work they have so far after a discussion of the play\/s assigned for the week. We have short assignments every week that really help develop our skills. It was a really fantastic experience.",
    "Definitely recommended. I've learned so much about playwriting and writing in general. I have so many new thoughts on how to approach creative writing. It's great!",
    "Yes.",
    "A great course thatwill help you write a one-act, be in a community of actors, writers, thespians who really care about helping you grow, and with a professor who is dedicated to his students and is an accomplished playwright himself. I recommend this class to anyone who can get in -- Margulies only lets 12 people in the course, so you will have to fight your way in!",
    "Anyone interested in creative writing would do themselves a disservice not to try and take this class. It's one of the best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes.",
    "Absolutely fantastic! The teaching format of this seminar works extraordinarily well, with the reading and discussion of a (usually) excellent play, and then a putting-into-practice of that play's greatest strength or most interesting device. Every assignment felt illuminative and thoughtfully planned. In workshopping of students' own writing, Margulies sets such a constructive tone: simultaneously critical, sharp, and supportive. Obviously, the quality of student work varied, but regardless of level, most writing improved substantially over thecourse of the semester.Rigorous in a good way and beyond worthwhile -the highlight of the semester."
