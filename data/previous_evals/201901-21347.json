    "Amazing professor! Quizzes and homework are very helpful!",
    "Strength: contact time Weakness: too often",
    "Strengths: lots of cool, hands-on activities to learn Hebrew, which makes it a lot more fun. This class is super interactive, which is the best way to learn Hebrew. Orit is the sweetest lady and a great teacher. You get to listen to a lot of Israeli music and learn tons about the culture! Weaknesses: a lot of everyday work, which can be tedious, but is really the only way to learn as much as we've learned in one single semester.",
    "The course is well organized. The workload is not overbearing. Content is engaging."

    "Yes! Hebrew is so fun to learn at Yale because the professors are engaging and the students become very close. It is very clear what is expected of the students and easy to improve.",
    "Absolutely!! Such an amazing course!! I learned so much!! I feel like Im a great Hebrew speaker now!",
    "Yes - if they want to learn Hebrew.",
    "Absolutely. The Hebrew department at Yale is amazing and it's a great way to learn a really cool language and learn about the culture, too. The class is smaller than other language classes, which is really helpful for learning and makes the entire experience very personal.",
    "Yes! It is a terrific continuation of learning Hebrew from L1."
