   "comments": [
    "I felt like I got a really solid foundation to a lot of new physics in this class!! Good class. Problem sets come irregularly, so make sure you stay on top of the material between psets.Prof. Schoelkopf sets up an awesome physics demo almost every class.",
    "The material gets really tough towards the end of the semester, but overall a really good class. Professor Schoelkopf is great, and it was awesome having someone that accomplished with such a small class (about 8 people). He is very laid-back, but he teaches the material very effectively. Definitely take it if Schoelkopf's teaching it.",
    "This course covers basic electricity and magnetism-- fields, scalar potentials, vector potentials. There's a bit on circuits, impedance, etc. And then the course covers transmission lines, waveguides, and briefly touches upon cavity resonators and antennas (or really the principles behind antennas). If you would like to learn and to use Maxwell's Equations, to witness first hand their profundity and develop an appreciation for them, take this course.",
    "APHY 322 was a very exciting experience. Coming in from PHYS 200\/260, you cement your understanding of statics, dynamics, and Maxwell's equations for the first half of the course. Then, you venture into a series of topics in microwave engineering, ranging from transmission lines to wave guides. Some of these topics do get incredibly challenging but Schoelkopf is a very fair professor. The oral final was perhaps the best aspect of the course, since it tested you on general conceptual understanding, as opposed to nuances in problem solving. The only drawback to this course is that at times, it strikes an awkward balance between EE and applied physics. Some of the topics will, at times, be too physics-y for engineers and vice versa. But this does balance out across the class, so it wasn't a big worry.",
    "APHY 332 is a great course that has a 70\/30 mix of physics and electrical engineering. You really learn about electrodynamics (the later chapters of Griffiths) and do some good work with circuits and then continue to study microwaves. I would say this is a great alternative to PHYS 430, and if Schoelkopf is teaching the course, then definitely take it. He is a great professor, and if you do your work, you will learn a lot. The final exam is an oral exam, which is much better than a regular test. Not only do you learn more in studying for the exam, but you learn things from the exam itself. Overall, this was an excellent course that I would recommend to anyone wishing to learn more E&M.",
    "Aphy 322 is a great but challenging course. Make sure you review your multivariable calc first. I took it after math120 and phys180 and was able to follow everything pretty well, though psets and exams were quite tough. There are bi-monthly psets which is good and the professor is quite flexible with deadlines and scheduling of exams.It was a good course, whih I found extremely useful as a BS in electrical engineering."
