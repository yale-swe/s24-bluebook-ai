    "It's a good way to learn about some current events without needing much background in economics.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE THIS CLASS if you're premed, econ major, or even just think the title and topic itself sound remotely interesting. Health econ covers topics and issues that are really really applicable and important in today's U.S., and everyone should have a good idea about what it covers, because we'll all inevitably have to deal with healthcare issues sometime in the future. Also, Forman is a BOSS. I have no clue how this guy gets any sleep...he does so much; it blows my mind. He's an expert in his field, and he knows the material like the back of his hand. It's pretty hard nowadays to find a professor who's so knowledgable about what he's teaching that he almost literally knows what every single line and number in his slides mean. Also, he's extremely responsive to email (thanks to his iPhone), and is a great resource to lots of other interesting opportunities. His Brooklyn accent is also entertaining to listen to. The class Powerpoint based, but isn't boring because of the nature of the material. Just go to class, take good notes, read over the slides, go to review sessions, and you'll be fine for the tests. The final paper is pretty cool to write too, since you can just pick your own interesting topic. My favorite class at Yale so far. A must-take.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone pre-med. This are things I would hope\/expect all doctors to know.Definitely interesting and very useful, and gives you a much more objective view of doctors (and pharma, and insurance) and how they can help\/hurt our healthcare system",
    "There was less economics in this course than I had expected. I felt like I was learning the specifics of an industry, rather than economics applied to it. It's useful for pre-meds (or anyone else getting into the healthcare industry; for example, biotech or pharmaceutical companies) so that they're more familiar with what they're getting themselves into. However, it's not as useful for economics majors. Another thing that you get out of this course is that you'll become more savvy with your own healthcare decisions.",
    "Only take it if you're really interested in the subject matter. I started the class Credit D, expecting to switch it to a grade, but then realized that I had no interest in the material, and never made the switch. If you want to learn about healthcare, just read wikipedia.",
    "I would highly recommend it",
    "I would recommend Econ 170 because you learn a lot from the course. Be prepared to do outside research for the midterm and final and be sure to study hard, but overall, the class was very important for me, and I absolutely don't regret taking it at all. It will remain one of the most influential classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! Covers some very interesting material",
    "I would recommend it if you've taken basic microecon and have any interest in public policy\/government.",
    "ECON 170 provides a very comprehensive look at how the U.S. healthcare operates and what problems exist. The weekly reading and final paper weren't bad but the midterm and final can be difficult to study. A pretty good econ class.",
    "Yeah, only take it if youre really interested in health care tho. Don't just take it for an econ credit if youre not interested in the material",
    "If you want to learn econ, don't take this. Take Amanda K's Econ 405, she's an actual economist.If you are a premed and just want to show off some healthcare knowledge without really understanding the mechanisms, this might help you out.",
    "Definitely recommended! Very interesting for almost anyone!",
    "During the first two weeks of this course, I thought it was pretty great. I knew a lot of what was being discussed from being somewhat of a policy wonk, and the reading load really isn't that bad. But it got boring, and past a point, it was tough to see how any of it was relevant if you aren't going to work at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services or going into health care consulting.Don't be fooled: it is not an economics class. You talk about elasticities for about two days, briefly mull over something referred to as a physician \"shortage,\" and moral hazard and imperfect information are recurring phrases. But by and large, it's memorizing regulations and minutae about federal programs. And, despite what you are told, that's what the final is,too. I felt the class was full of premeds who were better at just memorizing stuff than people who were interested in applying economics.TL;DR A friend told me at the beginning that this was a gut and now I want to punch him in the mouth.",
    "I took this course as a pre-med science major with zero previous econ background outside of honors econ in high school. In the end, even though I think it was a bit above my league, and that my lack of econ exposure probably prevented me from getting an A, I think it was a positive experience overall. You definitely learn a lot of important information that will eventually serve you well in medical school admissions, and that's the main plus. Some drawbacks are that many of the lectures are disorganized, especially for those with no background. Also, the exams aren't easy by any stretch, and the curve is rough (i.e. 93% plus needed for an A, you don't usually see that at Yale). Regardless, you should still take it -- opting to not take a course in healthcare econ because you don't know econ doesn't bode well for your future as a successful physician.",
    "I would only recommend it for people interested in the subject matter, if not expect to be learning a lot of specifics and details that are not very interesting or applicable to general situations. For non-econ people, it is a good place to pick up basic econ concepts.",
    "To anyone who wants to acquire basic knowledge about how health services are processed, anyone who wants to go into medicine, anyone who is interested in economics, or anyone who is interested in issues that affect our community, this is a great class! I really learned a lot and would definitely recommend it. I didn't take microecon, but I was able to get by, even as a freshman in a mostly junior class. But don't let the behavioral economics approach make you think that this class is easy. The exams are challenging and you will be forced to keep up with lots of information in this class. But regardless, completing this class will be extremely rewarding and leave you asking for more.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. If you are pre-med or interested in learning more about the healthcare industry as a whole, this is a great course. The professor is very interesting, and the material is comprehensive. The workload isn't bad either.",
    "This class gives you a sound understanding of the problems inherent in healthcare markets and the way the recent reform bill attempts to solve these problems. Although the lectures are dry, the material is actually pretty interesting and extremely relevant. If you devote yourself to this class, you will come away being a relative expert on healthcare markets and Obama's Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. You will also be shocked at how ignorant most people are on this subject, especially what Obama's bill actually did and why it did those things. I am very glad I took this class, as I have already been involved in several conversations on this subject (without me bringing up the subject) and realized that I actually know a lot about this topic and much more than any of my family members and friends. If you are interested in healthcare at all, I would absolutely recommend taking this class. It may not be thrilling, but it will be very informative.",
    "Exams difficult but interesting. Class is interesting if you like the subject matter.",
    "Professor Forman is extremely knowledgeable about this subject and makes himself available to talk to. This is a great class for anyone who plans on being connected to healthcare as a physician, policy maker, or a consumer of health care (basically, it'll be interesting for everyone). Take it!",
    "Yes, take this course for a conceptual overview of healthcare and reform in the US. No more than a basic understanding of simple economic concepts is needed (externalities, supply-demand curve).",
    "It's a great class. It might feel rote because it is for someone who doesn't know anything about the system. But once one clears the jargon and conceptual foundations there are some interesting insights to pick up.",
    "If you are at all interested in medicine or public health, you must take this class. Forman is great; he can be dry sometimes but that's more the material's fault than his own (e.g. no one can make pharmaceuticals fun). This class is definitely easier for people with an economic background since those people have a better foundation for understanding the how\/why questions, but pretty much anyone with sufficient interested should be able to do really well. Take this class seriously - it's not hard, but can potentially kick your ass.",
    "The material taught in this class is important for everyone to understand because we all pay taxes towards healthcare and we consume it throughout our lives. The class gives you a great perspective on healthcare reform and the healthcare system in the US, and it's good to feel more educated on this topic.",
    "Pretty decent survey of the developing climate of health economics. The heatlhcare system itself is pretty convoluted, and this course does a good job of condensing it and making it manageable to learn about.",
    "Great class, going to and paying attention in lecture is crucial to doing well in the class. A lot of up-to-date material as well on current events.",
    "I think an understanding of the healthcare system is incredibly important for everyone as a citizen, but especially people that are planning on entering the healthcare industry.",
    "Econ 170 is NOT an Econ course. If you are pre-med, I would recommend this class as it focuses more on the history of our health system, and is useful for you to know. Otherwise, I would not recommend taking the class. I felt that most of what was learned could easily be found on the internet, and it wasn't presented in a very interesting or compelling manner.",
    "Interesting summary of the US healthcare system. Fast pace but very interesting.",
    "You'll learn a lot from the class. Towards the end of the semester, everything starts making sense. However, the tests are very very very detail-orientated. You need to memorize EVERYTHING.",
    "If you really want to learn about the healthcare system and the healthcare reform (if you're completely unfamiliar), take it. There are also pizzas at the last review session.",
    "Highly recommended. This class provides a great, low-stress introduction to the US healthcare system. Professor Forman is great. The class has a pretty low workload, as all the readings on the syllabus are supplemental (aka, not tested). That means you can just go to lecture and learn all you need. There is some emphasis on using economic concepts as a method of analysis, but the class is not quantitative at all. Even though you don't dive into the topics at an extremely rigorous level, this class will definitely give you the background that will allow you to understand the healthcare system (so pre-meds, please take this class, even if only Cr\/D), and it will also prepare you for further study in healthcare.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this course. The material begins as interesting but becomes boring quickly, and though there are few evaluations, they are much more difficult than you'd assume. There is basically no work besides for the two exams and the paper, though, so in that sense it is an easy class. Professor Forman is a decent lecturer, but even he can't make the material interesting.",
    "It depends on if you want to know this material, its not really fun, but if it has to do with your career it may be necessary. I really felt like I learned a lot.",
    "Yes. Even if you're not pre-med, you need to know this information as an American citizen\/resident. Great overview of the U.S. healthcare system. Prof. Forman is very knowledgeable, though dry at times. Workload is pretty manageable (readings are optional). Class was good, but overrated.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Econ 170, especially for anyone remotely interested in going into a field related to health care. No economics background is necessary (I certainly didn't have any). You will learn an immense amount about how health care works in the US (not so much other countries), but really not too much econ. Howard Froman is wonderful and ridiculously qualified, definitely make an effort to get to know him. The work is always pretty manageable, but you should go to lectures. There's a very short assignment at the beginning of term (seriously, it's nothing), two reading responses (once again, very easy), two tests (straight forward and short), and a final paper (which you can write on just about anything and you get plenty of warning). The readings are very interesting and light, though often don't relate to the current lecture material. All testing is done off of lecture, so I suppose you could skip the reading, but it would be a shame. Overall, this is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and has perhaps taught me more about the real world than any other. Highly recommended.",
    "It's a decent class, and you learn a lot about healthcare in the US, but it could be better. The lectures are interesting, but you sometimes get the feeling that a ton of random information and stats are just being thrown in your face, and there isn't much of a connecting link between them. Take it if you find the subject interesting, but not a must-take class.",
    "Fun, easy",
    "I would definitely recommend it because of how applicable it is to the real world, more so than any other course I've taken at Yale."
