   "comments": [
    "It's definitely an easy course. Whether it's worth sitting through the dull material is up to you. But don't think that it's a gut. The material is easy, but only if you come to class, read the book, etc. And the curve sucks, so if you don't do those things, you're not going to get an A.",
    "good class, enriches your appreciation for music, but can be a bit tough for someone with absolutely no music background",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "Listening to Music is not a gut course. Trust me, you will have to do work and you will have to study. Actually, during the entire course, we never clapped. If you're looking for an enjoyable class that will teach you about classical music without learning music class, then this is the class for you. You listen to amazing music and learn why it's amazing and how to talk about. Easily the most fun class I took this semester, and possibly at Yale.",
    "It was a good introduction to classical music with interesting facts and information that every appreciator of music should be exposed to. I would highly recommend this class to any student. It was extremely interesting and entertaining. Also it was not extremely work intensive. It was a fun class.",
    "absolutely take this class. you will love classical music afterward.",
    "If you don't have any background in music it can be difficult.",
    "Incredible class. Prof. Wright is truly hilarious, engaging, and knowledgable. HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended. Take this class before you leave Yale. Seriously.",
    "Sure. It's easy, no doubt, but take it Credit D and you pretty much don't have to show up if you have any understanding of music. Then again be serious about it and it's interesting and easy.",
    "This was an easy course that won't take up too much of your time.",
    "MUSI 112 is a great introductory class to people who have no musical experience. Although it is not always easy, it is not a huge amount of work. If you have studied music, take something more challenging and interesting, and don't screw over the kids who actually want to learn something new. I would absolutely recommend it to those who find music interesting, have no experience, and want to learn more about it.",
    "Take this class because it's awesome and not very difficult.",
    "I very highly recommend that anyone and everyone take this class. It is essentially a lecture on culture and beauty, and you can tell Prof. Wright really enjoys himself.",
    "Yes! Might be slow for advanced musicians, but extremely culturally edifying. Just as any intelligent person should be able to speak about history and literature, this class gives you a fundamental crash course in Western classical music. Workload is super light (listening exercises from the book each week), three tests (including the final), short paper on a live performance, and final paper (I wrote 5 pages on Fantasia). Prof. Wright tells you right off this class is meant to be easy, and the work is - but you can choose to challenge yourself to really learn how to listen to music and absorb as much music history as you'd like beyond what you need for tests.",
    "I would definitely recommend Listening to Music. It's a fun and exciting class. The lectures are interesting and informative. It's important to study for tests and keep up with listening exercises and to make sure you understand the musical concepts. Overall, it's a great change of pace from most other classes.",
    "Definitely definitely recommend this course. You learn so much, and Professor Wright is just phenomenal. You come out of lecture humming the pieces you've heard and it just makes your day.",
    "This is a great class if you want a good introduction to the history of classical music. Note that it requires more work than people think.",
    "For the majority of the semester, this course is easy and interesting. Professor Wright tries to include a lot of different types of music in the lectures. Often, the music was stuck in my head for the rest of the day. Towards the end of the semester, though, there was a lot of work with the paper and the final. The tests were often overly specific, but in the end I am happy I took this course because I learned so much more about classical music and now appreciate it more also.",
    "Take it! It's more work than it sounds (even for someone with a musical background like me) but it is a wonderful course and Craig Wright is actually the bomb. You'll learn a lot with not a lot of effort, and it is the perfect de-stressor class.",
    "Music 112 is a good class to take, but if you don't have a musical background you have to put some work in. I was glad I took it for credit, but even then you have to do some work, but its a fun class to have in your schedule.",
    "You should absolutely take this class. It is not remotely gutty, and while there isn't a huge amount of work, the tests and papers are not easy and you have to work to keep up (or work frantically to catch up). If you are committed to actually attending the class, it might be a good Credit\/D (less stress about grades), but I would imagine getting a D would not be that challenging if you did none of the work. Also, you'll want to go to lectures. They are incredible. And DO THE READING, it will make everything make more sense. Basically, while it should not be taken as a super easy fifth class as many people think it should, there are few classes at Yale where I have learned more than in this one. For someone who knew nothing about music, I feel like I have come a long way, and that is wholly thanks to Professor Wright.",
    "Yep. Good class. The treatment of music theory is somewhat superficial, so if you're willing to do a little more work, I might recommend taking a more advanced class. Otherwise, if you don't want to do that much work, take this one. You'll still learn a fair amount about basic music history.",
    "Take it. There is basically no work (maybe 10-20 min listening exercises every week) and then there are a couple weeks with more work (but just 2 short essays\/papers). If you have absolutely no background in music, you might find this course a little tricky, but if you have any background at all this is a great class to satisfy a distributional credit, cr\/d\/fail, or just want to learn a little more about music.",
    "Take it if you can! It is well worth it!",
    "",
    "It was so relaxing to start off my day in the low stress class, listening to great music and APPRECIATING IT!",
    "Amazing survey of the Western classical music tradition through theory and history, ultimately aimed at increased appreciation.",
    "I was disappointed by my experience in this class. While it is an interesting subject matter, I felt that the lecturers were not very substantive. This was especially true for the historical section of the class, which should have been by far the best part. If you don't have a musical background, then this course will be very difficult for you (the professor tries to make it accessible, but it really isn't so. I have a musical background and even then it was tough).Also, this course is not easy. I took it CR\/D\/F, and even then it was a solid amount of work. If you do decide to take this course, I would recommend starting it for CR and switching if you do well.",
    "This is an incredibly enjoyable class. If you don't know much about music, take it. The tests aren't that easy, but if you pay attention and do the listening exercises, you'll be fine.",
    "Absolutely. Not too much work and you learn a lot!! I listen to musically completely differently and I have had a little experience with music. Professor Wright is wonderful. Take it!",
    "YES. if you're looking for a class where you can learn about music without having a strong workload.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. There are mixed responses in the course evaluations about the difficulty of the course, so overall that's not very helpful. The difficulty of the course varies depending on your auditory skills, your effort, and what you are comparing it to. I recommend taking this course credit\/D if you just want to enjoy something different and not worry about a grade, but definitely attend lecture, do the homework, go to section, and study for the tests. This course is very fun and rewarding if you give it some effort.",
    "This class is interesting and you learn a lot about music that you might have taken for granted before. You should definitely take it, and you should definitely do all the work for it; you'll enjoy yourself better that way.",
    "I would recommend Listening to Music to students with a small note of caution: it's a great course and you end up learning a lot (and being exposed to some excellent works of music), but it's more work than you think it'll be and takes moretime than you think it will take. There are weekly Listening Exercises, a concert review, a short final paper, and three tests. Also, you might find the some of the beginning material (meter, pitch, etc.) a little difficult if you have no prior music experience. However, Listening to Music is a fun course, and as I said, you do come away having a good basic understanding of the history of Western music, with important composers, works, etc.",
    "This is a great class! Teaches you basics about western classical music and then moves onto history. Great survey, I didnt know anything about music or music history and feel like i learned a LOT. That being said, BEWARE the many many people in this class who are already concert pianists and trained opera singers. Most people seem to already know everything there is to know about music before taking the class and that was really frustrating for someone like me, who did not know anything. The homework counts for a LOT in the final grade which is good! Take it credit\/d if you dont want to work hard but definitely take it! Professor Wright is incredible and should not be missed!",
    "I would only take this class for a credit. Too much work.",
    "Take this course. Period.",
    "MUSI 112 is a great course, one of my favorites at Yale. Prof. Wright does a great job teaching you a lot about many different types of music and makes it a lot of fun. Make sure you go to lecture, as this is key for understanding a lot of the material, especially in the first two thirds of the course (he tests on both material in the book and lecture). This course does require weekly listening exercises, which are not too time consuming. Be wary of this course if you have absolutely no background in music, as it will require more work on your part during the first third of the course especially. That said, you leave the course with a greater appreciation for classical music and a really good base of knowledge about many different genres. Very highly recommended.",
    "Really great class if you are interested in learning about western musical tradition. Don't be fooled into thinking you will also learn about contemporary music. You do get little insights into how contemporary music draws from classical music. We focus on german classical tradition and then a bit on impressionist and modern music.",
    "As someone with awful listening skills, and little to no exposure to classical music, this class was great fun. Credit\/D that is. Take it Credit\/D. It's actually quite difficult (the exams, that is) is you're not musical.",
    "A very good class, for the most part. It's nice that the class is on Open.Yale.edu, in case you miss a class. The papers are very easy, but be warned - the exams are harder than you would think. I would not necessarily say this class is a gut at all, but if you do have experience with music, it's quite a bit easier.",
    "Please take this class! You won't regret it. Wright's lectures are so great that you won't want to miss any. A lot of times he would have the TA's (who are all so talented) either sing\/play certain peices, or he would bring in outside performers (usually students). As a result, lectures were never boring! Wright is hilarious and very passionate about this subject. The music we got to listen to was really good. Going to class was always fun and you usually leave in a better mood. The workload is very fair and the textbook is very interesting to read. Although the day to daywork is very easy, the tests do require you to study. So don't take this class thinking you will get an easy A. That said, though, don't take it credit\/d\/fail b\/c as long as you put in some effort, you will be fine. Awesome class!!!",
    "Take this class if you are interested in classical music. Otherwise dont.",
    "Yes. it was a great class. professor wright is the nicest funniest man and it's not a lot of work. its not a gut though like everyone thinks. you definitely need to put in effort to get an A",
    "Take it credit D. Its much less stressful.",
    "Definitely not as easy as you hear it is, especially if you've never taken any music classes\/played a musical instrument before. The learning curve can be REALLY STEEP for those who have no previous knowledge of classical music!",
    "This class may be nicknames \"Clap for Credit,\" but it is NOT a gut! Do not take this class looking for an easy A! You really have to study and try to understand the music otherwise you will quickly fall behind. The only thing is that the book and CDs are expensive, but very worth it!",
    "This class is engaging and will get you to look at classical music in a new light if you've never really engaged with it before. That said, it is very basic, so if you have had any musical training or already listen to classical music, you probably shouldn't take it.The workload is not what you'd expect given the reputation of this class. There is actually a lot of work in terms of the sheer number of assignments; three tests, two papers, and about twenty minutes of \"listening exercises\" per week. Not overwhelming by any means - the papers and tests are not work-intensive - but not the gut class you may be expecting. That said, it definitely won't break anyone's back.",
    "Shop the class to get a feel for it, you will probably like it. I only suggest that you have some background in music.",
    "I would recommend this class but warn them that what seems like a light course load will literally explode around Thanksgiving (ie when it is absolutely impossible to catch up).",
    "I would recommend the course for anyone who wants an introduction to the tradition of classical music. However, if you really want to enjoy the class, take it Credit\/D or be prepared for hours of pointless memorization.",
    "A must take class; very interesting, low workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is unfamiliar with classical music. Though the course is called \"Listening to Music,\" it's worth noting that it might more accurately be called \"Listening to Western Classical Music.\" That's not really a criticism -- if you take this course you'll learn a lot of the foundations of classical music. As a member of western culture, this seems pretty important from the standpoint of cultural heritage. Plus, there were many great minds that devoted themselves to the composition of classical music and it's worth it to appreciate their efforts.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was engaging and truly taught me a new appreciation for classical music.",
    "This class is as good as some music history mixed with just a little theory and lots of music listening can get!! I highly enjoyed it and most definitely recommend it. It's not a lot of work, and it's an easy HU credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend it whatever major you are.",
    "Great course if you're even slightly interested in music (unless you're a music major, in which case it might be too light for you). Professor Wright is very good and the course is fun and a nice change of pace from the rest of what you're likely to be taking."
