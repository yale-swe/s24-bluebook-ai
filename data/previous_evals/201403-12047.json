   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if it is required, or if you are genuinely interested and have MATLAB experience.",
    "Obviously you'll be taking the course as a requirement for BME. It wasn't too bad overall, but there is a considerable amount of work as the PSets while not long are pretty hard when you first learn the material, so they take quite a bit of time. The midterm project was VERY time consuming. Good thing is that the exams are non-cumulative. Professor Miller-Jensen is also a decent teacher, writes all the notes pretty clearly on the board.",
    "This course provides a good introduction to the transport of biological materials that are relatable to real-world applications.",
    "Beng 351 is a core engineering class that covers protein-ligand binding, modeling cellular networks, and molecular transport. Most likely, people reading this will be required to take it, but it is a good class. Weekly problem sets are manageable. 1\/3 of the class was a project, which was tough but a good learning experience.",
    "This is a major requirement so you will have to take it. I suggest taking it with friends as the class was a lot easier with people to work with and bounce ideas off of.",
    "Great class; everything is explained clearly in class.",
    "If you're thinking of taking this class, you probably have to seeing as it's required for the BME major. All-in-all it's pretty interesting and the workload is manageable. I would advise students to start the psets earlier than the night before and to think ahead for the project. The exams were fair and so was the grading. Overall, not a bad experience. In retrospect, I feel like I learned a lot of useful problem solving skills for BME.",
    "This isn't a walk in the park. If you struggled a bit with differential equations, definitely spend extra time on this course. You'll be doing a lot of integrating in the second half of the course, so brushing up on how to do that quickly might be helpful as you don't get that much time on exams and you might feel rushed if you're slower at working through problems (like I am). The problem sets are quite difficult, so you'll want to get started on them early, but it might be hard to figure out just how to start in on them without the TAs' help. There are two exams (non-cumulative) and one project. The project is a bit disorganized, so get started on it early and ask for help so you have plenty of time to finish it.",
    "Mandatory for BME, but if you are another major probably no reason to take it. The concepts can be dry at times, but it is really a class in problem solving. There is some MATLAB programming, so helpful if you take BENG 249 before. Miller-Jensen is a good teacher but her exams while fair are very long.",
    "I actually liked this course. Professor Miller-Jensen is really cool and the TFs were super helpful. I learned a lot! As a BME major you have to take this, but I would also recommend this course to anyone that has taken MB&B 300 and enjoyed it.",
    "Yes, you'll have to take it as a BME major. Overall really useful material, but the lectures can be a bit confusing and not always logical. The professor is extremely nice and approachable, so take advantage of that! The PSETs are an absolute pain (unnecessarily long) though, so be prepared to spend a lot of time on those.",
    "Not superrrrr hard, though some of the psets were annoying. There's MATLAB project, which wasn't too bad considering I didn't take BENG 249 and still did well on it",
    "Chances are if you are taking this class you need it because of BME requirements, so whether to take this class or not would be a moot point. I took this as a senior as I wanted to take Biochemistry which is usually offered at the same time. Honestly biochemistry would be useful to take before. However, as biochem is not a \"required\" class I would just take Biotransport in junior year as taking a required class senior year was stressful.",
    "Biokinetics sounds scary, but it's really just a bunch of equations. Yeah, you're required to take this but it's not bad at all. I spent fewer than 10 hours a week on homework, though the midterm project took quite a bit of time. Expect to get cozy with Matlab on almost every problem set; it's required for at least one problem a week.",
    "This is a good overview of protein-ligand interactions, systems biology, and diffusive\/convective transport. The project helped me learn quite a bit, and the exams are fair, though we had a major time crunch during the midterm. For this class, it is necessary to know MATLAB, so it is probably best to take BENG 249 beforehand.",
    "This class was very dry and I found it boring. I thought the homework tested an aspect of the subject matter we didn't talk about in class and required You to use Matlab which we never talked about in class, we just had one review session in the beginning of the semester. This was my least favorite class of the six I took this semester; the professor wrote tiny and then stood on front of the most recent writing on the board, I felt a disconnect from the lecture and the work we did outside, and for the midterm project, the guidelines and expectations kept changing. I wish it was more organized, which might be because she hasn't taught it before, but personally i just didn't enjoy this class. The best part of this class was the TFs who were really helpful and really cared that You understood the material.",
    "Great BME class. Probably a lot more work than when Fahmy taught it, but I liked that it was challenging and had a lot of interesting applications.",
    "Yes. A required course for BME, and a good introduction to biological signal systems modelling. Especially good if you enjoy Matlab programming (BENG249 should be listed as a prerequisite). Plenty of help for programming is available, but the course (and the midterm project, which is basically a programming ODE's exercise) will go much more smoothly for you if you have proficiency in coding. Algebra and calculations (dimensional analysis!) comes in handy (the beginning half of the course deals a lot with protein-ligand binding, and the latter half with diffusion (for which basic diff-eq's are necessary). Each of these halves ends in a test, with the aforementioned coding project in the middle.",
    "BENG 351 is a difficult biomedical engineering course, but it is so interesting and relevant. It relates a lot of the chemistry, modelling, and differential equations learned in previous course to biological interactions such a protein-ligand binding an diffusion. The MATLAB practice is difficult but relevant and the midterm project, modelling a biosensing system, can be pretty cool. The problem sets are difficult but Professor Miller-Jensen and the T.A.s are easily accessible and always willing to help teach you the concepts.",
    "Very difficult, could do with more resources online"
