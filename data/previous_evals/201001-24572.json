    "This class was awesome. It's so much work, but you probably already know that. I think it's much better than the first semester with Robert and Mireille of French-in-Action because you read real novels and have real discussions. The success of the class is entirely dependent on your rapport with the other students in the section, so make sure you like them and are willing to spend a huge amount of time with them. The tests are fair and your French will skyrocket if you put the work in. I'm so so happy I did this.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. You have to be dedicated to the class but I cannot stress enough how worth it it is in the end.",
    "This class is a lot of work, but if you are really determined to learn French, then take this class. You will invest a lot of time, but you will most certainly reap the rewards. Don't worry too much about the grading, the professor is understanding of the intensive nature and will work with you when the going gets tough. But don't think its a walk in the park. You move fast and you need to keep up. There is a ton of reading, especially at the end of the semester, but it's doable and in line with a 2-credit course. Another plus is the camp nature of the class. Its a small class so you will really get to know all of your fellow classmates, and the professor organizes a ton of fun outside activities, from meals to movie screenings.",
    "A phenomenal intermediate French course. It's very time intensive, but you learn so much with great professors, and my fellow students were fantastic, as well. I highly recommend it -- you won't regret it!",
    "Intensive, lots of work, lots of time and often a struggle to do everything. But, you meet some great people (or I did) and you really learn French.",
    "Yes! I think it is the best method to learn French in a short time. I would say that it is intense but at the end of the day you will be very satisfied."
