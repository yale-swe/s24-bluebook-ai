    "Really great and in-depth foundation of health disparities at an upstream and downstream systems level. Love looking at these issues through a policy lens, where Dr. Geballe knows best. A lot of reading, but its worth it.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It covered a wide range of very important topics related to health disparities. Because of this course, I have learned to view public health in a different way, especially regarding the importance of the social determinants of health. Some weeks there were definitely too many readings assigned. It would be useful to continue using a ranking system for the articles to ensure that everyone completes the same readings and are prepared to discuss them.",
    "The course requires a great deal of readings, but they are all carefully chosen for their quality and value. The topics and discussions were relevant and important to all of us as public health professionals, advocates, and individuals."

    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Dr. Geballe is an amazing woman who cares so much about these issues and really tries to impart as much knowledge on her students as she can in the time she is given. It really was a pleasure taking this course with her.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is a great teacher, and she really cares a lot about her students.",
    "Instructor: Shelley Geballe \u00a0Shelley is very knowledgeable and insightful. She cares about all of her students and was invested in expanding our awareness of critical issues and improving our writing."

    "There is an astronomical amount of reading, BUT as a discussion course you do not need to actually do all of it (which I think some people get caught up in thinking). Pick and choose what interests you, write your weekly reading reflection on those articles, and come to class ready to have Dr. Geballe impart wisdom and knowledge on you. Intimate class, one of the best I have taken at YSPH so far. A LOT of feedback on your final papers both from Dr. Geballe and your peers. Great material that is looked at from a policy perspective. I learned a lot, and really loved the instructor. Highly recommend.",
    "A lot of work, but totally worth it. I would definitely recommend this class!",
    "This course is an excellent addition to the public health curriculum, and useful for really anyone. Be prepared for a lot of reading, and I would strongly recommend coming to class with topics and ideas you are ready to discuss.",
    "This course looks at disparities that exist in health through the lens of social justice. Yes I would recommend it."
