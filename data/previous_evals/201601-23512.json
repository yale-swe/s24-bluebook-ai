    "This course was not what I was expecting. Based on the course evaluations from last year it seemed like it was very heavy on theory, but this year it seemed to swing in the opposite direction. It was great to have minimal work to do outside of class, but I don't think it allowed us to learn as much about health communications as we could have it we learned more about theories in class and tried to apply them to our group projects outside of class throughout the semester. A weakness was not being able to pick your groups based on similar interests. Additionally, while it was fun to blog and tweet about issues, I don't think it really built on anything we learned in class or allowed us to apply any concepts. Possibly adding structure or themes to this aspect of the course could be helpful. Otherwise, it was a fun, enjoyable class with a nice professor.",
    "This is a very relaxed course with a very low time commitment outside of class. I thought the guest lecturers and discussing different public health campaigns during class was fun and interesting, but I'm not sure how much I've learned coming out of it. The class isn't too heavy on theory - and although I love how small the work load is for the course, maybe it would be beneficial just to have a little quiz or something to make sure people learn the theory behind public health campaigns. To be honest, since we didn't *have* to learn this stuff as a class requirement, I don't feel that I really did.",
    "Start earlier on the projects, give more direct guidance and examples of what you would like",
    "The weekly blogs and tweets are good experience to have, but those would have benefited from having direct feedback from the professor and TA regarding the content\/style. I thought the class about responding to disaster situations could have been improved by watching more real-life responses and critiquing how the person did (we did that once). Going from group to group in different scenarios is a good idea too but it could have been strengthened by providing more feedback (what we said that was right\/wrong) and examples of things we could have said. I think groups should be determined by interest in certain topics rather than randomly or trying to make them heterogeneous. I think group members should evaluate each other's contributions to group work to increase accountability. I think a clearer picture of the final project should be presented at the beginning of the semester and the topics should be chosen much earlier with time each week to work towards the finished project. It might be interesting to coordinate this class with Trace's class about developing an intervention. Perhaps students could take both simultaneously and work to develop a communication plan for the intervention they develop!",
    "Disorganized...definitely needs some restructuring. I think the course holds real promise but by the nature of it being a new course offering, it was disorganized and it was not always clear what the expectations were .",
    "Majority of our work was in groups and it was fun to work with classmates that I have not had the chance to do so with. Working well in groups is a tangible, and transferrable skillset that you can definitely hone in this class. This class is still being developed and I expect Professor Bazell to continue to refine and adjust the cirriculum next year to include more of these group projects.",
    "The course lacks organization and deliverables that students expect at this level. Rarely did I feel that my work was being truly 'evaluated' as opposed to being observed. It is helpful to have practice presenting, but I would have gotten more out of working independently and receiving formal feedback, as if I were in a full-time position.",
    "Bob tries but this class falls a little short. It has the potential to be great but most of the best lectures were from outside professors.",
    "This is the second year in which Dr. Bazell has taught the class and I think he's getting the hang of it! I learned a few different public health communication strategies through him that I actually implement in my daily life through my academic work and in conversations with other friends. Strengths: interesting material, lots of different speakers coming in to speak on different aspects of public health communication, easy workload, small group projects, and weekly Twitter and blog posts are fun! Weaknesses: sometimes a little disorganized where students aren't sure what his expectations are for certain projects, reading is occasionally boring",
    "I felt like the course was all structured around a final project. I wish I could learn more about current PH communications problems, like the coverage of Zika and Ebola.",
    "Strengths Bob clearly cares about the students and their experience in his course but it was plagued with unclear communication about expectations and assignments-- assignments seemed random or without purpose and did not build on each other which could be naturally be fostered in culmination of the final project. I wish we had more assignments to be graded on so that we had a sense of our grades throughout and they didn't all depend on one, vague final project. I was surprised and disappointed by my grade.",
    "This class was just ok. It was hard to determine what the professor wanted as he wasn't always quite direct about his expectations. I would have liked the project to have started quite earlier and for us to have defined deliverables. It was nice to see everyone's final project and how creative they were."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Really great guy with a lot of great experience, but he needs to improve his communication with the class. He began to send out weekly emails detailing what was needed for the next class, however those were not as helpful as they could have been if we had a better understanding of the bigger picture. The semester-long project should be made more clear ahead of time, so that students can be working ahead.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Prof. Bazell is great. He knows that this class is pretty new and is a work in progress, and is very very open to suggestions from the class. He encourages anonymous feedback to improve. However, I did feel that things were a little scattered and assignments frequently required clarification from him. Having a set syllabus that outlines group work expectations and key learning objectives per class, at the *beginning* of the semester, would have been nice.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Interesting, intriguing, collaborative",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0I think Bob didn't want to give us a lot of group work outside of class time, but he definitely can --most other classes do. That way class time can be used to do hands-on work on other types of communication besides health promotion campaigns. He can also come up with a way to make us accountable for the weekly readings. I always did them but we didn't always (less often than not) incorporate the weekly readings to class discussion\/activities so they were not always reinforced. With all of Bob's experience I would have liked to hear more details about his work and examples of it that we could learn from. The class where he showed us a long slide show of videos and results from focus groups related to a project was ineffective --most of us were not sure what to take from that. He should more strongly enforce a rule not to be using phones\/laptops for non-class stuff during class time. I found it distracting to see other students doing things that were off-topic. I'm not sure if this was because he did not notice or because he didn't want to come off as too authoritative.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Clearly knowledgable about the topic, but I would have appreciated more structured class\/lecture time and more clear communication about class\/assignment expectations on a weekly\/fortnightly basis.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Truly cares about his students...",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Bob is a great guy who knows a lot. I think he could have talked more about his own career; when he did so it was engaging and gave a really unique perspective. He should not be afraid to ramp things up a bit next time around.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Bob is really nice and tries really hard. He wants the student to be engaged and learn.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0He is GREAT! Very kind and thoughtful.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Bazell is such a sweetheart! I understand that there's always growing pains in teaching a new course and although I don't know how his first class went, I think this year's class is much improved. He is an incredibly impressive and well-informed intellectual from his many years as an NBC health correspondent. However, I think he sometimes is a little nervous in class because he really cares about the students' experience. I would like for Dr. Bazell to have more confidence in his lectures and words and also share more clips of his work because I find those informative and exciting to watch. I also appreciate that he is always asking for student input via the anonymous Classes V2 option. He implements those suggestions immediately in the following classes, which shows that he is receptive to feedback. Keep up the great work!",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0The instructor has so much potential to share his insight and knowledge, given his past work as the Health correspondent for a major news network. But this potential is never used. He never gave his insight about the current public health news coverage, or communications. He kept promising to talk about Zika, but we never got the chance to, because we kept focusing instead on our make-believe health campaigns, by novice classmates whose opinions I don't really care about or value. So much potential with this instructor. So much excitement on signing up for the course because of the professor teaching it. And so much disappointment at the end.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0Again, he cares a lot but my advice would be to be as clear as possible. Make the readings relevant in the lectures. Have each lecture have clear takeaways-- don't be scared of using powerpoint-- people come to the class wanting to learn from your experience.",
    "Instructor: Robert Joseph Bazell \u00a0He was very sweet and always wanted to make sure we were getting out of what we needed to get out of the class but at times, his expectations were not always clear."

   "comments": [
    "Hard to say how the course will change between this year and next year since it seems to be a work in progress, but for us it was a fun, light class.",
    "If you're looking for an easy class, this is it. You do learn some things about effective public health communication, but I think there is more that could potentially be gleaned if the class were restructured a bit. So if you're looking to honestly come out of this class with a solid understanding of PH communications, you will have to go above and beyond what is required for the class to learn it on your own. Prof. Bazell is a cool guy who's had some cool experiences, and he knows a lot. I think the course will only get better with time as Prof. Bazell makes improvements each semester.",
    "Interesting class, somewhat dry readings, cool projects and useful skills with a really exciting professor",
    "Take this class. It's really the only class of its kind at YSPH. Even though it is new and not perfect yet, you will learn necessary communication skills required to work as a health professional.",
    "Final group project was a public health communication campaign.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if a few conditions were met: -The course changes its emphasis away from group work and toward individual work. You can keep one group project, but students stand to benefit from being challenged independently. -The course should have some kind of deliverable, beyond the blog posts and tweets.",
    "Overall, it is decent but won't be something that is really new.",
    "This course is enjoyable as long as you make it enjoyable! The low workload and interesting topics made it a great class to take my last semester in conjunction with the other more demanding courses.",
    "Don't take it unless the professor changes his teaching objectives. Currently, the class is just one final project for a fake public health campaign. You don't really learn anything of value, which is a shame, because of so much potential to learn from the professor's experiences that he wont share.",
    "Easy class, wonderful guy who would be great to get to know, but didn't learn a ton.",
    "It was just ok."
