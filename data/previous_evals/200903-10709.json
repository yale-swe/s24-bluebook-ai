    "The course certainly deepened my knowledge of the field of South Asian architecture and ritual. I wonder if a syllabus that gave a more robust introduction to the scholarship on Indian temple architecture and sculpture (from throughout the 20th century) would have helped get us all off on the same footing; then, the approaches from ritual studies, performance studies etc could have been woven in as we got deeper into the subject."
