   "comments": [
    "Yes, esp. early modernists, though debates are of general interest",
    "I would definitely recommend History 580 to any student looking to learn about cultural encounters in the Early Modern World. The reading is great, the structure of the course is great and the class discussions are great. As an undergraduate, it was a great challenge to be surrounded by PhD candidates who were always active in section. I not only learned from Prof. Schwartz, but from the students around me.",
    "Yes - this is a great way to get a global view of the transition to modernity and a different kind of theoretial backbone for history, while at the same time doing some comparative work beyond your region.",
    "This course is perfect for really getting into ideas of alterity and learning with a great professor."

    "Methodologically provocative, some overlap with orals readings, great preparation for teaching.",
    "This course assisted me a lot in preparation for my senior thesis this year and anticipated research in Brazil next year.",
    "This course deeply contributed to my understanding of encounters and gave greatly needed context and knowledge of past and current debates in the study of encounters - all directly applicable to my dissertation."
