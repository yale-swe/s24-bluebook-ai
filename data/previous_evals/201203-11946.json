    "If you would like to learn German thoroughly you do not need to look elsewhere.",
    "There are several things you should know about this course before signing up. First of all, it is a full-year course; German 145 continues it in the spring. You will hypothetically complete L4 by the end of the year. However, the 'intensive' aspect of it isn't just that it moves faster. The course is VERY grammar-heavy, the idea being that you will first master German grammar and syntax and then move on to vocabulary building and oral fluency. As Herr Stern puts it, you are not going to \"talk happily about recycling.\" You will be doing grammar exercises every day, and some speaking, but certainly not as much as you would in a regular level class. The difference is that every single thing you end up saying will be grammatically right as opposed to just right enough to communicate.But that is not all. This course is ideal for someone whose interest is not only in German but also in English and language in general. You will learn a lot about the history and structure of the English language, which is at root very very similar to the German language. You will also learn a lot of trivia about German history, religion, Berlin, and Herr Stern. It will be hard sometimes to get up for a 9:25 class every day, but eventually your class will bond, and there are often a lot of graduate students in the course, so you'll learn about what they're studying as well (we have a medievalist, areligious studies student, a divinity school student and a management school student in our class). If all of this sounds like your cup of tea - do it. It'll be worth it.",
    "German 125 is an amazing course. You will learn a large amount of German in a relatively short amount of time, and you will have a very thorough grasp on the grammar and stylistic intricacies of the German language. The fact that it meets for two hours every morning makes it a challenge, but for an intensive class, I feel that the workload is not really that bad. It's definitely manageable. A word to the wise: Herr Stern does not respond well to mediocrity, and he's very strict about attendance--so don't miss class and don't be late. That being said, Herr Stern is an incredible professor. He can be intimidating at first, but he warms up to you as the semester goes on. He's an infinite fountain of knowledge, and yet you'll come to find that he's funny and engaging in class. He cares a lot about his students really learning German, and as such he's very accommodating. I feel that, as students of his, we've learned a lot more from him that just another foreign language. If you're not serious about learning German as a language for literary and scholarly pursuits, or if you don't like grammar, don't bother with this class.",
    "A shockingly bad course - I have the strong feeling that none of the other evaluators have taken one of the countless other excellent language courses available at Yale. You will not actually speak any German - instead you will instead spend hours upon hours locked in a room staring at a grammar book. Classroom interaction and creativity is nonexistent. Herr Stern's teaching style can be described as at best idiosyncratic, and at worst, interminable, irrelevant and occasionally downright unreasonable. None of us came out of the course with any practical language ability. A huge disappointment.",
    "Only take this class if you need German for scholarly purposes. If you need it to speak, take the regular German classes",
    "This course is very informative and likely to be a blessing in the long term for any student looking to fulfill a language requirement (or considering German for a major). The work is not terribly difficult, the grading is fair, and Herr Stern is a very strong lecturer prepared with a well-chosen textbook. I expect that this course is the most effective way available at Yale to get a very strong start to learning German. However, the course has long daily meetings early in the morning, daily homework, and weekly (semi-)comprehensive exams. Herr Stern can be kind at times, and has a good sense of humor when the mood takes him, but he is quick to reprimand tardiness, absence, and mistakes of any kind. Pronunciation mistakes will often earn brief mockery; conceptual mistakes warrant brief lectures on exactly what was wrong and why (this one makes sense but can sometimes feel more than necessary if the mistake is a misspoken word, not a misunderstanding); tardiness or absence will not be tolerated. Excuses for absence do not exist, even in emergencies. In general, take German 125 only if you are passionately interested in learning German and willing to prioritize this course above everything else in your life for the entire semester."
