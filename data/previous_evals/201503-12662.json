    "Overall this is an excellent class for students who have a background in political philosophy and want to take a class at the graduate level.The course integrates contemporary political philosophy with legal documents related to sovereignty and human rights. The readings, while lengthy, were always interesting and class discussions were stimulating. The only weakness, in my opinion, is that the readings could have been cut down while still retaining the core content of the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend EPE276 for any student who is seriously committed to learning about human rights, international law, sovereignty, or the European Union. Heavy reading, but completely worth the effort. The students in the seminar and incredibly talented, and you will learn so much from them.",
    "Do it!"
