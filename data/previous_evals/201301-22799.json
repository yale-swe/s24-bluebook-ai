   "comments": [
    "This lab isn't a lot of work: you only have to write 3 labs (granted they are 15 pages, but you complete them with a partner) and there is one informal presentation. Jan actually really wants to help you improve your skills at lab writing. The class isn't difficult and if you're non ABET it's a good alternative to the second physics lab.",
    "A student should only take this if they are pretty comfortable with their workload for the semester, don't do it as a 5th or 5th and a half credit. This class was the straw that broke the camels back for me at times this semester, with difficult 15 page lab reports hitting hard at the worst possible times. That said, there is no work beyond those three lab reports and a presentation at the end of the year, and dr schroers is an awesome person to get to know. If you would like to get an introduction to materials science and can handle some lack of organization, this is a good class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Meng 286l. This class met mostly during the first half of the semester and we only had to complete 4 labs and of these we only had to write 3 lab reports. The course load is small but very helpful. After taking this class my ability to write a scientific paper has increased greatly. Jan is a really nice guy and he always tailored the due dates of the lab reports to the fluctuations of midterms in other classes during the semester. Also if Emily Kinser is still TAing the course you should get to know her because she is really helpful and helped me land a job this summer.",
    "chill lab and jan schroers is friendly. the 15pg lab reports take a while to do but there arent many and you dont always meet",
    "Look forward to taking this class if you're in Mech. Eng. It's a good one, and it will show you the ropes for a lot of the stuff you're going to be doing in your career. Jan is great in this course too, and the TAs are both laid-back and awesome.",
    "I would recommend it. You'll learn about how to write a scientific paper and give a presentation, both of which are useful skills. It's a pretty easy workload, except for the few weeks when you have lab reports due. A chill, fun course, although its one minor drawback is that the professor isn't very organized, so you may not know when you have a lab until the week it's happening.",
    "Won't teach you much science that you didn't learn in MENG 285, but you will learn how to write a lab report, which is great. Prof. Schroers will give you a lot of good feedback in that area, and you'll get to revise your lab reports to incorporate the feedback.",
    "The class is very disorganized. The lecturers at the beginning of the course are the same material covered in the material science class, but don't actually cover everything you need to know to write the labs. The labs themselves were pretty unorganized except for the ones that Emily Kinser ran, and it was often hard to tell what was expected to write for the ~15 page lab reports.On the other hand, you do learn about writing lab reports in the style of scientific papers, which I found valuable."
