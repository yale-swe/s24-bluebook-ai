   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to a fellow student. Even if you never imagined that you would be interested in learning about South Africa, this is a great class to take. It discusses topics that are relevant for all classes and you learn so much about a different part of the world.",
    "Fantastic!! Definitely my favorite class of the semester. The material is so interesting and Prof. Magazine is great. He does a wonderful job of facilitating class discussion and really getting us to think. I looked forward to the readings and going to class every week. It was more work than my other seminars (a LOT of reading + reading response every week) in addition to leading one class discussion and writing a 10-20 pg paper. That said, totally worth it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class, perhaps especially to someone who's never studied African history before (I hadn't). South African history is absolutely fascinating, and apartheid is a poignant case study in the economic, cultural, and social effects of a 'special' type of colonialism. The readings are generally very interesting, and Professor Magaziner is really knowledgeable and good at nudging discussion in the right direction. Because it also caters to African Studies, there's morefocus on social science and contemporary South Africa than you would necessarily find in typical history seminar, but I would still definitely take it even if you are more of a history person.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS if you can get in! Professor Magaziner is absolutely wonderful. Apartheid and its Afterlives was a challenging, thought-provoking and meaningful class. I wouldn't change a thing. The size of the class was perfect and as an undergraduate History major unfamiliar with South Africa, I valued the variety of perspectives and levels of expertise that my classmates brought to the table. I also loved the readings -- it seemed like every week was a logical continuation of the larger study we were pursuing; yet, I felt that each week's readings made me think about South Africa totally differently.",
    "This is an examination of apartheid and its legacy through discussion and through the lens of a variety of different topics, ranging from materialization to AIDS. It's not a great first South African history class to take, but it makes for a great follow up to some initial coursework.",
    "Take this class! This was by far the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. Every single week, I felt that the readings came together to provide us with a solid understanding of that week's topic, and Professor Magaziner did a phenomenal job of picking readings that informed each other not only within a given week, but also from week to week. The interdisciplinary composition of the student body made the discussions the highlight of my week. The reading responses were time consuming, but there's enough flexibility in terms of topic that I could choose to write about whatever made me happy\/angry\/sad\/etc. I know that my Yale career would not have been complete without having taken this class."
