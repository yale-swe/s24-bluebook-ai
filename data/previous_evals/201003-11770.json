    "Stereotypical Spanish course. Very grammar heavy but it is taught well and your reading and writing will improve. I would recommend this teacher but I would not recommend this course if you place higher.",
    "Spanish 130 is a course with some strengths but many significant weaknesses as well.Overall, there was very little new learned in this class. It was mainly a course for reviewing and solidifying grammar concepts. And while this definitely is useful, I feel more emphasis on oral proficiency could have made the class more enriching. Also, more resources outside of the textbook could have made the course more interesting.",
    "Rather than viewing this course as a requirement to fulfill the L studies, it should be viewed as a challenging, yet rewarding experience. It will do wonders for a diligent student's grammatical skills, although do not expect to be able to speak the language any better by the end of the semester. Hopefully, L4 will be able to focus more on conversational skills. Be prepared to speak up in class and make an effort to talk to your professor - the homework is typically graded by other students, and thus be diligent about grades and making sure you have not been docked points for the wrong reasons. Also, understand that as a 1.5 credit class, there will be a lot expected of students EVERY DAY of the week. Just because you were prepared and enthusiastic for class on Monday does not mean you can slack off by Thursday. Find your intrinsic motivation and push to make the most out of this language class!",
    "Yes, especially with Rosamaria Leon. Fun and enjoyable, improved my Spanish.",
    "Like any other language course, it meets five times a week and it has daily homework assignments. You should come out of it a better Spanish speaker, but certainly not without doing work.",
    "Good if you want to learn spanish",
    "Yes! It's not too difficult, even with the homework everyday.",
    "It's a good language class if you have some background in Spanish.",
    "I took this for my requirement and ended up loving it",
    "Spanish 130 11 is a class that reviews all of the major grammatical tenses, deepens one's vocabulary, and promotes a lot of oral speaking. It is an small environment and therefore fosters relationships and conversation in spanish among classmates. I would definitely recommend Spanish 130, because it is structured in such a way that the student is always prepared for what is going on. Also, I would recommend this class because you not only get to learn from the teacher, but the setting allows for a lot of interaction between classmates. Spanish 130 is a great class to solidify your grammatical accuracy and develop more confidence with speaking aloud.",
    "Depending on the professor, 130 can be a fairly enjoyable class. However, the homework is ridiculously time consuming and meeting 5 days a week is no fun.",
    "Spanish 130 is definitely not an easy A. You have to go to class every day, do ALL of the assignments, and pay attention at all times. If you speak in English, you will be swiftly corrected. It felt like more work than 1.5 credits. It's a very challenging course and not to be taken on a whim.That being said, you'll learn a lot and will definitely feel more proficient in Spanish at the end. I had great classmates, which made it a fun class. Profesora Leon was also fantastic and understanding with students who struggled, so I highly recommend her. Also, if you wind up taking the class, remember that homework is 18% of your grade, so be sure to spend a lot of time doing it!",
    "Spanish 3 is a pretty normal language class for Yale, but I found myself enjoying the class by the end of the semester. I was initially disappointed about being placed into level 3, but in the end, I found the content to be surprisingly challenging and engaging. The tests and quizzes are tough\u0097you will need to do some studying, which was a change of pace from high school. The oral exam requires quite a bit of preparation especially. Meeting every day can seem annoying first, but it really does improve your Spanish. Group activities in class can be fun and interesting, especially when the class works well together. However, the graded homework can be very tedious, and the Enfoques textbook is pretty boring and is mostly a review of previous concepts. There are a few short films, and this semester, we watched Pan\u0092s Labyrinth during the final week of class. Sra. Leon is great\u0097take the class with her if you get the chance! She keeps the class on track while being very helpful and understanding at the same time.",
    "I would recommend this class if it is necessary to fulfill a language requirement. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. It is a challenging class that has a lot of homework which you should not be bothered with unless you are majoring in spanish or need it for a language requirement."
