    "If you made it through 110, take 120 for sure. It's very similar, but many of the frustrations are gone. It's much more enjoyable overall. Over the course of the semester, you really feel like you can communicate in Persian. The stories are better and more interesting too. If you're considering it, take it.",
    "Yes, definitely",
    "Yes Persian is a beautiful language and relatively easier than other languages in terms of grammatical rules. You end up learning quite a bit of the language by the end of it."
