   "comments": [
    "ITAL 120 is almost identical to ITAL 110, except that the grammar contains more verb forms that one has to memorize. Overall, I would definitely recommend that someone take Italian for their language credit.",
    "While vocabulary is also important in Italian 120, there is more of a focus on grammar in this class compared to Italian 110. There are somewhat more difficult (and longer) writing assignments to do and far more encouragement to speak in class, developing your writing skills, spoken Italian, and your overall comprehension of the language. If you already took Italian 110, there are far more reasons to take the class than not; Italian is a beautiful language, and as long as you have interest in learning it, the class should go rather well.",
    "It is definitely a difficult class comparative to other languages, but a lot of great people are involved in the class making it enjoyable.",
    "Italian is a beautiful language and it is fun to learn. At times I found it very challenging with all the irregular verbs and conjugations but in the end I would recommend this class.",
    "Good course. You really can't go wrong with the italian department here - it's a great, relatively painless way to fulfill the language requirement.",
    "I would recommend Italian to students who really want to learn Italian. However, it's not an easy class and it takes great commitment, so I would suggest that students really pick the language that they want to learn, as they are going to have to invest a great amount of effort into learning it.",
    "Yes, I loved Italian this year. It was challenging but rewarding and the culture is beautiful and inspiring. The course included learning the last half of Italian grammar and improving vocabulary. We also read various operas, watched movies and learned about facets of italian culture through readings and student presentations."
