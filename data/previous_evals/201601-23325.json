   "comments": [
    "this class is so great. you learn a TON but its fun and interesting and the professor is super passionate about the work and makes class exciting w music and videos etc. highly recommend",
    "Definitely take this class. The material is very interesting and Arielle is an amazing professor. The information is so cool and relatable to our world and media",
    "YES.",
    "Fantastic course. More work than average, but absolutely worth your time. If you work hard, you will come away with a strong understanding of a highly specialized field. Plus, Arielle is a brilliant professor.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It is incredibly doable and extremely interesting and fun!",
    "Absolutely take this class. I took this class because I thought it would be an analysis of the TV show \"Criminal Minds\", and while I quickly realized this was not the case, I would still recommend this to any person interested in the psychology of crime. I took this class without any previous experience or classes in psychology, so while I was able to eventually understand the material, I would recommend at least one previous psychology course. The professor is one of the most knowledgable people I have ever encountered, and is extremely reasonable in her expectations. 10\/10 would recommend.",
    "Definitely take the course. You learn about psychopaths and people with other mental disorders.",
    "Psychology 141 is an intriguing class about the working and development of a criminal mind. It is about the etiology and risk factors of all types of personality disorders such as psychopathy and discusses how these conditions development from childhood. There are three essays, a midterm, and a final but the work is very manageable. There are readings every day, but they are not required for a thorough understanding of the course since the professor has very detailed lectures as well.",
    "Absolutely take this class! Dr. Baskin-Sommers is a really fun and engaging lecturer, and the content of the class is really interesting. Don't be afraid of the readings! Dr. Baskin-Sommers makes it easy to understand each one and is willing to take the time both inside and outside of class to explain concepts.",
    "No",
    "Yes! You won't regret it. It is difficult to grasp the material at first, but once you have a solid base, everything else comes naturally.",
    "AMAZING class - absolutely take it if you get the chance (especially because I don't think she plans to teach it every year). Arielle is a GEM of a professor, the best I've encountered at Yale. She is absolutely brilliant, funny, and engaging. You will learn SO much. There is definitely a learning curve at the beginning of the semester (the material might be a little challenging in the beginning if you don't have a ton of background), but it's super manageable and not difficult to do well if you pay attention in class. It definitely becomes easier as the semester goes on, because the concepts get repeated in different contexts. Seriously, take this class.",
    "Definitely recommend. Low stress, interesting class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this to any Yale student. It was an incredible and exciting course with a lot of interesting material.",
    "Overall, this was a good course! The work was extremely reasonable. The subject material is interesting, though can get a bit repetitive.",
    "Great course. Will be fairly easy if you are psych major as a lot of the lit will be familiar (work on executive functioning, fear conditioning, etc.)--but definitely accessible to the non-major.",
    "Take it if you are looking for an interesting course!",
    "This course focuses on the criminal mind with a majority of it paying attention to psychopathy and what constitutes a psychopath. She used a lot of empirical research and data and this class went through environmental, biological and structural abnormalities of criminals.",
    "Take it!",
    "I would 100% recommend this class. It's not a lot of work, just two exams and three papers. The material is very interesting and the lectures are engaging. Arielle Baskin Sommers is an incredible professor so take this class even if it's just for her.",
    "I would recommend this class to a psych major and a non psych major. It is so interesting and fun! Not too much to handle, although it seems like a lot in the beginning. Plus, we got to drop our lowest grade and there was extra credit which helped a lot. Definitely take this class if it seems interesting to you.",
    "TAKE IT. Baskin-Sommers is one of the smartest, engaging professors at Yale. Her knowledge and passion about the topic is second to none. The exams and essays are challenging, but you learn so much in the process. If you're interested in psychopathy, antisocial personality disorder, mental illness and crime, neuroscience and the law, then take this class!",
    "This was a wonderful class! I feel like I finally have a grasp on what psychopathology is all about and how it applies to research. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in criminals and psycholaths!",
    "I would say it is a great psychology course that was well presented and fun. I would recommend it.",
    "Take this if you want either an intro course or a beginning to a psych major. Don't take it to fulfill a requirement as it is NOT an gut class. Don't be scared away, but do keep up with lectures and readings. Read the study guides for the exams--they are your friend! Talk to Prof. Baskin-Sommers, she's a major player in this field of psychology and it's a privilege to have someone like her be teaching an intro psych class that's exactly what she specializes in.",
    "Amazing class, nothing bad to say about it really. Interesting material, not too much work, and fair grading. definitely take it if you have any interest in psychology at all or need an SO. Arielle is beyond amazing.",
    "Not too much work, interesting material, forgiving grading, very rewarding",
    "Good course if you're interested in the brain or criminal behavior",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to other students because the content is super interesting!!",
    "Interesting, useful information for anyone interested in crime and\/or psychology. Would recommend.",
    "Not a gut class. It is interesting but do the reading otherwise you're screwed for exams and papers. Make sure to take great notes during class and check the forums.",
    "100% recommend if you are at all interested in criminal psychology. Not only is the class super interesting and you'll learn a TON about how criminal's think, but Professor Baskin-Sommers is AWESOME. She's brilliant, she led half the studies you'll read about, and she's incredibly nice and funny. Seriously this class is a gem, it's a good deal of work but they let you drop your lowest grade and grading is very fair. Highly recommend.",
    "Take this class if you are really interested in psychopathy. The class has readings that the lectures help clarify. There are three 6-10 page papers and two exams, but one of them is dropped. The class is very interesting and I would recommend taking it.",
    "Yes, take this if you want to learn about criminals, their environment and brain.",
    "This course is a really interesting explanation of different psychopathologies that criminals may have such as psychopathy, externalizing, child disorders, and other mental illnesses. The class explained the research on how these disorder affect functioning and why they might result in criminal behavior. There was also a focus on how the current systems can be improved.",
    "This was by far one of my favorite classes at yale and has shaped my interest in criminal psychology. This class covers topics in psychopathy and externalizing, their etiology and characteristics, antisocial personality disorder in children, treatment of psychopathy, and other topics. I thoroughly recommend this class. Even though lectures are packed, the material is highly engaging. Professor Baskin-Sommers is a wonderful professor. The essays are very straightforward and very fairly graded. The exams are also very straightforward. Professor Baskin-Sommers is very organized and makes her grading policy clear.",
    "Psyc 141 gives a general overview of the mechanisms that may lead to an individual engaging in criminal behavior. I would definitely recommend this course. I thought this was one of the most interesting courses I've taken so far at Yale and it wasn't overly difficult.",
    "Criminal Mind is an interesting class, and it was a good change of pace for a non-psych major. It's pretty easy, and is extremely easy to Credit\/D.",
    "Really great, really interesting class. My favorite of the semester. The papers were fun to write and the exams were fun to study for. The material was always intriguing and there was not a single class I didn't look forward to going to. If you are taking it for the same reason I did, with the hope that it will be anything like the TV show \"Criminal Mind,\" all I can say is that you will learn things that will help you appreciate the show itself even more.",
    "Comprehensive, in-depth analysis of two mental illnesses that plague prisons. Would recommend. Very well taught.",
    "SUCH AN AMAZING COURSE! The Criminal Mind is such a gem, Arielle has a clear teaching style and is straightforward about the material you need to know. But you're going to want to learn everything beyond the test and essays anyway. The TFs were lovely, William Vanderlind is the sweetest TF ever. You'll learn a lot for a reasonable amount of work: 2 tests, 3 essays with one grade drop. Aside from the neuroscience and psychology of the criminal mind, at the end the course will be placed in perspective with other disciplines and greater society - prepare yourself for wokeness. The class structure is built for you to succeed, the most organized class I've had by far - online question forums, quick responses to emails, etc and TFs + Arielle available. They also post study guides that you just have to fill in (!!). An absolute must-take at Yale, changed my whole life trajectory.",
    "At first it might seem like there's a lot of work involved (having to read 3-4 scientific papers before every class and single space essays) but it's manageable and the material is fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in criminal psychology, whether a psychology major or not. The information is presented in a very easy-to-understand way, and the workload is manageable. Plus, Professor Baskin-Sommers is a great lecturer who made the class fun despite the heavy subject matter.",
    "Yes! It's amazing. A great SO.",
    "The course explains why criminals do what they do and presents a case for why the systems we have in place are more hurtful than helpful. I would definitely recommend taking it if you can.",
    "An AMAZING class that is a must-take here at Yale. The class has extremely interesting material, a relatable professor, straight forward assignments in which you can earn full credit, and quick grading TAs. Recommend for Pscyh majors and not. Everyone should take this class."
