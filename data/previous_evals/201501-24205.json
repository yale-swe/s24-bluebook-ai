    "This is a great course. It was loads of fun simply reading amazing German literature and then talking and writing about the books and essays. I highly recommend it.",
    "In Gman 171 you get exposed to a series of German books, that represent different eras of German literature. Class discussions are accompanied by papers and readings. An enjoyable class.",
    "You read major works of german prose from the 18th to 20th centuries. You discuss in class and write 4 essays on the texts in german. The reading and writing can be challenging but does wonders for you german. The books are amazing though. I'm glad I took it.",
    "For anyone else like me who wanted to learn German to read the literature, this class is perfect. You get to just read books, talk about them in class, and write a few essays. And Andrew's a great teacher to top it off. Would recommend",
    "Introduction to a pretty wide range (~250 years) of authors writing prose in German. Andrew (Kirwin) is a very good teacher and a very approachable person.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in German literature or German language. There is plenty of opportunity to practice your speaking skills while learning about the greatest works of German thinkers."
