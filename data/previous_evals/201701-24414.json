   "comments": [
    "Great understanding of the education policy landscape beyond the 110 class.",
    "I think this course gave me a broader understanding of the landscape of education policy beyond my own experiences\/home school district. In particular, I feel that I gained insight into the school choice movement, as well as the history of high-stakes accountability testing and the issues surrounding it.",
    "EDST 245 was monumental in supplementing the introduction to public schools and public policy I first received in EDST 110. I feel much more confident in my technical writing and researching skills, especially in the realm of policy. I also have a healthier balance of perspectives on a number of high profile issues.",
    "I learned about the importance of counter-narratives. Debs does a really good job of structuring readings such that you frequently have pro and con views for every issue that is evaluated. I really enjoyed it.",
    "I learned so much about the world of public school education policy. From pedagogies, charters and magnets to testing and racial segregation, we covered it all. I have so much greater appreciation for the complexities of public school policy now",
    "I developed a vocabulary to talk about the issues I had already seen and felt in education and related policy.",
    "I got a really in-depth understanding of No Child Left Behind and the impact of the accountability movement, which was really useful.",
    "This course was objectively helpful in developing my understanding of the education system, but more than that, I did learn a lot of valuable skills. One example: Professor Debs required us to use data in our projects which is an important, yet overlooked skill in the social sciences. The class was a good class for beginning an academic career in the social sciences, so I wish I'd taken it earlier. Good range of readings (academic, journalistic, personal narrative etc.) and good range of ways to engage with the class.",
    "This course has provided a rich learning experience centered around two key and important questions: what do public school in the U.S. look like today, and what can we do to improve them? The course offers insight not only around popular debated topics in the field of education (accountability, standardized tests, charters vs. public schools among them) but also a deep look into what has caused these issues to arise, and what are the nuances of each argument. It is a highly relevant course for anyone wishing to understand education today, touching on subjects like anti-bias education, disproportionate discipline, culturally relevant education, and the role of teachers of color.",
    "I took EDST 110 the semester before I took this class, and I think it chooses a few current topics in education (charters, standardized testing, and teacher preparation) and delves more deeply into them. I gained a lot of knowledge in each of these subjects (and about the landscape of American education more generally), and because we normally read materials with viewpoints on all sides of each issue, I could come to a solid conclusion about where I stood on each issue. I can safely say that anyone who finishes that class would make a better Secretary of Education than Betsy DeVos.",
    "In taking this class, my eyes were opened to the state of American public schools, which, despite their importance, I was ignorant of.",
    "All of our conversations were extremely engaging and although you shouldn't expect to understand intricate details about policy regarding public schools, you'll learn sooooo much about what debates and discussions have been had over the years!",
    "I learned so much about what goes in to public school policy.",
    "EDST 245 was a great overview of different policy issues. I felt that because of the readings, lectures, and discussions, I began to form my own opinions on those issues.",
    "In terms of new things, I learned how to write a policy memo and also learned about rural schools, charter schools, and other policies that have shaped our education system. This class has been more affirming of the things I already knew about schools and the segregation within them."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The \"lecture with the heart of a seminar\" model is great. Keep fostering that atmosphere!",
    "Strengths: thought I wouldn't like doing reading responses in the FB group, but I thought it was actually way better than doing it on canvas or some other obscure site that you'd never actually engage w\/ other people on. Weakness: sometimes I felt like we spent too much time in class talking about people's individual experiences\/opinions. Hearing other people's voices was definitely valuable, to a certain extent (especially when they helped to put the readings into context), but at times discussion could be shallow\/repetitive. After all, we're not the experts (and most of what we know came from the readings). Would have preferred to use more class time supplementing readings w\/ lecture (where Mira could explain additional complex stuff that we might not understand on our own). The class might have benefitted from a section to accommodate more time for people's \"reactions\" (although you would sacrifice some diversity of experience).",
    "SUCH A GOOD COURSE - the strengths are due to Mira being an amazing professor. But I will say a weakness of the course was that people would tend to make too many personal experience comments that wouldn't enrich the conversation, and then Mira wouldn't have time to finish the lecture material she'd want to.",
    "I liked that we didn't just do one activity in a given class period, and I really enjoyed the focus on small group discussions. I was somewhat disappointed in the balancing of various topics throughout the semester-- in particular, the unit on charters could have been condensed to make more room for discussion of rural schools\/teachers unions\/curriculum development beyond what's included in the common core, etc. In general, though, I really enjoyed the time we spent in class lectures\/discussions. Particularly loved the times when we had the opportunity to speak with guest lecturers (and helping Patricia Maloney revise her dissertation was awesome). I loved that there was a social component, and that we got to know our classmates and their life experiences. Also, while I did like the variation in assignment structure, I have to say that the CMO group project was a total mess. I really did not appreciate when we received instructions for a subpart of the assignment like 36 hours in advance of when it was due and given like 10 minutes in class to complete a task that would clearly take way longer than that. I think the project might be better if people were able to choose their group members-- I ended up feeling like half of our group got unfairly penalized for the shoddy work of the other half (I don't think it's unreasonable that I was unwilling to completely rewrite another group member's assigned section if it was done in the most perfunctory manner possible, but I probably would have gotten a better grade if I had). That assignment also dragged on for an EXTREMELY long time. In general, with the exception of the first policy memo assignment, I did not think that the expectations\/prompts for assignments were made very clear. It would be helpful to provide a \"model\" as was done with the policy memo assignment. Also I STRONGLY recommend streamlining the websites in future years. The fact that there were literally 4 different modes of submission was so unnecessarily confusing and stressful (though I did appreciate the format of putting comments on google docs). I liked the theory behind the facebook page, but I don't think it was all that helpful in practice. I think a more structured reading response assignment (with peer responses!) would benefit the experience. I also think that making our assignments publicly available on the wordpress website should be OPT IN ONLY (or at the very least have the option to opt out). While I appreciate that for some people there can be benefits to having publicly accessible writing samples, I also just don't have the time to get every assignment for a class to the level that I feel comfortable having it publicly attached to my name, ESPECIALLY in the case of the group project, where my name, again, is attached to the work of some of my groupmates who clearly did not put in very much effort. If this practice is going to continue I think it should be announced loudly and clearly during shopping period. I do know that it is completely well-intended, and if everyone in the class had infinite time and energy I would like it. But we have senior essays to write, extracurricular groups to run, and student income contributions to earn. I do NOT mean this as a blanket indictment of the course-- I learned a lot and really enjoyed most of my time in the classroom. But I do think it had some serious flaws, and I hope that these critiques are taken into consideration for future years.",
    "Strengths: Seminar-feel of the lecture, interesting assignments Weaknesses: seminar-style doesn't always work and sometimes becomes a round of students popcorning personal experiences, a lot of reading (that i wish i had time for because it's really interesting!), little focus on rural schools",
    "This class involves too many websites\/mechanisms of communication.",
    "I liked this course. It was a broad overview of several educational issues and the path we can take through policy to address them. I think sometimes peoples sharing personal experiences got in the way of the lectures. Also sometime, the discussions were too broad, and it felt like we ended class without having any solid conclusions.",
    "I think there should be less group work, and more formal debates. I think the formal debates worked really well. The readings are also relatively manageable.",
    "Seemed somewhat biased in her presentation of certain subjects which was off putting at times",
    "Strength: It felt like a high school class, in a good way. It was fun to be taught differently than I have been in most of my classes at yale: group discussions, debates, etc. The content was also really relevant and topical Weakness: I think we glossed over some really important topics (like special education policy for example) in favor of talking about things like testing for what felt like too long",
    "I think the course was strongest in the beginning of the semester, but towards the end the semester it got weaker. This is because in the beginning of the semester we really focused on national education policy and its impact in schools. In the second half, instead of covering state and local policy, it was sort of an \"interesting topics in education\" class rather than a class focused on policy. Since this is the only class offered on ed policy at Yale, I was really hoping for more of a policy focus, so I was disappointed. I think one part of the problem was that the class should really have a section, and Professor Debs should have lectured more. I found the discussions problematic: even though I care about my peers' thoughts and experiences, very few of them related to public policy because none of us had detailed knowledge of public policy. Also, in a lecture it's harder to ensure that discussion is high quality or to call students out on making irrelevant or obnoxious comments, so the discussion was of a lower quality. I really wanted to learn from Professor Debs' expertise on public policy, and so I found the lack of policy focus (in both the syllabus and the class format) very disappointing. Finally, I think the emphasis on data in the final project would have been really cool, except that we got no instruction in how to find data and analyze it if it wasn't from one source (ELSI).",
    "The class was great at engaging students on issues of public education, and Debs was very intent on making it a seminar-style lecture. The demand for the class is high, in terms of coursework. There are LOTS of assignments that creep up on you and that can sometimes make it difficult to get a deep engagement with the materials. Sometimes too class discussions were cut short in order to focus on the assignments and I really just wish we'd had more time to discuss the readings \/ hear from Debs about the topics. The guest speakers were good, although it would've been good to hear from a teacher of color (we spent a lot of time talking about issues of race without hearing from someone of color). The biggest strength was probably the students and I doubt Debs' format would work with a less enthusiastic and engaged class. It's definitely worth repeating and taking; the syllabus could just do with some refinement which will likely come because Debs is so engaged and willing to make the best experience for her students.",
    "I loved how much space was given for student input. (I didn't realize how much student participation went into scheduled class time until I saw how many slides the professor skipped over at the end.) It gave way for students to provide a lot of different perspectives and approaches to each issue, always driving the conversation forward. Lectures never felt boring and, as discussed, were kept brief. I agree with my peers to have wanted to discuss certain topics a little more in depth (I understand, however, there is only so much time) and perhaps pace assignment so as to not have intense weeks.",
    "The structure of this course as a seminar lecture and varied assignments is an excellent way for students to truly grasp the material. Of course, the course's greatest strength is Dr. Debs! She makes material exciting and accessible, while still challenging students.",
    "The course readings were, on the whole, very interesting, and I loved that we got multiple perspectives on each issue. Dr. Debs's lectures were generally engaging, but we did spend a lot of time on discussion each class. I really appreciate the sentiment of prioritizing student voices, but I felt like it inevitably devolved into a few of the same voices speaking. I would have loved to have a discussion section for this class, and that might make the lectures more streamlined. On the other hand, that kind of goes against the constructivist idea Dr. Debs certainly has in mind with prioritizing student voices in each lecture. I love the idea Dr. Debs has about a lecture with the heart of a seminar, and I would love to see the class taught as a seminar, but I think the current formulation has the unintended consequence of leaving out the voices of people who don't feel comfortable speaking up in class or aren't as engaged. This is also coming from someone who spoke a decent amount in class, so make of it what you will.",
    "The strength of this class is definitely in its teaching of more obscure means of instruction, which often prove fascinating and highly important in an age of public school reformation. Another amazing aspect of the class is the hybrid-seminar nature of it, which often allows for discussion that may not have happened within a more forum-like set up. However, I often struggled to keep up with readings, and having the reading responses on Facebook often made me reluctant to post responses.",
    "Not very much policy detail, but a lot of insight on how public school systems are structured.",
    "Great readings and discussions, but could use more material review.",
    "While I liked the idea of the \"lecture with the heart of a seminar\" model, I felt like we spent too much class time hearing people share personal anecdotes that didn't always enrich the discussion. I wish that Professor Debs had lectured more than she did before allowing people to share. I almost think that this class could have benefitted from a separate discussion section to help mitigate this problem.",
    "If there is to be a continued focus on classroom discussion, then there should be a dedicated discussion section, and class time should be dedicated primarily to lecturing. The anecdotes of students were interesting but often were tangential and took away from what we could discuss about the topic at hand. I loved the assignments, and I think they should maintain a similar structure in the future - though the CMO project could have used a bit clearer instruction. The content, too, was a strength of the course, and I enjoyed the focus on equity and the inclusion of both high and low profile political issues in education. Professor Debs was incredibly helpful and accessible.",
    "I think that the small lecture size of this class had some really great advantages. You really got to know classmates and Mira which proved insightful throughout the course. Yet at time it felt that the small group time and class discussions prevented us from learning from Prof. Debs.",
    "Strength: Mira Weakness: Too much reading and we focused too much on charter schools.",
    "Sometimes there were a lot of readings that were not really discussed and some very important subject were overlooked",
    "Strengths: opportunity for class discussion and listening to other students' experiences Weaknesses: the \"lecture with a heart of a seminar\" style does not always lend itself to productive conversations and I often didn't feel like class augmented my understanding\/interpretation of the readings",
    "Strengths: This course creates a space for students interested in education policy to read about a variety of topics, discuss those topics in a class environment that encourages interaction, and delve further into topics that are of interest. Professor Debs balances depth and breadth and I appreciated that she gave us insight into how policy researchers do their work by having us do data analysis. Weaknesses: The lecture\/seminar format was frustrating at times. Sometimes student comments were unnecessary or kept us from getting to all the material. Also, some students feel more comfortable than others speaking in front of 40 people. I preferred small group discussions, which we also did. Also, there was too much reading for a lecture."

    "Everyone should take it, regardless of experience with education policy or teaching.",
    "Yep! Great overview of a lot of important issues in education. A good intro course that will challenge you.",
    "YES, Mira's amazing, and everyone should care about education, or at the very least, everyone HAD an education, so there's never a shortage of discussion.",
    "Like, maybe-- I'd basically tell them all the things that I typed about the strengths and weaknesses of the class and tell them to weigh how they felt about those things and take it at their own risk. The content was interesting and important, and the workload was mostly reasonable, but I think a lot of assignments were made much more complicated than they needed to be.",
    "Absolutely. For anyone interested in education, as a teacher, researcher, or policymaker, this is a fantastic class.",
    "Yes- not a good class to credit d because there is a lot involved.",
    "Yes, take this course! Debs is an incredibly accessible professor, and her willingness to incorporate student feedback into her practices is incredible. She really pushes you to think in a fine-grained manner, recognizing that issues in education can rarely be split into mere pro and con camps. She is great.",
    "Yes you should! I never realized how pervasive the issues of public school education were until I took this class. This is an extremely relevant topic today, and it will give you a newfound understanding for the educaiton that got you to Yale (if you went public)",
    "I would say that this class is more of a \"foundations in education studies part 2\" than a class about education public policy. In the first half, we did some really interesting work on No Child Left Behind and the accountability movement's impact on the ground, which was really useful. However, we didn't look much at state or district education policy, and the second half of the class focused on broad topics like Teach For America or implicit bias (which are very interesting but not policy-related). Also, I found the \"lecture with the heart of a seminar\" thing not so helpful. First, discussions are lower-quality in a lecture setting, and people frequently lost the topic of discussion or told long, irrelevant stories about their personal experience. Second, I value my peers' thoughts, but none of us had any substantial knowledge about public policy, so I didn't learn much about the topic of the class when Professor Debs was not lecturing. If you're interested in just learning more about education (especially if you don't know much and want a broad introduction to current debates in education), this is a good class, but if you're specifically interested in policy, you might find it disappointing.",
    "Absolutely recommend shopping, but this class and this format is not for everyone. If you struggle with lots of little assignments, check the syllabus before taking the class! If you like class discussions and lots of interaction, this is a great class for you. Content-wise, everyone should consider this class.",
    "If you are at all interested in the topic of public schools, this class is a must. It does have a little more work than your average lecture, but this course goes into the most interesting and important topics being debated today. This course might not provide a lot of answers, but it will leave you with a better understanding of issues and will give you the opportunity to be creative and think of potential real solutions. If you do not already appreciate public education and the people who work in it, this course will guarantee you do. I took it the first time Professor Debs offered it and I can only imagine how much better it will be in future iterations.",
    "Yes, especially Ed Studies Scholars.",
    "Take this class! Dr. Debs really wants to engage students, and you'll learn a lot about current debates in education and their theoretical underpinnings. If you're interested in becoming a teacher, having a different career in education, or just want to learn and think more about what education means to society and how to change it, this is a great class to take.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! I think everyone should have at least a basic knowledge of public schooling, but the class itself is engaging and wonderful.",
    "Absolutely!!! If you're interested in public education and the inequities that exist, take this class!",
    "Yea, if you have any interest in the politics behind education.",
    "This course would be excellent for anyone interested in education or just the U.S. in general-- there is so much in education that is applicable to other areas and deeper questions brought out by educational issues that are interesting on their own.",
    "This class is a strong introduction to the issues of education and education policy. I would recommend it if you're looking to take a class that talks extensively about contemporary issues in education. Professor Debs is also an incredible person and resource, and I recommend taking a class with her if you get the chance!",
    "Definitely.",
    "Fantastic course! Would highly recommend. Extremely well-organized, interesting and diverse range of papers and projects, and the course very much values the class' respective personal experiences with schooling. Very much \"a small lecture with the heart of a seminar,\" you will end up learning just as much from your classmates as the prof\/lectures\/readings.",
    "Yes. It is a good introduction to the many issues plaguing public education in the U.S.",
    "I would describe this class as an extension of EDST 110. It felt like another survey course that didn't demand much investment and was really easy to disengage from, which was unfortunate. Interesting topics, but not a very rigorous treatment.",
    "Yes! If you are interested in education policy, this course is an awesome chance to dive into topics that interest you and be exposed to new topics. Professor Debs creates a great space for discussion and you will get to know other people in the class which is always great."
