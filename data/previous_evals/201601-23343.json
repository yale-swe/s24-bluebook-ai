    "The instructors are excellent. It is so valuable to learn from practitioners with so much experience in the conservation field. Apart from just teaching the tools, the instructors add context and stories from their experience that helps illustrate in which settings the tools may be useful or not.",
    "Amy and bills professional experience is invaluable.",
    "I liked that the professors encouraged us to \"bend\" the tools to adapt them to our projects in cases where they didn't fit very well, therefore allowing us to be creative and to really own our projects",
    "The combination of in-class and out-of-class exercises was fantastic. The homework really adds to the educational experience (unlike many other classes) and the ability to spend the whole semester fleshing out aspects of your final project with constant feedback from Amy is really, really helpful.",
