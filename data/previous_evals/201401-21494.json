   "comments": [
    "A broad view of evolution and anatomy, taught from a progressive developmental perspective. Absolutely wonderful.",
    "It's a good class to take for the major, just make sure that you review the lecture slides after each class and to ask questions! There is no assigned reading for the course, so its very easy to forget to review the material and end up with 400+ slides of material to know for the next midterm.",
    "Definitely take it, even if it's outside your usual area of interest. You can definitely keep up with the material if you stay on top of your studying, plus it's just amazingly interesting to learn. Though there's no work in between tests, don't underestimate how much studying you'll need to do for it.",
    "Interesting material and Professor.",
    "dated my decision to be an EEB major. I appreciated how we had three non cumulative tests, given how much material we covered. Additionally the material was extremely interesting and I felt that the exams were fair. As a fair warning, you don't need the textbooks because Wagner's lectures are pretty comprehensive.",
    "Great class! Not too much work but you really learn a lot! Professor Wagner is awesome and I always enjoyed class!",
    "Fun and interesting introduction to comparative anatomy. Pretty relaxed classroom environment.",
    "Yes, I think you get a lot out of this class. It's interesting, and there are only three exams, no finals.",
    "It'd be nice to take as a fun class if you stay on top of lecture - you have to go to every lecture to do well\/okay. I wouldn't take it if I didn't have to, but I don't think it's a bad course either.",
    "The class covers a wide array of material. It is challenging to memorize it all; however, many of the topics are interesting. I would recommend it if you need it or have a general strong interest to learn about anatomy.",
    "Straightforward bio class. Took it last year then dropped and see that there's been a shift from short answer to multiple choice exams. And no final! Problem with that is that you're screwed if you don't know anything. Did great on 2 exams and not so great on one and it still worked out really well.",
    "A lot of information. The only grades are the tests, but definitely plan to study for those for a while.",
    "Highly recommended to anyone who wants a straightforward and predictable exploration of animal anatomy. This course doesnt focus much on human anatomy but I still felt that learning about organisms in general will be nice preparation for learning about human anatomy later--perhaps in medical school.",
    "A straightforward class: 3 midterms, with few essay questions. There's a lot of material to learn and memorize, but do so and you will be fine, even with the high concentration of pre-meds in the class. Gunter is humorous and kind once you see past his placid demeanor.",
    "Take it! Loved it. Comprehensive bio knowledge. If you're pre-med, probably one of the most enjoyable bio classes to take. If you're not and want to try science, good class to get an overall idea of vertebrate and vertebrate history.",
    "Straightforward but dry anatomy lecture. Not too hard, but the tests are a bit arbitrary, and the grading was annoying. I recommend, but know that you need a 93% or more to get an A.",
    "It's a fun course, but there's a lot of material, and it can be hard to follow of you don't have a biology background. I really enjoyed taking it, and would recommend it to anyone who likes the general field of evo devo biology."
