   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are passionate about animals, the professor is great, the lab is fun as we have access to the Peabody's rich collection of mammals, and the information and what you learn is so interesting",
    "Completely recommend this course. It was everything i wanted and more.",
    "If you are someone who likes learning about animals, take it. I love it too much to speak to what the class would be like if you weren't that enthusiastic, but I think the chance to study a bunch of skulls would be pretty cool even then. If you were that kid who had a bunch of Ranger Rick magazines or Amazing Animals videos, this is the best thing ever and you should do it. I'm sure the vast assortment of cool animal facts would be enough to keep just about anyone interested, but you need at least a little bit of engagement to be willing to figure out the differences between a bunch of families of bats (trust me, it's actually cool once you get into it).",
    "An excellent overview of mammalian anatomy and phylogeny.",
    "yes i would",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in learning the morphology of mammals! The weekly lab where we got to handle skulls was the best part of my week.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It's really fun and you'll learn so much. There is a lot of information covered and the lab practical exams are really hard if you don't prepare. But if you put some effort in you'll have a great experience and come out with a bunch of facts to impress people with at cocktail parties (or you'll leave with a really good basis to pursue further work concerning mammals).",
    "This class was run by having a lecture one day each week, and by examining specimens on the other day. It was small, and because of its size, all the students were extremely enthusiastic about the material. There are three quizzes using specimens and two quizzes on the lecture material."
