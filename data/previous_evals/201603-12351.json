   "comments": [
    "This course had several good components: first, it was good to be forced to review all the elementary paradigms I learned years ago and have not referred to often since. I think this improved my knowledge of them returning with a more experienced eye. Second, the wide selection of genres and authors we drew passages from was good exposure (even though we have a policy against getting to deep into \"content\"). Third, and perhaps most importantly, this class helps students who are getting comfortable enough with the language try to focus on the more interesting stylistic points that arise when you can see past the basic mechanics.",
    "A specific focus on Attic Greek and the relevance of alternate word forms and stylistic patterns. A rigorous drilling in accidence and grammar."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class was very interesting and I definitely learned a lot. Of course, it felt somewhat unstructured and rambly at times, and I would be hard-pressed to reproduce a list of exactly what I learned, but I do feel that my comfort level with Greek improved.",
    "Class time could be more structured, and a clearer view of what should be learnt and covered throughout the semester would help with the final, but overall an enjoyable class for those who love the intricacies of Greek style and grammar, and Victor Bers is a lovely man!"

   "comments": [
    "I think this is a great class for students serious about improving their familiarity with Greek or diving into the minutiae of the language. I would not recommend it to a casual undergraduate.",
    "Not for the faint-hearted, the class is primarily taken by graduate students and has a single purpose (to comprehensively understand Greek style and grammar) that makes it inevitably tedious at times - but Greek-lovers should most definitely take it as it is hard to find something so immersive elsewhere."
