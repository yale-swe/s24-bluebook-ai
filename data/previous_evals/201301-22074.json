   "comments": [
    "I would summarize it as an introductory English course with a fair workload and a lot of theoretical material which was not entirely engaging. I would recommend a higher level english course with more directed readings\/course material over English 114, but that is my personal recommendation. The compulsory writing tasks would certainly benefit some students.",
    "If you want to take an English course that does not ask too much of you while greatly improving your writing and your ability to analyze readings and prompts critically, this is the class for you. Professor Cornelius is great, always willing to help a student if they are stuck or are having trouble getting their thoughts together. He really puts the time in to help his students understand the little amount of reading he actually assigns and understand how it applies to greater parts of life as well. It is well worth it for you to put in the time and effort that he does for this class, you will notleave disappointed.",
    "I would definitely recommend Ways of Living to other students who are looking to take a basic English course that really helps improve writing skills as well as exposes you to different types of writing. Professor Cornelius is fair, honest, and overall a great teacher. The course doesn't have too heavy of a workload either. Overall, I recommend this course to anyone looking for an easier class that is very informative.",
    "The course helped me further sharpen my writing skills.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to other students. The readings were really interesting, and the small class size is great."
