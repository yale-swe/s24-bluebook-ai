    "First of all, Barbara is awesome. If you do want to take this class I would definitely recommend her -- she clearly cares about her students and wants everybody to be successful, and has a great energy in class with pumps everybody up and motivates us as well. Great professor.This is a good course for people who have some speaking skills but maybe are not confident if their fluidity of speech, etc. You spend the whole semester talking in a small class setting about various topics. If you already have a lot of confidence in your speaking abilities, it's maybe not such a good idea because it's more likely to maintain your speaking abilities at their current level than improve them very much. That said, even for people who spoke pretty fluidly, Barbara was a stickler about correcting small mistakes as well to improve our grammar so that we can express ourselves more intelligently, which was useful even for people who already spoke fairly well.",
    "If you're looking for a relatively low-key Spanish class with not too much work, this is a great class.",
    "great conversation developer and good for deepening the profundity of topics possible to discuss in Spanish.",
    "Great class if you want to improve your ease in spoken Spanish. Overall you read interesting articles and talk about them in class. Your experience will depend a lot of which professor you get. Take it with Prof Barbara Safille! She is crazy in a good way, very expressive and passionate, and gets everyone to talk. She is an easy grader too.The only weakness is that most students need a lot of grammar review, especially of the subjunctive, which the course does not provide, so students end up just trying to avoid using complicated grammatical structures to express their ideas. The course would really be improved if a couple of days were devoted to grammar review.",
    "it is a good class, students learn a lot. it is also a lot of work",
    "Very fun and relaxed course with a light workload. My Spanish didn't improve enormously, but this class was definitely useful in maintaining my fluency. Definitely take it with Professor Safille if possible, she is the best!",
    "A great way to keep up your fluency in a laid back, fun seminar. The work load is not too heavy, and the midterm and final are easy oral exams. Attendance is really important, but usually the discussion is engaging. Your Spanish might not improve a great deal, but at least it won't get worse.",
    "This couse was generally pretty good, though at times it could have been a bit more challenging in the material we discussed. I liked the means of assessment for it, the written tests and quizes never seemed too intimidating, but rather manageable, and the oral exam at least you knew what you had to prepare for. I don't regret taking this class at all. Also a great way to complete a language at the L5 level. I would recommend this class to other students. The book we read at the end (La Invencion de Morel) was at just the right level of difficulty where it wasn't easy to read, and it expanded my vocabulary, but it also wasn't impossibly hard if you spent some time with it. A good course, made even better by the teacher, Barbara Safille!",
    "yes definitely. It is a very good class and I improved my spanish speaking ability greatly.",
    "I would recommend it because it helps improve one's Spanish a lot.",
    "I would recommend it to a student interested in getting better at comprehension, but as far as speaking, if you're not speaking Spanish constantly, I'm not sure I see ways to improve conversational skills past this class. Also, while we did learn how to utilize new vocabulary about very profound themes, I'm not sure this comes in handy during every day conversation.",
    "Great professor. Barbara had so much energy always and facilitated good conversation, though sometimes her \"no-hand-raising,\" \"just-call-out-to-voice-your-opinion\" style favored the more outspoken and comfortable members of the class. The structure of the course can got a little bit tiresome sometimes, with seemingly unrelated readings that we would talk about class after class, but still a really, really good way to practice speaking Spanish."
