    "So many Fourier Transforms",
    "I learned a random amalgamation of information and programming techniques related to computer networking. At the end of the course the areas of information that stuck with me were backscatter communication (the topic of my final paper), slotted Aloha, Black-box and white-box programming, flow tables."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures of the course were really interesting and Professor Yang definitely knows what he's talking about. The biggest drawback of the course, however, is that assignments are really disorganized. The programs we were supposed to use for the problem sets were often broken, and the problem sets themselves were miles harder to understand than to accomplish. This, however, was also in large part due to the TA's themselves not understanding the problem sets or even many of the lectures.",
    "Good exposure to recent research Could use more organization and more realistic pset pacing (we were supposed to have 5, only had 2; this is totally fine, but more people may have taken it if they knew) The radio section should use something other than GNURadio The pacing of the final project was okay, but I hope the class gives students more time with it in the future",
    "It's structure was a little haphazard and it could use more organization. The problem sets were a little more EE focused than CS focused.",
    "The course is rough around the edges. Lectures are unorganized as a result of Yang trying to shape the course around the student's interests. The PSETS were very unequal in workload but had the potential to be very interesting. With both psets, I left feeling I had a much deeper understanding of the concepts that were initially confusing in class. I wish we had more PSETS that consisted of more evenly distributed work. Like most classes you really learn by working through issues and so the final project and psets are where people really cemented knowledge of topics covered in class. I only wish this aspect of the course was better developed."

    "Yes, take this class if you want a chill (more or less) semester with Yang Richard Yang. He is good",
    "Yang Yang is great, but this course wasn't organized too well. It was just a mishmosh of topics he wanted to cover for the most part, which is fine, but if you haven't taken a basic EE course or the other networks class, you probably didn't get everything you could have out of this class. This isn't a replacement for his other networks class at all. Two psets, most of the challenge came from figuring out how to use the software (pset 1 literally had us use software with no documentation anywhere and program without an API :\/), but if you talk to the TAs you'll be ok.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in the latest technology networks. It is very interesting and many of the concepts you learn apply to several fields. You will also learn about the design of different frameworks, which will give you a high level insight into the design of many applications.",
    "I highly recommend this course but I recognize that I am in the minority. Most people tended to doze off during lecture because the slides were hard to follow or very detail specific. However, if you could sift through the unimportant material the actual content of the course was very interesting and engaging despite how they were presented. Yang, although not a great lecturer, really cares about his students and is passionate about the topic. His office doors are always open and he fosters close relations with students if you engage with the class. Take the class if you are interested in putting forth a little more work to understand a topic that can be initially overwhelming."
