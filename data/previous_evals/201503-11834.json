   "comments": [
    "This was a great class if you are interested in anything related to food. We covered a variety of topics relating to this theme, including the farm bill as well as hunger and food stamps. It was very helpful to learn about writing a strong college essay.",
    "ENGL 114 06 is a class that explores food politics and other related topics to food through reading material and mainly synthesis essays.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is interested in issues of food, or even one who needs a writing credit. It was a way to learn about an something important in our society and also fulfill requirements and improve writing skills.",
    "In English 114, you'll look closely at a certain topic and write various papers about aspects of the topic. The topics lead to great discussions and ideas. I would recommend English 114 to a student who is looking to improve their writing. If you are not interested in improving your writing, you are better off taking a different English course.",
    "Yes. The exact section depends on the subject, but overall my experience was positive. There is much reading involved, but the course is manageable and useful for future writing.",
    "This class explores food policy in the United States, starting with the Farm Bill--the complex piece of legislation which covers everything from SNAP to sustainable farming. The class explores issues of food inequality, access, GMOs, food distribution, sustainable farming--basically all topics related to food, agriculture, and society. Readings range from excerpts of Michael Pollan to Janet Poppendieck, and documentaries such as Food, Inc., King Corn, and A Place at the Table are also assigned. There are three main papers and a final presentation--all which are well spaced out and not too stressful. Would DEFINITELY recommend!!! Dr. Stuart is such a wonderful teacher, and the course material is so relevant and interesting! There is something for everyone in this class, whether you're interested in the environment, economics, social issues, food justice, racial injustice, U.S. history, law and policy--anything! Great class.",
    "It was difficult to get into the topic initially, but after a while I felt the class was more interesting. The research paper was a lot of work but if you find a topic you are interested in it isn't bad at all."
