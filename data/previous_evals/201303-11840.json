    "There's not a lot of structured learning but you learn a lot through your work and class critiques. I'm more confident in my eye for graphic design now. It's not as much work as people say and it's enjoyable\/fun for the most part. Henk is great. Take it if you can get in!",
    "If you can get into the class, take it. You will have an amazing time and learn a great deal about visual communication. It's a lot of work but if you are in it chances are you are willing to do it.",
    "Definitely take it, if you're willing to put work in--you'll only get a lot out of it if you put a lot in, but it's definitely worth it. I really loved the class. I've taken a lot of art classes here, and this one may be my favorite.",
    "Intro Graphic Design was an absolutely fabulous class. A great 'back to basics' approach to design that forced us to master the bare essentials. This class will most certainly help with more advanced design, and really required a level of attention to detail as each assignment was done by hand via collage, cutting, pasting, etc. It was certainly a lot of work, but incredibly rewarding. Professor Van Assen is a wonderful professor- constructive, friendly, approachable, and a lot of fun. I 100% encourage you to take this class, regardless of your background or major.",
    "This is a really wonderful class. If you have the chance to take it, definitely take it with Henk. One of the best professors at Yale, and especially in the graphic design department. Do not expect to be using Adobe programs like photoshop and illustrator if those are your reasoning for taking the class. Most of the work you do is by hand with an exacto knife and paper. Though it is a lot of work, Henk is a very relaxed and understanding professor, and will make sure that you get to where you need to be.So take it!",
    "Take it. Professor van Assen is fantastic. He pushed me to design with intention and had a profound impact on the way I think about art. Be warned, however, that the class does require meticulous work done by-hand \u00e2\u0080\u0094 you only rarely use computers to print things out that you will then use when constructing something by hand. That being said, I came to love this way of working, and the workload wasn't overwhelming.",
    "Graphic Design at its most basic\u00e2\u0080\u0094no computers, cutting& pasting, collage. Really a crucial stepping stone for anyone looking to do more advanced work. TAKE THIS CLAS- Henk is wonderful and the class seems to attract a fun group of creative individuals.",
    "In the words of Adrian Monk, getting into this class is \"a gift...and a curse.\" Let's start with the gift: This class is amazing! You will learn so much and you will have fun doing it! The people in this class are awesome too! You will make new, wonderful friends. But all good things have a price: in this case, say goodbye to long nights of sleep. Class meets twice a week, and (at least in the first half of the semester) you will have an assignment every day. After the first half, things ease up a bit in workload, but your projects matter more.In sum, take this class if you can get in. It was my favorite class this semester. It was also my most time consuming (and I took it Credit\/D!)",
    "Yes",
    "Amazing class! Henk is great! Take it!",
    "if you have time to work on projects over and over again until you're happy with them, then take it. It is not hard but you'll be significantly happier if you really do work in it and advance your idea rather than crank out mediocre work.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. Henk is extremely kind but still really pushes your artistic ideas and effort. In other words, I would think I had finished something and he would show me that I needed to start over. Or, I would be despair of ever finding an idea, and he would show me what direction to take one of my ideas.",
    "I would shop the class. It was a great course but only if you want to be dedicating 10 hours a week to graphic design. I took the class credit\/d and I found it frustrating because I didn't want to put that much time in a credit\/d class but at the same time if you don't your projects won't be great. In which case the class becomes a waste of time.Henk is awesome though!"
