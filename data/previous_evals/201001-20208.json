   "comments": [
    "It's basically a course that looks at the production design of films. The art of the film is analyzed in class, and students present on the designs of several films.",
    "It's informative, it will change the way you watch movies, you'll watch a TON of awesome films, the work is completely manageable and the professor is amazing.",
    "I think it is an interesting course to take. Be prepared to do a lot of work and reading though.",
    "In HSAR 469 you will learn a lot in a little time, and Professor Connor is really well versed in the material. It's great to be able to watch movies for your homework and it's enjoyable (well, more enjoyable than usual) doing the written work. Class wasn't super organized, but that could be good or bad. Overall, I really enjoyed it and recommend it!",
    "This is a GREAT CLASS -- genuinely challenging, but always engaging and ultimately very rewarding. As it was a new course this year, there are certain kinks to be worked out (mainly having to do with a lack of clear guidelines regarding the professor's expectations on class assignments), but Prof. Connors (J.D.) is TERRIFIC, and the time you invest in the coursework and discussions is well worth it. If the subject matter interests you, and you're willing to really engage in the readings and film screenings, you will definitely get a lot out of this course, and have a great time."
