    "more tropical diseases! more zoonotic pathogens, and spatial epidemiologywhy is everything always at CIRA?",
    "This seminar was an excellent chance to learn about current infectious disease research going on here at Yale and around the world. It was great to hear different speakers talk about their work and it really opened my eyes to the variety of research being conducted by epidemiologists.",
    "Liked the new speakers and hated the time that the seminar was held \"12 noon\". Its your only time to relax during the day.",
    "Thanks for considering the refreshments!",
    "Good seminar, but there was way too much emphasis on HIV\/AIDS. By the end of the course, I wasn't even paying attention to those seminars. I really appreciated when diverse people came in to talk to us, such as the foreign animal diseases presenter.",
    "Great seminars and instructor accommodated student requests.",
    "NO more HIV lectures on MSM. At least half of them were on this topic. I feel like some of them are more social science seminars that actually microbial seminars.",
    "EMD seminar exposed us to many different projects in the field of infectious disease and public health. I found the majority of the talks to be very interesting an pertinent to our program.",
    "The range of topics have increased compared to fall semester. Really enjoyed the CIRA talks especially.",
    "The EMD lecture series was interesting and topical. I particularly enjoyed seeing the projects of faculty both at Yale and elsewhere. Also, once we got refreshments provided it was even better!",
    "The course was great. The speakers were interesting and the material engaging. Of course, making sure lunch or snacks are served is important, considering that many of us have classes right before and right after the seminar. The snacks served towards the last half of the semester were a great idea and much appreciated.",
    "The course included a great series of speakers which presented a good mix of professional research.",
    "I enjoyed the class since it had great guest lecturers and discussed topics on emerging diseases and infectious disease practices."

    "you have to go, it is not bad and some are excellent.",
    "This is a seminar that introduces EMD students to various projects and topics in the field of infectious disease and public health. I would definitely recommend it to students that are interested in learning more about research and infectious disease.",
    "Yes, it's required for EMD but even if it was not, seminars are a good and fun way to keep abreast of the latest studies and developments in public health.",
    "This is a speaker series on current topics in Epidemiology of Microbial Disease. The speakers are varied, and depending on your interests potentially very interesting or boring. Generally though, it is a good way to understanding the ongoing research being done surrounding many infectious diseases.",
    "This seminar is a great way to learn about current techniques and issues in infectious disease research.",
    "An excellent refresher and introduction into the current possible research for people entering fields of epidemiology of microbial diseases.",
