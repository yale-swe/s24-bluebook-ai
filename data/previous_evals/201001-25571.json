   "comments": [
    "French 120 is an introductory course in the French language that follows a narrative of two young students in Paris. The course teaches French language and culture at the basic level. I would recommend this course to any student looking to learn another language.",
    "I would recommend French L1\/L2 only under the condition that you have a genuine interest in learning French. It is a difficult language class that moves at a fast pace, but there is an incredible payoff.",
    "A great and thorough continuation of L1 for people that want to learn French. The storyline, with Mireille and Robert, is very entertaining.",
    "Absolutely. It's great if you have a fun TA and it's an important language to learn. Take Cayer if he's teaching. One suggestion might be to try to stay on top of all of the workbook practices--they are very important, especially the speaking sections. if you have time, also watch the video again by yourself and try to repeat lines from it.",
    "French 120 is interesting and fun. The class is entirely in French and so are the tests. I would definitely recommend it. It can be intimidating at first, especially if you have no priorexposure but you learn so much from the class.",
    "Yes, take it, but understand that it is a lot of busy work.",
    "It's just what it advertises itself to be--a basic intro language course. If you're at all interested in taking French and learning a solid foundation for further enhancement, then take this course! It's a lot of work, but definitely manageable."
