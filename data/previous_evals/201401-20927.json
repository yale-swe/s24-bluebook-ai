    "Only take this if you really need a science credit and nothing else fits in your schedule. Not because it's a bad class, but there are better options. Otherwise, the TAs and professor are really nice and you do learn a lot. The final project is nice because you get to learn a lot about a specific topic. Don't regret taking this class, I did learn a lot about the immune system.",
    "This class definitely isn't very rigorous. It can be a bit intimidating if you have no propensity for biology or no biology background, but realistically you can easily learn the subject matter for the midterm if you just spend adequate time studying. There isn't a lot of work, and the problem sets are usually easily manageable. I didn't think this class was very interesting though. Take this class if you desperately need a science credit. If not, don't take this class unless you know you are interested in biology and immunology.",
    "I would recommend MCDB 109 to other humanities majors who are looking to fulfill their science credit. The first half of the course is much more focused on the \"biology\" of the immunology whereas the second half of the course is much more about the \"ethical\" questions surrounding research and epidemics. Both parts are interesting and the final paper\/presentation can focus on either (which is useful if you have a particular interest one way or the other)",
    "Definitely recommend. Great way to get a science credit. Immunity and Contagion is definitely a biology course but not much prerequisite knowledge is needed. Weekly problem sets aren't too difficult. Reading and lectures are definitely interesting and engaging. Class does a great job of explaining both the immune system and the biological, social, economic, and political implications of contagious diseases. Midterm is a bit difficult but not too hard if you study. year end project is a great way to research a pertinent topic and show your knowledge. Definitely a course worth taking.",
    "Immunity and Contagion won't be the best class you ever took at Yale, but if you're looking for a relatively chill science credit, I say go for it. You only really have to learn the material once-- for the midterm, because there is no final. And before you start studying, you will know nothing, because it is pretty much impossible to pay attention in lecture, and you will just copy from the lecture slides in order to do your psets, but if you give yourself a few days to teach it to yourself before the exam, you can do just fine on the midterm. Instead of a final, you have a presentation and paper on your choice of topic--which turns out to be really fun. There's a bit of reading involved in the course--but it's all really cool--not text books--like actual books real authors who can actually write well have written about cool diseases. You do actually have to read them because you have problem set with questions that can only be answered if you've read the whole book. But it's good reading. The professor--Paula--is AWESOME. She's super sweet and funny, and really tries to make the course fun by coming up with cool field trips and activities. I think if you're looking for a pretty chill science credit, you should definitely consider taking this.",
    "Yes. The class provides a solid overview of the immune system while also being accessible to non-science majors. A big plus is that you're given a lot of freedom on your final paper, meaning that you can write on something that genuinely interests you. Know that a background in biology (e.g. AP Bio) is recommended, however, since you discuss the topics on a relatively detailed level from the get-go.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who wants to learn about diseases, the immune system, and also historical epidemics like AIDS and Polio. Don't be freaked out in the beginning if you feel like you've forgotten everything from AP Bio and everyone is ahead - Professor Kavathas and all the TFs do a really good job of explaining key concepts. Sometimes the class feels slightly disorganised, because it's hard to explain the entire immune system in a way that we can understand and that is very basic. If you study the review slides and your notes, (you don't even need the reading) and make sure you get the big picture (not just understanding the details in isolation), you will do very well in the class! Also, Omotooke was an AMAZING TF and she works so hard to make sure you get the most out of class. Thank you Omotooke!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. If you're looking for a science credit that won't skew your workload but that also won't be a waste of your time because it's so boring, then this is the perfect course! The material's super interesting and you learn a lot.",
    "As a science course for non-science majors, it has a lot of potential. The idea of integrating public health discussions with lectures that are more nitty gritty science-based is really cool. If you're looking for a science course without much work, you should take it-- weekly p-sets, one midterm, and a final paper\/presentation. That said, Professor Kavathas can make the class frustrating-- it can be hard to understand the material because of her teaching style, and it always somewhat unclear what exactly we were supposed to be turning in when.",
    "A fine, albeit boring course, that asks as much of the student as s\/he does of the course: not a whole lot.",
    "I would not recommend the class unless you find the material extremely riveting. The midterm exam on the specific science of the immune system was more challenging than I expected it to be, although the rest of the class was fairly straight-forward. I would say that there are probably easier science credits if that is what you're looking for, as well as more interesting classes if you are attracted to the topic.",
    "If you like immunology, take this class. The people that took the class but were not interested in the topic did not enjoy it. I thought the topic was fascinating, and absolutely loved the course. The midterm was not too difficult if you learned all the material (it was fair). You learn actual biology so be prepared to do a lot of memorizing of cell types and functions and actually read the textbook. The project at the end was interesting and fun. What you get out of this class will depend on how much you put into it.",
    "Immunity and Contagion is a painless science credit, and one in which you will actually learn a decent amount of science. The readings of articles and semi-historical books can be interesting, as are some of the presentations people give at the end of the semester. However, Paula Kavathas is pretty disorganized and I didn't learn much from hearing her lecture; it was easier to just look over the slides. Take this if you want a somewhat interesting Sc credit, but not if you're looking for a great class.",
    "Great science class to take if you want an enjoyable class to fulfill your SC requirement.",
    "You should definitely take this science class!",
    "Great science credit. You learn a lot about the basics of biology and there's not too much work outside the classroom. Definitely take it!",
    "I would highly recommend MCDB 109 to other non-science students and even science students! This class is extremely interesting with relevant health topics that I think everyone could use. The first half of the class is filled with pretty technical science details, but the second half is pretty socio-politically focused. All the readings are really interesting and the professor and TF's are great! I am terrible at science and had pretty much no experience with biology, but I had a very positive experience with this class.",
    "This is a very interesting, and manageable class for non-science majors. Only one short problem set per week, one midterm, and one 6-7 final paper accompanied by a presentation (on of topic of your choice). I learned a lot more than I thought I would about the immune system. Most of our readings were from novels that I really enjoyed. It presented the material in a more real-world way.",
    "This was a good general immunology course with pretty basic focus. If you're doing it just for a science credit, you may be better off taking the into bio sequence, it is easier. However, this course gets more in-depth into a more interesting aspect (but, at the same time, you will have a better time in the course if you know your bio basics).",
    "A good overview of immunology and a basic introduction to the immune system. Good for students without extensive background in the science. Would definitely recommend to other students!",
    "If you aren't a science person, but need a credit, this works pretty well. There was no final, only a paper on a topic of your choosing. It was great.",
    "Yeah take it!",
    "This is a decent science credit, mostly because you get to do an independent paper and presentation at the end, which is really interesting. The class is strange because the midterm requires a lot of specific biological knowledge, but since there's no final exam, students lose incentive to pay close attention to lecture during the second half of the class. It's nice being in a small lecture setting.",
    "This is a great class for people who need a science credit or, more generally, for non-premeds who are looking for a general introduction to the immune system and how the concept of immunity is relevant to our everyday lives. The first half of the course leading up to the midterm is very biology-heavy, and people who have had at least some biology background in high school were definitely more prepared to process information from lectures. The second half of the course deals more with the \"bigger picture\" of how immunity is important on a population scale, as well as some ethical issues related to immunological research. Overall, the material is interesting and engaging, and you definitely feel yourself growing more knowledgeable about the topic as the course progresses. The workload is very manageable (one midterm, 6 brief problem sets, a 6-7 page final paper on a topic of your choice, and a presentation on the paper), and I really enjoyed the freedom we were given to apply course concepts to any current issue we found compelling. Highly, highly recommend this course."
