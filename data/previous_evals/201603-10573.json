   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Excellent teaching. Zhou Laoshi makes all his own notes, and cares deeply about the class. Weaknesses: The course prioritizes writing over the other three skills (listening, speaking, and reading). I would rather see writing receive the *least* emphasis. It is much more important to me to be able to hold a conversation in Chinese (which I still struggle to do) and to consume Chinese media (TV, movies, books, newspapers), than it is to be able to write formal Chinese. I would recommend reducing the amount of time spent on partnered grammar exercises, and replacing it with partnered conversation. The grammar exercises can be moved to individual homework.",
    "The course is very well paced and the professor makes it so that we learn the material by heart. A weakness might be that the textbook material isn't really interesting, especially since it overlaps a lot with what students learn third year - social problems and such.",
    "Strengths: Zhou Laoshi is so caring and loving towards his students. I always had so much fun in class and loved how we give presentations-- it makes us review our content. I loved how he emphasized how to make our writing sound more complex! Weaknesses: Sometimes homework wasn't posted on time",
    "Lots of learning fairly quickly but without too much effort. However, just learning from the textbook gets a bit monotonous sometimes",
    "Great class! A little disorganized at times maybe but generally loved the pace, content, and style."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! It's quite simple: if you take Chinese 154, your Chinese will continue to improve. If not, it will degrade due to lack of use. Take it!",
    "Yes! This is a great course to continue honing your language skills, without the rigor required of the first three years.",
    "Yes",
    "Yess!! Zhou laoshi knows that as a higher level chinese course, students are taking this out of wanting to learn Chinese. He doesn't pressure students to do every tiny detail- he thinks holistically and makes this course about how much you want to gain from it.",
    "Yeah you need it for later Chinese courses",
    "If you're serious about improving your Chinese you must take it"
