    "Great course, so long as you are self-motivated. Prof. Bloom is incredibly knowledgeable and hilariously sarcastic.",
    "I would only recommend it if you are willing to put in a LOT of effort and time with the script.",
    "Yes. Funny, informative.",
    "It's a class dedicated to being creative in a whole new realm of writing. You'll learn what's great and what's terrible in television writing, and how to apply that to yourself. From the brainstorm process to the pitch to the writing, it's a quick dive into the world of tv writing. I would absolutely recommend this class to someone willing to try something new, fail, and put a lot of time into the script (especially at the end). Also, definitely make use of Professor Bloom's advice, meet with her after class, and be in touch with her.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want to put a lot of work into your project. It's not the sort of relaxing class you can take because you just want to dabble in a new type of writing that you've never tried before. It's one of the hardest classes I've taken. But it's also rewarding and fun to make progress on your script and to see it come together."
