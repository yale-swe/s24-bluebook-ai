   "comments": [
    "Of course! If you're at all interested in French, you have to take a lit course. And I don't think I've ever taken one better than 170.",
    "A solid class, not life-changing but an engaging and manageable introduction to french lit. Will help you understand literary analysis, and french literary history in particular, while also pushing you to improve your french. If you want to take it, though, make sure your french is up to snuff or the readings will be semi-incomprehensible torture and the discussion will seem impenetrable.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class! This was the first time I actually felt like I was working in French, not just taking tests and memorizing vocabulary. You really have to read the texts and think deeply about them. There are also several essays, which turned out to be fun to write after having class discussion. It also felt very laid back. I know I was intimidated at first, but the atmosphere was very lighthearted, and I think everyone felt comfortable. Professor Sanjabi is an amazing professor - her insights are incredible and she is always very open to meeting outside of class. I would highly recommend taking French 170 with her!",
    "French 170 was a sampling of works of French literature through the ages. I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in the topic. Not too much work, and exposure to a lot of good literature.",
    "A survey of french literature beginning with medieval works (Marie de France) and working through landmark works up to the 21st century.",
    "Yes, take it for a greater appreciation of French literature. Madame is very understanding with the workload and open to different opinions."
