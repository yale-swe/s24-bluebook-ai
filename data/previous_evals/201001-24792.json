   "comments": [
    "A very interesting course that does not get boring as the semester progresses. It's a fair amount of reading, but you can get away with skimming a lot of it. The seminar goes by really fast and the professor is not afraid to end the class early if the conversation gets stale. Overall I recommend it.",
    "Come to class prepared and ready to discuss the readings. You will get called on eventually and you will look dumb if you do not have anything to say. The class covers a variety of issues so if you don't like something one week, you might the next.",
    "I'd highly recommend it, especially if you're interested in theories about violence, war government and social structure, and cultures of poverty. The reading is great!",
    "Yes, I would sincerely recommend it to any student with at least a basic background in political science (especially comparative politics) theory. Discussions can be somewhat jargon-heavy, so this is necessary, but overall it is a course well worth taking.",
    "I would say the course is a great investigation of social order, violence and how human behavior changes across contexts. I would definitely recommend it to other poli sci students! The class discussions were great",
    "A look at order and disorder based on several different readings. While every week has a different topic, they all focus around the title of the class. Plenty of reading, but a worthwhile class.",
    "Yes, but beware it's a little disjointed but the readings are varied and pretty interesting and Kocher's a nice guy. Paper's flexible."
