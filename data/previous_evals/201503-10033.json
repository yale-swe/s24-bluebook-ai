    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon is smart and well-spoken. His sections were fine. However, he did often borderline on aggressive. His reads of the room were often \"off.\" His assessment of what the student speaking said were aggrandized or exaggerated. I think it might be a little more ego than anything else. When he had the opportunity to open the class with lecture, however, he did a magnificent job. I think perhaps that is a better space for him.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon has very strong political views, and at times I was bothered by the way he chose to express them. But I also enjoyed that he provided such a clear contrast to the way Dr. Wenger thought about things, and that made the class more interesting as a whole. I did very much appreciate his feedback on my writing.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon did an excellent job of providing a different perspective and sense of balance to the course. He regularly sought to evaluate the types of arguments being made in the texts and relate those to practical and legal concerns.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon was very knowledgeable about the subject and readings. He was an engaging group conversation leader and challenged us in thoughtful ways. His comments were very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon did an incredible job as the Teaching Fellow; the two lectures he covered were some of the best of the semester. He has a firm grasp on the material and isolated key terms and themes necessary for our delving deeper into it. At times held onto some obvious opinions, but did an excellent job admitting to that fact as well.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Excellent: I met with Graedon once for about a half an hour about my term paper and he gave me some great pointers. He was excited about the course material and to dialogue with students.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0My teaching fellow was always well prepared and good initiating and maintaining discussion on relevant topics.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon was very approachable and skilled at facilitating discussion in section. The few times that Professor Wenger had him lecture to begin class, he was extremely competent. For the most part, he was also attentive to concerns expressed outside of section via email. I appreciated his comments on my bibliography and drafts.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0He was a good lecturer and good at prompting discussions during small group. His feedback on the various steps in the research paper process was very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon was absolutely terrific! He was well organized and his questions were provocative. He is the best teaching fellow that I have had at YDS.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Though he talked a little to much when facilitating discussion, he was incredibly knowledgable and offered a counter-opinion to Prof. Wenger. There differences in opinion offered a diversity in conversation, which was actually very useful.",
    "Instructor: Graedon Hileman Zorzi \u00a0Graedon's prepared lectures on legal histories were a great addition to the course material. His feedback on proposals and assignments was thoughtful, constructive, and useful in drafting further assignments."
