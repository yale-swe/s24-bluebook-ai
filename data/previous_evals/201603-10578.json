    "My chinese reading and speaking skills have improved, and I learned a lot more about Chinese culture.",
    "I was able to learn how to read simplified Chinese -- Su Lao Shi was very encouraging as I had only read traditional characters before",
    "learned about chinese philosophy and meanings behind many idioms and metaphors",
    "This helped me with its rigorous workload by grasping Chinese through immediate immersion.",
    "By taking this course, I developed a strong foundation of the Chinese language. In addition to vocabulary and grammar structures, Su Laoshi makes the point of supplementing class lessons with interesting facts and lessons about Chinese culture and philosophy. His stories his life as a student, and in China are fascinating, and engages the class.",
    "My Chinese level improved immensely from this course. I learned a lot of vocabulary and idioms and about Chinese history and culture."

   "comments": [
    "I really like the structure of the course -- it's well balanced between learning new concepts and characters and having engaging discussions",
    "more oral practice during class would be great. i feel like part of the problem though, was that my speaking\/listening ability just wasn't as high as everyone else's , so it's probably a me thing where i need to improve my abilities and confidence",
    "Strengths include interesting classes, and a passionate professor who keeps his students engaged. Su Laoshi obviously cares very much about his students, and the subject of Chinese language and culture, and that shines through the way he teaches. However, I think one weakness is that there is little structure to the class in terms of grammar and vocabulary drills. Furthermore, there are often things that we do not learn in class, on our tests. This puts students who don't have as strong of a heritage foundation in Chinese, at a clear disadvantage.",
    "Strengths: focused on reading and writing skills, excellent professor, really improves your Chinese level but not overly difficult Weakness: could involve more speaking practice, also weekly essays\/presentations were a lot of work"

    "I loved this course and the professor (who has lived an incredible life that he enjoys sharing with his students)",
    "yes! su laoshi is amazing!",
    "The professor is so interesting, as well as the topics in the book.",
    "For students who are truly interested in learning Chinese and improving their knowledge of Chinese culture, this class is great. However, I will warn that this class is definitely challenging for students that lack a strong heritage foundation in the Chinese language. It is unstructured and unlike other Chinese classes (132\/142). Su Laoshi is a passionate professor, however, and tells the best stories. He's clearly loves teaching very much, and is eager to instill greater interest for Chinese culture among his students.",
    "Yes! This course really improves your Chinese skills and the professor is excellent! It was a very fun class and I got close to my classmates. The workload was manageable but requires you to keep up with everything. Overall a very enjoyable course!"
