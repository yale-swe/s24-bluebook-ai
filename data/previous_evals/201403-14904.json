    "A perfect mix of theory and practice! A very well structured and taught class. I wish there were more courses like this, but am truly fortunate that I got to take it my senior year! If this is offered again you must take it!!! Every class was just absolutely amazing!",
    "This is one of the most helpful and practical Theater Studies classes I've taken at Yale and ought to be taken by anyone who plans a professional performing career. It brings you back to basics in a way you'd have never thought possible and is truly to a joyful addition to a weekly schedule. If it's offered again with Chris Bayes (to which the Theater Studies department will hopefully agree), TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "This was, without a doubt, one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Both actors and non-actors took the class and we all \"blossomed like little flowers.\" I often dreaded going to class because I knew that I'd experience the risky, uncomfortable challenge to grow. I knew that I'd be asked to put myself out there, and some days I was braver than others. Every risk I took was rewarded with a new-found sense of self-worth, a \"softening\" of my reactions when I was uncomfortable, and the ability to listen better to the audience I was performing for. Never before has the greatest compliment I could receive been, \"wow, that was REALLY stupid.\" This class is the antithesis to the social constraints we put ourselves through at Yale: don't worry so much about what other people think of you, be comfortable putting your emotions on display in front of others, and if you need to have a breakdown have a breakdown. I only wish the class would continue next semester. If it is offered again, you MUST take it. Yes, it's a big chunk of time, but please do yourself the favor of taking this risk.",
    "YES. A serious course in clown technique. Very, very fun. Most of the work happens in the class, and though there are important homework assignments, they do not involve reading. Or writing papers.",
    "100% recommended. There is no other course like this at Yale.",
    "This class will teach you how to connect with an audience, and about humanity in general. Be prepared for it to be the hardest, most beautiful part of your week. I absolutely recommend it. It's a truly fantastic class.",
    "Yes, best course ever!",
    "TAKE IT. If you're a Theater Studies major or do anything in the theater, it's a must take. But honestly, it's a must take for everyone. It is such a great class and such important work not only for any performer but for any human being. Professor Bayes is amazing, and I really hope he teaches it again. It is a very challenging class, though in a different way than any other class at Yale. But you will laugh more in this class than anywhere else during your week, and you'll learn so much about what it means to be free, brave, and (of course) funny, both on the stage and in your life.",
    "Look, you will enter this course thinking \"How hard could it be? This will be a piece of cake.\" Yeah, well, it won't! Bayes demands something of you that has never been demanded of you before in your life. And MAN can it be hard to let yourself get to that space! But positively riveting, gratifying when you feel yourself and others open up to it. I don't want to tell you what it is exactly because you have to experience it to believe it. Suffice it to say that this class will demand a personal commitment of you that no other Yale course will ever or has ever demanded. And it can be scary. But well worth it. OK for you NON-ACTORS: this is definitely a course in \"clown\" for actors -- the clown as a tool for helping the actor to discover his innate sense of fun, play, and comedy rooted in the SELF. That being said, there were some non-actors in the class who seemed to really like the course -- because, truth be told, clowning and discovering that personal sense of play and freedom is good for EVERYONE, not just performers. But I guess I wanted to point this out because for anyone coming to the class thinking \"great, I'm going to learn specific techniques of comedy and comic theory, or I'm going to learn about clowning and how to construct clown scenes,\" -- it's not that kind of course. We don't sit down and \"analyze\" theory, we are on our feet discovering the comedy within us. And we really don't get as far as being able to dig into \"clown\" itself as a form, but techniques inspired from contemporary clowning that are designed to help the actor and person be a more true, honest self on stage.",
    "If your up for a challenge and a shock to the system every week, go for it. I think this class and this professor has something to offer everyone, not just performers or theater practitioners. It was an incredible experience to take this class.",
    "Take this course! This was one of the best theater studies classes I have taken. Professor Bayes is a master teacher and I am beyond fortunate to have had the opportunity to work with him. The skills we learned in class will benefit me as a performer and intellectual for my entire life.",
    "This course is brilliant for anyone and everyone--not just actors. If you want to learn about self expression in any way shape or form, this is the course for you. It is both challenging and extremely fun, demanding and liberating.",
    "Chris Bayes' Clown Class was a totally unique treat of a Yale course. It had long, weekly sessions with an emphasis on tapping into the most mischievous and elemental parts of ourselves (\"let the little one drive\"). There were no assignments for outside of class (save admonitions to \"laugh louder\" and \"make more stupid jokes\"). Easily the funniest and most energetic course I've taken at Yale, it was also one of the most freeing. Each week in warmups we modeled a journey through nervousness, anger, and despair (much less pretentious than it sounds) until we were finally in the place where the \"ha-ha-ha\"s could happen. Bayes took a practical approach to clown theory, handing us impossible tasks (\"walk out onto this stage and make us laugh\") and then coaxing and cajoling us into building our clowns out of the miniature tragedy of all our best ideas failing. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in diving into comedy and clown with an able teacher and a supportive environment."
