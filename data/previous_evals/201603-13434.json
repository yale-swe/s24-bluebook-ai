   "comments": [
    "A VERY thorough view of the characteristics of the American health care systems - areas of potential improvement, greatest risks in the future to keep it sustainable, and determining why health care markets are unique. Very good course.",
    "I learned how to apply economic theory to health economic problems and how to evaluate data in the field of economics. I also learned a lot of stylized facts about the US healthcare system.",
    "Deeper understanding of the American healthcare system's economics and how economic tools and techniques can be used to gain a deeper understanding of the American healthcare system",
    "I learned a lot about the econometric tools health economists use; I learned how to interpret their papers and critique them.",
    "In this course, I learned of institutional details of health care in the United States, how to apply economic theory to health care, and of recent economic studies in healthcare.",
    "This course was my favorite class of the semester. With many relevant discussions to healthcare today, I feel much more knowledgeable about the history of healthcare, the delivery\/economics of different healthcare sectors, as well as healthcare policy having taken this course.",
    "This course was a nice follow up of ECON170, which focused much more on public policy and reforms\/regulations than Economic research. ECON405 focuses explicitly on current research, which gives you insight into what policies are actually, quantitatively effective. I learned a substantial amount about many different topics in healthcare, including supply and demand side issues, ways the market is different, etc. We even had a lecture on dental care! We also touched on healthcare in the news, which was good to discuss, and we spent a lot of time on understanding how to read a research paper and how to interpret them correctly.",
    "I learned how to think about public policy from an experimental based, data driven perspective. I learned how to read and critically analyze economics papers and research in the field. I also learned so much about the healthcare system and the economics behind health in general, that to try to capture it all on this evaluation would be futile."

   "comments": [
    "Problem sets are challenging by design -- they really have you dive into research papers, rather than just getting a very brief summary from the professor. You recreate the main results of her papers and discuss policy\/economic implications. Exams are fair - mostly taken from lecture, with the occasional question from a paper discussed in section - but nothing covered on them will come as a true surprise.",
    "The strengths of the course lie in class discussion and the problem sets. For both, i used critical thinking skills that made me excited about learning health economics. The problem sets are well-developed and fun to tackle and class discussion was insightful. While I thought the first half or first two-thirds of the course were great and I really liked hearing Margot Sanger-Katz from the NYT, I found the last bits of the class to be lackluster in comparison to what had been a generally great semester. This was because I felt that the level at we were learning at before - mainly learning economic concepts in health economics - was way more interesting and stimulating than learning how to \"apply\" that knowledge in the last few lectures. The application of that knowledge worked for some lectures, but not the ones towards the end about long-term care, managed care, and controlling costs. I think this was maybe not so much because of the content, which was all presented on the slides, but because most of those lectures felt as if we were just reading the slides together with no discussion or Professor Kowlaski was not really conveying the information in a lecture style. Therefore, I found the end of the class to be disappointing compared to how excited I had felt about the class earlier. I also found the final to be disappointing because it recycled many questions from the past exams and one from our midterm. While I understand that technique is meant to reinforce certain takeways we have from the course, I did not feel challenged at all to critically think about the questions. Therefore, I felt disappointed that after a semester of learning health economics, I was being tested on things I could just memorize and not flex what I had actually learned.",
    "Really engaged professor and interesting readings. Problem sets were hard but worthwhile (except the third, which was orders of magnitude harder than anything else, but hey, you drop the lowest pset, so whatever). Small class size facilitated great discussions with the professor. Guest lecturer was super cool. Section was more or less useless, even thought the TA was pretty good. Exams are mostly rote regurgitation and could probably have been better written to test understanding and application along with content memorization. Annoying to have to buy Stata just for 2 psets, but I guess there's not much to do about that. Very little clarity as to grading, in that no one really knew how they were doing in the course grade-wise. Still, good class overall with a stellar professor.",
    "Some slide sets were out of date, but overall the content was very relevant for today. I think the weights of the components of the grade were also fair, since psets took a long time.",
    "This is an incredible course. It is interesting and challenging. It is analytical and real-word. Its strength is that it is a seminar. Our discussions are lively and fun. Kowalski loves questions and promotes creativity.",
    "Strengths: Question driven discussion, contemporary examples and statistics, invitations to relevant on campus talks\/events Weaknesses: lacked relevance in the technicality of problem sets to the conceptual takeaways of the course",
    "I think the course is very comprehensive in terms of what it covers. I also thought that problem sets and exams were fair. I think as healthcare policy begins to shift in the upcoming year that more discussion of potential policies and research surrounding them will be interesting, but for now the class was great!",
    "One of the biggest strengths of the course was that it followed a clear trajectory and it was very evidence-based. One weakness was that each lecture had too much information that wasn't discussed thoroughly for time purposes."

    "Absolutely yes! It is not an easy course by any stretch - it requires a lot of abstract thinking and general econ knowledge (you can't BS your way through the problem sets) but it is extremely interesting. Kowalski draws upon her own research a lot, which makes for very cool discussions. If you're worried about taking this after Forman's class, don't. The titles are similar but the subject matter has almost no overlap at all - this is really the econ version of that course (whereas Forman's is almost a political science course.) Leila was the TF for the whole course and she was great -- responsive to questions, led section well, and knew the material cold. (And she made cookies for us at the last section!) Grading is fair. Most sections are optional, so don't think of them as a huge drag on your time.",
    "Make sure you actually care about the subject, because if you don't, the class will be quite dull. Serves as a great follow-up to Forman's Health Econ class. Econometrics and Stata skills are extremely valuable.",
    "Yes, I would. Especially with Leila as the TA.",
    "Absolutely! So interesting. Wonderful format. Very applicable topics.",
    "Yes. It is definitely worth taking this course. Professor Kowalski creates engaging discussion and really cates about her students' opinions and learning. Lectures are relevant to and tests are fair.",
    "Ultimately disappointing. This class is a natural extension of Econ 170, focusing less on institutional detail and more on simple microeconomic modeling and empirical research. For example, in 170 you learn what adverse selection is, and in 405 you read about research on adverse selection - how people have tried to model it and measure it - and even recreate some of the econometrics behind a published paper on it in a problem set. Good material, three problem sets (drop one), four mandatory sections and the rest optional, midterm and final, the setup was more than fine. But what sank the class is Professor Kowalski did not prepare for lecture. These were her own slides for a class she was teaching for the fifth time, but she simply did not know what was on them in any meaningful detail before class. I was actually embarrassed for her as she either simply read slides word for word, paraphrasing sparsely, or furiously scanned slides with more text to figure out what they were about, and only offered meaningful commentary on a minority of the content. Once she actually tried to pass off her not understanding a set of figures she had accidentally copied into the slides without axes as evidence of how complex and spurious the research itself was, which was frankly insulting to our intelligence. But to summarize the good again: the class content is worthwhile, the structure is reasonable, our TA Leila was wonderful, and the visit by NYT reporter Margot Sanger Katz was really great. It is a shame a class with such potential turned out like this. A previous review for this class mentions Professor Kowalski is a \"rising star\" in health econ, and if you take the class, you'll see that the quality of her research (on which she bases the psets) is indisputable. Hopefully if her tenure review either this year or next goes well, she will take her teaching duties more seriously.",
    "ECON405 is a great course to take if you are seriously interested in healthcare and healthcare policy! It is also a great followup to ECON170, which focuses more on policy. In ECON405, you will study Economic research on healthcare, which informs (or should inform) public policy. If you are interested in knowing which policies\/reforms are actually effective, how people value health, or any other supply or demand side issue in healthcare, this is your class. We also touched on healthcare in the news, and we spent time on learning how to really read, understand, and interpret Economic papers, which is an important skill to have. Kowalski teaches effectively and is a star in her field! It's a fair amount of work, as you should read the research papers, but it isn't too much work if you're interested. The class has 3 psets (best 2 count), a midterm, and exam. The exams were fair, and you were able to reason through them for the most part. Overall, a solid senior seminar!",
    "If you want to learn about economics integrated into healthcare -- take this course!! Even if you have taken Econ 170 with Howard Foreman -- this class is much more economics based than 170. The workload is very manageable, and I leave it feeling like I have the tools to frame questions to be used for research. I also feel that I am much more capable at thinking about our healthcare system. In this class we looked at a lot of healthcare literature, so I feel that I better able to reference literature that could support or criticize policy. With the current state of our healthcare system and its uncertain future, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants guidance on how to look at the issues that are being brought up in the media, etc. But also don't feel like you need extensive healthcare background to take this course. Professor Kowalski will walk you through all the different aspects of health and healthcare. Overall -- really applicable, really interesting --"
