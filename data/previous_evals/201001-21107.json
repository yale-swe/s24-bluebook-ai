   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to any music department student interested in 20th century music -- even those students who are not specifically interested in tonal 20th century music would benefit, I think, from this class's discussions of contextualization and the anxieties of the composer. The final project in this class would also be extremely useful to any student in that it provides an excellent means of experimenting with a future research topic, or at the very least gaining an understanding of what our future prospectus procedures will be like.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially someone who already had an interest in composers and repertoire of this period. I particularly appreciated the flexibility with the final project, which allowed students to look at nearly any composer and issue from the time period that interested us.",
    "I would recommend the class highly, both because it is a terrific excuse to get to know some of the music that makes up the \"contemporary tonality\" tradition, and because it is an excuse to get to know the theories developed explicitly for use with this music.",
    "Would recommend to a student interested in the material",
    "This seminar introduces fundamental issues and concerns related to the study of contemporary tonality, and encourages students to engage extant modes of analysis and to develop further methods largely based upon the study of individual works or bodies of work within the contemporary tonal corpus.I would recommend this course to another student, especially if he or she has an interest in (and\/or familiarity with) the repertoire."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to explore several areas in which I maintain some research interest, and any of these experiences may contribute to my research in the future. Again, the final project was an ideal way to explore our individual interests and create a mock-prospectus in the process.",
    "If anything, this course made me aware of how much remains to be done on this repertoire in the field of music theory.",
    "Good overview of some historical approaches to post-CP tonality."
