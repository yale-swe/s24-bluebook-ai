   "comments": [
    "Fun, interesting class for those wanting a peek at the world of history of art\/archaeology. A lot of reading but quite interesting stuff, especiallyfor first timers. I especially liked all the drawing we get to do in class. Word of warning: there will not be very many freshmen in this class. Don't be scared if you don't know the techniques and names of all the motifs that other people seem to know, KPF is a more than fair professor and the sweetest, kindest professor one could hope for.",
    "This is a great course covering the art of, not only ancient palaces, but also the three great civilizations to which these palaces belong. It covers a wide array of information on this subject. I would recommend knowing at least a little history before taking this class; often the history is glossed over in class to focus on the art itself. Otherwise, this is a great class!",
    "This is a great class. I'm not anything close to a history of art or archaeology major, and my knowledge of ancient near east history was VERY limited, but this didn't prevent me from understanding what was happening in class. Professor Foster is a great instructor. She likes for people to ask questions, but it is kind of difficult due to the fact that you're in a dark room. I took this as a fifth class--there is little work--3 tests and a 10 page paper. It's a unique way to learn history.",
    "This is a wonderful course for anyone who is interested in ancient art. The course packet of readings is significant, but you're free to read whenever you have time throughout each unit. Very low work load compared to my other courses, exams that are relatively easy to prepare for, and very interesting lectures. Overall, I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "Take it! Everyone should know something about these ancient civilizations because they are simply fascinating!",
    "I strongly recommend this course. It was a great class, the material was fascinating, the presentation was excellent, and I never felt lost. Everyone should take this class.",
    "Ancient art and society of Egypt, Mesopotamia, the Aegean through the lens of palaces; both art historical and archeological aspects covered.Recommended for people interested in ancient civilizations; ancient society reflected through palatial art.",
    "If you are interested in taking this course, I would look at the class syllabus; it is quite comprehensible and will tell you all that you need to know. The material covered in the course is very interesting, and the presentation of the material is excellent. Professor Foster clearly knows what she is doing, and her lectures are entertaining. The workload is manageable and the assignments clearly explained in the syllabus. I would definitely recommend this course to another student!",
    "Yes, it was a nice into into Palace art, and it gives you background history to the regions included.",
    "The course focuses on three civilizations: ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian and the Aegean. It introduces the palatial structures, life and the highlights of each civilization. It focuses on the architecture as well as the art produced. I recommend the class to students who are truly interested in those civilizations and in learning about their palaces and artwork."
