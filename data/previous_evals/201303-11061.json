    "This class was very manageable and the teacher was super helpful. For a required class it was surprisingly enjoyable.",
    "Spanish 120 is a great course to delve into common Spanish grammar topics, practice writing, and practice close reading.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone wishing to build upon their Spanish level. It explores basic grammatical structures and vocabulary that is necessary for everyday conversation.",
    "Take this class, the instructors are great, and they'll really take the time to walk you through everything you struggle with.",
    "Yes, I found this class to be very enjoyable, and the teacher was very helpful",
    "A solid Spanish course. You should expect a steady stream of work and some tedium from time to time, but you will certainly learn the language. Grading is very fair - even generous - and spread out across many assignments and assessments. The class will be rewarding if you put in effort every day."
