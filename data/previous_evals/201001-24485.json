    "Course that focuses on the journalistic process - especially sourcing and the changing business model.",
    "Journalism is arguably worthwhile, but it's definitely not a class in the typical Yale sense of \"class.\" Very little work. Two projects over the course of the semester. Both are quite fun to research and write, since you're worrying almost exclusively about the writing itself, as opposed to the type of things you might worry about in an english or philosophy paper.I agree with those who say that this is class is like a weekly Master's Tea every Monday morning. Being around Jill Abramson is very cool, and she tells you all about her career. Cool stories abound. Also, some sweet guests, including Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter Michael Moss. The trip to the NY Times headquarters and guided tour given by Jill was by far the biggest upside of this class.That said, you get almost no help with your writing. You learn very little about the craft of journalism, the history of journalism, ethics of journalism, and quite a lot about the career of journalism.",
    "If you're interested in any form of writing, ever, do it.",
    "A great class with 2 truly interesting assignments. It does take dedication: you are held to high standards in your reporting. I wouldn't expect anything less from the managing editor of the NY Times. Prof. Abramson really seems to care about each student, and she is very open with her experiences in journalism.",
    "This class was obviously unbelievably--Professor Abramson would lead great class discussions that were always so interesting. I learned something every single class an have come out a much better journalist and writer for it.",
    "Yes, if you get in. But I really hope she changes that midterm assignment.",
    "Take it as an easy course if you want to be a Journalism Scholar--the ease of accessing summer funding is absolutely worth the dry class.The class is not a total waste--the assignments were great, but as with any student journalistic endeavor, you get out what you put in.",
    "The Journalism seminar is a great way to get a broad look at the recent history and possible future of the journalism industry. The course readings include some of the best articles written in recent years, as well as material on journalistic ethics, business models, and new forms of media. The two big writing assignments are delightfully unstructured, allowing you to zoom in on what interests you most. Class discussions can become a bit unfocused, especially when we roam away from the assigned readings, but in general I really looked forward to the class every week. I took this class with very little prior journalism experience but a lot of interest in the field, and my interest has only grown. I highly recommend the class to both experienced and novice journalists.",
    "By no means as intense as Brill's version, but a lot of fun and quite interesting. You'll learn a lot about the New York Times."
