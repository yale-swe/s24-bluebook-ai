    "Best class I've taken at Yale. It has everything: light workload, interesting class lectures, rousing discussion sections, and great readings. I would recommend this class to anyone, even if just as a fifth class that isn't needed for any requirements.",
    "Eh. Really chill lecture. Wont change your life but a solid fourth or fifth class.",
    "Pretty much focuses on the major battles that have happened since 1500. Talks about the transition of military power over time, from different weapons to different \"fronts\" (land, naval, air). Also discusses some of the economic and political developments over the time period.",
    "Great class and must take for anyone who wants to get a breadth of overview about the time-frame. Prof. Kennedy is a boss and you got to take this class if he is still around in the years to come.",
    "Take this course as long as Professor Kennedy is still teaching. Valuable.",
    "This was a great course that I would highly recommend. The submitted coursework and evaluations are very manageable and supplemented with though provoking texts\/readings, including Paul Kennedy's own \"The Rise and Fall of Great Powers\" (great read). Insanely enough, I can confidently say I know the military history of the west since the 1500s almost like I do the alphabet. Most of the credit for this, however, rightfully belongs to professor and the teaching assistant.",
    "I took this class because I love history and need a humanities credit, but this class is not worth it. The readings are cool, but there are WAY too many of them every week. It's also supposed to be an intro history class, but the teaching staff never teach you how to make a good historical argument in essay form. The final is a lot of stress as well because the scale of the content is so vast. It's 500 years of history, and some of the ID's on the final are pretty specific. Luckily, you only have to pick 5 terms out of 10 to identify. In terms of work, the course is a LOT of reading every week. The midterm is one essay question (30% of your grade) that is arbitrarily graded based on your TF's whims. The Final(worth 60% of your grade) is two essays and 5 ID's. I really enjoyed some of the readings, though many of them were really long winded and complex (Max Boot's \"War Made New\" is an incredible book that I heavily recommend though). Overall, unless the requirements\/specifications of the course are updated, I would not recommend. You're better off just buying some of the books that are interesting to you and reading them on your own. Kennedy's a nice guy but his lectures are very disconnected from the course material that is actually tested. You're basically self-studying this whole course.",
    "Military History is a great course. Professor Kennedy's lectures are very interesting and made me look forward to attending class. This course has the reputation of being a gut. This is true in that there is very little work required (only a midterm, final, and weekly section attendance). That being said, this does not mean that it is easy to get an A. On the contrary, I think that it is very hard to do so without doing the readings and spending a lot of time thinking about the \"big ideas\" of the course. If you are interested in the subject, then definitely take it. If you want a GPA-booster, look elsewhere.",
    "Obviously take it for the Legend known as Prof. Kennedy. Actually though, go to lecture, you will enjoy it, the man has some crazy interesting stories. Good luck with the readings though, you have no chance of doing all of them.",
    "Military History of the West is an incredible and complex course, tying together economic, technological, militaristic, and political developments over five centuries into a beautiful narrative of history. This is by far the best class I have taken at Yale college.",
    "A pretty good Yale course that's a little dull at times. Kennedy is sweet and a decent lecturer, but there's really not a ton that you learn. The class is way too focused on air and sea power (for the ROTC kids), and the classes should be split up. Not the worst course I've taken at Yale, but not the best one either.",
    "Chill. Very chill.",
    "Amazing 5th class that is super interesting and required NO work besides going to the lectures and section. I did none of the readings, had no prior knowledge of European history whatsoever, and I still learned a ton and did well. No papers or homework, just a midterm and a final.",
    "Paul Kennedy is an amazing lecturer, and the fact that he is a world renowned historian is just the cherry on top. Section was very well organized, and I feel like I have a very good grasp on not only military history, but also economic history. I took this class to fulfill a humanities requirement, but ow I think I will continue to take history classes at Yale just because of how much I enjoyed this class.",
    "Great fifth class. It's not a gut if you do the reading, but it's still not an especially difficult class. The material's interesting if you have any interest in military history, and going to lecture doesn't feel like work. One midterm and one final, no other assignments. Very manageable workload.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone.",
    "If you like military history or world history, take this class. If you're looking for a gut or at least a class that has no work, also take this class. Though it doesn't focus as much on wars and battles as one might like, it is still an interesting overview of war in the west since 1500, and gets really interesting at the end when you talk about Vietnam, Iraq (Gulf War and 2003), and Afghanistan. The class only requires a midterm and a final - I didn't even buy the books and I was fine. Overall, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone, regardless of major, as Professor Kennedy is a true scholar and great teacher. Also, the material was interesting and provided a new framework for me to think about the history of warfare.",
    "A fascinating course on an important subject, with an emphasis on the roles of economics and technology in war. The workload is light: midterm, final, section attendance, and readings. Prof. Kennedy is an engaging lecturer, and there are several great guest lecturers as well. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, take it!! It's a comprehensive history of Military Rise in the West, covering technology, finance, and the wars. The guest lectures were fantastic, and Prof. Kennedy is fine. The readings can be a lot, but you don't have to do them all. The midterm is fairly easy, the final is harder however since it covers more than half the semester and counts for 60%.",
    "Please do not take this class. Lecture teaches nothing. It is about nothing yet everything. Just don't do it. Please.",
    "Try to put effort into the course and it will actually be quite interesting. There are a lot of people in this course who put the minimal work in, but they're missing out on an interesting topic. Take the course because you want to take it. Study hard for the final; we had a few absurd IDs. Overall the class is very fair and interesting. Even Kennedy's rambles and tangents are fascinating at times.",
    "I mean, this is such a classic class, you must have heard of it. It's the only chance you may ever have to actually study military history. I recommend the readings as genuinely interesting, and a better way to learn material than lecture. Lecture is more of a framework for what is going on, which readings provide details for. I would recommend this class as a good way to understand the importance of military power in the modern world, something which most modern Yale students totally lack.",
    "N\/A",
    "It's an easy class if you don't do the reading, but you get nothing out of it if you don't do the reading. Take this if you are interested in the material and will read, not if you want your ideas to be challenged or if you want a new understanding of history. It is basically AP Euro.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material was fascinating, the lectures were engaging, and the TAs were great. In addition, the workload was relatively manageable. The readings were a bit heavy but interesting and there is only one midterm and a final. While the class can seem too broad in scope, professor Kennedy does a great job weaving together a compelling narative of military history and explaining key themes throughout history. If you are looking for a detailed analysis of military tactics or of specific events, this class probably isn't for you. But if you are looking for broad themes that have influenced militaries and wars over time, or if you have relatively little history knowledge and would like a broader survey of history, this is a fantastic class.",
    "An excellent class that provides an overview of western european history through the lens of warfare",
    "Decent survey course with little required work. PK is pretty funny, as he constantly refers to himself in the third person. Is it the most insightful course? Probably not. But if you aren't a history major this is a decent class to take in the history department.",
    "Take this course if you are only interested in reading about history and wars.",
    "Totally recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, not too much work and a very good overview of history since 1500. The final is a huge percentage of the grade, and can be difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is ok with understand big themes and having specific examples to back up your points. It got a lot more interesting in the WWII era but overall it is a good class.",
    "The material is fascinating, but this is decidedly a history gut; do a few readings and you'll be okay. Showing up to class is largely unnecessary. There's no homework, and the midterm was a joke. The final was slightly more difficult because of term identification, but the essay questions were vague enough that it was still not bad.",
    "A very broad overview of military history since 1500 (economics, technology, strategy etc.). You can either enjoy this or not, since the timeline for the class is huge. This can either overwhelm you or make it easier to write on specific things you found interesting in the course for the in class essay questions.",
    "The readings were interesting, but the lectures were meandering. If you've taken AP Euro or a similar course, you just won't learn much new information from the lectures. Even if you've only taken AP US history, you will probably know all the material from WWI on. Profesor Kennedy is a brilliant academic, but his lectures don't always have focus or direction. He asks a lot of rhetorical questions and makes obvious points again and again. If you do all the readings (God knows I didn't) this course could be time-consuming and rewarding. Otherwise it's a semi-interesting gut, so only take it if that's what you're looking for.",
    "A cool class, with somewhat interesting lectures, and too much reading. Take if you have an interest in the subject, and maybe as a easier credit. I would not describe this as an easy course if you want to master the material, but it's possible to do well on exams by understanding general trends. The level of understanding required for the exams is far below what I would consider mastery of the material. Some readings are greatdefinitely do most of the Boot ones. Others are quite boring.",
    "Decent. Readings are usually pointless, which sucks because they're so interesting. Kennedy has a definite command of the subject, though, and his lectures are what make the class worth taking.",
    "Not necessarily a gut history. Readings are extremely long, but you can get away with doing very little and still getting a good section grade. Mid term and final are both fair and straightforward. Professor Kennedy is very renowned but can get a bit boring, and skipping class is very common among students. With all this being said, if you're interested in the topic, take the course. You will enjoy the material and the workload is far from overbearing",
    "It's a good class with interesting material about how the military has changed since 1500. I would recommend it, but maybe with the Credit\/D\/Fail option, since so much of the grade is dependent on just two exams.",
    "Yes, I would. Fairly easy course with material that covered a lot of history from the military perspective.",
    "I would summarize this class as a very interesting introduction into western military history. If you do the readings and go to lecture, it will be one of the most interesting classes you take all semester.",
    "General survey of military history of Western Europe and the United States since 1500. It is quite interesting, but at times you will feel as though lecture is useless. Definitely go to section if you want to get the most you can out of this class. The reading is not necessary, but it is very useful if you are genuinely interested in the material.",
    "Would not recommend.",
    "Perfect for interest in the war and society major",
    "Good class and interesting lectures.",
    "Yes. Every Yale student should not only want to take this class, but should be required to. This knowledge is very critical for understanding the current state of world affairs in the modern era.",
    "Solid class, especially if you do the readings. Take it with Max Walden as your TA if possible.",
    "Probably won't learn a ton, but it'll give you some basic historical knowledge.",
    "Absolutely! Hope Kennedy continues to teach this class!",
    "If one was very interested in the progression of warfare, both American or those involving world forces, I would highly recommend they take this course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in getting a deeper understanding of military conflicts. I think that it is a good survey course for this subject, however it can get repetitive for people who have already read about WWI\/WWII history.",
    "A broad overview of 500 years of military history that focuses on the development of military hegemonic powers as being attributed to a culmination of economic, political, technological, political, geographic factors. You will learn a lot about Great Britain as Kennedy is British, but it is an inspiring course that is worth taking! Fun! It is worth it to attend lecture as Kennedy will share things with the class that you won't find any where else. A midterm, a final and some reading. Good course.",
    "Overall a very good class, however the importance of teaching assistants is too great"
