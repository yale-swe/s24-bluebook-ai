    "RUSS 120 is great! If you want to continue down the path of this interesting language and culture than this is the class for you. You've got new cases, modal words, and verbs of motion heading your way, but fear not! They will come far more easily than you will realize.",
    "Out of all of the languages I've heard about at Yale, I think Russian ranks as the best to take.",
    "For anyone truly motivated to learn the Russian language, I would highly recommend RUSS 120 (as a continuation of RUSS 110). Obviously this language is more difficult for the native English speaker to pick up than Spanish or French, nevertheless, the curriculum was well suited to the complexity of the language."
