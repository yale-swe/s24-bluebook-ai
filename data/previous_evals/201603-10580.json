    "I improved my Chinese skills to be able to express my thoughts in a professional manner, while gaining a better understanding of China in general.",
    "Learned how to converse on modern day relevant topics in Chinese.",
    "This course helped me to continue to improve my Chinese specifically more formal\/educated Chinese. The interesting topics were also thought provoking and generated great discussion in class.",
    "Because the class focused greatly on reading articles, by the end of the class I was able to get through an article much more quickly. Also, because we were able to choose our own vocab words, I was able to pick out the ones that were most useful\/important to me, which made me more inclined to learn them.",
    "Learning to read articles in Chinese and how to discuss them in conjunction to modern day themes.",
    "I became more comfortable with reading news articles and reading and writing in more formal style.",
    "Learned more formal written Chinese, and a lot about different contemporary issues in China.",
    "I learned how to conduct research in Chinese, read Chinese articles, and increase my fluency.",
    "Fast paced learning of journalistic Chinese",
    "Through this advanced Chinese language class, I enhanced my reading comprehension and oral presentation skills. By reading Chinese news articles every week, I improved my vocabulary skills while also learning about current issues and contemporary culture of China.",
    "I got a lot of good practice reading and discussing Chinese media sources and also learned about current Chinese social issues. We learned to elevate our writing to a more formal level and style, and also worked on making our writing sound pleasing to the ear in an authentic way."

   "comments": [
    "This course offers an opportunity to not only improve one's Chinese skills to a professional level but also understand various social, economic and political aspects of modern China. The array of topics discussed is interesting, but at times I hoped the course would be better organized with sufficient prior notice given for readings or assignments.",
    "Solid course for speaking and reading, not much emphasis on writing.",
    "Zhou Laoshi is a great professor. He really cares about helping the students learn and improve. I think that the material was engaging and made the course more enjoyable. An improvement I might suggest is limiting the number of oral presentations or reducing the length. I found my self wishing we had more time for discussion as the presentations for each unit took up a significant amount of time.",
    "It's a great course! I loved the daily discussions. However, I feel like we would have benefitted greatly from a smaller class size, so that everyone could have chance to speak. I really gained a lot from the bi-weekly presentations, which were a great way of getting everyone involved.",
    "There were a lot of articles which made it hard to fully read all of them for class each time. But the articles were very interesting!",
    "Professor Zhou picks very interesting readings. I think the structure of the course is excellent. I thought the class was simply too large meaning there wasn't as much opportunity to speak in class as I expected from a language class.",
    "The course was overall a good one. Zhou Laoshi is simply amazing. However I thought that the quality of discussion was very lacking and a bit subpar for an L5 elective in Chinese. The class felt more like a mini lecture sometimes than a seminar, which is personally more of what I hoped for.",
    "Strengths are that it encourages synthesis of material, the professor is great, and topics are very interesting. Weaknesses are that there is a lot of memorization and the class size is big so it is hard to talk that much.",
    "Positives -lots of breadth -discussed complex issues -grades were pretty fair Negatives -assignments were often released just days before due; no option to work ahead of schedule -the TF would just grade with a number and a single word comment; no reasons why or recommendations on what to improve -course load was very heavy to develop a deep understanding in such a short amount of time",
    "This is a perfect course for students learning to either advance their Chinese skills or maintain their skills. Zhou Laoshi is an excellent professor, and designs the course in a way that allows students to set and achieve personal goals. Strengths: you get to learn about extremely interesting Chinese cultural issues during each unit, you get to work with other students on oral presentations, you are given a bit of space to move at your own pace. Fantastic class and professor, overall.",
    "The strengths of this course are the depth of the material and the extent to which we improve our skills, particularly reading and writing. The many articles we read every day teach us to read efficiently and effectively, and the many angles we cover in the readings help us understand the topic in depth. We get broad exposure both to issues and to the language necessary to discuss them. It is effectively set up as an advanced course that really pushes students to improve both depth of knowledge and skill. The weakness of this course is the overwhelming work load, and I believe the major reason for this is the oral quizzes that we have to prepare for every morning (in which we first hand in a list of 10 self-selected vocab words and then, if called on, use those 10 words to give a short oral presentation about the reading). In theory it makes the course flexible for people to chose vocabulary relevant to them, but in practice the sheer amount of preparation involved needed to actually produce what is required is overwhelming, particularly because it is required for almost every single meeting of the course."

   "comments": [
    "This course will help improve one's Chinese skills to a professional level while understanding various social, economic and political aspects of modern China. It may not resemble other language courses with a strict curriculum since it is focused on learning Chinese through exposure to actual Chinese articles and news. Professor Zhou is very approachable and caring, and the topics discussed are very interesting.",
    "Would definitely recommend - Zhou LaoShi is a great teacher, very reasonable too.",
    "If you are looking to keep up your Chinese language skills and looking for a great professor this is the class for you!",
    "Yes! If you want to keep up your Chinese-level, then this is a great course to take. The topics that Zhou laoshi selects are all very interesting, and it's fun to be able to actually use your Chinese to engage in conversations about real-world issues.",
    "This class is pretty unstructured. Zhou Laoshi gives you 4 or 5 newspapers to read for every class, you discuss them in class, and then write essays and give oral reports. It's a lot of reading, but ultimately Zhou Laoshi wants for everyone to do well. If you need more structure, though, business Chinese may be a better fit.",
    "Yes, Zhou laoshi is very nice and the material you read is pretty fun. You get to talk a lot in class which helps you improve orally.",
    "Definitely take Zhou Laoshi's course. Prof. Zhou is a really fair instructor whose M.O. is take help students reach a higher level of Chinese.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. I really like the structure of this course; there is no textbook only assigned online articles written for a Chinese audience. There are no assigned vocab words, instead students get to pick 15 words per class to study. There are pretty frequent oral reports, but these are a good way to practice using new phrases and speaking in a formal style. While there is pretty consistent work, once you get in the groove you don't have to spend too much time on it if you don't want. I also learned more about Chinese society in this course than in any other language course.",
    "I recommend this course for someone who is looking to improve their formal\/academic Chinese skills. Generally, after this course you should be able to speak, write, listen to, and read the Chinese academic style. Your modes of communication become a bit more sophisticated. Yet compared to other courses like 150 and 151 you speak a lot less. Significantly less focus on grammatical drilling and memorization (neither a good or bad thing). But yeah, take it, try it out.",
    "I would recommend this is a great way to maintain Chinese fluency while learning about interesting topics.",
    "Recommend, but be prepared to work very hard.",
    "Yes, I would recommend to other students looking to maintain language skills. While you have to read a LOT of Chinese newspapers and prepare many oral presentations, Zhou Laoshi is amazing and very caring and considerate of senior students who may not have a lot of disposable time for outside language study. You get to move at your own pace and achieve personal goals. Plus, you get to learn about really interesting issues in contemporary Chinese culture while improving your language skills.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking to elevate both their reading and their writing skills. The class is also designed to give you good speaking practice (there is lots of time for discussion), though the level to which this is effective realistically depends on how filled (or overfilled) the course is. This course is definitely worth it content wise, but be aware that the work level is extremely intense and will crowd out all other classed you are taking if you want to do it well."
