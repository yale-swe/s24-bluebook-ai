    "I recommend taking this with Sebastian Diaz. He makes the class so much better. He cares about teaching and how well his students are doing. There is a lot of homework for this class, but it is doable. Not a bad class considering it is required.",
    "Sebastian is a great teacher. You wont find someone who cares more about their students. Overall, the curriculum is solid and not too difficult.",
    "Great course, mostly grammar orientated. Would recommend to students as an opportunity to improve their spanish foundation.",
    "Solid. I took it because I need it to graduate but it wasn't terrible.",
    "Sebastian is a great professor who really cares about his students. He keeps class entertaining. If you're taking Spanish 130, I'd recommend taking it with him.",
    "Sebastian Diaz is definitely a good prof for Spanish. He's really fun and clearly wants us to succeed in his course.",
    "Your Spanish skills will definitely improve!",
    "Spanish 130 04 was a worthwhile class to take. I would certainly recommend taking a class with Sebastian Diaz, who taught SPAN 130 04 this semester.The issues with L-3 are these:Most freshman entering Spanish classes at Yale are eitherin L-1 or L-5--that is, they either have never taken Spanish before or took Spanish all throughout high school and have reached a high level of proficiency. Freshmen in L-3 thus tend to be those kids who took Spanish throughout high school and were not very good at it. If you are proficient in Spanish, therefore, you may find yourself in a class of peers far behind you in your ability. This certainly boosts the ego, and some people thrive off of this kind of environment. However, class activities tend to involve conversation between pairs of students, and so you may find the conversation exercises rather unhelpful, as you peers will not challenge you to improve. Your Spanish may not improve significantly in L-3 for this reason.You tend to learn the same grammatical concepts that you already learned in L-1 and L-2.As with any language class, learning in L-3 tends to be passive. You come to class, sit down, and listen to the teacher speak in Spanish. The teacher rarely calls upon students to respond, and so you very infrequently are pushed to speak in Spanish and thereby learn actively. I never took Spanish in high school and jumped into L-3 after spending about six weeks immersing myself in Spanish. I anticipated learning so much more, but, because of the passive learning style, my Spanish improved negligibly.Nevertheless, you will learn a substantial amount of new vocabulary, and reviewing the grammar is always helpful. And of course, you need to take L-3 to advance to the higher-level classes, and so I would still recommend Spanish students to take it."
