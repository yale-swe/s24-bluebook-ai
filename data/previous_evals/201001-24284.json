    "it's a super easy class with a low workload. if you're interested in the subject and are looking for an extra 5th class, then for sure take it. you won't get a terrible amount out of it though from the class itself but you will from the outside class component.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. It is a meaningful experience and a very interesting course.",
    "It is an overview of autism spectrum disorders and consists of a lecture once a week (1.5 hours) and a placement at a school or center for autistic adults or children for 3 hours a week. The workload isn't bad at all and it's very interesting. My placement at Benhaven school was particularly eye-opening- I really loved getting to know the teachers and the students (as much as you can get to know very low-functioning non-verbal autistic kids) in my class and learned a lot from them. Each lecture has a different guest speaker, which adds a lot of interesting perspectives, but also makes it sometimes repetitive.",
    "if you're interested in learning about autism in depth, definitely yes. We don't learn too much about \"related disorders.\"",
    "Absolutely. Little work. Awesome experiences in the practical.",
    "This is a great primer on ASD and other developmental disorders, as it covers all the bases, from genetic to legal questions and consequences of the disorder. More of a seminar-like atmosphere would be appreciated.",
    "This course is NOT a seminar, and because most of the classes are guest lectures, it can feel disjointed at times. However, Drs. Volkmar and Klin are the best in the field of autism, so if you can get into the class, it really is an awesome opportunity.",
    "This class is meant to help explain autism both as a biological\/psychological condition and a social reality. I would recommend it to any student interested in autism.",
    "The class isn't very difficult, but you will get out of it what you put into it. I took the easy way out and simply did observations for my tutorial, which were still interesting, but I feel my friends that went to the schools had a better and more eye opening experience. The reading is unnecessary and class is as well as much of the material covered you won't be tested on and will not be related to your paper. The class time isn't the best and because lectures were often boring I often was asleep. Again, you should take this class for the exposure to the world of autism through the tutorial instead of the lectures.",
    "It's okay. I know a lot of people skipped lectures because they got really dry and repetitive. With new guest lecturers every week, there is alot of overlap with the material. The field placements are pretty enjoyable though. The teachers and mentors you work with are awesome. It is hard to actually interact with the students because many of them are low-functioning, but it is really beneficial to observe their behaviors in person. It is really helpful if you have a car too. There is no work until the last paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in gaining a first-hand experience and a very in depth background of developmental disorders.",
    "take it if you can get in. Relatively little work, great materials covered, and good professor.",
    "Yes, if just for the placement. don't expect a seminar though, it is more like a small lecture.",
    "This is a really disjointed class. The lectures are good, but have a lot of repeated material, and I literally didn't realize there was reading until after the class was over. You don't have to go to class, most of your grade is one paper, and it feels like a bit of a gut. Volkmar says it himself--it's all about the placement.Placements vary a lot. For me and others at Chapel Haven, there was a lot of freedom, which sometimes was good because I could ask students there about how they saw the world--it was like an independent study. But other times, it felt like lack of direction, and I had no idea what was expected of me.This left a lot to be desired, especially considering how hard it is to get in."
