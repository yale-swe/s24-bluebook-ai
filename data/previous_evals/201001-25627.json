    "Dr. Gregoire is a spectacular professor - he went above and beyond to make the course material both useful and accessible to students. This was a great course - among the most practical of any I've taken at F&ES. I learned dozens of skills that I will be able to use directly in analysis of data from my own research.However, regarding 7c: I really can't say whether Christian was a good TA or not considering I never met him. He was out of the country for the ENTIRE SEMESTER. I realize PhD students need to TA courses to gain teaching experience, but this was truly ridiculous. The only contact I had with him was by email, when I sent him my homework assignments to be graded. I received little to no feedback on my performance when he emailed us back our grades, sometimes a month after we had turned in the assignments.If I wanted to get my graduate degree through a distance learning program, I would have signed up somewhere online. I am at Yale (and paying a lot of money) to learn in a real classroom.",

    "Professor Gregoire is a wonderful instructor and really knows the field. I enjoy taking his classes and learn a lot from him.",
    "The Professor's mastery of the subject. That gives you confidence in what you are learning in class.",

    "They were both very available and flexible. Ready to meet you anytime to you suggest.",
    "It is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE for a TA for a course like this one at a university like Yale to be located in another country and inaccessible to the students. Prof. Gregoire made himself available for help very freely, but as a student it is sometimes easier to ask for help from a teaching assistant--in office hours, review sessions, etc--and that's what a TA is for, not just to grade homework.Feedback from the TA on homework assignments was limited to a numerical score and one or two words like \"good job\". The TA did not respond to email requests for help. The idea of communicating by Skype for help is ludicrous--this is a topic that necessitates give and take between student and instructors, including the TA, and both student and TA must be looking at the same lines of code on the same screen for this to be effective.When I speak to prospective students interested in this subject, I have to advise them about this deficiency. For what FES costs to attend, we deserve a real TA.",
