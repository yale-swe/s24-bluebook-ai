    "Incredible course gives a great perspective of what is going on in the world. One of my favorite classes I have taken.",
    "Learned about developments in technology and how they affect international relationships between countries",
    "Read the syllabus and it's pretty accurate",
    "How business, technology, and strategy come together with a focus on the context of war. This course is not about military technologies per se, but rather about how companies and governments think about technology and its place in business and war.",
    "Lots of knowledge about current technology, AI, and Nuclear Weapons as well as Nuclear Policy. I learned the histories of military technology and it's development in the US, some management practices on how to implement change and be successful. I also learned a lot about the cold war. Everything was fascinating."

   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses, class was excellent",
    "Strengths - interesting material, engaging lecturer, mostly good readings Weaknesses - some points became repetitive, the course could use more assignments\/group work\/opportunities for feedback",
    "Professor Bracken shares a lot of interesting insights, and I feel like I have a better understanding of the topic, but the class feels rather unstructured and kinda like whatever Bracken wanted to talk about that day.",
    "This course is really great, the best course I've ever taken. Professor Bracken is great, each lecture is fascinating and seems like really helpful information to learn for my future career as an Air Force officer. Professor Bracken has lots of experience working in the US defense world and has lots of things to share that you can't get from any other professor at Yale. Aside from the technologies and their histories this course also teaches about the history of many conflicts the US has been engaged in during the cold war, why and how the leaders made the decisions they did, and what the technology has to do with it. Some of the things taught in this course are mind-blowing. I struggle to find true weaknesses in the course, but one thing does stand out. Many of the readings are very dry, and long. You might have a (rare) night where you're expected to read over 100 pages of pdf's that you simply can't focus on or absorb information from. In lecture, if Prof. Bracken mentions the reading, then he will quickly explain the key takeaways and importance, but as a student with no experience in this subject, I couldn't find this on my own. Other readings were manageable and I liked the inclusion of news articles and videos."

    "Absolutely, if you have any interest in international relations or just to understand basic strategy this is an incredible course that I looked forward to going to every day. Professor Bracken is a great lecturer and has such a fascinating perspective.",
    "Yes, very interesting and relevant topics to the political issues of today",
    "If you're interested then take it - just understand that there aren't many graded assignments so unless you're super confident for the tests you may wanna credit-d this one",
    "If you're interested in learning how to lead organizations through technological changes, this class is helpful.",
    "This was by far my favorite course I have ever taken. I looked forward to going to class every day. Out of the 4 semesters I've been at yale this might be the only class I have truly enjoyed and I wish it lasted longer\/I could take it again. Professor Bracken is super knowledgeable and his lectures are never boring. He talks about both current events relating to the course that happen as the class progresses but also talks about historical examples from WW2 onward. Some of the information he talks about you can't find anywhere else, due to his vast experience working in the defense world. The only downside to the class is that some of the readings are very long and very dry as they are reports from government and contracting agencies as well as business school readings which seem to be thrown in to satisfy the constraints that this is a business school class. Some of the other readings are watching videos and movies, all of which are great. All of the management practices he talks about are applicable to both the military and civilian leadership, two groups that often complement each other nicely in this course. Many of those in the class are former, current, or future military so there is definitely more bias to that field. For me, that was perfect, but If you don't like the military or war, I would avoid this class. Overall, I can't recommend this class enough. It's amazing and I have learned more valuable information that I will retain than perhaps all my other classes combined. Go to lecture (Why would you not want to?) and do the readings or else you will have a hard time on the exams but take this class, you won't regret it."
