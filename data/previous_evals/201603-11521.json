   "comments": [
    "The class definitely gave me more constitutional law knowledge than I had before. It taught me to read case law and understand verdicts by the Supreme Court.",
    "I learned plenty about major issues in constitutional law in the U.S. and in the other G-20 constitutional democracies, but really did not receive much guidance in thinking about the law in a systematic or rigorous way.",
    "Skimming a lot of text very quickly.",
    "Through this course, I developed skills in reading some legal court cases but mostly articles about law.",
    "This class was a great introduction to \"law school thinking.\" Class discussion relied on one's understanding of the reading and the case law for the week. You really learn to think creatively and to form your own opinions on topics that some would say are pretty straight forward.",
    "I learned how to analyze the Constitution and compare the different legal systems around the world.",
    "Wish I had taken intro to constitutional law before this class that would have made it much easier to participate in class discussions and engage with the reading materials.",
    "Developed a great survey knowledge of constitutional law in a comparative context.",
    "I feel that I was better able to formulate arguments and analyze cases.",
    "It gave me a good foundation and introduction to comparative constitutional law.",
    "Having to read a real law school case book was good practice.",
    "I developed an increasing awareness of how constitutions reflect the historical contexts that produced them. By looking at different constitutions simultaneously, we were able to see how different democracies grappled with the same issues, sometimes reaching similar results and sometimes very dissimilar results.",
    "I learned a great deal about the legal systems of other countries, something I found fascinating. I learned how to do comparative legal analysis-- looking at Constitutions and court decisions from a few countries and analyzing the similarities and differences. I got great insight into how other countries deal with the issues that the US is facing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Despite being comparative constitutional law the class focused mainly on the US cases and how the US rules and sees certain laws. As I was drawn to the comparative part of the course this was a little disappointing to me. Professor is clearly passionate about the topic so that makes the class discussions really interesting.",
    "Strengths: A broad scope and approach to major issues in constitutional law around the world; casebook is a fantastic resource. Weaknesses: The Scope is sometimes too broad to fit into class without feeling like the discussion skims only the surface of whatever we're learning about. Class size was a bit too big. Professor did not give much feedback on work unless asked.",
    "Comments on papers, even if they are brief, would help direct students.",
    "Strength: The knowledge to be learned is very interesting and broad, comparing so many countries at a time. Professor Calabresi gave some very helpful and mostly interesting background information at the beginning of every class.",
    "Great class! Strengths: Lively discussion, great professor who successfully moderates class discussion, interesting course material",
    "Discussion is sometimes between the same people, but overall the class is very interesting.",
    "no weaknesses to report. strengths: engaging readings, fun and edifying discussions. great essay topics. ticked all the right boxes.",
    "I think the only weakness of this class was that Professor Calabresi would summarize the cases before we would talk about them. This meant that people could do the readings and still participate in discussion. A summary was repetitive for those of us who actually did the reading and this summary time could have been devoted to discussion!",
    "Professor Calabresi is very patient and understanding. The casebook we were learning from is very informative and well organized as well. However, I wish the seminar discussions were more question based rather than going through the chapter assigned for that week.",
    "Con law with amar is better!",
    "The seminar was too large, and the professor did not know everyone's names. Perhaps if it were smaller, it would better facilitate discussion. In addition, he always called on the same people. I did learn a lot about constitutional law, but some of the cases selected were not the most interesting, to be honest. In terms of freedom of speech, there MUST be more interesting\/contentious cases out there than whether a bottle in Canada is erroneously labeled \"light beer\" or not. That the cases weren't interesting stymied debate. In addition, the professor provided no feedback on essays--the letter grades were not accompanied by any comments, which was irritating.",
    "I believe the greatest strength of the course lies in the breadth of material it covers. Professor Calabresi's textbook is organized by topic so that each chapter offers a survey of different court cases and statutes in several countries that are relevant to the topic at hand. Thus, by the time the student reaches class he or she has a rough understanding of an expansive amount of material that is refined in seminar through engaging with other students as well as by Professor Calabresi's own remarks.",
    "The readings were well-organized and always interesting, and discussion was always a blast. Prof. Calabresi is a great discussion leader!",
    "I loved how this course strengthened my understanding of our own constitutional government by comparing it to those of Germany, the UK, and other G20 countries. Where this course could be improved, however, is its feedback. Professor Calabresi often just graded our papers without making any edits or comments. I think even just a few words would go a long way in helping us write and think more concisely.",
    "Strengths: The course is very well structured-- nothing is ever a surprise. The material, in my opinion, is all incredibly fascinating and extremely relevant. The workload is also very manageable. Professor Calabresi is a great seminar leader-- he will start and focus discussion, but regularly calls (sometimes cold calls) on us. Debate was some of the best and most productive I have ever had in a seminar. Weaknesses: I wish there had been more readily available feedback on the papers."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Take if you're interested in constitutional law, as opposed to just law in general. The class will give you really interesting class discussions, probably more if you really engage with the readings. Workload is light, two 5 page papers and a 10 page papers, although Prof Calabresi doesn't give any feedback on your papers unless you seek him out.",
    "This is a fantastic seminar. The chance to learn from Calabresi is one that you cannot pass up. The papers are very thought-provoking, although a bit difficult because they ask you to answer enormous state-building questions in a very small space. Overall, Calabresi is the best seminar leader I have had at Yale, and this class attracts very dedicated and engaged students.",
    "I probably would not recommend this course to another student. Although the knowledge is interesting, it's not framed well in the class. Each class is mostly the professor lecturing for 20 minutes and then slowly moving from topic to topic very methodically and in a pre-determined fashion. It lacked the flexibility in discussion that I expected from a political science seminar. The readings are about half opinion articles about law and half condensed court cases. So that was a bit disappointing for me. This semester, the class was also too large in my opinion so it was hard to have a real discussion.",
    "Yes! Take if you want an interesting perspective on constitutional law from a super engaging professor.",
    "Yes! Hearing from Professor Calabresi is very interesting.",
    "The readings (cases) are interesting, and you really learn a lot from Judicial Review to Bill of Rights. But the class discussions can be better facilitated. They involved a lot of hypothetical situations such as \"what would have happened...\" and comparison questions such as \"is A better than B...\" They are interesting for people who like to argue and express their political stands, but can be boring for people who want serious, analytical discussions.",
    "Professor has a dry sense of humor and the material is incredibly interesting if you like law classes. Professor Calabresi is obviously brilliant.",
    "I would not recommend this course if you are not a section asshole and do not already have an in-depth knowledge of the U.S. legal system.",
    "Whole-hearted yes.",
    "YES! This class was amazing. Also, Professor Calabresi is one of the few professors at Yale who is openly not a conventional Democrat or flaming liberal. This means that there are more than a few Buckley kids in the class, which is a huge plus. The class was great in terms of actual learning and from **different viewpoints**. Take the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in gaining a good basis in comparative constitutional law. I would also recommend it to a student invested in reading through the casebook as the casebook is very informative.",
    "A LOT of reading per week. He does a good job of summarizing it at the beginning of class, though, in case you start skimming some weeks. The seminar was too large, and the professor did not know everyone's names. Perhaps if it were smaller, it would better facilitate discussion. In addition, he always called on the same people. I did learn a lot about constitutional law, but some of the cases selected were not the most interesting, to be honest. In terms of freedom of speech, there MUST be more interesting\/contentious cases out there than whether a bottle in Canada is erroneously labeled \"light beer\" or not. That the cases weren't stimulating stymied debate. In addition, the professor provided no feedback on essays--the letter grades were not accompanied by any comments ever, which was irritating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is easy enough to lose oneself in the American democratic process (especially if one lives in the United States), which can lend itself to the belief that the American way is the only way (or at the very least that it represents the ideal democratic system) or to ignorance regarding how other democratic societies function. Yet Professor Calabresi's course challenges those assumptions, forcing students to better understand the strengths and weakness of different democratic states.",
    "Absolutely! This class is so fun--the readings are always interesting, and discussion sometimes gets a bit heated, which is the best. Professor Calabresi is really kind, and always willing to meet with students or answer questions over email, despite his busy schedule. I always looked forward to this class! It's a lot to handle at 9:25, but definitely worth it.",
    "Definitely take this class if you get in. This course helped me understand our constitutional government by comparing it to those of Germany, the UK, and other G20 countries. The readings are very interesting, even if you skim through them. The assignments are also very doable just two 5-page papers and a final 10-pager. Calabresi is a great teacher and wasn't a hard grader at all. A win-win all around.",
    "Definitely-- Professor Calabresi is a great seminar leader. The material is incredibly relevant and fascinating. The class increased my understanding of many problems facing the United States in that I saw how other countries had responded or are responding to similar issues. I would recommend having some sort of Con law background-- as I found it very helpful, especially when writing the papers-- but in no way necessary. Debates in class went very well, I felt, with plenty of actual disagreement and solid argument. I found my opinions on certain large issues pretty significantly changed."
