   "comments": [
    "The course provided a really interesting look at violence and intrastate violence in particular. It definitely challenged some of my previously held notions that were based on the way conflict is portrayed in the news.",
    "I appreciated that Prof. Kocher paid so much attention to methodology -- urging us to think about whether a researcher's methods actually stood up to scrutiny. This is so important in political science. The class was also very accessible for novices to the discipline of interstate war.",
    "This class exposed me to a great selection of political science literature that analyzed violence in its various forms and contexts. The course definitely improved my knowledge of the subject and my analytical skills.",
    "I learned a lot about how violence and security work in society and theory. I gained the ability and experience of working in a high level seminar. I got a lot of practical experience for political science and global affairs, especially on the security track.",
    "I learned ideas on patterns of conflict that I hadn't been exposed to in other courses. This course helped clarify methodology and challenges of performing experiments in the social sciences.",
    "The readings and discussion linked extremely well with my academic work in past years and in other courses this semester, and I now feel I have a very solid foundation in conflict studies, focusing on several regions and current issues."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The seminar format allows for great discussion and lets us cover topics beyond just the specifics of the readings.",
    "A big strength was the care the professor took to ensure that we would learn about interstate war in all sorts of contexts -- recent and distant past, on almost every continent. I also think that discussion was facilitated well.",
    "Tackling a broad concept like \"violence\" has the potential to be broad and unfocused, but this course was extremely well structured. I really enjoyed the seminar style class, Professor Kocher guided discussion and always added his own knowledge and expertise, but did a great job of not lecturing and preserving a really positive group discussion.",
    "The strength are the discussions which were always super engaging and pertinent. Also, the texts were often good supplements, but I think the texts were sometimes a weakness as well. Sometimes it felt like we went way beyond the text, and thus the text was a bit unfocused. I also enjoyed the graduate student perspectives in the course.",
    "Strength: Great pairings of readings that contrast and interact with each other. Good leadership by Prof. Kocher in facilitating discussion. Weakness: Sometimes the discussion focused on only one or two articles of a handful assigned. Perhaps assigning \"Primary\" and \"Secondary\" readings could assist a student to more thoroughly prepare for discussion."

   "comments": [
    "I believe Professor Kocher is leaving, but if you can take the class sometime in the future, do it! I learned a lot about a part of political science that I was unfamiliar with -- the class was very accessible to novices. It's a mix of undergrads and graduate students, which I think was nice overall. It was cool to hear about their past experiences in the military, the Peace Corps, etc. Kocher was good at running discussion and making sure to get back on track when it veered into tangents. He was also good at making sure people who hadn't spoken yet got a chance. The assignments are low key -- just 3 reading responses plus a final paper. The scope of the class is also broad - we read papers on conflict in everywhere from Vietnam to Algeria to South Africa to the U.S. during totally different time periods. I really liked this aspect.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! It provided an ample overview of the concept of \"violence\" and the various forms it takes - civil war, insurgency, mass killing, genocide, torture, rape, and much more. Professor Kocher is a very knowledgable and passionate instructor and contributed to a relaxed but engaging classroom environment.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to students with interest in the global security and poli sci areas of interest. You have super intelligent discussions on the touchstones of the violence literature and theory. It's important stuff to know.",
    "This class is very theoretical--- while you do focus on specific instances of violence the emphasis is on the theory.",
    "An excellent theoretical introduction to why rebellions and insurgencies occur, why they're successful or not, and how states choose to respond. Discussion very much grounded the topic in different and wide-ranging case studies. Would highly recommend."
