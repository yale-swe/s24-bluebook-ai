   "comments": [
    "Art of the Printed Word is a once in a lifetime opportunity. The chance to learn a real, hands-on craft skill that is charged with such historical significance is fulfilling and fun. It is completely different from any other class available at Yale. The focus is on the craft of printing itself, rather than typography or typographical design, so be prepared for nights setting type and printing. Being able to hold and admire the work that you produce in the class, especially the handmade book, is the best part. Professor Rose makes the learning process clear and manageable.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this class, please do. This is a fantastic course. It's a guide to printing at Yale. Professor Rose is absolutely wonderful. I had no background in art or design or printing prior to this class, and yes, you will feel a bit inadequate given the enormous talent of your peers. That said, it's an absolutely amazing class and one unlike any other at Yale. Printing, and especially printing at Yale, has an incredibly rich tradition, and you'll be grateful to be a small part of it. As far as workload---I mean, it can be rough at times, but it's so worth it.",
    "If you can get in, take it!! A wonderful class, very unique. When else will you have a chance to print and bind a book!? And it showcase's Yale's old\/rare\/art book collection very well. I actually paged through a 2nd edition copy of the Canterbury Tales! The final takes A LOT of time (and the other projects take quite a bit as well), but it's generally very fun and interesting work. If you're willing to put time in on the project, it is ten thousand times worth it.",
    "I would definitely, without a doubt, recommend this class to any student. The workload is what you make of it. Yes, printing can be time-consuming, and I spend many many days of the week working until midnight in the press, but others can get by with less time in the press.",
    "If you get the chance, and you are at all interested in printing presses or typography, take this course. Although sometimes you will have to put in a lot of time on printing projects, you will feel like you are having fun rather than doing work. Professor Rose is kind and helpful. I loved this course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! All of the projects (especially the book) will end up taking more time than you expect, but it is still worth it. Professor Rose is great and you will learn so much from him about printing. Using the printing press is a lot of fun!",
    "Fabulous. Great balance between viewing manuscripts\/artist's books\/broadsides (posters) and working in the press itself. Very hands-on class--you can definitely skip the readings if you so choose, but you will be spending a lot of time in the press in short bursts once a month (and you will like it! and hate it. and love it!).",
    "This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale so far. The class was very straightforward but definitely not a cakewalk since you literally spend days in the pressroom to make sure you produce quality works. You make a coaster, a broadside, and, as a final project, a book. Personally, I think we could have either skipped the broadside or spent a majority of the semester working on the book because with finals in other classes, printing a book is actually a large task.Professor Rose was so helpful and so thoughtful at every step of every project. He seemed to really care about how we did and how our projects were coming along, and understood the pressures and difficulties we were going through. The beginning was a bit of a shock since he kind of just had us start on our own with typesetting and printing (like throwing us in the pool when we were just starting to learn how to swim), but I think this was the best strategy since we really did learn a lot in a very short amount of time.If you can get in (and it will be difficult because of the high demand for the class), I would say absolutely take it. The workload (although a lot) is nothing like midterms or papers (although you do write one 4-6 page paper) so it is almost therapeutic to spend so much time in the pressroom. You do befriend those in the class because of a shared interest in the class (and shared time). Again, take it, take it, take it!",
    "This is a wonderful class. Letterpress printing is as much about the process as it is the product. As our world is increasingly digitized, this class places you firmly back in the tangible world as you struggle to make your artistic vision into reality. Letterpress printing is an exciting mix of design and technical skill. Unlike many other classes at Yale, you get to think with your mind and your hands. The class will also bring you into contact with printed works in Yale's collections that you might not otherwise get to see, such as its collection of artists' books and medical historical texts. While letterpress printing takes a great deal of time and effort, I enjoyed every second of it so it never felt like work.",
    "SO FUN. But also SO MUCH WORK. This class is really fantastic for someone who is interested in using their brain in a completely different way than most academic courses require. This class has one 4-6 page paper that is really not difficult to write. Otherwise it is completely devoted to printing on letterpress printing presses. You learn how to operate presses and then use them to create three projects--in our case, a coaster, a broadside (poster with a poem on it) and a BOOK. You handset type, design your own layout, and really create your projects from the ground up, from paper to typeface (font) to ink, etc. It can be very tedious work sometimes, especially if you choose to typeset a large block of text, and printing can be very frustrating because of all the things that need to line up or come out just right. It's the best and worst course for a perfectionist because you will come out with great stuff but probably drive yourself crazy in the process. All that being said, I LOVED this class. And you do not need to have ANY SKILL in the visual arts, drawing, etc in order to do it (tracing is the best!). As a person who usually doesn't do visual art and really can't draw, it was SO COOL to come out of the course with 6 ACTUAL BOOKS that I had MADE MYSELF--printed and bound. You get out of this course what you put into it. It's A LOT OF TIME. SO MUCH TIME. REALLY. EVERYTHING TAKES LONGER THAN YOU THINK IT WILL. But I thought it was worth it. I really loved it and would totally recommend it to someone else who is interested in doing something pretty much just for fun with a tangible awesome thing to take home.",
    "This is an amazing opportunity to see a little sliver of Yale's resources in art books and get a taste for printing yourself! You will find yourself overwhelmed with possibilities...in a good way! The work is definitely time-consuming but a totally different kind than other classes and that makes what could be tedious fresh and exciting."
