   "comments": [
    "Definitely take the class if you can. You'll get to study the Soviet Union and its transformation from a very different perspective, and Professor Rogers is great. Not too much work, and all of it is well worth it.",
    "Take this class. It's my first antho class and it changed the way I look at Russia and the world.",
    "ANTH 209 changed everything I thought about postsocialist Eurasia, especially postsocialist Russia. The course itself contains a lot of reading that is difficult to tackle for a first course in anthropology, but the concepts become more fluid as the semester progresses and connections become apparent. Overall, I would recommend the course but caution a student who has never taken a course in anthropology. A general introductory course would serve well for understanding anthropology and the issues generally associated with sociocultural anthropological thought.",
    "If you are interested in anthropology or the subject, I definitely recommend it. The lectures are awesome and you see Eurasia is a different light.",
    "It's a fascinating part of the world, and Doug Rogers is a lot of fun to listen to. He did fieldwork in rural Russia and has a lot of cool stories. You learn a lot in this class not about Eurasia AFTER the Soviet Union necessarily (though that is the second half of the course) but about what living under socialism was like, which is really informative for people (Americans\/Westerners) who typically have no idea.",
    "YES YES YES TAKE THIS COURSE. amazing class. Makes you look at the world in a new way.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. Prof. Rogers is a great lecturer. The course material is interesting. I had not taken an anthropology class before this course. Prof. Rogers does a good job of choosing course readings that allowed me to gain a anthropological perspective of Eurasia after the Soviet Union."
