   "comments": [
    "Strengths: This is a course taught by real experts. Both two professors have really really deep insights into the materials and topics. I learned not only the knowledge but also the general way to model and solve a problem. Weakness: We did not have problem sets in the first half. Also maybe we can replace the problem sets with a term paper.",
    "there is no TA. hard to ask questions when professor is not around.",
    "It gives detailed description on how models have been set up and the implications of the model which really help me understand the reletively complicated models and learn how to use it. My suggestion is that we should get more practice opportunity throughout the whole course to strengthen our understanding,",
    "The lecture notes are very detailed and the instructors are very engaged in teaching. But the course seems to aim to convey more than a single semester can do. There are some gaps in different parts. It would be better if it could be slower."

    "yes",
    "Yes. The course is very good.",
