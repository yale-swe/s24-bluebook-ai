    "This is one of the few classes in FES that offers an international perspective on issues. It provides an insight into how the social, cultural and political context of a country shares its legal system which have major influence on how environmental issues are being handled. Extremely valuable for students interested in environmental policy."

    "As mentioned above, the fact that it was condensed into two weeks did not lend itself to maximum learning ability and information retention. I was often not able to do all of the readings for the following day.",
    "If the class can be spread over a longer period, it would provide us the opportunity to have more informed discussion. Perhaps over 6 weeks instead of 2 weeks if timing is an issue and Prof Lye's could lecture over 2 or 3 of the 6 weeks or through tele-conferencing.",

Although the instructors are very good and very knowledgeable, the timing of having the class everyday for two weeks makes it difficult to really gain all the benefits from the course materials.",
    "It is 2 weeks of intensive classes and then a paper to finish throughout the rest of the semester. The lecturers will offer ample help with the help. If this clashes with your other classes, check with the lecturer if you can miss part of the lesson. A really great class!"
