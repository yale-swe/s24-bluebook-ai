    "All right.",
    "I would not recommend this class. Despite the fascinating subject matter and the chance to go and pick a topic interesting to you to do a fairly in-depth research paper, the class was still not a particularly pleasant or enlightening experience.",
    "Take it!",
    "Engaging, not too difficult (nor particularly rigorous), a good \"rest of world\" choice for history majors interested in medieval (broadly defined) European history.",
    "You will be reading primary sources to get a picture of what it was like to live in heavily religious societies. There is a lot of reading, and not all of it is thrilling, but overall my general sense of \"the big picture\" with regards to the three religions improved. If you've never written a 20-page paper, this is a good class to start with because Prof. Marcus is really encouraging and will help you every step of the way. The course goes thematically, so sometimes I felt like I got lost chronologically.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone genuinely interested in the subject material and prepared for a far larger focus on the generation of research then on stimulating class discussion. be warned that the research can be difficult simply because identifying source material for the subject can prove very time-consuming."
