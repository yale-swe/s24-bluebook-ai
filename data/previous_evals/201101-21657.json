   "comments": [
    "You will learn a lot about a very pertinent topic -- you will be much better informed about WWII than you were after taking your high school history class. Professor Maragkou is really knowledgeable, you should take advantage of her expertise by meeting with her outside of class to discuss your paper. The workload is very reasonable.",
    "Good Class",
    "Professor is boring. Class summary: Eastern Europe gets ramshafted + Nazis are mean.",
    "Pretty chill class. One short quiz, one film review, and a final 10pg paper. One can get away without doing most of the readings. the class can get very dry at times.",
    "A good survey course about the different occupations in WWII. Super easy, but not very interesting. If you already know a good deal about the war you will have no problem.",
    "Really fascinating class, probably the most detailed and nitty-gritty class on WWII that is offered. Teacher is very nice, is sometimes very dry, but the material keeps you interested. Assessment wise, very nice. reading ends up being mainly supplementary, not usually necessary. One research paper at the end, one short film review, and a test, which does require some studying because it's detailed. Overall, solid class and a must for those who want to learn directly about the details and battles and leaders of the war--not just the prelude and indirect effects that most classes teach.",
    "i woudl recomend this class if you want a good indepth survey of ww2 europe",
    "I'd recommend this course to students interested in WWII.",
    "Good class. Gives a different view on the war other than military actions.",
    "It is a solid course. Interesting material. Knowledgeable and kind professor. Course is structured well.",
    "It was a fantastic course. If you want to understand what lay behind Nazi lines, this is the right class.",
    "prof reads her lectures from a sheet of paper-- it's incredibly boring. best cr\/d class ever b\/c very minimal workload but attendance is necessary. interesting material as well if you like WWII",
    "I would recommend this class to another Yale student if they are looking for a good and simple history class. You will learn a lot about World War Two and the Holocaust, and Professor Maragkou is great. Her accent can be intimidating at the beginning, but she is incredibly smart and very personable. Class Participation, Quiz, Paper.",
    "I might not recommend it, simply because of its overly long lectures.",
    "No. I feel that there are better WWII classes one could take at yale.",
    "Yes, for all sorts of majors. The course does not have too many students and felt like a large seminar, although it was a lecture. The material is something students should know and the professor is fair and wonderful.",
    "This course was great.",
    "This is a class to take if you want a mostly easy class whose lectures won't necessarily be that interesting. The topic is definitely interesting, but you end up realizing that although every country's occupation was a bit different, the overall story of each was mostly the same every time.There is a good amount of reading, but you don't really need to do any of it. Lectures are terribly boring at times. The film review is a bit pointless in all honesty. Again, this is a relatively easy class. It is just very very boring at times.That being said, Konstantina is a cool person, and I liked her at least for that."
