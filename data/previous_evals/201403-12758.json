   "comments": [
    "Math 320 is the first semester graduate measure theory course. The experience will depend almost entirely on the instructor in terms of workload, rigor, topics covered, etc. If Stefan teaches again, the workload will be light and the topics covered will be many, in little depth. Stefan is nice, approachable, and a good instructor, but there's a lot of hand-waving in class.",
    "The quality of this class (like all math classes) depends completely on the instructor. It was very good with Steinerberger. I heard it was not so great with Garland.",
    "320 with Stefan should be renamed 'Analysis' or at least 'Measure Theory and Functional Analysis'. More than half of the semester is Functional Analysis, which I think was a good thing since there's a lot more material there and it's really interesting. You cover pretty much all of the theorems listed in the course description for the sequel function analysis class. With Stefan we had reasonable weekly psets and a reasonable final. He's very fun\/young\/energetic so class is always fun.",
    "Stefan is really engaging and fun! If you enjoyed 305, you should strongly consider taking this!",
    "It could probably best be summarized as a course on topics in and applications of measure theory. I would recommend it to someone who's taken 305 and\/or has a decent idea of what a measure is and wants to know what you can do with it other than just integration.",
    "An excellent class. Fundamentals of measure theory with an eye towards modern explorations.",
    "I would highly recommend taking measure theory with Stefan - it's a beautiful and fundamental subject, which Stefan makes intuitive and accessible. The homeworks were not extremely difficult, but often invovled some type of trick which was fun to figure out.",
    "I very much enjoyed Math 320. Measure theory---great, important topic with lots of cool results. Fun problems. I think it was especially good taking this class with Stefan; he definitely came at the material from his own perspective and interest, which made it really interesting."
