I also really loved her lecture the last time we met.Questions 13, 14 - - Just look the readings, I found the course overall excellent, but better in the first half than the second half.",
    "really this was an excellent class, in large part because the group, as stewarded by professor dove and sarah, just worked so well together. discussions were so much fun, and i felt like i learned and grew in this class as much as any i took while at yale. however though the class was excellent, there is room for improvement. first of all, the title being a bit of a misnomer is not a small problem. there is a lot more room to address disasters as real, current, material phenomena, and not just sort of circle around their historical or theoretical construction. as for dystopia, there could have been a significant amount more material and discussion of that concept. i felt it was largely ignored or that its perimeter was traversed, not its literary or intellectual terrain. the real focus of this class, instead, was degradation, indigenous vs. colonial mythologies, and, the reach of surveillance and biopower. all of those can be wrapped into a way of understanding future dystopias (or our current one), however, the class may have benefited from diving into literature that depicted or theorized it directly.",

    "- - Some of the readings on Linnaeus, some of the readings by Frake, and some of the readings by Dove could be replaced.- - I really liked how in Agrarian Societies, the lecture was certainly tied to the readings, and helped us think about them, but wasn't exactly ON the readings. Then, in discussion, we dealt with the readings themselves, with the lecture we'd just heard shedding some new light. I think a similar system would work well in this course. At times, it felt like the lectures repeated the readings, making points that we then would come back to yet again in the discussion. Either that, or the lecture would cover all the points we'd meant to discuss, leaving the discussions a bit wandering. This is by no means a a huge issue and probably only happened a few times, but I thought I'd offer thissuggestion of a slight structural change.",
