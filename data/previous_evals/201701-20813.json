    "How to develop one's academic work and to present it to your colleagues (who may or may not be specialists in your area) in a clear and concise way.",

   "comments": [
    "Maria was excellent and clearly had a \"big picture\" goal in mind. She gave good feedback to every student. Sometimes the assignment instructions weren't so relevant to me, though.",
    "I didn't always feel like the exercises we did for class were particularly constructive-- though I think they would have been helpful in the first semester. I would have preferred to have less structured assignments; they often felt like busywork that detracted from actually working on my thesis.",
    "It would be great if the assignments and class times were more focused around helping us make progress in our writing, rather than working on presentation. It seemed like a lot of the feedback we got was about our handouts or how we presented on the content, which wasn't terribly helpful since the contents were not usually what was actually going into my senior essay. The practice presentations at the end of the course were helpful for the actual department presentation, but more work on the actual writing process would have been much more helpful. I also wish we got more peer feedback in class, rather than just from the professor.",
    "The only thing I wish I had more of was time, but of course with a senior essay I'm sure that's always the problem. The weekly assignments were super helpful in getting me to address each of the moving parts of my project with care and attention.",
    "Main strength: this course did a good job of showing us how to structure academic work. Main weakness: Some of the assignments were time-consuming and took time away from working on my thesis when I really needed to be working on it. So perhaps add an alternative of \"Here's this week's assignment, but you may substitute some other relevant part of your thesis that you've done this week.\"",
    "Second half of the course was much better than the first in preparing for presentations and in terms of clearly presenting research. Wish this had been done first semester!",
    "I felt that the weekly assignments were not helpful. They added stress and distracted from work on the actual senior essay. I think it would be better to just give weekly progress updates and practice presenting, not write one to four page handouts."

    "Well... you have to take it lol. If Maria ever does teach this again, rest assured that she will be a good instructor.",
    "I mean you either have to take it or you can't so it's not super relevant.",
    "You don't have much of a choice, but I'd just advise linguistics seniors to set up regular meetings with their advisor as soon as you can. I found that the meetings with my advisor were where I made the most progress, and this class was more of a place to work on my presentation and keep up with what the other students were doing. The class was not bad and didn't add a lot of extra work, it just wasn't super helpful in getting my senior essay written and revised.",
    "It's a requirement, so that's not really a consideration if you've made it this far. That being said, writing the senior essay is what made my entire Yale career feel worth it, like I had been building up to something bigger, and going through this course and the project itself is what made me realize I wanted to go into academia, so yeah, do it with love and you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "'Tis an excellent course (and also, of course, a mandatory one). But it was definitely worthwhile--Prof. Piango has a lot of great thoughts about how to work productively in an academic setting, and I think that my thesis did turn out much better due to all the feedback of the other Linguistics Homies than it would have had I been laboring alone all semester. Also, it's just a lot of fun to get to hang out with all the linguists once a week! My one main criticism is that not all of the work we did contributed very directly to my thesis, so there were times that I felt like this course was kind of distracting from the thesis work I wanted to be doing; but in all cases that work was edifying in its own right (just not useful toward the task of thesis-writing), so all in all definitely a solid course. One other big positive point is that this course really teaches you to discuss your ideas in a way that any linguist (even one outside your subfield) can understand, and I found this very useful when I was interviewing at grad schools and having to explain my ideas to many professors who work in very different subfields--and rather than floundering in that setting, I was very comfortable because this class essentially constitutes explaining your ideas to the general linguist. Work-wise, it's not too much work (other than the thesis itself), but the weekly assignments are not negligible--each one does take a few hours at least. Enjoy this class, it's one of the big perks of the linguistics major that you get this class with your fellow majors!",
    "Required for major so yes if linguistics major not really useful if not writing a senior thesis"
