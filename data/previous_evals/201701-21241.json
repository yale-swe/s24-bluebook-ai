    "This course introduces you to the oil medium, which is incredibly complex, versatile, and historically important. This course primarily encourages you to paint different types of subjects: monochrome still lifes, color grids, 2D still lifes, various abstractions, and a final project of your choosing. While this course does not actually teach you painting techniques, it does familiarize you with the medium through practice.",
    "I was pushed as an artist to improve my technique and expand my creativity.",
    "This class does not focus on painting techniques - it is more of a theoretical approach to painting and art, so just be aware of that when you sign up. You will not get much specific instruction.",
    "I did not have any prior experience with art classes. Through this course I was able to familiarize myself with color relationships and by the end of the course I felt comfortable and confident in my ability to render still life.",
    "I learned how to paint from observation and just use the supplies -- I am excited to continue experimenting with the skills I have developed.",
    "Working with oil paint, thinking critically about composition, and considering more carefully content\/subject matter of a piece",
    "I learned about the materials used for painting. I got in the habit of painting. I started a bunch of projects that I want to continue. I set up a kit of tools that I can now use. Between this class and generally being involved in art department work, I feel like I slipped into a new and generally productive way of talking about work in progress. In general this was a lot of trying to figure out what we were each already paying attention to. Sophy and Loren supported putting our painting class in a political context. Not that there were always clear connections but the questions were active and the course didn't feel bracketed off from the rest of my life in the strange way classes often are."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lots of practice painting. The iterative process in this class was useful, and although it could get tiresome painting the same subject again and again (via studies and new drafts), it really improved my facility with the oil medium. I would like to have had a much broader variety of subjects, however, instead of just focusing on realistic still life paintings. Additionally, I think it would have been helpful for the instructors to be a little more hands-on in critiquing and workshopping technique.",
    "Perhaps more studio time.",
    "The final project is the best part of the course, because you have lots of freedom. The earlier assignments are a bit restrictive and not as fun - basically just still lifes.",
    "I really enjoyed how the class was structured. Maybe more of an introduction to the different mediums and techniques could be helpful for new painters, but it is also nice to allow people to figure out how they paint naturally.",
    "The class was very open. Sometimes it was hard to see the direction, but the course drew real change, relationships, and good work out of all the students. The syllabus was well thought-out but also flexible. I wanted to be pushed harder (or at least I say that now--how would I have responded then?). Or maybe I just wanted to have an even tighter class community. But that may just not be possible with an introductory class where people don't really know one another, have the constant Yale busy-ness, and are all new to painting. And we did move quite far together. I definitely bogged down in the middle, but something changed towards the end and I felt just like I could give kind of an endless amount of attention to my project and it would just get richer. This was kind of an emotional roller-coaster, but that's not too much to do with the class. More with how I respond to that kind of intensely engaging projects. Was definitely one of those classes that's spilling out around the borders all over the place. In a great way."

    "I would certainly recommend this course, but you should know exactly what youre before enrolling. This course introduces you to the oil medium, which is incredibly complex, versatile, and historically important. This course does not actually teach you painting techniques; it does familiarize you with the medium through practice. You will teach yourself most of the approaches to painting via trial and error, personal research, and occasional workshopping with the instructors (who are super nice). But be aware that you will not learn to paint in this class (nor in any other class in the Yale art school).",
    "Yes, if he or she likes painting already or is interesting in learning something new, this is a great class.",
    "I said the workload was much greater, but only because it was full of possibility, not because it was demanding. I'm curious about where other students ended. My sense was that many were really turned on by the work, but I don't know. In my case, I felt changed by the work. It became entangled with other classes I was taking, too. That's rare for an art class, in my experience."
