    "do it",
    "I'd recommend it. Similar amount of work to L3 or L4. Speaking definitely improves because we speak only in spanish every day. two presentations help that out too. fair tests\/quizzes.",
    "If you really want to study Spanish farther, take it. If you have to take it for distributional requirements, take it. It is not too much work, and much less than the other Yale Spanish classes. You also don't really learn too many NEW grammar points.",
    "It's a really interesting class in Spanish and well worth going beyond L3 for more credits",
    "It is a good course, depending on your teacher. Some make class more fun than others. A little too much busy, mindless work...work book exercises.",
