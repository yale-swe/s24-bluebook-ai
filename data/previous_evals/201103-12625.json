   "comments": [
    "Yes, you should take this class if you are interested in Epidemics and want to discuss them. The reading load is generally pretty light, but the books can get dry\/depressing at times. The class projects and trip to NYC let the class bond, which makes it even more fun as the semester goes on.",
    "Humanities 076 01 was a very rewarding course. I learned a lot about global epidemics and was able to directly participate in class discussions. The seminar experience was extremely fulfilling and allowed me to get to know my classmates on a personal level. I would highly recommend this class to another student. The work load is minimal and the content is extremely interesting.",
    "Epidemics in a Global Perspective is a great Yale Freshman Seminar. It introduces you to the world of infectious disease through literature and historical text. Also a great chance to take a paid-for field trip to New York. It's a pretty easy class with a relatively light work-load (the first assignment we photographed a short story in costume). The only time I was stressed was during book presentations (each student is required to present on one of the readings).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It's small and very well taught. Great class!",
    "I would summarize the class as an interesting reading-based course on epidemics throughout history. There are readings for both the science-oriented as well as the literature-oriented. Dr. Summers is an awesome professor who is very understanding and knowledgeable. I'd recommend it to anyone with interest in diseases or history. The readings are fun and the class isn't too demanding.",
    "Without a doubt. This class was great!",
    "Great class, a lot of interaction, not very stressful. Yes",
    "I would strongly recommend this class for those who want a humanities credit in a science-focused class. The work was very manageable overall, and the readings were interesting. Bewarethat the entire grade relies on a final research paper about your favorite epidemic. It's not too bad, but it can be if you put it off for a while. On a positive note, there is no final for the class. Professor Summers is a great guy, and it was an honor to have him.",
    "This is a very enjoyable class, but it is not for everyone. If you are already well versed in public health you may find it a bit dry. Some of the readings can get a little monotonous. Overall it is a lot of fun. Our class bond a lot because of our love for Bill (Professor Summers) and our field trip to NY.",
    "I would say Epidemics in a Global Perspective is a courser that evaluates several epidemics throughout history. I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is very interesting and the course is very fun.",
    "Yes, This was a good seminar for those interested in history or epidemics. Also, it has a very light course load - lots of reading but only two papers - so it was quite manageable."
