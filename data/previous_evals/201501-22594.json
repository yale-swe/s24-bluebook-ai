    "A pretty chill, easygoing course with very kind deadlines. Although a bit disorganized at times, the class grew on me throughout the semester. The professor is a silly old bald dude who cracks bad jokes and likes his students. The subject matter was as much about how to be a good journalist as it was the relationship between the media and politics. I expect this would be more interesting when there is an active campaign going on, which there wasn't when I took it. Recommended for anyone with an interest in political journalism, but probably not to others.",
    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale. Absolutely take it if you get in. Class was always fun and interesting, the readings were by far the most enjoyable academic readings I've ever done, and you'll learn a ton over the course of the semester. The workload was steady and very manageable if you didn't procrastinate.",
    "AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING. Take this as a fifth class or whenever you can. My favorite class at Yale so far. Two hour seminars can sometimes drag, but Walter Shapiro is so sweet and I wish I could have this class every semester. The readings are sometimes longer, but it's all very interesting (or even common sense). Most of the time we discussed 2016 or topics related more to the current, so the readings were sometimes irrelevant to the discussion. Short spring break paper (less than 4 pages) and a 8-10 page final paper. He's a journalist so he loves a good story. Great class!",
    "Yes, without question. Whether or not you think you're interested in the material, you won't regret taking this course and it might become your favorite at Yale.",
    "The booklist is incredible. Read them all. Skip the class.",
    "Presidential Campaigns and the Media is a very enjoyable class. Walter Shapiro is full of interesting stories and the class is basically his story hour. It's a lot of reading, but all the books are interesting and are written by journalists so are actually engaging. I learned a ton and the subject matter is especially relevant right now. A highly recommended course!",
    "Great seminar and great reading list. Though some of the big themes can get repetitive, it was not something that particularly bothered me given that this was my first and only poli sci class at Yale. Shapiro tells us lots of fun stories and is a delight to get to know. He is excited to be teaching the class, and that definitely rubs off. Reading responses are incorporated well into class discussion and bring in some ideas and opinions of the quieter folks, which is great.",
    "This was a wonderful wonderful seminar! Reading list was ON POINT, particularly in the first half of the semester (for real, Making of the President 1960 made me cry tears of joy). Professor Shapiro tells hilarious stories, which made the class. Learned a lot too, and writing the paper at the end was great because you can choose whatever interests you! Take this class if you're at all interested in media\/elections!",
    "Definitely take this class! It is amazing, and the reading is great."
