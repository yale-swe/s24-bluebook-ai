   "comments": [
    "In ASTR 210 I learned about the solar system with more than just a topical lens; I also learned about stars, how they're classified, how they're born, how they mature, and how they die. I reinforced my ability to handle algebraic equations in a physics context.",
    "nothing this class is terrible",
    "General introductory topics in astronomy and deeper topics in evolution of stars.",
    "I gained many skills in this class such as how to navigate the night sky and how to find locate astronomical objects using declination and right ascension. I also learned a lot about topics that have always interested me such as black holes, pulsars, and stellar evolution.",
    "I don't think I really gained any skills beyond plugging and chugging with equations. Some of the content is cool though (black holes, stars, etc).",
    "Gained insights into the basics of star evolution, and touched on cosmology and other topics. I learned a lot of interesting material about stars and techniques related to characterizing stats.",
    "I would say that this course primarily taught us to not take astronomical processes for granted -- I particularly enjoyed exploring stellar evolution and the construction of the sun.",
    "learned about astronomy and physics and mathematical methods of determining stars, exoplanets, and other celestial bodies",
    "I learned a lot in this course and got a strong foundation in stars.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of stellar measurement and stellar evolution, and this class is a good foundation of what you need to know in astronomy. There's also some side topics that we learned, such as electron energy levels, special relativity (and the basic concepts of general relativity), and some interesting results of quantum mechanics, such as electron degeneracy.",
    "I learned the basics of astronomy and star evolution. It was a very great class! It covered a wide range of topics in physics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strength of this course is the homework assignments. They are great for reinforcing the material learned in class and they replicate the style of the exam problems perfectly, so that the exam has less anxiety surrounding it: it's basically a longer homework assignment. The weakness would be the level of engagement with the lectures; the material is fascinating, but I often found myself distracted in lecture, missing important information.",
    "remove it from the course catalog",
    "The information required for the psets we had often not yet reached in the lectures. This meant that there was a good deal of self teaching and that once we did cover it in the lecture it was repetitive. The strength of the class is that it covers truly fascinating material.",
    "It's definitely a very basic intro level course. The homework all felt like practice finding formulas and using a calculator more than anything conceptual - it might be nice to take a border conceptual view rather than just giving us a bunch of equations (or maybe derive them!)",
    "Psets, tests, and topics and very interesting but lectures are not very engaging.",
    "The lecture is unbearably boring.",
    "This course was very strong in the information that it provided for students. The material was very interesting and was taught in a very understandable manner. However, the delivery of the information could be improved slightly. The course was a lecture and it was often difficult to stay engaged while listening to the professor. He did not make eye contact with the students very often and therefore did not see when students had questions. He also never checked in with students to make sure the class was following the material. Many students were simply on Facebook all class or doing other work because it was difficult to stay focused on the lecture.",
    "The professor is boring and the course is poorly taught.",
    "Strengths include format of exam and helpful lecture slides. Weaknesses include how slow the class was at the start.",
    "The lectures covered quite fascinating topics, though I would say that most of the learning happened beyond Sachem St. That being said, I wish a greater emphasis would be placed on actual observation at the observatory. It would be very helpful to provide lists of recommended textbook readings and exercises much earlier than the week of the exam (!)",
    "I think that the class covered a lot of material and I learned a lot. I do wish that the class slides were clearer.",
    "I thought that this class was a good, intermediate-level introduction to stellar astronomy. The midterms and final were very straightforward, with most of the questions being mirror images to problems on the psets, along with some definitions and qualitative short answers. The psets were fairly easy, since most of the problems included taking one or two equations and plugging numbers in. That was one drawback to the course- you could potentially get an A just by popping in numbers to given equations without fully understanding what the question means.",
    "I found the lectures to not be very engaging and as a result felt like I had to learn a lot of the material myself. I would recommend that class participation be more elicited. Overall, very interesting material though!",
    "The material could be interesting, but it is horribly presented in a way that demands absolutely no student engagement.",
    "The one thing I had trouble with was the length of exams. The midterms were not given with enough time, so I suggest shortening the number of questions. It felt like there were so many, and definitely more than was necessary to show our understanding.",
    "The course is extremely organized--weekly problem sets and three exams. No surprises. I think the course is great and does not need to be changed."

   "comments": [
    "This course is good for anyone with a genuine interest in astronomy either as a serious hobby or a potential major. You will need to keep yourself focused in the course, but if you do, you'll learn some really fascinating things about the universe and everything in it.",
    "This is the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes if they are interested in Astronomy and want to be more engaged than taking a gut class, but this certainly the most rigorous and can be tedious at times. I would recommend this class with that warning.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who genuinely interested in astronomy, not just looking for a science or QR credit (but it's great for someone who is curious about astronomy and needs a QR\/science credit). Also, I would tell them not to worry about the physics\/calculus requirement; there was no calculus necessary and very little physics.",
    "Good introduction to astronomy.",
    "The material for this course could be interesting, but Zinn's lectures are dry and boring. It's also full of astro majors so if you're not planning on doing astro, probably not for you. NOT A GUT CLASS!!",
    "I would probably recommend this to a student looking to study Astronomy. However, I would most likely not recommend it to a student who did not demonstrate much interest in the topics because I did not find it to be a very engaging course.",
    "No. I took it as an interesting non-gutty science, but it was gutty in all the wrong ways (not difficult but boring).",
    "Yes! It's a great way to learn about stars in detail while touching upon other astronomy topics like cosmology, history of astronomy, and measuring techniques. Great material overall though it started off rather slow. The lecture slides are super helpful for the exams, which were very straightforward. Overall interesting material - you gain even more appreciation for stars!",
    "If you are excited enough by stars to not mind fairly dry homework assignments (i.e. if the concepts stimulate you enough), take the class!",
    "it's pretty good if you need a science credit. very little reading, and the psets are manageable. i'm not sure if i would take it as a fifth class, though. i did, and i ended up being in situations where i had incredibly little time to study because this class was my lowest priority. i ended up getting a pretty mediocre grade as a result.",
    "I would recommend this course. I think it gave me a strong foundation.",
    "I thought that this course was a fun introduction to astronomy, and the workload was fairly low compared to other QR classes. The psets generally took me around 2-3 hours to complete, and studying for the exams was pretty easy since everything is in the lectures (just take decent notes and show up to every class). I don't know why anyone would take the lower level astronomy classes because 210 is very low maintenance, yet you still learn a lot of cool astronomy.",
    "I took this class as a science gut. I do not believe that it is as there is a problem set every week and they took me at least 5 hours. The weekly burden though ensures that we are on top of the material some what. I found the professor ( while very knowledgable) to not be the most engaging lecturer and I learned most of the material by looking up youtube videos or reading the textbook. If you do find a way to stay awake in lecture, I do think that the class material is very valuable to what is ultimately tested. Professor Zinn is also very approachable, kind and replies to emails promptly. I felt as thought the material got really interesting after the first midterm, when we began to cover the history of stars etc. Before that we learned more about light and the celestial sphere which I found less interesting. Overall, I liked the class and was happy to learn new material, but definitely was expecting it to be less work than it was.",
    "Don't take it. Find something else, just don't take it. It's definitely the worst class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes. This is a great intro course into Astronomy for people who are comfortable with more calculations than conceptual ideas. That being said, the calculations are essentially plugging in numbers into a calculator, so the math is not difficult in any sense.",
    "If Professor Zinn teaches this course, do take it! It is like listening to an astronomy grandfather tell you stories about the stars."
