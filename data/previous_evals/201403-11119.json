    "Seminar-style course in which neuro faculty give one lecture per week about their field of interest and then select 2 high-impact articles in their field for a subsequent, student-led discussion. Highly recommended for a student with a solid technical background in neuroscience - much more difficult for students who are new to the field.",
    "I would recommend it, but would advise the student not to take too heavy of a courseload otherwise because the paper revisions took a lot of work",
    "This course really improved my abilities, both on science and communication skills. It contained large variety of colorful backgrounds and exercise speaking & academic writing."

    "Great survey of the field.",
    "Broad exposure to research interests of neuro faculty at Yale. Helpful for choosing laboratory rotations.",
    "The course teaches me to read and understand the literature in different subfields, which will be helpful",
    "This course definitely improved my critical analysis of science publications and my ability to synthesize ideas and articulate experiments that would support them",
    "Helped my grasp the key ideas of papers much faster than before."
