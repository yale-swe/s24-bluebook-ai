    "I would absolutely recommend it: class each week focuses entirely on the three poems written by students that Professor Gluck has chosen we talk about. We spend the entire class talking about these three [oems and finding ways they could be better, praising what's good, and trying to do our best to make sense of them. I think that the experience of being workshopped is very helpful because you receive so much useful feedback, from students as well as Professor Gluck. I enjoy the discussion of other students' poems as well: it gives you a chance to find something you admire in their work\u0097or something you want to avoid doing\u0097and really think about it and make sense of why it's good or not.",
    "If you want to write poetry, and can commit to writing a poem a week, and are to some extent serious about your poetry, take the class.",
    "Take it, if you get in; Gluck is amazing, the class is amazing, take it take it take it.",
    "Gluck's class is wonderful. She's a trenchant critic, and the other students tend to be as well. As a student, you can make the workload what you will, but the more effort you exert, and the more you interact with Gluck the more dramatically your writing will improve. Growth is abundant, but not without some scar tissue.",
    "I thought it was weird that the class workshopped the best of the week's poems. The workshop idea is a great one and can be very beneficial, but it's best to critique more mediocre work in a classroom atmosphere. It's the people on the bottom who need the most help, not the people on the top. And if the only people getting solid, consistent advice are those already performing at a high level, there's really no hope for the less talented. Basically if she likes you, you're good to go. If she doesn't like you, you're screwed. I think the idea of the class is its major strength, but the fashion in which it is actually carried out is its major weakness. I would revise the workshop format so that it's tailored more to a classroom environment. It's also frustrating because during class, everyone is always pandering to Louise and trying to say what they think she will like best. This makes for a very frustrating classroom environment. Also poems are sent out via email to everyone in the class, and the idea is that everyone will give feedback to other students on their poems, but this never happens. The peer critique system should be revised so that you're actually receiving constant ideas for how to improve your work.Honestly, I felt that Louise Gl\u00fcck really didn't care about her students in any way, shape, or form. She made it virtually impossible to schedule meetings with her, she is very difficult to get into contact with because she doesn't have an email, and when I did speak with her, I consistently got the feeling that I was wasting her time. It was a really frustrating and disappointing semester. She doesn't have time to talk to you before or after class. When she critiques things, she doesn't do it in a \"constructive criticism\" way that helps the student but also encourages him\/her - instead, she just criticizes. After a while, I found myself just trying to write something that I thought would please her instead of writing something that I was actually invested in. I dreaded going to this class because I felt like I was consistently being told that I had failed and that I have no redeeming qualities. I'm sure she's a very talented writer, but teaching is apparently the LAST thing she wants to be doing. In all honesty, I would save yourself the trouble and not take this class unless you want to be constantly at the mercy of her attitude and consistently acting as sycophant.",
    "A nice workshop to produce new work and get constant feedback from a wonderful poet in the professor, and also from the students. Discussion in class sometimes verges on meaninglessness, repetition, and ridiculous analaysis, but hey, it happens.",
    "It is a workshop class. The workshop itself can be hit or miss, though there are always things you can get out of it. Makes you a better reader of poetry. Ultimately, the best parts come from Louise's comments on your poems, and your meetings with her. If you care about it, you can grow as a poet.",
    "Yes. Yes yes yes.",
    "Yes, but as I already said, only if you YEARN to write poetry, and truly want to spend hours agonizing, writing, revising, and thinking about verse.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to young writers interested in a poetry workshop scenario."
