    "Don't take this class.",
    "An overview of the ways that scientists use animal models to learn about the causes, treatments, and other aspects of clinical disorders. I would recommend this because it is very interesting, but only if you feel solid in your knowledge of biology.",
    "The material is interesting, but the lectures are extremely dull, and it is difficult to pay attention. The tests are fair and not too difficult, but studying for them is rough when you realize that you have zoned out every lecture. The professor provides notes on slides that are helpful but not necessarily comprehensive, so going to lecture and trying to pay attention is important. Take Cr\/D if you really want exposure to the material. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend taking it unless you are REALLY interested in neuro.",
    "It's an okay science credit. It requires a lot of memorization and not too much conceptual understanding and the lectures aren't super engaging, but the material is really interesting when you do pay attention. Plus Prof Donegan is very nice and really cares about the students - he hold upwards of 6 hours of office hours the week before an exam, for anyone to come in and ask him questions.",
    "If you want to understand the science behind clinical disorders and how treatments can be developed, take this class. Animal Models of Clinical Disorders struck the right balance between being challenging and feasible. The class went into depth to explain the science behind clinical disorders and treatments, but was explained well, making it very approachable. However, there were times the professor was too repetitive, making the class boring. There was not much reading and not much outside work. The paper was long, but definitely do-able. The fact that there are 3 tests throughout the semester keeps you reviewing, which is nice. The exams are tricky, though, so be careful. Make sure you're well acquainted with all the experiments and the exact results. There is some degree of memorization, but a lot of it actually requires understanding. So make sure you don't just cram for the class, but sit down and understand everything fully.",
    "A really interesting course if you're interested in neuroscience and mental health. Over the semester we discussed alcohol and drug addiction, anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, Parkinson's Disease, and Alzheimer's, each time studying experiments that have been done to make animals (rats or monkeys) manifest symptoms of the disorders and then how those animal models are used to test the causes of, and treatments for, the disorder. It can get technical, but it's also material worth knowing.",
    "I would not recommend Psychology 147 to a non-science student looking to fill a science credit (which I what I did). The course material is extremely frustrating for students who find science material difficult to comprehend and study. I recommend students to have a strong and working knowledge of biology and chemistry. If you get frustrated easily by disorganized lectures, do not take this course.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Dreadfully boring, with surprisingly challenging exams. The class does not encourage critical thought and stifles students who ask deeper questions than clarifying, conceptual concerns. I learned a list of facts that were necessary for the exams and that animal models can sometimes be useful to like\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 learn stuff about human diseases. A true waste of a credit.Caution: If you're looking for an easy science credit, don't waste your time. There are more interesting classes. If you're looking for an easy social science credit, don't waste your time. There are more interesting classes. If you are genuinely interested in the material, you won't be after attending a couple lectures. All in all, avoid this class at all costs.",
    "Great science credit, interesting material and not terribly hard, though you do have to attend lectures and pay attention.",
    "PSYC 147 was much harder than I expected. In the end, I just tried (unsuccessfully, I'm afraid) to memorize the material. The exams were extremely detailed and difficult to prepare for. I found the class very stressful, which is too bad because the material is so interesting.",
    "Interesting class, but I wouldn't take it unless you already have a background in the material and are ready to memorize neurological terms.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in learning about disorders like drug addiction, depression, and schizophrenia in a very technical, neurosciencey way. The material is interesting but can get complicated, and sometimes it is hard to follow in lecture. However, Prof. Donegan provides notes that go with his slideshows that are very clear and helpful, so it's not always necessary to go to class. Lecture gets a little boring at times also. But still a good class. One pretest, two tests, a 10 page paper, and a final.",
    "Animal models is a FANTASTIC class. The material is interesting\/applicable, and the professor is incredibly helpful during office hours. It is a great science credit if you are not a hard science person; as a psychology major with no background in bio-chem, I thought that it was totally manageable (although definitely challenging) and approachable. The material is taught so that people with no background can really understand some of the mechanisms of clinical disorders. If you have any knowledge of psychology, it goes a fairly long way in the class, especially for the first test or two. Conversely, if you're a science major looking for a good psyc credit, this class would be PERFECT, because it's heavy on the bio-chem, and the psyc concepts are not difficult at all.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. It's a great science credit. I'm not a \"science person\" but the course is taught such that it's very understandable. Professor Donegan is very engaging and explains his lectures thoroughly. He's always so receptive to questions in class and explains the content in an approachable way. He definitely cares about his students-always offering numerous office hours - plus the work is definitely manageable. It's a very interesting course and I would say that if you're looking for a science class that's a bit challenging, but very interesting and enjoyable, then take this!",
    "I would recommend this to a student if he\/she were sure that they were interested in Psychology or Biology.",
    "This is a lovely introduction to neurobiology and underlying mechanisms of mental disorders. It's a very useful and functional class if your interests lie anywhere in the realm of mental health, psychology, neurobiology, or any other kind of thing you can imagine. The professor is engaging if at times monotone in presentation, and his grading structure is very reasonable and logical (the tests count more and more as the semester progresses). The final paper is a little confusing in terms of expectation, but start early and you'll be fine. It's some work, it's true, but relevant work.",
    "I took this class because I needed a science credit and the reviews said it was accessible to non-science people. While it was technically accessible, it really is geared toward science people. And the lectures are terrible - it's really difficult to learn much from them. Overall, an unnecessarily difficult class on a topic that should have been interesting.",
    "This is a very technical course, but extremely interesting. The ten page paper is quite a lot of work, and having it plus a final is a bit of a drag. Take it because it's really cool!",
    "Unless you're interested in mental disorders and the experiments that help us understand to them, this can be a dry science credit. But if you're interested in this stuff, it's a solid class. The exams are not difficult, but it's a lot of cramming. If you haven't taken a neurobiology class before, you could be in for a rough start but group studying helps.",
    "By the end of this course, I was glad I took this course because I felt like I learned so much relevant information. However, the class also took me by surprise in terms of difficulty level. I do not think it would be possible to do well in this course without attending basicallyevery single lecture. The week-to-week amount of homework is very low; studying is the only thing you can do for most of the course. The final paper is not particularly hard, and actually rather enjoyable to write. I did have to study for many many hours before the final. I think the class underestimates the amount of prior science knowledge you should have. I would recommend this course to a student with a fair amount of science background and who thinks this material would be interesting.",
    "Would recommend to students interested in research methodology.",
    "This class will teach you a lot if you are prepared to do the readings. Take it if you learn by reading and if you are looking for a way to learn some interesting information about clinical disorders and their pathophysiology. Do not take this class if you want an easy science credit. Do not take this class if you have a hard time with neuroscience. This is probably one of the most neuro-heavy classes in the psych department.",
    "Definitely take it! You'll learn more than you expect, and the material is applicable to any field of psychology.",
    "Pysch 147 is a good course for both those with a science background and those without, although it is definitely much more of a science class than a social science one. It can be very confusing at times, at least that was what I felt, as a non-science major. Definitely doable, not a gut, but worth the while if you're actually interested in learning things.",
    "A solid class. Professor Donegan's lectures can be a little dry at times, but the material is fascinating. You'll learn about a lot of different animal models, including current research. He's also easy to talk to during office hours to get things clarified. It's definitely not a super easy science credit, but the exams are pretty fair, there's just a lot of material. Helpful (but not necessary) if you've taken a neuroscience-related course before.",
    "You should definitely take this class as it opens your eyes to a lot of things that happen in the brain, but you should also be prepared to work in the class and ask a lot of questions and just enjoy the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It was really interesting to learn about some of the more recent advancements in neuroscience. I especially would recommend this class to psych majors concentrating in neuroscience who are looking for a course that is founded in molecular biology.",
    "A really interesting and eye-opening class! Particularly for those interested in research and experimentation rather than just the facts derived from end results. Some science background would probably be helpful"
