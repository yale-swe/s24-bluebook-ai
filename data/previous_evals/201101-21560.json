    "Easy class ... not a gut but definitely not too much work if you are looking for a good 4th\/5th class for your schedule. No one really holds you accountable to the readings so you need to motivate yourself to do them (but I found them to be really interesting).It can be kind of dry if you aren't used to anthropology, but if you like the subject (like I do), it is interesting...",
    "Overall assessment: Mediocre.Strengths: For the subject matter (which is pretty dry), it was well and creatively taught.Weaknesses: The professor seemed to know that many people taking the course had no intention of becoming anthropology majors; while this is fine and to be expected, at times I was mildly insulted (never personally, but in a collective sense, I suppose). For example, on the midterm half of the points were MULTIPLE CHOICE. They were easy and so I guess I shouldn't complain about that, but I'm in college and not in the sixth grade, if you know what I mean. Another example is that it seemed like every time we read a thoroughly engaging, well-written, and insightful piece, he (well, almost everyone, but in my opinion the professor and TF's should be the last) would down-play it by saying it was difficult to understand. (Really, it normally just required a second or third read and was pretty straightforward in my opinion.) Levi-Strauss is dense? I have never complained of dense texts since reading some Foucault last fall (this anthro class was in the spring).Each week Professor McGovern would send us all a \"discussion question\" (whichwere not always particularly stimulating to discussion, but they did provoke thought, which I suppose is the point). I feel like I would have been better prepared for section each week if my TF had sent out some sort of \"Points for reflection\/thought\" over the readings a day or two before section so that I would have a reason to go back over the readings and develop a firmer grasp on them. I imagine they could be in the form of questions that would emphasize the key points of an author's argument; and that they would NOT REQUIRE response online, but rather be of a more voluntary form of \"Think about these because I'm going to ask you in section\" sort of thing.",
    "Don't take this class... it will feel like a waste of time. There are much better ways to spend your afternoons.",
    "I would not recommend this class to another student unless it is restructured and taught by another professor. I am hoping that this class was not an accurate preview of the field of anthropology. The lectures were so disjointed that it was almost impossible to take organized notes that would be at all helpful later. The midterm exam had multiple choice questions that would insult the intelligence of anyone who had done the readings and sat through the lectures.",
    "ANTH 110 is a very good introduction to Cultural Anthropology and a good way to find out whether your interest lies in Anthropology. Most of the readings are fun. The workload is reasonable, there is an in-class midterm, a take-home final, and weekly reading responses.",
    "I'd recommend taking the course, but it's not what you would expect coming in. You study HOW to study other cultures, and very little of the course actually has to do with the outside cultures. You'll deal more with French philosophy than anything. Not a bad workload, though a good amount of reading.",
    "Easy easy easy! So boring though... be prepared. If you need a 5th class, take it but be warned- getting through the reading and the lectures are painful.",
    "With Prof. McGovern's teaching style, this class would probably work best as a seminar. For budding anthropology majors (even ones who have already taken intermediate classes), it's good to read some of the \"anthro canon.\" Even for those who aren't anthropology majors, the discussions the readings generated were very engaging and interesting. Good class. (In class midterm, weekly reading questions, take home final).",
    "Absolutely. I went into this course with a very shallow understanding of what anthropology even was or why it was useful. Coming out of this course I realize its practicality as well its its importance in understanding and solving problems rooted in culture.",
    "The readings are really cool and not overbearingly long. The class is mostly about the methods of anthropology...this is NOT a class where you just learn strange facts about other cultures just to be entertained. If you're ok with that then take it. it's a pretty chill and insightful class, though you have to make a lot of the connections yourself. If you have no intention of doing any of the awesome reading then don't bother taking the class.",
    "Cultural anthro is a great introductory course. You will get out of it what you put into it. The readings are definitely a highlight of the course, and lecture helps you understand them. Mike McGovern is cool, sometimes he can be confusing, and going to lecture helps untangle the confusion. Take the course. It doesn't require a huge time commitment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is one of the most enjoyable I have taken so far at Yale.",
    "If you are looking for a gut, take ANTH 110.",
    "Anthropology 101 01 is a fairly broad overview of the field of cultural anthropology; we went through methodology, theory, and specific ethnographies. If you've ever questioned the world aroundyou, if you've ever asked yourself why our society operates the way it does, if you've ever wanted to look more deeply at the complexities of culture, this is the class for you. Coming in, I didn't know that much about anthropology, but I soon found that I LOVED it! Section was definitely my favorite part--this stuff is really interesting to talk about in a small group, and it can sometimes get a little dry if you're just listening to lectures. Professor McGovern is quite a good lecturer, though, and he has great stories from his fieldwork.",
    "This course has some interesting readings (particularly Bourgois's In Search of Respect) and I was lucky to get a very good TF (David Kneas, but I have a feeling like TFs for this course change a lot), but overall, it was not very enjoyable. I'm an Anthro major, and although this course didn't discourage me from pursuing the major and I did learn a little bit about methodology, Iwas mostly just bored and disinterested. Lectures were dull and hard to follow, and Professor McGovern has the unfortunate habit of getting kind of militant-sounding at some point during all his lectures, which I found quite off-putting. If you're looking for a class to give you a sense of what cultural anthropology entails, I would suggest you look elsewhere, although a peek at some of the readings (or at least learning a little about the works and contributions of the likes of Mauss, Durkheim, Levi-Strauss, et al.) would probably be a good idea.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about anthropological methods. This is not the course for those who want to learn about actual cultures.",
    "It is NOT a class about various cultures of the world. Instead, it is an introduction to the methods and techniques that a cultural anthropologist would use during fieldwork. You will also delve a bit into the ethics of anthropology. If you are interested in this, I would highly recommend it.",
    "I would only recommend this if you are very interested in anthropology. Otherwise, it is really boring and there is a significant amount of reading in the second half of the course.",
    "This is not a \"learn about cool world cultures\" class. It's an anthropological methods class, where you read a lot of dense ethnography. If you shop it on the first day, that's basically what you can expect for the whole course. If you're interested in cultural anthropology, you should take it.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class really depends on the person teaching it. McGovern is pretty good. Shop it to see if you like his teaching style. The class can be boring at times, but some of the readings are really interesting. I'm not an anthro major and I just took it for the heck of it, and I think it was probably a good choice.",
    "This class is focused on showing what anthropology is as a discipline and how to conduct anthropological research. Some of the readings can be pretty dry, but there are other times when the readings are incredibly interesting (we read an entire ethnography about crack dealers in Harlem).If you're considering an anthropology major, take this class because it will be a good overview of the materials you'd be working with in the future. Personally, I didn't care for the class much because I wasn't a fan of Professor McGovern's lecturing style (a lot of lectures were rambling and had no clear connection to the reading). If you're looking for a class that studies something interesting from an anthropological perspective, I would recommend Language, Culture, and Identity (anth120) with Joe Errington. In general I found that class to be a lot more engaging.",
    "Not really. I didn't really like this class. I'm glad that we read the readings that we read, seminal works in the field of anthropology, but I had issue with the fact that we didn't read some of the important works that Professor McGovern mentioned in class. How could we not actually read Margaret Mead, Foucault, Durkheim, and others, and instead just learn ABOUT them? That's silly. Also, this class was way too political for my liking. I guess that teaching about cultural anthropology could be spun in this political way, but I would have liked it to be more sociocultural. The lectures were often insipid, and I, and many others in the class, had a hard time paying attention for so long to a sort of stream of consciousness lecture. On the last day of class Professor McGovern told us that this course could have been taught with a textbook, but that this class was better because we read diverse works rather than going through a textbook. But I actually wish this class was taught with atextbook and then some supplemental reading of anthropological works. That way, I could actually follow what was going on (because I was often confused by Professor McGovern's seemingly aimless, disjointed lecturing) and not have to resort to Wikipedia time and time again.So, no, I wouldn't recommend this class, although it is really easy -- just readings, a midterm, and a take home final comprised of four essays. It was just too boring. Even the anthropological readings, which I, as an anthropology major, usually love, were really strange. Not a good course.",
    "It's a fine class, interesting even if you don't have much interest in anthropology. It's worth taking if you have any interest in world affairs, or justwant to learn about some random cool cultures.",
    "No, it sucked. It was not interesting and was sickeningly liberal. My opinion of anthropology since having taken this class is that it is a useless, pompous, condescending field and is even a bit offensive.",
    "Anthropology 110 is a solid introduction to cultural anthropology. Though the reading may be dense and even uninteresting at times, it's necessary to get an understanding of important concepts and theories in sociocultural anthropology. Its strengths are its ethnographic readings, and its weaknesses are its introductory readings. It could be improved by substituting some particularly dry readings for others that are more engaging and communicate the same concepts. Don't be daunted by early readings in this course; read them, digest them, and push through to the more interesting readings a few weeks in.",
    "Interesting class with some insights into anthropology. Not a lot of work, but the take home 4 short essay final is not completely trivial (at least not for this science major).",
    "Do not take this course, unless you are seriously, seriously interested in anthropological theory and nothing else. Actually, don't take this course even if you are. The lectures are rambling and unstructured to the point of incomprehensibility. As a result, it is very difficult to know what to look for as you are reading.",
    "You learn to define Anthropology and also learn different methodologies to how to apply them in your field work.",
    "It was a very low commitment with one in-class midterm and a take-home final. However, if you get behind on the readings you won't have anything to talk about in section or the various times in lecture when he wants people to respond to his questions.",
    "Excellent introduction to the discipline. Lectures were sometimes a little slow, but McGovern is nonetheless a captivating speaker. Take it if you're considering Anthropology as a major.",
    "No. Just no, never. Not worth it, even if it requires no work. The reading itself (interesting sometimes) cannot make up for the class.",
    "Not a gut, lots of reading. Geared towards African, Polynesian, and poverty cultures.",
    "Anthro 110 has a lot of potential in terms of an introduction to a wide and varied discipline, but unfortunately it fails to deliver because it is so disorganized and seemingly unfocused. It's not necessarily as much of a gut as people say it is. Take it if you need it as a pre-req or if you're sincerely interested in the course material, but know that it's not a class on different types of cultures but rather a course on anthro theory with some case studies randomly mixed in. On the flip side, I really enjoyed section."
