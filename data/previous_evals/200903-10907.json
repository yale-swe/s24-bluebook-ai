    "I would recommend the course for students considering the social sciences as a career path - it gives a good overview of the ways in which theory and empirical research can be reconciled and proposed within and beyond a field. I would however, recommend that it be made clear in the course description whether or not the class is open to other schools or to only sociology students."

   "comments": [
    "This course helped me in to recognizes potential questions around method of inquiry and theory assertion that will arise in writing my masters' thesis as both a writer, reader, and evaluator\/journal editor. In particular the final assignment gave me the opportunity to frame a potential research plan that complements my current area of research. Understanding the concerns and critiques from social science perspective allowed me to comparatively look at the similarity and differences between interdisciplinary and traditional fields of research."
