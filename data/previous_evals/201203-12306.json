    "If you have something that you want to research on, take senior essay",
    "It is a chance to tie together a lot of lessons from your Yale career into one project. It can be extremely meaningful if you approach it the right way and invest the time to really do a good project.",
    "If you want to really learn about a topic and gain a greater appreciation of the field of Economics, you should take a senior essay.",
    "Pick an amazing adviser because you should be seeing them every week. If they are invested in you and in your success it is a much more enjoyable and educational experience than if you had to convince them to mentor you.",
    "Yes",
    "You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get your grade until 2nd semester. My only pointer is to establish regular deadlines with your advisor (eg bi-weekly deadlines) to motivate yourself to keep making progress. Otherwise, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be left in the dust by the end of the semester. I have a friend who did zero work until the end-of-semester report to the Econ dept; Needless to say, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have significantly more work than the rest of us in his final semester at Yale.",
    "Would highly recommend for all economics majors.",
    "If you have the work ethic to ensure that a lack of immediate deadlines does not result in a lack of work, then this can be rewarding. Honestly, you should already be very aware of how desirable the notion of writing a long paper is; choose accordingly."
