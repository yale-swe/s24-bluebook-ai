    "You're probably taking this as a prereq but don't let it scare you! It's an interesting class and you'll learn a lot.",
    "I mean I feel like anyone who's looking at this course has to take it so...",
    "Chem 220 isn't as bad as people say. It's a tough class, for sure, but if you do your work and don't get behind it's very manageable. Probably not a class that's worth taking for fun or just because chemistry is cool, but if you have to take it don't stress out -- you actually might end up liking it.",
    "Organic chemistry was an extremely difficult course that required an enormous amount of time. That hard work also did not always pay off. I would only recommend this course to those interested in going into a health profession or chemistry.",
    "Rablen was great. Orgo is honestly not that terrible. It even makes sense sometimes, especially when you go to lecture and read the chapters and do the homework. So do that.",
    "Only take it if you have to",
    "It is a terrific course that you should find very enlightening whether you are going to study organic chemistry or biochemistry or other related science.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The material is way more interesting than that of General Chemistry.",
    "Organic Chemistry made accessible. If you can take it with Paul Rablen, do so.",
    "Very challenging class. So much information to digest in so short a period of time.Only take it if you have to for pre-med or something. I don't know how, but get ALL the help you can as early as it starts!",
    "You're probably only taking this class if you're a predmed or bio major...good luck.",
    "Take it if you have to.",
    "You're probably taking this for your major, but don't worry, it actually ISN'T that bad. Just don't fall behind!",
    "Professor Rablen is a great professor; he has so many resources to help you and his lectures are great. That said, it's still orgo, and you do as well as the amount of time\/practice you put in.",
    "Take it with Professor Rablen!",
    "If you're reading this, you are one of the following:- A premed- An MCDB\/MB&B major- A chem major- A rare breed of animal which actually wants to take organic chemistry for fun. In that case, PLEASE talk to the DUS of chemistry - we need people like you.Either way, you probably weren't looking forward to this course TOO much. In an intellectual sort of way, orgo is fun, and some of the material covered is fascinating (Spectroscopy and Synthesis in particular) but everyone always speaks of it in hushed tones, for fear of awakening the slumbering beast atop science hill that is CHEM 220.And that's straight up BS. THIS. COURSE. ROCKS. Even if you don't have the good fortune of taking it with Rablen, don't let naysayers ruin your enjoyment of orgo. Sure the course is a bit of work, yeah, some material is confusing, but this is CHEMISTRY. You are studying how the world works on a nanoscale level by drawing stick figures. And that just gets me hot and bothered to be honest. Go into it with a positive attitude and a desire to learn, and by Zilm's mustache you will. And if you're anything like me, you won't be able to go a day without wanting more. And that's what CHEM 221 is all about, they tell me...",
    "This class is a requirement for a lot of majors. I don't think anyone would or should take it by choice.",
    "If you're taking this class, you most likely have to. It's not a \"for fun\" class.",
    "It's safe to say that very few people are overly fond of organic chemistry and that it often induces feelings of frustration and anxiety. That being said, Rablen's amiable demeanor will initially make you forget the horror stories you've heard about orgo. But that will soon change. The work load for the course is pretty heavy, with ridiculously long problem sets that will be the bane of your existence. Rablen also has the tendency to give very long exams (the midterms began at 9AM rather than the usual 9:25 for class), but the lowest of both the three exam and three quiz grades are dropped. Also, the final was quite long (about 4 hours), but you'll find when you take it that in spite of your frustration you actually learned a lot. If you're taking this class you're probably doing so because you have to, but consider yourself warned.",
    "Taking orgo for the sole purpose of venturing into a new science is the best reason to take the course. I recommend anyone who wants a worthwhile challenge to take it.",
    "Take it if you must (i.e. either pre med or for your major). Take it with Rablen (he's the best professor you could possibly have for orgo). Be prepared for more work and time than you have ever put into a class, but know that with the right amount of time you will understand the concepts. You don't have to be a genius to take orgo, you just need to be willing to dedicate at least 10 hours a week to it.",
    "For most people Organic Chemistry is a necessary evil. The class will consume your life with all of the work there is to do. The textbook stops being helpful about halfway through the semester and doing book problems is not necessarily the best application of your time. HOWEVER, for Rablen's class it is extremely important to do the ungraded assignments because his tests are formatted similarly. His handouts are also extremely helpful. Although the class takes a lot of energy out of you, you will come out of it feeling like you have learned a lot of material. Finally the final is a BEAST! It is a combination of the ACS's organic chemistry test and Rablen-like free response. One criticism is thatACS questions could be incorporated into the ungraded assignments from earlier on for students to gain familiarity.",
    "It's very challenging and requires effort to pass. Do your readings and as many practice questions as you can handle",
    "Orgo is hard. But it's not the hellish experience everyone likes to suggest! If you stay on top of the reading in the textbook, this course is very manageable. The problem sets are not a huge bother -- the online interface is easy to use and the problems are actually a great way to learn the chemistry you're responsible for. I would definitely recommend 220 -- I've heard it's a lot more chill than 124.",
    "Not nearly as difficult as advertised, though one ought, of course, to stay on top of work even before the week of the exam. Organic chemistry rather reminds me of algebra or a crossword puzzle--a little bit of figure-it-out, some basic knowledge requirements, and at least a possibility of fun. I heartily recommend doing assigned readings before Professor Rablen goes over them in class. While the professor was good at explaining the relevant concepts, getting a vague visual sense of the concepts from the text before getting an audio-visual experience made learning organic chemistry so much easier.",
    "I mean, if you're taking it, it's cause you have to.Good luck.",
    "Orgo is a really interesting class--full of cool concepts and material. It's definitely a class worth taking, but be warned: it is a difficult class! If you fall behind even in the slightest, it takes hours of reading the textbook to catch up. But Rablen is a gem, and he's super friendly, so he makes Orgo less intimidating.",
    "Professor Rablen is incredible. I loved this class. Too bad he's going back to Swarthmore after this academic year.",
    "A challenging, yet rewarding course in organic chemistry. Nearly all of the material will be new to you, yet it is taught in an intelligible way. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone even thinking about taking orgo in their undergraduate time at Yale. On that point, everyone always says that organic chemistry is the hardest course they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever taken or that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpre-med weed-out\u00e2\u0080\u009d class. Chemistry 220 with Professor Rablen was anything but that. Surely organic chemistry is one of the hardest classes I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken thus far at Yale, but it is not impossible and not nearly as bad as everyone leads you on to believe. I might be saying this because I had the good fortune of having the phenomenal Paul Rablen as my professor, but I truly think that if you take organic chemistry with Rablen, you will be fine! His class is engaging, intellectually-stimulating, and all-around fun to be in. Rablen gives weekly online problem sets (Sapling Learning) that are worth such a minimal percentage of your term grade that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re encouraged to do it, but you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stress over it. With that being said, the only way to learn in organic chemistry, no matter how many times you read the textbook or listen to Rablen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fantastic lectures, is to do problems. I was never someone to do problem after problem in any class. In fact, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the type to only read the book before exams. In organic chemistry, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no other way to get by and Rablen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s problem setsand homework philosophy make this all very painless and legitimately helps you learn in a fun, stress-free way. tl;dr TAKE ORGO WITH RABLEN; HE\u00e2\u0080\u0099S THE BEST!",
    "I stopped going to class because I was behind in the readings and stopped fully understanding what was happening. I thought that I could have used my time more effectively if I slept or used that time to work on other assignments\/catch up in the textbook. However, if I had just stayed in class and actually paid attention, I bet orgo would have been a lot easier for me. I bet I wouldn't have had to read the book as much because I would have understood it better seeing it a second time. I also know that if I had broke my studying up before exams better then I would have had better grades. My advice is to take the class, but put the work in. Don't copy a friends pset and tell yourself you'll actually learn it later. Just do it.",
    "For an organic chemistry class, this wasn't too bad. I actually kind of liked it, except during test weeks. Rablen was a great professor and really tried to make it interesting for his students. I do think that we focused too much on the later chapters though. Organic chemistry is a struggle, but Rablen is there to help you along the way, and after you've spent most of your time focusing on orgo instead of your other classes, you'll look back at the end of the term and be proud of the 15 chapters you have learned.",
    "Orgo is notoriously awful but I felt that this class was definitely bearable and the work wasn't too burdensome.",
    "Make sure you have a good professor and an even better TA. TAs are SUPER important if you want to get good practice with reactions, and the professor is usually not too helpful in terms of answering questions. No premed kid generally enjoys Organic Chemistry, but having a good TA will at least make it a manageable experience.",
    "Honestly, unless it's a requirement for your major or for pre-med, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it. The content is somewhat interesting but can be incredibly challenging and it can be frustrating to motivate oneself to work through it. It is very time consuming but if you do have to take it, put the time in and it will be rewarding. Go to section and take advantage of the other resources offered to you. Also Professor Rablen is amazing, though I suspect if you're reading this he has already returned to Swarthmore from his year visiting and won't be the professor when you take it.",
    "Orgo is hard. And it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full of premeds who make the curve impossible. I have taken a ton of STEM courses at Yale, but orgo is different. As a STEM-minded person, I found that the concepts were not so challenging, but there were just a lot of details that you have to learn and know very well. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essential to stay caught up with the material. Go to lecture, skim the book beforehand if you can, and do the problem sets for the material you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re learning when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re covering it in lecture. Do a ton of practice problems, and make cheat sheets with the important information and reactions on them. These will be very useful in committing these details to memory. Practice problems and being precise are essential. Plan to spend a lot of time on orgo. I think that freshman orgo is better \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there are generally fewer premeds and more people who are prepared in science and are thus usually interested in it. Less material is covered, too, which makes it a bit easier.",
    "This is a solid course to take. If you are taking this course with Dr. Rablen in Spring 2014, go for it.",
    "It is a decent class and if you're premed, you probably have to take it.",
    "Rablen is a fantastic professor - I actually ended up really enjoying the class. Since Rablen makes the material understandable, it's very interesting. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale.",
    "yes, it's a great class that covers alot of material on organic chem",
    "An awesome and importance chemistry course worth taking for enjoyment and for appreciating what chemistry can be.",
    "It's organic chemistry, so obviously it's difficult. But if you're considering\/have to take it, then DEFINITELY take it next semester while Rablen is still here. He was a great teacher and really nice and helpful. If you actually want to learn the stuff, take it with him. All the other Yale teachers apparently don't teach very well.",
    "Absolutely take this class.If you're reading this course evaluation and you have the opportunity to take organic chem with professor Rablen, DO IT! He's incredible. I found that going to lecture for this class was more than enough to understand the material. There was almost no need to read the textbook due to professor Rablen's careful explanations of major concepts -- I would even say that getting up to go to the 9:25 am class was a pleasure due to his engaging style. He is a wonderful lecturer with a genuine passion for the subject; it is highly regrettable that he'll be going back to Swarthmore next year, especially considering how poorly taught CHEM 220 usually is. Everyone tells you that taking this class will be a horrible experience, but it really doesn't have to be. Thiscould easily end up being one of your favorite courses of the semester. Be prepared to work hard, of course, but you'll leave the class with a real sense of having accomplished something.",
    "Necessary class for chem majors and pre-meds, but a good, \"different\", class for non-premeds. On a general level, I enjoyed learning the material and doing the problem sets, and am excited to learn more orgo next semester. I know this is Rablen's only year at Yale, but he should definitely come back! He is a great teacher. The one iffy thing about this class is that it is not curved, meaning that what you see is what you get. No one really knows how grading is going to work. Anyway, c'est la vie. Maybe this will become more clear in future years.",
    "rablen is awesome. be prepared to dedicate lots of time to psets, because they are long but they will help you. try to find a good TA.",
    "Yes. Make room in your schedule for it so it is a priority and then take it. I don't recommend taking it with a heavy load of other courses.",
    "CHEM 220 with Paul Rablen is the best organic chemistry class at Yale. Rablen is from Swarthmore and has a great set of teaching skills. Lectures are clear, organized, and information. Problem sets are not a big deal, take a little bit of time, and ensure that you really understand the material. Tests and quizzes are very reasonable and can vary on difficulty. Section is definitely useful, as we go over material that was not covered in class but material that Rablen still thinks is useful. Overall, if you have to take ochem, try to take it Rablen if you can.",
    "It is difficult - but it IS do-able! It will require much more time to understand than other courses, but there is logic and there are tons or resources, just use them.",
    "Spoiler alert: this is not a gut class. Do not take it for fun. You do not take orgo, you marry it. Be prepared to put in a lot of work if you want to do mediocre. Be prepared to put in even more work if you want to do well. The tests are ludicrously long, but they are fair if you are prepared. Rablen's handouts are very helpful as are the additional problems that he writes. Doing these problems is the best preparation for the exams and quizzes. I won't say orgo was necessarily a bad class, but it was a lot more work than I was used to. Best of luck.",
    "It's not easy, and don't ever get behind-otherwise, it's very difficult, if not impossible, to come back. Very good course-wish I had had more time to spend on it.",
    "Great and interesting course, although that probably doesn't matter much since you're taking this course because you're a chem major or pre-med student. Still fun though, I enjoyed it. In terms of grades, you probably won't get a good one, but that was expected considering it's organic chemistry.",
    "This is an extremely well taught course. I have heard many negative things about organic chemistry however Rablen made this experience very good.",
    "I would only recommend that you take this class if you HAVE to and I mean absolutely have to like you want to be a doctor and it's your NUMBER ONE DREAM and you absolutely cannot see yourself being anything else. Or it's required for a major that you cannot see yourself not focusing on. Yea...only if NECESSARY",
    "YES WITH RABLEN. Otherwise it could be a completely different course.",
    "... Yes. Take Orgo. It'll make you a better thinker.It'll improve your spatial reasoning and critical thinking. Look forward to the class and go in with a positive attitude; you'll enjoy it more.",
    "This is obviously not a class you take for funsies. It's hard and you have to work hard, but if you put in the time and effort you can get B's and maybe even A's on the midterms. Rablen was a great professor and was very fair with his questions. Averages were usually in the 70's, but the median was always a low to high B so most of the class was getting it. If you aren't willing to work like crazy (study for 4 days straight for a quiz) then don't take this class.",
    "I had always heard the ominous and terrifying stories about the infamous organic chemistry course required for med school requirements and science majors. However, this class fit very few of the stereotypes I had heard about. Yes, it's a challenging class full of memorization. But it is so doable if you put the time into it. You don't have to be scared of this class - rather, if you embrace the subject in all its complexity, you'll realize that it is actually quite fascinating. Professor Rablen is an excellent teacher and a wonderful person. His lectures are very understandable, the class is well organized, and the tests and quizzes are fair. This course is not for everyone, and I understand that the majority of students in the class only take it to meet a requirement. But I think that the course is actually a very valuable class and I would highly recommend Rablen as a teacher of organic chemistry.",
    "Organic chemistry is one of the hardest classes at Yale, period. You will devote more time to this class than any other class on your schedule, so keep that in mind when deciding what other classes to take. It probably goes without saying, but definitely do not take this class if it's not a requirement for your major or pre-med.",
    "For fun? Absolutely not. With this particular professor? I hope not. But if you need to take it, then...I recommend taking it with Prof. DiMeglio over the summer.",
    "Organic Chemistry is not a course you should take for fun. It is extremely concept-based, and if you miss one concept, you can set yourself for a course of disaster and long nights of miscomprehension. Be sure to keep up with the concepts (though not necessarily with the readings), and you will be fine.",
    "Take advantage of Professor Rablen while he's here! Definitely take Orgo I in the spring with him as long as he's here. He's probably the best orgo professor Yale hasever had.",
    "Although Professor Rablen will only be teaching for this year, I would definitely recommend taking orgo under him. He is a professor who truly wants to teach students in a way that they understand the material (instead of most science professors who seem to simply summarize the textbook).The class had required online psets which were helpful for making sure you at least somewhat understood the material, and then optional textbook psets with additional problems that professor Rablen wrote. There were three midterms, three quizzes, and a final (lowest grade dropped for the midterm and quizzes). Professor Rablen also made online practice quizzes and exams and problems, and had a plethora of other online resources available on classesv2. Looking back on this class, I think it was one of the most well-taught classes I have taken so far (taking into account both science and humanities classes that I've taken).",
    "Interesting but impossible. Only take if you're a chem major or premed and have to.",
    "Professor Rablen was fantastic, completely invested in the students and very clear in his instruction. The assessments were fair and I definitely learned a lot. I was very pleased with the course. If you must take orgo, I hope you get the chance to take it with Rablen. He makes the process all the more bearable.",
    "They tell you Orgo is hard, but they don't tell you how much work there is. Each concept is not too difficult, but it just takes so much time to read, practice, understand them all. You will do well if you devote enough time to it. To do well on exams, memorize all the mechanisms completely, and do all the practice problems you can get your hands on. Rablen is very willing to help you and very kind. Go to lecture and review sessions and you will learn to enjoy it.",
    "Organic Chemistry with Rablen was challenging, sometimes frustrating (as any organic chemistry lecture is bound to be), but overall incredibly rewarding. Rablen MADE the experience worthwhile, and he provided the materials and the necessary explanations in lecture that helped the class succeed. If you get the chance to take it with him- do not hesitate. He is a very skilled lecturer and is deeply invested in his students. Orgo is the one class where my grade does not wholly affect my opinion of Rablen or his lecture- he is just that good.",
    "Professor Rablen's orgo was difficult but a meaningful and interesting class to take. As opposed to memorization, deeper learning was emphasized. Online homework at times seemed tedious but provided a good grade-booster. The quizzes and midterms were, on the whole, pretty fair. Having the lowest scores dropped was pretty generous. I just wish Rablen were staying!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, as long as he is willing to put a good amount of time into learning the material. The class was well taught, the tests were fair, and the material was interesting. I was surprised how much I had learned by the end of the semester.",
    "CHEM 220 is a very difficult class that requires a lot of time and commitment and energy. You have to spend a ton of time focused on learning the material (like at least three times the amount of time you spend on your other classes) in order to do well in the class. The information learned is interesting but so complex. It is pretty horrible having to take this class... it is such a time suck that it ruins your semester. But it is a class that everyone takes because they have to not because they want to. So just put in the time and effort and try your best.",
    "I was stunned at how excellent this course was. I came into the semester dreading Orgo, having heard horror stories from Yalies who have taken it previously. Boy was I relieved! Don't get me wrong - Orgo is one of the hardest courses I've ever taken. What is required is not only mastery of complex concepts and memorization of complex techniques, but also the ability to apply them to novel situations. But (a) that can be as rewarding as it is challenging if you get into it, and (b) Professor Rablen made it possible to enjoy the course and not despair by being AMAZING.",
    "In terms of content, Chemistry 220 01 is a little dry.",
    "Only if the student needs to fulfill requirements.",
    "take the course. you learn a ton, and it's a fair course, especially considering that it's organic chemistry",
    "It is a thorough and challenging course in organic chemistry.",
    "Organic chemistry. Teacher is nice though",
    "Only take this class if you are premed or it is required for your major. Unless you absolutely love the class and are committed to put the effort in to do well, don't take it. It's a good class, just be wary.",
    "Yes. Study hard though because otherwise it will kill you.",
    "Not as bad as people make it sound. Definitely requires a lot of studying, but it's mostly memorization. In my experience, the professor (Rablen) and TA made every effort to help students be successful in the class, even postponing a test when students didn't do well on the quiz so they would have more time to study.",
    "Take Chem 220 only if you need it for your major, are a potential premed, or have a genuine interest in organic chemistry. Paul Rablen was a great organic chemistry professor, however, he is only here for one year. He taught well and graded fairly. His exams were a bit on the easier side than what was expected for this course.",
    "Orgo with Prof. Rablen was difficult, but I learned a lot. Unfortunately, Rablen will be leaving, so your experience with the class will be completely different. Either way, orgo will always be a topic that you must study intensively for. I think orgo gets a worse rep than it should, and I feel like I learned much more from orgo than gen chem.",
    "If you do not need to take this class do NOT. It has nothing to do with the teachers or the class but Orgo I found was so hard. Problem sets averaged around 50 questions and up to 70-75. Quizzes and tests were fair but it was hard (I thought) and very time consuming. If you do have to take this class do not bank on a curve to help you",
    "I would take it, because you probably have to take it if you're thinking of taking it. This is one of the better professor to teach the material, but he's a visiting professor and will probably only be here for one more semester.",
    "Orgo is tough but completely doable. You have to come in prepared to do a lot of studying, but it can be completely manageable. Make sure to get help if you need it because most of the time, a little extra explanation and practice is all you need to do well.",
    "If you're taking it, you probably have no choice. It is not an easy course, but Professor Rablen makes it a lot more enjoyable. You will learn a lot.",
    "If you are ever so lucky to get to take organic chemistry with Paul Rablen, do it.This was the most painless organic chemistry experience.At the end of the semester, you realize just how much you have learned in the short period. For the final he makes half of it a national ACS exam so you can rank yourself in a national context.Can't say how great a course this was. Wish he didn't have to go to back to Swarthmore.",
    "A great class if with Professor Rablen; he is very nice, teaches in a very lucid manner, and is extremely available outside of class.",
    "DIfficult but you probably won't take it unless you have to. Just know you'll have to buckle down and do the work.",
    "This class is really excellent. It's one of the best I've taken at Yale so far. I'm taking it as a chemical engineering major (which gives me a different perspective from taking it as a pre-med), but I found the material consistently interesting, and most people would agree that Prof. Rablen's teaching is fantastic. There are few things he could have explained more clearly, and few resources that he could have provided that he didn't to help the class learn orgo. I hope for Yale's sake that he somehow gets hired as a full-time professor, but he's supposed to be back at Swarthmore next year.",
    "Chem 220 is an Organic Chemistry course and includes different types of reactions, stereochemistry, and syntheses. I would recommend it for a fellow student.",
    "Exposure to fundamental concepts in Organic Chemistry. A lot of material covered, but if you work fairly hard and ask questions, you can get the underlying \"sense\" of the chemistry that's happening, which will help you on exams and on homework. Doing practice problems can really be beneficial, but don't stress out if you don't get them done or do them a night or two before the exam. A lot of people really liked Professor Rablen; he's knowledgeable and enthusiastic. I thought he was a little too enthusiastic at times, but it's really not a big deal.",
    "I would recommend this course because one gets a better understanding of why certain types of chemical interactions and reactions happen and it's a really insightful subject. However, I definitely put more time into this one course than all of the other courses I was taking combined, so you have to put in the work to understand the material.",
    "Tough but take it!",
    "Great class! Awesome! If you want to take orgo then now is the time to take it!",
    "A typical organic chemistry course that is not highy difficult if one keeps up with the work. Take the course if you are interested in the material, because the instructor did it justice, or if you need it for a requirement.",
    "If you have to take it, then you don't really have much of a choice",
    "Very difficult course due to a large amount of very confusing concepts that must be understood in addition to a large amount of memorization. I would not reccommend this class to someone who is not taking it as some type of requirement for something.",
    "CHEM220with Rablen is great. Because it is organic chemistry, there is definitely going to be a lot of reading and a lot of material to cover. However, Rablen is an extremely fair grader and is a fantastic lecturer. I got something out of each and every class I attended and felt extremely behind whenever I missed a class because he does such a good job of explaining things. Rablen is also really good about posting extra resources online. You can always find practice problems and study guides to help you through confusing topics and he answers questions on piazza very regularly.Overall, I would say that if you are planning on taking this class ever, take it with Rablen.",
    "Yes, definitely recommend this course if you want to thoroughly learn organic chemistry.",
    "If you must take it you should take it, and just put in the requires amount of work because it is really easy to slack off and get lost.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class, so long as you're prepared to study quite a bit outside of class and look for help whenever you need it.",
    "I would recommend CHEM 220 for any student. It was a great class. Although organic chemistry is an intimidating subject, Professor Rablen is a great teacher and made all the concepts easy to understand.",
    "Definitely take organic chemistry with Professor Rablen. He explains the concepts really well and organizes the topics so that we learn the fundamental concepts well before moving onto the harder chapters. I really not only learned the hard concepts of organic chemistry, but learned them well with Professor Rablen.",
    "DO NOT EVER NO JUST DON'T FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.",
    "Chem 220 is a very good course that continues a rigorous scientific major. I would recommend it to others (as long as they are serious about chemistry\/biology and\/or enjoy chemistry). It really did a good job with a very difficult subject.",
    "It's freaking hard---but if you read book before class, pay attention in class--it should be a slice of cake. Not a piece of cake--it's actually a tough course. Don't be discouraged, though. Do the homework and practice tests and you'll be fine!",
    "It is kind of like learning a new language. Thus, it takes a lot of time to learn it. But once you do, life will never be the same in a good or possibly bad way. I enjoyed it, so yah give it a shot.",
    "Prof Rablen does a great job and introducing students to organic chemistry. Make sure to attend lectures and follow him through the book. He also sets plenty of opportunities to further understand the material.",
    "The course material was challenging. Prof. Rablen presented the material well and was particularly helpful in office hours.",
    "Definitely take this course!!!! I never thought I would enjoy organic chemistry so much but this course changed my outlook completely. Everything was taught in such an easily-understandable manner and there were so many resources to really understand the material if not understood in lecture. Be prepared to work a lot, however, to really understand the material.",
    "Standard chemistry course. Chapters build on previous chapters so getting behind is bad, but if you stay on top of everything, it is not difficult.",
    "I would recommend this course for another student because it is an interesting course.",
    "Difficult. But you have to do it.",
    "It's a requirement for so many things, you probably will take it because you have to do so, Bonus points if you end up enjoying it.",
    "It's a challenge, and you're likely not taking it unless you have to, but it's a worthwhile one. Unfortunately you may not have Prof. Rablen (who's excellent - good lecturer and very understanding of the workload), who taught our class as a visiting professor, but you'll cover the same material. Of necessity, it's a heavy workload, but Prof. Rablen gives out good problem sets, and the required portion is actually fairly light, while the recommended material is quite useful for test and quiz preparation. It's very satisfying once you startto understand it, and you will learn a lot of material. And the grading isn't brutal - one dropped quiz and one dropped midterm out of three each, with relatively easy online p-sets. I don't usually study with others, but group study before tests and quizzes was very helpful Bottom line, it was a lot of fun and I learned a whole lot, so I'd recommend it."
