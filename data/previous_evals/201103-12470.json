    "Math 112 moves through the basics of calculus rather quickly and requires a lot of time spent on your own studying the material. Just because you have a decent understanding of basic calculus does not mean that this class will be in any way easy for you. What I thought would be an easy QR turned into a semester of stress that will bring down my GPA. I absolutely would not recommend this class to anyone, particularly someone simply looking to fill a QR requirement. The textbook was awful and so were the exams. I",
    "I only took it because I had too for my major. It teaches you calculus, which is the goal of the class. It is by no means fun, however, and I am simply glad that it's over.",
    "I would not recommend the course simply because there is a lack of professors to teach the course. While some of the graduate students are great, it's a lot more difficult to learn from a student than from a professor.",
    "Its Calculus... Make sure to shop the different sections that fit your schedule."
