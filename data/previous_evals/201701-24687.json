   "comments": [
    "Through this course I learned completely new theoretical frameworks for understanding society. We studied the milieu approach in depth, but also learned about the works of Weber, Marx, Beck, and other influential thinkers. We learned to look at these Western-centric theories with a critical and analytical lens. Focusing on specific case-studies of different countries and even cities in the Global South in the latter part of the course allowed us to solidify our understandings of the concepts we learned.",
    "In addition to the specifics of understanding and constructing milieux, this course served as an introduction to some of the methods and theories behind the study of social stratification in sociology. The assignments also helped me build skills comparing and critiquing both theoretical and empirical texts.",
    "I developed a new framework for identifying social stratification in the developing and developed world. We also worked on writing techniques and skills which was useful.",
    "Different methods on social stratification that take into account the differences in socail hierarchies (especially in comparison to EuroAmerican perspectives)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The structure of the course was well though out, and the readings were well-selected. We started out learning about conceptions of class, lifestyle analysis, modernization theory, and other sociological frameworks. We were then able to apply these frameworks to different countries and cities in the global south. Throughout the semester, the conversations became increasingly rich and insightful.",
    "This course was a strong introduction to a little-discussed field, and it was very helpful to have someone with such deep expertise in it be the instructor. I appreciated the balance of theory and application in the readings, and prof. Stoll's eagerness to involve everyone in class discussions. I would have appreciated devoting a bit more time to discussion of the methodology.",
    "The framework was interesting and the material was engaging but I have had difficulty grappling with how to approach the assignments. Cultural sociology is complex and the research required for the assignments is very different to what I have normally been exposed to at Yale.",
    "I loved how intimate the class was. It made it easier to ask questions (especially when you did not have a background in sociology). Professor Stoll was very supportive and would help us work on our paper outlines and drafts before the final deadline. He was also very willing to meet with us if we were struggling with any concepts, made the class incredibly accessible."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, but only if they were willing to fully engage with the work. If a student took this course without a desire to learn, they would truly be missing out, because I have learned so much from this course. This is definitely amongst the most challenging (in a good way) and enjoyable courses I have taken at Yale, and professor Stoll makes it even better. The readings are super interesting too! Additionally, the workload is very very reasonable, and Professor Stoll is very helpful with the papers.",
    "This course dealt with a unique area of sociology that allowed for comprehensive discussions of social stratification and development through a lens other than economics. The readings were very interesting, and readily accessible to non-sociology majors (with some effort required at times), and there was always a lot of time for involved discussions in class.",
    "Yes, it is incredibly important to understand and development frameworks for understanding social differentiation. The Milieu approach is engaging, different and opens up ones mind when defining populations and their interaction with culture, consumption and values.",
    "Yes, would recommend. It's unfortunate that this wont be offered in future years as Professor Stoll will be leaving. Great class, the readings were really interesting and the types of readings varied a lot. Also, very accessible (Professor offered a lot of support in terms of writing papers and understanding concepts) and just a great learning environment overall.. He really allowed us to take over in terms of discussions in class (based on our questions, concerns and experiences)."
