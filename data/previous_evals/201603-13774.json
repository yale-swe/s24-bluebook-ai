    "The homework ended up being much more time consuming than I prefer when compared to how much I felt I learned from the assignments. Part of this was because there were so many assignments, and each one had elements that we did not cover in class. I think having some parts of this is good, but overall I felt there was too much trying to figure out what the assignments were calling for."

That project was when things started to click for me, but whether or not I was truly doing it right will be a variable until we get them back.",
