   "comments": [
    "African American Arts Today was a really amazing course. We covered a large range of artistic forms within the current black culture and many important themes were approached within the arts. This class homework consisted of one 500-word paper a week on a the subject on the table for that weeks lecture. This often meant reading a novel or a book of poems in a short period of time and then writing a paper on it. If someone is interested in all forms of art (novel, poetry, visual, film, dance) then this is an excellent class.",
    "An experience that just can't be said to have been worth it on the whole. You get exposure to a variety of black artists across mediums but the subject matter often felt distantly irrelevant.",
    "It was a good course where important, understudied material is featured.",
    "Yes! Take a class with Elizabeth Alexander before graduating, she has the most beautiful voice and so much interesting insight to share.",
    "It was a very interesting experience that I overall enjoyed. It's hardy to say the tangible knowledge I received, but it definitely expanded my knowledge of African American artists and I've got to think that that counts for a lot.",
    "If you're looking for a survey course on modern black art, sure.However, I'd be weary to take this course without some sort of foundation in the critique of art history.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to a student interested in African American Art. It is a great class to learn about contemporary art in an academic setting. It is a fair amount of work though, so stay on top of it.",
    "Many artists and topics will be covered. The lectures are very informative and contextualize the diverse curriculum. They are great. Speakers are hit and miss, but you will hear all types of artists talk about their processes and influences. The key part of this course is to highlight a contemporary moment in black art and how it has and will influence academic research and artistic trends."
