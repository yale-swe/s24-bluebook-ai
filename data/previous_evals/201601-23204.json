    "This class is awesome. Definitely not a gut course but I would highly recommend for anyone looking for a science credit. Especially for those who are not the best at taking exams. Weekly reading responses, participation, and a smaller group project help alleviate the pressure for the midterm and final. The class is extremely organized and is not intimidating for students new to the material while simultaneously challenging those who are more well versed. The professors are super supportive. The lectures are interesting. The discussion sections are engaging. Just take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Nutrition and the Brain to students! Expect to work, but don't be scared off if you haven't studied much psychology before. This course is accessible to everyone, and is a fabulous course!",
    "Yes I definitely would, especially to psych majors on the neuroscience track.",
    "Great class, overall! The workload is manageable and the topics very interesting. Would recommend if you're curious about how what you eat affects how your brain works.",
    "Yes, but i would suggest they know something about neuroscience.",
    "Tuesdays were lecture, Thursdays were discussion of a short empirical study paper. Light workload, interesting topic, supportive professors. Work consists of a maximum one-page single spaced reading response due each week on the paper, short presentation on nutrition claims in popular media, and two hour-long midterms with good reviews to help you prepare. Professors are very helpful and work really hard to make sure you understand the material. Material is engaging and very applicable to real life. I recommend!",
    "Great class if you're interested in food\/nutrition and the brain at all! It's definitely more science heavy than other psychology classes, but the concepts are explained very clearly so you can definitely do well even without having a science background. It's also great that this is a small class b\/c that allowed us to have discussions once a week instead of having lecture both days.",
    "Take it--first half is more molecular and not as obviously applicable nutrition but it gets there",
    "yes, would definitely recommend if you have an interest in nutrition and\/or the brain,",
    "Interesting class, get to learn about the effects of the different nutrients on your brain and body; sometimes boring",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the material. It's a good science credit because we did read scientific papers every week but if you don't want a science credit than that may be annoying to you. The material towards the end of the semester is relevant and interesting if you want to know more about how eating bad foods can effect the brain and body.",
    "Great class because of Robert's teaching style. I can imagine that this class may be more stressful under a different instructor.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, and although it is my personal field of interest, it is also very accessible to people of other majors. It was the best taught, best organized class I have taken at Yale, and therefore my favorite. I appreciated how it challenged me in a reasonable way and I really learned a lot from this course."
