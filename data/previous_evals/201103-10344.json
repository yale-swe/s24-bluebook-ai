   "comments": [
    "I will strongly recommend this course for 3rd year students.",
    "Yes. It is a great class for students working with mesoscopic systems.",
    "In summary, Mesoscopic Physics is very useful and powerful for students or even researchers who want to do relevant research. Although it's a difficult course, we can really learn a lot from it. Therefore I'd like to recommend this course to other students.",
    "Need to do extra reading to understand everything, but certainly would recommend to someone going into quantum computing or mesoscopic research.",
    "This semester's course set out to investigate two broad areas of mesoscopic physics (in past years, the syllabus has been slightly altered). The first--quantum circuits--is essential for anyone working on the 4th floor of Becton. Professor Devoret starts from describing the Hamiltonian for a given quantum circuit and finishes with a discussion of the devices employed by the superconducting qubit world--Cooper Pair Box, Transmon, etc. In the second half of the course, we moved to describing conduction in mesoscopic conductors, in particular, motivating and describing the Landauer picture of transport.I would recommend this course to anyone interested in mesoscopic physics, unconditionally. Even, if you have concerns about the level of the course (as I did), Professor Devoret works hard to motivate the material from the beginning, and APHY 634 is generally a self contained course.",
    "I would recommend it to people who have not taken Many-Body theory, and I would not recommend it to those who have as the material is mostly a repeat."

   "comments": [
    "its very useful and a nice course, except for the fact that the assignments are very hard to do and the TA didnot have specific office hours.",
    "The course definitely laid the foundation knowledge that I need and will build upon for my research in superconducting quantum information. I find that is was very helpful in explaining the physics behind the aspects of many of the experiments that are performed in my lab.",
    "This course gives me a deeper understanding of mesoscopic physical process. The concepts and analyses taught in the course are necessary to me to develop my own research in future.",
    "As my research is in the area of quantum mesoscopic circuits, the material in APHY 634 is likely one of the most important courses I can take. Indeed, I do not think any of the lectures in the course would not be useful in the future for my research.",
    "This course was very relevant to my field of study."
