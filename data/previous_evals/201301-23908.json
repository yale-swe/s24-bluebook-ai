    "I was underexposed to Aureli's past projects before taking the studio and was interested purely on his presentation during the studio lottery. That being the case, I was not familiar with Aureli's method of work and expected a standard urbanism studio with the typical spatial analysis, f.a.r. research, zoning research, that sort of thing. Well, I was wrong. The methods for research were far more interesting, but they were very directed, almost dictatorial.",
    "The process of pure research for the first half of the term was unusual but ultimately very fruitful. We were able to begin the design process with a very clear idea and approach to design.",
    "I wanted to take a step away from the typical \"make pretty pictures\" studio. This gave me the opportunity to really develop a thought process behind our creations. My expectations of the studio were met and exceeded two fold.",
    "I had high expectations but they were greatly exceeded. It was a privilege to be a part of the studio."
