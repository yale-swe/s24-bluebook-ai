    "I would and do highly recommend not just this course but Prof. Faragher.",
    "Yes - best readings course I have taken here. Consider even if you don't think you're interested in the topic, as it's organized thematically, and most are the same themes you'd cover in a general US survey. Really heavy reading load, and to a certain extent you'll get out what you put in. Writing assignments are extremely practical and not hard (learn to write a 500-word book review, put together a syllabus for a course you will teach).",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend it. It's an excellent class with excellent readings that is full of great discussions about a fundamental part of American history.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course because it was very interesting and taught more than any other course I took this semester.",
    "History 738 is a readings course that introduces students to several major topics in Western history and provides a thorough grounding in the historiography of the field. Each week, students examine a topic in Western history (for instance, violence, women, or capitalism), for which students read a book and five to eight historiographic articles. Written work consists of five short book reviews and either a western history syllabus or a mock dissertation prospectus in western history.I would highly recommend this course to other students. It challenges you to become familiar with several historiographic issues and trends in the field and to think deeply about the ways historians construct the West in their work. It provides multiple frameworks for considering the West as a process and\/ora place, for considering the multiple interactions (economic, social, cultural, political) and diverse peoples involved in shaping the West, and for considering the place of the West in the US and in a global context. Even if you don't think of yourself as a Western historian, it would prove extremely useful for developing your toolbox as a historian and for deepening (and perhaps altering) the way you think about the content and writing of American history.",
    "I would recommend the course and the professor and most especially, readings and the books which were terrific.",
    "HIST 738 is excellent at distilling the important themes and unresolved debates within the field, but it is also rich in detail and information. The readings are excellent and well-balanced between very new scholarship (e.g. Comanche Empire, Making Indian Law, Shadows at Dawn) and older books that simply haven't been surpassed (e.g. Nature's Metropolis, The Middle Ground).",
    "A very interesting course with a great professor and an excellent reading list.",
    "I would highly recommend it, and I already have to incoming students."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent preparation for orals. No research component, but discussions shaped how I will approach my dissertation.",
    "This course helped me a lot, and a lot of the readings and discussions will be helpful for my orals and dissertation.",
    "not applicable for me just now as I am not yet aGraduate student. it did, however, make me even more interested in the discipline and subject and in history, anthropology and politics as well as the literature and cultural portrayals of the West.",
    "I feel that the course, in addition to the topical or field-specific material, was also an excellent demonstration of various historical methodologies and tools. We had books that were forbidding syntheses of large masses of already published secondary material as well as books that were incredibly rich in archival work. We had legal history and environmental history and social history and economic history; we had books that were pitched to undergraduates, books that could easily reach a general audience, and books that seemed best suited for informing highly specialized scholarship. There was so much here to take with me as I approach my own work.",
    "This course was central to my studies at Yale and to my future career."
