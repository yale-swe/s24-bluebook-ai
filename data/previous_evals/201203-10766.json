Being \"Teaching Practicum,\" of course, this class had as its main goal to teach us how to teach. And, in my case at least, I think it really did help me to prepare for being a TF next year.",
    "I got a lot out of the discussions we had in 990, as well as from the teaching observations and experience that the course requires; I think I have a clearer and better informed perspective on undergraduate teaching as a result."
