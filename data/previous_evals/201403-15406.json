   "comments": [
    "This course was great! It's an interesting look at the history of asylum from the ancient Greeks to today. It's a very multi-disciplinary course that explores concepts of refugeehood and asylum from the perspective of history, law, and even literature.",
    "HIST406J is a great seminar that combines history, legal theory, and practical applications of the concept of asylum to broaden students' understanding of international refugee systems. The way the course is structured builds very logically upon itself, so that each discussion can pull on other weeks and readings. The various approaches to asylum that are presented allow students to fit the course into other interests or areas of study, whether philosophy, history, medicine, law, or anthropology. In this way, the course, while focusing on a rather specific topic, is immensely valuable across a range of disciplines. While the syllabus includes a larger number of written assignments than many courses would require, these papers and projects are generally short and build on each other in a meaningful way. It is clear that Professor Leaman has thought carefully about how each assignment should fit into the course and help students develop writing and analytical skills.",
    "If you are very interested in asylum law, I would take it. It gives you the opportunity to really understand this topic and flex your legal reasoning. The assignments were very enjoyable. Just make sure to be clear on what is wanted in each assignment as these kind of assignments are very different.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone, especially people who are interested in the modern politics surrounding refugees and asylum. The historical context of the refugee\/asylum system greatly informs its current workings. Professor Leaman also contextualizes the course with very interesting essays and art, including films, that humanize research and theory.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in refugee issue."
