   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It gives a wonderful introduction of the Russian 18th-century, and actually makes you think about the further development of Russian literature in a different manner. The course works great as a historical, as well as a literary survey of the period.",
    "Even though it is part of the distribution requirement, I would highly recommend RUS 608 to any aspiring Slavicist. Having very little knowledge of the period prior to the course, the class has given me much insight into the historio-cultural setting as well as the early polemics of this literature. It has also greatly helped my understanding of both 19th and 20th century literature, as well as broadening my awareness of both American and Russian academic scholarship on the subject."

   "comments": [
    "It definitely gave me a valuable insight into my discipline, as it encouraged me to think about the development of Russian literature in a new way. I feel I have a better grasp of Russian literary history at large because of this course. I do not know to what extent the course will be helpful for my research, but it is comforting to know that I no longer have a century-long hole in my knowledge of Russian letters."
