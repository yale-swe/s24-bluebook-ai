    "Intense, difficult, not the best professor, but the texts are significant",
    "History and Politics in Early China is a unique course taught by a unique professor. Students considering History and Politics should know: -This is a course in philosophy, not history. Professor China assigned two secondary source readings for historical background at the beginning of the course, but after that we only read philosophical texts. -Professor Chin is very enthusiastic about the curriculum and has engaged personally with these texts for her entire life, so she has strong personal opinions on how to read certain works. -Professor Chin did not communicate her expectations clearly. We did not receive a single grade through the semester and comments on papers were sparse. Overall, I enjoyed this course because it stoked my interest in the history of Chinese political thought. I think this course is a good fit for anyone with even a remote interest in Chinese political philosophy. But students should be prepared to struggle with some difficult texts.",
    "I would take this class if you are interested in political philosophy. If you are just looking to learn the basic history of this time period this class will not provide that.",
    "An in-depth look into ancient Chinese politics and thinkers.",
    "Early China is really about the founding culture, intellectual environment, and political thought of the period. These ideas remain the pillars of China and Confucian societies today, so it is really an important topic to learn about. However, don't expect blow by blow, 230 BC Battle of XYZ and 13 BC XYZ person did XYZ. This is really more of a class about ideas rather than specific events. For me, it was not what I expected, but it was perfect. I loved exploring the works of Confucian, Mencius, Han Fei, and other Chinese thinkers. Professor Chin is super enthusiastic and her excitement is infectious. She is so passionate and that for me, really made this class a joy to go to. I learned so much and was constantly pushed. A must take if at all you're interested in Chinese culture!",
    "Would not take this again and would not recommend it to another student based on my experience. I just wanted to gain some more knowledge about Ancient China and its political history but this was not the class for that. Attend some shopping period classes and see for yourself if this is right for you."
