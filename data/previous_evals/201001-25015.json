    "This class is a great chance to work on your ear-training skills (sight singing and dictations). Day to day it felt like I wasn't growing much, but in the end I can hear chord progressions and melodies in music a lot easier and more clearly. The class was fun and minimally stressful - the only homework really was preparing for keyboard labs, which weren't that difficult. It's an easy way to get half a credit and learn some useful skills. Take the class with Sarita if she's still teaching it - she was great.",
    "I would recommend all musicians to take it because it is so useful for any type of instrument.",
    "You can add this class to your schedule without worrying much about workload and get your ear up to par. Keyboard lab will get annoying but you'll be glad you did it in the end.",
    "Sarita is the reason why I passed this class. She is so willing to meet with students outside of class and help you if you are struggling in the class. She is also really awesome :]The class was a good experience although it was definitely not my easiest class this semester. No matter what level you come into this class with, you will improve dramatically in terms of dictation, sight singing, and general musicianship.",
    "If you want to be able to hear music and write it down, or see written music and know what it will sound like, this course is for you! It will help so much with your sight-reading\/singing, notating, and knowledge of chords. Sarita is really nice and full of energy. Take it!",
    "This was a great course. I took it not simultaneously with music theory, and it was still very beneficial. Great if you need a 1\/2 credit, or even if you don't. All musicians (even non- music majors) should take this sequence!Take it with Sarita if you can - she is a great teacher and makes the class really enjoyable and you learn a lot!"
