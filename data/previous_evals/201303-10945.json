   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this as a good intro history class, but again not social history.",
    "I would say that this course is extremely interesting but requires a LOT of reading.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student with an interest in the subject, or in American history in general. Freeman is a fantastic lecturer and the workload is very manageable. The course is not very date\/fact based--the midterms and final are more concerned with general themes. You read some great books and learn some fantastic anecdotes from lecture. Overall, a wonderful course! You will not regret taking it.",
    "Take it. No joke. Take it with Michael Hattem.",
    "It depends. If you are particularly interested in what life was like around the time of the Revolution in addition to a more cursory discussion of the politics and economics of the time, then this would be a great course for you. Otherwise, it is still a good and interesting class, but can feel a bit unfulfilling. The workload isn't too bad: about 100 pages of reading a week, two essays, midterm, and a final. Professor Freeman is also a great lecturer.",
    "Professor Freeman is just amazing. She is a great lecturer and her enthusiasm just pervades the lecture hall.",
    "A more in depth cover of the revolution than any high school US history class would cover. Nuanced and interesting. The reading for section was too much, as with every history course, but some of it was really relevant and interesting. Lectures were interesting, freeman is engaging and funny, though didn't always completely keep my attention. All together not painless or painful.",
    "This class is really fun. Dr. Freeman's lectures are usually very entertaining, and the reading is enjoyable (if you choose to do it). IT is not terribly difficult, so it is a nice 5th credit.",
    "Great class - professor Freeman's enthusiasm is infectious and she does a great job infusing life into this time period in American history with anecdotes and her obvious passion for the subject. Definitely take it if you want a good class in American history that isn't too difficult.",
    "Absolutely! This is a wonderful course with an excellent professor.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. Prof. Freeman is such an engaging lecturer and its obvious that she is passionate about the subject. She's very approachable as well. The workload isn't too bad either--one 3-5 page paper, midterm, a 7-9 page paper, a final, and section. Everything was really spread out as well so the work was never overwhelming, nor was the reading for section, so it's beneficial if you actually do the reading. Great class.",
    "Take it for the Professor, or if you need a not so hard history class.",
    "Yeah, absolutely. A fun history class and we can all use more of those. The revolution was really important (no shit) and while you already know a lot about it, this class both fills in the gaps and changes your lens in a very satisfying way. But only if you do the readings.",
    "A good course. Not too much work (the readings can be dry, but you should do fine if you don't get to all of them) -- 2 essays, 2 tests. The lectures and readings were okay and expanded my understanding of the Revolution, but mostly I enjoyed Professor Freeman's lecturing style -- her enthusiasm and deep knowledge of the period really shows.",
    "Such a good intro history class. Professor Freeman is, as everyone knows, a fantastic and engaging lecturer; she truly loves the topic, and I'm pretty sure most of us left the class loving the topic, too. Readings were generally interesting; they also came from a variety of different interpretations of the Revolution (Whig, populist, social, political, etc.), which is very important when you're learning about the Revolution for the first time. Assessments (one short paper, one long paper, a midterm and a final) were very fair. The American Revolution (and the origins of the Constitution, which we cover a bit at the end of the term) is such an important time period, and this class is the best way to understand it.",
    "This was a pretty interesting class, taught by an incredible professor! The lectures are really engaging and filled with great anecdotes that are fun to listen to, but not tested. The reading can be a lot at times, but it is not directly tested in ID's on the exam (although you will be expected to know the general themes for the essay question). My only warning for this class is that if you studied this period in high school, you will see A LOT of the same material. The professor does a good job of adding social and idealogical aspects of the revolution to the course, but ultimately you are still studying things like the Boston Tea Party and the Battle of Bunker Hill again which can can get old. Therefore, if you know the revolution pretty pretty well, I'd recommend taking a different history class.",
    "I would, and have recommended History 116 to my friends. It is a thrilling class.",
    "A non-traditional look at the American Revolution. Pretty standard Yale history lecture course: two exams, two papers. I do wish the lectures covered more of the classic Revolution events; it often was hard to follow the trajectory of the course. At its root, this course attempts to answer the question: \"Was the Revolution radical or conservative?\"",
    "American Revolution is an INCREDIBLE course. Joanne Freeman is probably one of the best professors at Yale. Her lectures were extremely interesting and engaging, as she is clearly so very passionate and knowledgeable about the subject. She is the cutest person ever and makes little jokes all the time AND has a James Madison action figure. The readings for the course were interesting to read and provided various perspectives on the Revolution. There were two papers, a midterm, and a final, all very fair. I had not taken a history course before and am definitely not going to be a history major, but would recommend this course to ANYONE at Yale.",
    "It's a pretty good class. If you're really interested in the Revolutionary era it's probably a great class. I just didn't find the subject matter to be the most fascinating. Joanne Freeman is a really fun professor, she takes a lot of joy in studying and teaching about this era.",
    "Take it!!!",
    "Take the course if you already have a basic understanding of the revolution, if not you'll be inundated with work. That being said, if you already have this basic understanding you wont leave with much useful knowledge.",
    "This is not a fact-fest. Those of APUSH or similar courses have been there before. We've crammed the facts, binged on the battles, Quizletted the names, and drowned ourselves in the orders of events and the dates. And we've forgotten a lot of what we learned. No, this course is radically different: it is about the themes, ideologies, and concepts of the Revolution, and as such is a course not about KNOWING what-happened, but UNDERSTANDING it. It is a fantastic course for this reason. For those like me who have an inkling toward Political Philosophy as well as American history, this is a great course to start. If not, it's worth your time to recognize origins of this nation. I recommend this class. It really isn't that hard.A word for the wise: all of the lectures are on Yale Open's online courses. Videos, transcripts, you name it. I personally found the transcripts more helpful than the lectures for understanding the core materials of the course. Eventually, I stopped going to lectures altogether, reading all the lecture transcripts instead. Whether you go to lecture or not, I highly encourage you use those transcripts to supplement the material and make sure you have a strong grasp at it.Also, do the readings. If you're going to enroll in this class, do yourself a favor and read everything that's assigned. I cut corners, and I know I did well in the class, but I regret missing what I missed.",
    "The course gives you a very interesting social history of the American Revolution. Professor Freeman is an amazing lecturer and the TA's are also phenomenal.",
    "Really good course taught by an awesome professor.",
    "History 116 is a great overview of the political, economic and social effects of the American Revolution- the events prior to the War itself and the drafting of the Constitution afterwards.",
    "This class is fantastic. There's one short creative assignment, a longer paper, a midterm, and a final exam. Professor Freeman is a lot of fun \u00e2\u0080\u0094 half the class is just her telling anecdotes. Take it!!",
    "I would summarize it as a new approach to early American History that provides the students with a lot of meat for discussion. I would recommend it.",
    "Yes. Great readings and enjoyable lectures. Pretty easy.",
    "This class is absolutely sublime, and Professor Freeman is one of the best lecturers I've yet encountered at Yale. This isn't your run-of-the-mill facts and dates class on the American Revolution\u00e2\u0080\u0094the course is taught assuming that you know the basic details and such to an AP US history level. The course delves into the fascinating social forces precipitating and fulfilling the Revolution. Its lessons are readily applicable to studies of developing nations around the world, and simply going to lecture every week will give you a new perspective on your citizenship and new enthusiasm for the American political process. It will convert even the most jaded cynic into a public activist. In fact, I'm an MCDB major, but after taking this course, I seriously considered switching to history.Practical stuff:-Lots of readingeach week, but you only need to do around half each week to get by-2 papers, both of which are very manageable and interesting to write-midterm and exam are both reasonable and very straightforward",
    "An excellent overview of the American Revolution. Even if you think you know about this period of American history, you would enjoy this class. It goes into depth for the key events, studies the principal figures and analyses the general trends, all in a very effective and exciting way.",
    "I would recommend this course to others. It meets twice a week with section once a week. Professor Freeman makes lecture entertaining, and students learn more in-depth material than in AP U.S. History in high school. However, sometimes the reading can vary and be hard to keep up with at times. Skim them if there isn't enough time, but this is a good course to take.",
    "Yes! Take the course--you'll love it.",
    "A really really great survey of a subject you have probably already learned a lot about. Professor Freeman's hilarious lecture style and fascinating anecdotes makes this class totally worth it.",
    "Please take this class, with Professor Freeman, it's one of the best at Yale. I'm a history major, but even for non-majors, the content is straight forward enough and the lecturer good enough to make it a great class.",
    "An interesting course in the founding of our nation.",
    "A great course about a fascinating period of history. Professor Freeman is an outstanding lecturer who will keep you entertained throughout the semester. The TAs are also very good. Take it.",
    "I would, but with some hesitation. It's an interesting course, but never mind-blowing.",
    "I loved it, even if it was a little basic at times. Professor freeman is incredibly engaging and she makes the material very fun to go over.",
    "Lots of very amusing stories, but not the most rigorous history course I've taken. For that reason, I probably would not recommend this class to another student.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course. The material is interesting, and the Professor is great.",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS. It's SO INTERESTING, so well taught, Professor Freeman is AMAZING, such a fun, funny, and engaged lecturer. Sections were interesting, the readings were interesting, can't say enough great things about this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend History 116. Professor Freeman is awesome, the workload is manageable (although sometimes the reading can be extensive), and the 2 tests are very fair (ID's and an essay question for the midterm, ID's and 2 essay questions for the final). Take this class if you have any interest in history.",
    "Take this class! You're going to learn things about the American Revolution that you otherwise would never learn. Professor Freeman makes it enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to history majors and non-majors alike; the class is a brilliant analysis of the Revolution and at the same time serves as a good introduction for anyone beginning to study history at the college level.",
    "It's a nice History lecture on an important period. If you're interested in Law or History, I'd recommend it, but it is not a must-take.",
    "I would recommend it. I would summarize this course as a class where you learn everything about the American Revolution. I would also say that it's a fun class that anyone interested in history would enjoy.",
    "Good class. Not the best history class I have taken but definitely worth your time. If you are interested in the Revolution in particular or American history in general it is a fun and interesting.",
    "Yes, it's a class you don't want to miss, if you want to know more about the foundation of America.",
    "If you aren't a history major, definitely take the class. You will learn about a critical era in US history and gain an understanding of what excites historians from Prof. Freeman's entertaining lectures. If you are a history major, still take the class, but make sure you do all the reading so you get the most out of it because there are a lot of anecdotes in her lecture that take up some of the time.",
    "If you know a decent amount about the Revolution and are interested in taking another look at it with a great professor, sign up. You wont go wrong.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! I loved the course and really learning about the American Revolution, believe me, you did not learn everything in high school.",
    "If you want to learn about the American Revolution, there is no one better to do it than with Freeman. She knows the period well enough to be on a nickname basis with the Founders.",
    "I would recommend the course. The course load is not particularly heavy and the lectures are fun and engaging. An interesting look at a topic Americans in particular should be more knowledgable of.",
    "This course was not quite what I expected, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It looks at the origins of the American Revolution and puts it into a very moment-by-moment perspective. Focus on the intellectual and social propellants of the revolution changed my outlook on history; the readings were all engaging and influenced the way I analyze readings for all my courses. (There is quite a bit of reading; not all is necessary to do well, but do all you can because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just so interesting!) Professor Freeman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s enthusiasm was refreshing and inspiring. Take a course with her if at all possible!! I would definitely recommend this course to my peers.",
    "Absolutely. The class is lovely. You'll get past whatever you covered in high school. Professor Freeman is incredibly lovely, and her lectures are always filled to the brim with amusing and charming little quotations and anecdotes that make even going to lectures a reward. It's a fine history course, not too hard, but real. It's good. Go take it.",
    "It is a study of the American Revolution from several different perspectives."
