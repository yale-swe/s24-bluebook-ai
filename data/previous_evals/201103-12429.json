    "This class exposed me to a world\/culture that I had never gotten to know before. The world of early Christian monasticism is fascinating.",
    "The Making of Monasticism is a fantastic history seminar that teaches you about the early Catholic monastic tradition, from the desert fathers to St. Benedict; the focus is primarily on 4th century Egyptian monasticism. This may seem like a narrow and potentially dry topic (doesn\u0092t all the cool stuff happen in the Middle Ages? you might ask), but it was actually fascinating to understand the foundations for the more modern monasticism you may or may not be familiar with. Professor Layton is a great teacher, very knowledgeable, approachable, and a good discussion leader \u0096 the two hour time block flew by. The class is structured in an interesting way, using different approaches (ie economic, archaeological, theological) to the study of this phenomenon each week. For each class, you prepare a 1 page answer to the Question of the Week; it is expected that after reading the book for the week, you respond concisely and with lots of data and no BS. For this reason, you will get the most out of the class and do well if you take the time to read carefully and answer thoughtfully. Other work for the class includes one book report (your choice from a list provided), a 5 page midterm paper, and a 9 page final paper, both on a topic of your choice, researching straight from the primary sources. I worked hard for this class, and I got so much out of it \u0096definitely take it if you\u0092re willing to do the same!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone else."
