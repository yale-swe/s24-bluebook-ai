   "comments": [
    "If you want great and slightly uncomfortable discussions with a very diverse group of people, this is the class for you.",
    "Absolutely, if it is taught again, do whatever you have to to take it. Smith is wonderful.",
    "This course is fantastic. The combination of thought-provoking readings with an attentive and caring professor makes this seminar one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The main strength of the course is its format: every week half of the students are responsible for writing a 2-page reading response, which guarantees that at least half the class will talk about readings they actually read. Professor Smith is one of the most attentive and caring professors I have met during my time at Yale. As a person, he deeply cares about students and their thoughts. As a professor, he leads class discussions efficiently and effectively: he points outto students the flaws in their arguments while also ensuring that students fully understand a claim before criticizing it. You should DEFINITELY take this course.",
    "I would highly recommend any course with Professor Smith. Professors Smith and Latham do an exception job with bioethics-related courses at Yale. They teach differently and have a different bent on bioethics, but both are wonderful, professors whose classes you enjoy being in and a part of.",
    "If Smith is still teaching it, take this class! You get to have some interesting discussions, and he's one of the nicest professors at Yale.",
    "Readings on capital punishment, end-of-life care, self-defense, just wars, etc. Readings each week (generally a non-oppressive amount) and a short analytical\/argumentative paper every other week. Emphasis in class is almost entirely on discussion and debate.",
    "Definitely take it! Very thought-provoking and interesting subject matter.",
    "Absolutely; the material is interesting, the professor is amazing, and the class has a good workload. Professor Smith is very nice and is willing to help his students. Attend office hours, put time into your assignments, and enjoy the material because it touches on important concepts that not many Yale courses introduce you to. I recommend talking to Professor Smith outside the classroom as well.",
    "Take the class! Do the reading and you'll have a pretty stress free semester.",
    "I would recommend this class, mostly because of the Professor who's just really interesting and great to talk to and be in a seminar with. He carefully guides class discussion and student input, and furthermore he always gives off the impression that he truly cares about students.",
    "This course is about the ethics of killing people - either in the case of execution, physician-assisted suicide, abortion, or war. This puts it a little bit beyond the scope of a pure bioethics course, but the crossover is such that addressing the whole topic is well justified.The course requires one 2-page paper every two weeks, and a longer, ~10 page paper at the end of the semester, and a presentation given for it beforehand. And participation, of course.",
    "As Prof. Smith says himself, it's less bioethics and more the ethics of death. As such, it is a far cry from Steven Latham's bioethics courses, but is a breath of fresh air, as you realize through readings of Singer and Aquinas, treatments of capital punishment, and books on the ethics of war, that the questions of bioethics are inseparable from ethics in general.If you're interested in ethics, much less bioethics, take this course: Professor Smith's discussion format (one response paper every two weeks; those who write a response paper lead discussions) had the class always running over time, as there always was more to discuss, and Smith himself is just the icing on the cake.",
    "Each week there's a different discussion, based on readings, on a bioethics issue, usually surrounding the taking of human life. Not too much reading, the assignments are easy and helpful (and even fun). It's an interesting class to take and Professor Smith is great."
