   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class because although it doesn't often erupt in interesting debates, it does a good job of getting the ideas of the texts across. Makes you think of things you hadn't thought before and makes you see things you had considered before in a new light.",
    "I would highly recommend the course, which is a survey of philosophic thought from the Middle Ages to the 20th century.",
    "Again, less exciting than last term, but still incredibly important. And sometimes scary.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend Directed Studies to ALL students, but there are plenty of arguments for and against it out there. More specifically, though, you ought to take DS Philosophy with Professor Darwall.",
    "A survey of the major philosophical works from the middle ages to present day. Would definitely recommend it although I think the student should be sure that they will not come out with a solid understanding of every text but with a general notion and familiarity with them.",
    "Everyone should take DS. It's awesome. Despite the monstrous assigned reading, you can actually get by just reading summaries and you'll be fine, but you should really try to read as much as you can.",
    "DS Philosophy is perfect for anyone who wants a broad introduction to many of the best philosophers of all time",
    "If there is one class that is alone worth taking Directed Studies, this would be it for me. I learned so much philosophy that is relevant and often alluded to - particularly Kant. It's very exciting. I found section with Professor Darwall a little slow, because section is a little more like a lecture than a discussion, but his explanations were very clear and he is an instructor one feels privileged to have had."
