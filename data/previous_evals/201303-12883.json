    "I would recommend the course to anyone with an interest in 20th-century French literature and thought. It was very relevant to my interests, and helped me see certain connections that will hopefully be useful down the line as I start to think about a dissertation topic.",
    "French 920 is a study of Roland Barthes's contributions to literary theory. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because I learned so much and thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "I definitely recommend this class. I rank it amongst my favourite classes and I have grown a lot from it academically. It was extremely interesting to use one author and his body of work to study a range of author themes of the same era. This enabled us to really stay specific and rigorous while expanding our views at the same time. Really and excellent and very insightful class!"

   "comments": [
    "It helped familiarize me with Barthes, obviously, and gave me a broader appreciation for 20th-century French literature and philosophy. There is a definite chance it will end up contributing to my dissertation as well.",
    "This course helped me deepen my knowledge of 20th century literary criticism and theory as well as my knowledge of literature in general. We read a great deal of fiction and theory and the course was designed extremely well. Professor Zhuo was flexible with final paper topics, and she allowed me to study something that relates to my potential dissertation topic.",
    "This class has without a doubt opened up horizons for me. It not only enabled me to dive into subjects into which I have become deeply interested, but it has also given me a strong methodological awareness. Indeed, the Roland Barthes course threw me into postmodernism with a lot of positive energy and I have reconsidered a lot of my past apprehensions. That is very constructive for me and I find myself really wanting to pursue my studies with the authors in conversation with Barthes. From a methodological point of view I have learnt a lot fro Yue Zhuo's approach. I really grew from studying one author in thus comparative style: this is very rare in the liberal arts and she was able to use Barthes' specific themes to enlarge the reading list to a whole range of authors, while never going all over the place. very constructive approach"
