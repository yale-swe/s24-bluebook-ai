    "I would only recommend this course to someone who was very serious about learning Arabic and who was willing to supplement with additional work. I did not necessarily feel that my Arabic improves greatly this semester (which is partly my fault, but the course did not motivate me to push myself).",
    "I recommend this only if you are serious about learning arabic and doing a lot of independent work on your own to do so.",
    "This was a good course- a great improvement on my previous experiences with Professor Aziz. Things this course does well- We really do truly learn how to read newspaper a articles using the textbook. The vocab quizzes- while difficult to study for- certainly helped me gain the necessary vocab to pick up a newspaper or watch television. Additionally, the literature that we read was fascinating and really enjoyable. What could be improved: the monday vocab sessions are not very useful- I would much prefer professor Aziz to lecture on the vocabulary and describe how to use it correctly than watch him correct students' sentences. While I see what he is trying to do with this, it is very ineffective and I would rather be able to ask questions or review grammar or other vocab which I see as important at this stage. Additionally, your speaking will not get better. I'm not sure what the solution is, maybe more discussion instead of the sentences."
