   "comments": [
    "Overall, I really enjoyed this course. We read a lot of interesting literature by writers that anyone interesting in French lit should know. The discussion was pretty engaging, especially when we all actually had time to really read the books thoroughly, and I can certainly attest to the fact that I learned a lot in this introduction to French lit. Madame Sanjabi was very clear and articulate in her introductory discussion of the authors - which was great! She talked slowly which is perfect for an intro to French lit, since it's already difficult to talk about literature let alone talk about literature in French. What I did appreciate about the course was that the writing assignments were just the right length and number, and we were able to rewrite for the first two assignments (though it was actually not so much the case, because even when our final draft of the first assignment had been fixed and edited, the grades were mostly based on the first draft - this wasn't really made clear in the beginning). This class also really helped me understand how to put together a French literature paper, something I didn't think I was capable of but now am more confident about. Another nice feature of the course is that the professor sends you a list of questions to think about for discussion so that you can come prepared and to reduce awkward silences in class. Overall, Intro to French Lit was a satisfying, enjoyable course that I'm very happy to have taken. Not too much work (relative to the language courses you take here, much less work), but a lot of reading that you really don't have to do all of (and I really hope that they lighten the reading load because it's impossible to really finish it all, unfortunately). Make sure you shop for a section that makes you feel comfortable to talk in.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 170 for someone who is looking to practice French reading\/writing and SPEECH. I did not know expect this going in, but speaking is actually the most important skill in this class, and the one that is worked on most.",
    "I would highly recommend French 170 as a course every serious student of French literature should take as an introduction to great French writers like Moli\u00e8re, Baudelaire, Diderot, Pascal, Montaigne, Balzac, Merim\u00e9e and Proust.",
    "Yes- it is an essential course for any serious French student- a great introduction to French literature.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wishes to not only be exposed to French literature but also have a greater understanding of it in many levels. We start in the middle Ages with works by Marie de France, and finish with great 18th, 19th, and 20th century authors such as Proust, Perec, and Duras."
