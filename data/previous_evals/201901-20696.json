   "comments": [
    "Gained insight on basic macroeconomic models, tools, and theories. Insights on how the world works, what we can control economically, and also the gaps in our economic knowledge.",
    "Introductory macroeconomics and how topics we learn can be seen and applied in the real world.",
    "We began discussing long run growth and models for understanding trends in long run growth. Then we moved into analyzing key markets: credit, labor, and financial markets",
    "In the course I gained a broad understanding about what macroeconomics is, touching on many many areas such as credit markets, labor markets, exchange rates, economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and so much more.",
    "We learned firstly how to analyse graphs and understand log scales, correlation relationships as well as what makes correlation equal to causation. We then learned about macro concepts in a very immersive way. We learned how to apply policy to macro issues and present ideas and defend them.",
    "I learned how to apply macroeconomic concepts to the real world. I learned why certain countries grow faster than other countries and how we can sustain long-term growth by expanding technology. We learned about the US Monetary System and about the business cycle.",
    "Good foundation for macroeconomics, as well as for being more informed about current events.",
    "I learned so much about how the world works through economics and also how we don't really understand a lot of it. The \"seminar\" format of the class actually makes you think through real-life economic problems with classmates which was intimidating at first (especially as someone with no macro background) but by the end of the course really gave me the confidence to make educated guesses and still be ok with getting it wrong sometimes. I also learned how to create a formal economic report; that was pretty cool.",
    "I learned about macroeconomic theory and the intuitions behind it",
    "How economies work on a grand scale. What causes booms and recessions, how are bank runs handled, how is money managed (what increases\/decreases money supply), inflation, exchange rates.",
    "Learned alot about the course material, but also its real applications.",
    "The principles of Macroeconomic theory, as well as formals and practical applications and real-world analysis using said theory.",
    "This course is a great introduction to macroeconomics and is insightful for how the world has come to be. It explains, in simpler terms, how macroeconomic such as inflation, TFP, monetary policy work, and expands to bigger picture ideas such as why countries are rich or poor and what causes a recession.",
    "I learned a lot about fundamental macroeconomic concepts in a setting where I felt very comfortable asking questions and getting along with peers.",
    "This course afforded me the knowledge to take a more serious look at macroeconomics. I learned some key facts about the U.S. economy as well as some causes for this state. Overall, the course has helped me develop a broad understanding of the economy that can help aid analysis of this economy in the future.",
    "Excellent course! I loved my ECON 108 Fall semester class, and the spring semester with ECON 111 was a fabulous continuation of my econ pathway as well. Through ECON 111 I developed very solid knowledge in the intro to macro econ.",
    "I gained a thorough grasp of the complex aspects of economic processes that govern international relations. I came to definitively understand the components of production that go into GDP calculation, the intricate aspects of not just the financial industry but also the ways in which governmental action serves to regulate rampant negative by-products of production. I also came to understand financial crises.",
    "Analyzing the economy thinking about what contributes to economic activity."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: small class size; intimate; engaging; challenging in a good way; structured; interactive. Weaknesses: final group project at the end of the class can be painful if group does not work well.",
    "I think the class could be more well organized. It is a good class overall, but I found it boring at times. I really did not like the pre-class assignments and post-class quizzes- I would have rather had a problem set every week. The class only has one midterm which is nice.",
    "The seminar is extremely well organized and engaging. Professor Hawkins puts in a great amount of effort to ensure that students are engaged and understand the material.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses! A real strength of the course is the small class size -- it allowed for the lectures to be very engaging, and provided the opportunity to ask many questions.",
    "It is very immersive and interactive. We learn about concepts through videos, articles and games. It is really fun and instructive. There isn't any real weakness.",
    "The strength of this course was Professor Hawkins' passion for teaching. He really went out of his way to make it easy for us to access him, and he made learning a priority for us. He also made every resource possible available to us and worked very diligently in order to facilitate our learning. Professor Hawkins really goes above and beyond expectations for the sake of our learning. However, I didn't like the country project because all the considerations we had to face seemed too complex for the simple models we learned in this course. Things had to be overly simplified in order to make it fit the situations described.",
    "Structure of the class (prep assignments before every class, practice quizzes after every class) was helpful in learning introductory macroeconomics concepts. Professor Hawkins is a very clear and passionate instructor -- would strongly recommend this course with him!",
    "Strengths: Prof Hawkins all to ourselves, prep and review materials - before and after class, respectively - to keep you thinking, seminar style keeps students engaged, plenty of office hours Weaknesses: Material can get dry at times but Prof Hawkins makes it as engaging as possible and honestly it's better to learn dry material with 20 people than 200",
    "Country project was more work than it seemed it was in the beginning",
    "Strengths are its interactiveness. Much better than Micro seminar which was just a small lecture. I got to know my professor better, got to work with classmates, asked questions, and was asked to answer questions. I was very impressed with how involved Professor Hawkins was with the class. He always responded to emails promptly even when they were sent very late, around midnight. He always gave personal feedback on the class prep questions, which was helpful and must have been a lot of work. Weakness is that some students can still easily skip class, I guess, but they're only harming themselves. Not a problem for others, except for the group project where some groups get undedicated students and have to work harder to make up the work.",
    "Teaching pace is very fast.",
    "I can't quite think of any weaknesses. I really liked that this class was very interactive and cooperative. We would often have in-class discussions in small groups, and at the end of the semester we also had a group presentation\/written report. It was also nice that there were class preps and practice quizzes for each class for students to make sure they had a good grip on what we learned. I feel that this class played to the seminar setting very well.",
    "Strengths there is a quick prep-assignment that takes 10 minutes that really helped me, along with post-class Canvas quizzes that helped me solidify the material.",
    "This course is very strong in the sense that it builds on itself nicely. Ideas presented early on in the course lay the groundwork for more depth explanations presented later in the course. A weakness of the course would have to be the emphasis on models and the mechanics of these models rather than an emphasis on these real-world implications.",
    "I tried to think of any weaknesses but I honestly could not think of any. Professor Hawkins' slides were extremely effective and if anyone (including me) had any questions, he always answered and never left anyone with any questions unanswered. This is definitely the biggest strength compared to the lecture. I also loved the final project, where we could refresh the knowledge from the seminar by applying it with hands-on experience.",
    "The organization of the material was very well constructed and I believe the coursework worked well to ensure that students maintained engagement with the course. However, I believe that greater engagement could have been achieved by trying to find ways for students to interact with the material outside of class through more than just the slides that were posted, perhaps by substituting some of the article readings with textbook readings instead.",
    "The course is engaging and well-explained. I cannot think of ways to improve it."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, the class is incredibly well structured and Professor Hawkins has the ability to simplify complicated topics so students can understand. He is passionate about economics which makes his students engaged in the lectures. It's a great way to gain basic information on macroeconomics that will be a strong foundation for future learning.",
    "If you are interested in economics, go for it. Professor Hawkins tries to make things interesting but I think some topics are inherently boring. I did like the small seminar style of the class.",
    "Yes, the seminar format is great.",
    "Yes! If you have any interest in economics, I would recommend this over the lecture. Yes, the workload is slightly more, but overall you gain such a better understanding of the concepts.",
    "Yes it is fun and instructive. It is a great intro and opens up the path to future econ classes.",
    "Absolutely. I enjoyed the seminar more than the lecture, since I took the micro lecture last semester. I thought it was more engaging but made it easier to engage with the material. I think Professor Hawkins is a lovely man who puts his students first everyday. He really works hard to make sure that we are grasping the concepts at hand.",
    "Yes, absolutely. I can't speak for the lecture format, but this smaller version of introductory macroeconomics was great for learning basic concepts.",
    "Definitely. Even though I'm not an Econ major (taking the course as a prereq), I really appreciated the attention given to students to make sure we all understood the information. Also, yes Prof Hawkins is involved with both the lecture and the seminar, but it's so much better to have him as a professor than just a TA",
    "Yes, especially with Prof Hawkins hes a great teacher",
    "Definitely. I learned so much about the workings of economies around the world. So much of what I thought I knew about banks, inflation, and exchange rates was wrong. If I hadn't taken this class I don't know if my thinking would have ever been corrected. This is all knowledge that comes up in daily life fairly often. You'll survive without knowing it, but I am glad to now understand the world better. It's also not too difficult of a class, it's taught well, and fellow students are quite engaged (at least in my class), so I found the class very rewarding.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. First of all, Hawkins does an amazing job of making everything profoundly interesting. His wit and humor makes the class extremely fun. Second, the class is very fair. You will learn a lot, and your grade will reflect how much effort you put in. But I will say this: take the class. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes, this is one of the better courses I've taken at Yale so far. I found the contents of the course interesting, and it was covered in a thorough yet comprehensible manner. I preferred this course over Intro Micro.",
    "Yes, it is an engaging course with interesting material and a very stimulating final project.",
    "Yes! The small seminar is great for discussion and the group work really helped me solidify my skills.",
    "Yes, the course was filled with really relevant and interesting material. A lot of it is directly applicable and so what is taught gets you thinking about the world we live in immediately.",
    "Definitely yes.",
    "This course was very engaging and the material that we discuss is extremely relevant and vital in understanding the large and complex economic processes that happen constantly on an international level.",
    "I will recommend the class to someone interested in economics as the level of engagement will be better appreciated by someone as such compared to someone just taking the class as a social science credit."
