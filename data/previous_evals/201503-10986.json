    "Great class: learn a lot, would highly recommend.",
    "Great course to get an overview of a variety of topics in public finance.",
    "Highly recommend especially since it covers an array of topics.",
    "Yes, to anyone more or less",
    "Joe is well prepared for class and carefully walks through the various models. The homework, referee report, and presentation are a fair way to assess the course. A bit scattershot in its choice of topics\/papers. A good class for applied micro students, and for students outside econ (Forestry, SOM, etc).",
    "I would recommend this course because the readings are interesting and I learned some practical skills.",
    "Very interesting. A must if you are interested in public economics.",

    "This course may be interesting for those students, whose research requires an ability to deal with statistics and data analysis."
