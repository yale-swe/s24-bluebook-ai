    "Climate dynamics is a challenging course for people who don't have much experience in math! I really enjoyed the course because I knew it was going to be difficult for me, so be prepared to challenge yourself if you haven't spent time doing math beyond multi-variable calc or computer programming. I found that I got a lot of practice in coding, which was really great for me, but might be a surprise to others. Professor Fedorov is a clear lecturer and is very helpful!",
    "If you take this class, be sure to do the readings in the textbooks or else you won't get anything from the class. You use the Navier-Stokes equations without derivation, so it would be beneficial to have already taken a class in which they are derived. You should also be comfortable programming before starting the class. Either MatLab or Python with NumPy\/SciPy\/Matplotlib etc.."
