    "Easy class that discusses very interesting topics. You'll never be stressed about the material or workload, and you'll enjoy an intimate classroom setting. Definitely recommended, even if at times you'll be bored.",
    "If you're reading this, you're probably a history major in need of a \"rest-of-the-world\" or pre-industrial seminar. So let me tell you: you could do a lot worse than this class. I wouldn't call Professor Harms the most energetic professor, but he gets the job done, the readings are generally fairly interesting, and you learn a little bit about a topic you probably knew nothing about. The two 5-page analytical papers at the end are also great, since let's be real no one would come into this course knowing enough to be able to write a 20-page term paper. I would probably never have taken this course if the major requirements didn't make me, but on the whole I'd say it was a pretty good experience.",
    "I would recommend it only if you love the topic a lot.",
    "Such an interesting course taught by an awesome professor! Worth it",
    "A survey of different aspects of the slave trade. Interesting and fun!",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. Great rest of the world and preindustrial credit.",
    "I would highly recommend this class.",
    "harms is really nice and so knowledgeable on the subject. pretty chill seminar with interesting material",
    "The history of the slave trade is an interesting topic\u00e2\u0080\u0094more interesting than I expected it to be\u00e2\u0080\u0094and you will leave this class with a much deeper understanding than you had before, and with many of your preconceived misconceptions debunked. However, it was neither a demanding nor a stimulating seminar. Professor Harms is an interesting lecturer and a good scholarly writer (several of his pieces are on the syllabus) but a poor seminar leader. This was only made worse by the fact that most students taking the class were only there in order to fulfill their departmental distributions. Assignments were at once thankfully and frustratingly easy\u00e2\u0080\u0094they neither required nor encouraged students to really think carefully about the material."
