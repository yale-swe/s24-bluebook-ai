No experience in the discipline is necessary, and I think it does a great job at introducing you to a really cool subdivision of the discipline--behavioral psychology. I learned a lot about the process of thinking and making decisions. We analyzed human behavior in many different studies and offered explanations to certain fallacies and concepts. I related a lot to the material of the course in the sense that it resonated with me--the functioning of humans is a super interesting area and lends itself to more awareness and insight into the ways in which we perceive situations and react to circumstances.",

    "some interesting psych studies not covered in intro psych classes. really liked the last lecture that talked about how the things we learned could actually be applied to the real world",
    "I developed a greater understanding of various forms of psychology from social to cognitive to behavioral. The class structure of a new topic for each class allowed for a lot of breadth in fascinating topics about the way we make decisions, how to increase creativity, the reason we fall for fake news, and so many other interesting topics falling under the umbrella of how we think and make decisions.",

    "I learned how to apply psychology concepts in everyday life",
    "Deeper understanding of the thinking processes and mental biases that occur within the human mind. Learned the ability to objectively view the way our mind works.",
    "I understood how I or others think better systematically.",
    "Thinking is a course that provides you with practical tools for life and a conceptual understanding for why those tools work.

    "My note-taking skills have improved drastically upon taking this course. Additionally, my active listening skills have improved because of the daily quizzes after lectures.",
    "This course taught me all the little ways our brains sabotage us, but it also gave us some real strategies to help combat these quirks. The topics were wide-ranging and very interesting, and I think I have a much better awareness of the processes and biases that are intrinsic to how our brains work.",
    "I learned about how thinking and the processes that govern our thoughts are not so simply put or understood.",

    "Why we think irrationally.",
    "I learned about various things in psychology that make people think in counterintuitive ways, e.g. confirmation bias. It was an introductory course, so we did not delve into why our brains work this way, but it was still fun.",

These insights taught me to more critically assess my own thinking behaviors, studying habits, and relationships with others.",
    "I learned a lot about decision making, behavioral economics, and general psychology.",
    "This course was extremely valuable and useful...learned a ton. A must take course!",
    "Comprehensive overview of reasoning fallacies and biases, as well as empirical research on how these can be overcome. The concepts learned in this class have already improved my own thinking and reasoning abilities",
    "This class was awesome. If you put the effort in, it pays off. You end up learning a lot about the way people think and whether or not its rational for us.

    "How\/why people make decisions",
    "The ability to reason, learn new insights into Psychology, and develop a better understanding of how and why we make certain decisions.",
    "It was very much a survey course. Lots of studies were briefly discussed which I enjoyed, but despite the title of the course being Thinking there was very little actual thinking in this course. It was all memorization.",

    "I learned a great deal about behavioral economics, decision-making processes, and biases.",
    "Professor Ahn covers an impressively wide array of rational thinking and behavioral economics in the course, fitting in fun and socially relevant examples as she goes. Shes engaging throughout the term, and students can look forward to learning about a lot of psychological concepts that affect us every day. Throughout the semester, I actually remembered various concepts from the class in completely separate setting and that was pretty cool. Some of the material she covers overlaps with Intro Psych and Intro Microeconomics, but not so much so that I was entirely bored (especially because Professor Ahn covered them in much greater detail than the other two courses). Both course papers are super short and low workload, which is nice, but they still force you to consider the classs material in a real-world context. Additionally, the daily quizzes and three exams are detailed enough that you end up absorbing much of the courses key concepts.",
    "This class quite literally teaches you how to think better. You'll learn about all the different mechanisms through which we make decisions and how to make more beneficial decisions. You'll learn about psychological pitfalls such as biases and logical fallacies, why they exist, and how to avoid them. You'll even learn about timely topics like how to deal with fake news and how to discuss climate change in a persuasive way. EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "How people think and process things.",
    "This course gives you a broad overview of many of the thinking fallacies we commit in our daily life. It gives you a great understanding of where those irrational thinking patterns stem from and addresses strategies on how to overcome them.",
    "I learned a lot about the normative ways we ought to think, make decisions and analyze ourselves, and the non-normative ways we actually do. It was a lot of very practical, applicable knowledge that I feel like I identify in my day-to-day life now.",
    "I learned a lot about humans in general and how they operate, which is important to know. The things learned in this course are applicable to everyday life going forward from this class and made me more cognizant of how I act in certain situations.",
    "Knowledge of reasoning fallacies and some basic human psychology through experiments.",
    "I realized that a lot of the concepts that we had gone over in class were things that I had already known and seen in my life, but I had never thought that those things had a name until I learned them in class. This course helped me realize and understand why people behave in certain ways and keep in mind that psychology plays a part in almost, if not, all aspects of life. I truly did learn more about how people behave in the real world.",
    "I learned so much about our way of thinking and processing which changed the way I think about the decisions people make.",
    "How we can be irrational in our ways of thinking",
    "Knowledge of the factors that influence thinking, cognitive biases, decision making and behaviour",

    "It was an interesting, informative, and fun introduction to psych. The course allowed me to understand different thought processes, fallacies, and phenomena.",
    "I learned nothing. I didn't even learn how to improve my \"Thinking\" skills. What a joke. All I got out of it is like 50 random studies that I will never need again.",
    "i learned a lot about how we think and actually use a lot of the fallacies we learned about in my daily life.",
    "Understanding of basic Psych concepts that were super interesting and applicable to your own life.",
    "I developed many relevant and interesting insights into everyday interactions between others, between myself and others, and between myself and the world. I gained certain rational principles that I can theoretically apply to my life as a student and beyond. This course gave a name to many human tendencies that I did not necessarily recognize as recurrent patterns or as indicative of deep mental processing until now.",
    "I learned how about different thinking fallacies and how they apply to real world decision making.",
    "broad overview of thinking heuristics, (ir)rationality, and lots of real world applications",
    "Nice Psychology course. I know more about decision making and why people act the way they do.",
    "Insights about thinking from a psychological perspective. It was as entertaining as studying popular psychology off the internet but the information provided was far more credible and backed by studies. I gained a lot from learning the vocabulary to many of my fallacious thinking patters, now, just knowing that I am suffering from \"temporal discounting\" allows me to better respond to the situation since I know a few ways in which I could avoid it. Thus, the course can be helpful to daily life if one is rigorous in applying the principles learnt.",

    "I learned a great deal about ways humans think! Because this class covered such an interestingly wide breadth of topics, I can't answer this question any more specifically without running the risk of leaving out important details! So I'll just say that I learned a lot about human thought.",
    "Learned a lot about fallacies in human thinking and why we make a lot of common mental mistakes.",
    "I learned about how to interpret the results of psychology studies and how to practically apply the results of these thinking experiments to everyday life decisions.",
    "I got a basic understanding of the way that we think and how one might apply these strategies and concepts to every day life in order to improve it.",
    "Many concepts in psychology related to decision making including factors that make many conventional aspects of our decision making process non-normative.",
    "I learned all sorts of information about thinking, decision making, and how the human mind deals with information",
    "A better understanding of thinking fallacies, and ways to try to correct them or acknowledge them in our day to day life.",
    "I learned how to stay engaged and apply concepts to real life.",

    "A basic overview of cognitive behavior theories, perfectly framed for someone like me who previously had zero exposure to the topics.",
    "While vague, the title of the class describes what you learn from it--how people think. We learned about the various aspects of how people perceive the world and make decisions. Professor Ahn did a really good job of including a lot of studies and real life examples of the phenomena she covered, so everything we learned seemed extremely applicable. Her last lecture was particularly interesting because she connected all the concepts we learned throughout the semester to topics like climate change and cleaning up your room.",
    "I learned fascinating tricks and tools to better my decision-making and reasoning. The class covers many interesting studies and is structured very well to help students learn.",
    "I learned principles of introductory psychology, a bit about behavioral economics, how humans make decisions, and I learned about cognitive processes like language, creativity and problem solving.",
    "I developed an insight surrounding psychological concepts",
    "A lot of new and appropriate methods to approach day-to-day life situations.",
    "learning more social psych.",
    "Psychology principles and why we don't always act rationally",
    "I learned to think critically about the mindset I have going through my own life and to be more in touch with why I am making certain decisions which then allows me to make both more logically and emotionally informed choices. I learned basic principles psychology that I think will be really valuable as my time goes on and many of the skills I learned in class are easily applicable to my everyday life - to selecting classes, to choosing what to do after Ive already spent money (dunk cost), to learning to be satisfied with myself even if not every possible avenue has been explored, etc.",
    "The irrational ways people behave.",
    "A better understanding of reasoning biases.",
    "Overall, I learned about the psychological mechanisms of the mind, such as biases and fallacies. The course was taught using proven psychological strategies, like using two analogues to describe a concept, which made my learning more efficient. I felt like I was able to incorporate a lot of what I learned in class to better understand myself and others around me."

    "Strengths: - Organized and consistent--you know what every class looks like, and the syllabus outlines every assignment coherently - Material is highly interesting and very relatable and applicable - Infrequent assignments outside of class, which means you have the choice to do more work if you are interested but don't have to stress about a large volume of homework\/assignments - Lecture is interesting and interactive, with lots of videos, activities, and studies to support the content, which is never dry and far from boring - Short, manageable quizzes after every lecture during class, which means that class ends slightly early and the content is fresh in your mind; this also means that there are no assessments to study for besides the 3 exams given Weaknesses: - Infrequent assignments outside of class means engagement may be minimal if extra work on the student's end isn't put in - Exams count for such a large portion of the grade that almost all other assessments are irrelevant - Frequent quizzes (after every lecture) and a lack of homework may not fit a student's style of learning, especially in terms of reinforcing content. This may result in cramming a lot of studying in for the very large and important exams",
    "The strengths of this course are the professor, who is very knowledgeable about what she is teaching, and the content of the course. The weaknesses are the large lecture size (Thinking was the largest undergrad course this semester), which hinders the ability to interact with others or with Professor Ahn during class. In addition, the information in class is presented in a very simple way, which can be a plus, but that could prevent students from gaining a more complete, in-depth view of the subject. I wish there were more opportunities for engagement during class, whether with course material, with other students (e.g. working in pairs), with guest speakers, or with the professor.",
    "The course was highly interesting and engaging during the lectures. Professor Anh is an amazing lecturer who tries to keep every lesson fun, exciting, and information-packed. Although, the lack of a specific discussion section made it a bit harder for me to grasp material, as I had to organize my own talks with fellow classmates about lecture material.",
    "I loved just about everything in this class.",
    "Strength: Fine Credit\/D Weakness: Bland, unstimulating, memorization-heavy, unengaging",
    "yes.",
    "This course felt like a train wreck. Due to the poor organization of the course, students received an overwhelming amount of emails about constant changes and announcements. The course was taught with enthusiasm, but also with redundancy and unnecessary humor that were disturbing.",
    "Not very engaging. I would possible have more review sessions or discussion sections.",
    "Strengths: quizzes after every lecture, jokes and varied media Weaknesses: since it's a huge, pretty easy class, many people just space out and do other things during lecture which can be distracting. It's also a cumbersome process to go through exam results. Improved: emphasize TF groups more, have a review session for exam 3.",
    "The power points in lectures were helpful, and she gives a lot of examples to help you understand the material. However, the first test was a nightmare and had nothing to do with the study guide she sent out. Had to credit D it after that.",
    "Some of the quiz questions were way too hard for someone to have known after class.",
    "strengths: when learning about a certain issue, we learnt why and also how to overcome it. Several examples were always given when discussing a certain phenomenon for better retention. I liked the daily quiz aspect as it made me more engaged during the lecture but also made it easier to recall information later on. weaknesses: we were only ever allowed to see our quiz responses after we submitted them and never again. I think it would have been helpful to have access to them while studying for exam to test concepts and memory. Similarly, we had three midterms and were only allowed to see our answers during a specific time when Professor Ahn opened the canvas page to us, which was confusing because we took these exams and should be allowed to see them. One of our exams was the day after Thanksgiving break, which meant that most of us spent our break stressed and were not able to perform as well as we would have had the exam been two days later. Furthermore, we were made to study during break, taking time away from family. I wish our exam could have been during our last class because that way students could have prepared for it more. Furthermore, we had two papers over the course of the term. Each paper was worth 3% of our grade. And our midterms worth 72% overall. Far too much emphasis was placed on those and not enough on the papers we spent a significant amount of time on.",
    "Really loved the quiz format as you have to take it in class after each class, which helped make sure students show up. The midterms could have been questioned more clearly, in terms of weaknesses",
    "Strengths: excellently taught, material masterfully curated, very engaging lectures, exams are fair and true to study guide weaknesses: TFs were incompetent and didn't try at all.",
    "I think the lectures were very engaging, although extremely densely packed. I enjoyed that everything we needed to learn was concretely and quickly compressed into about an hour of lecture, and that we were quizzed immediately afterwards. It was very cool to see psychology findings applied to the logistics of the class in a way that highlighted the importance of applying what we learn in this class.",
    "great class great prof",
    "It's engaging and Professor Ahn is incredible. That is all.",
    "I really liked her lectures and the quiz style is great because it makes it so you retain information without having to do reading.",
    "Strengths: content was always fascinating, review sheets were very helpful, lectures always engaging, essays are thought-provoking and only a very small percentage of our grade, in-class quizzes helped with engagement Weaknesses: sometimes the wording on a few exam questions were a little confusing, but not usually",
    "Strengths- Professor Ahn in an incredible lecturer. She is incredibly engaging and teaches using tactics that she teaches us about. Every lecture is memorable and you walk out learning something that is applicable to your life. Weaknesses- That being said, her popularity means this was an incredibly large lecture. There are not very many opportunities to discuss unless you attend office hours, but never during the lecture.",
    "Strengths-- the breadth of information was really nice! Covered some quantitative stuff, some logical stuff, and lots of stuff regarding fallacies and biases. Weakness-- sometimes we would gloss over the more complex parts and take a long time on the simple topics.",
    "This course is incredibly engaging and fun thanks to the pop culture references and short lectures. If the lectures had been the full hour and 15 minutes, I would have found that tough to sit through. Occasionally some of the videos felt too long and would have been better explained by the prof.",
    "Strengths: engaging and fun lectures, content is interesting, not too much work Weaknesses: sometimes lectures moved pretty quickly",
    "Strengths: - daily quiz was not hard and made studying much easier bc we were forced to retain things well - Prof. Ahn is a gem; such a good lecturer, very engaging, she knows so much, and she really just wants you to do well and learn Weaknesses: - honestly can't think of any; the timing for exams and papers were great, plus the resources made available (the video taped lectures and review sheets) were very useful and the exams were extremely fair",
    "The class was incredibly well-structured for being such a large lecture. Prof Ahn did an awesome job making sure we knew the material, enforcing academic honesty, and making TFs readily available. The information can be repetitive if you've taken other intro psych or intro cog sci courses, but overall it's still really interesting.",
    "Strengths were that daily quizzes made you go to class each time and focus while you're in class. Overall it helped you better learned the material over time which helped when you studied over finals. The daily quizzes could be a weakness if you have to miss classes for whatever reason. Professor Ahn also posted each lecture video and the lecture slides. She also made very helpful study guides for the exams. Her organization and resources made it super easy to prepare for exams and do well in the class.",
    "I think it was very good overall. If any fixes, it would be to the language for the exams, but that wasn't too big of an issue.",
    "Very engaging, both in terms of lecture material and teaching style. Exams were basically all memorization based though, and didn't test actual understanding.",
    "The content is unique from many intro level psych classes because a lot of the content is shaped to explain concepts very relevant to the students.",
    "Strengths - not much workload outside of the class. no readings, only work you do outside of class is the two papers and studying for three exams. Quizzes at the end of class are pretty easy and I do believe that they help you retain and learn the information better Weaknesses - Papers are not super easy to write, a few lecture topics dull compared to rest of lectures, which are pretty engaging in general",
    "strengths: daily quizzes forced you to pay attention in lecture. Professor Ahn is also a great lecturer who definitely kept class interesting. weaknesses: sometimes supplemental media\/ demonstrations seemed super excessive or off topic",
    "Strengths: the class is organized very well. Everything from exam structure to lecture layout was very clear from the beginning and helped facilitate learning and decrease stress. The lectures were super interesting and opened up windows into new areas of psychology I hadn't thought or learned much about. Weaknesses: can't think of many. There isn't a ton of depth but a lot of breadth (which makes sense given its basically an intro psych class but with more interesting and creative topics). This can lead to less deep engagement but I felt most of the class took something away from the course and found it interesting. Given the lecture structure without section, it is not a very intensive class but was very interesting.",
    "A strength might be the fascinating and relevant topics that the course covered, from climate change denial to homophobia. Additionally, the course was light on \"busy work\" and utilized proved psychological techniques to reinforce learning instead. One weakness might be the fast pace of the class.",
    "Weaknesses: I think that the grading for the papers should be weighted more, since a lot of time and effort is required. I think there was also a bit too much variation among the TA's in terms of how they graded. As for the material, often it felt like we were just shallowly touching many topics instead of diving deeper into a few ideas which was quite frustrating. Strengths: super interesting class. Gives you great conversation topics.",
    "The material can probably be interesting if taught differently. The way it is taught now is very very boring",
    "Strengths: the quizzes are a good way to get people to go to lecture and I think it motivated me to pay attention even though they were a little stressful since I tend to learn things more slowly than average so need to hear things more than once. The variety of topics spanned a lot of useful and interesting topics so I think there was something applicable to everything which was good. Weaknesses: at times it felt like we were learning Professor Ahn's opinion about things instead of objective information, since some of the material seemed a little open ended but we had to learn a single interpretation. I think the format of tests would be improved in terms of format because I think it tested whether we knew the specific connections Professor Ahn made instead of that we engaged with the material on our own. I think it also felt a little unorganized and inconsistent, especially with her notation in the slides, which made it hard to review effectively.",
    "I think there could have been a more in-depth intellectual engagement with each lesson; we learned a lot of definitions but didn't question the definitions or frameworks we were already given very much.",
    "Strengths are that lectures are engaging, the quizzes after each lecture make you pay attention which is good, and the information is interesting for the most part. Three non-cumulative exams is good too. Weaknesses are that sometimes she would go fast and also the lectures covered a lot but were very organized.",
    "The lectures were generally interesting, the pace of work was never overwhelming, and the quizzes at the end of lectures helped to cement the material. I especially liked the lectures that related the material to our daily lives and experiences, rather than focusing on the complicated studies that didn't seem to have many practical applications. (It might be worthwhile to scrap the \"Concepts\" lecture for that reason - it's confusing, abstract, and I still can't figure out why it's at all relevant.) I think the course would benefit from revamping at least one of the paper assignments. I found it very frustrating to be graded on \"creativity\" when limited to the bank of my own experiences. The papers are also graded quite harshly on \"efficacy of the intervention\" when it is very unlikely that, as an intro psych student, I would invent a novel intervention that is highly efficacious and yet has never been identified or used. Spending an assignment either building the skill of a more traditional literature review or posing some directed, challenging questions to bring multiple lectures together (somewhat like a problem set?) would be more applicable and useful, and much fairer.",
    "Strengths: liked the daily quiz system, really forced me to pay attention to the lectures and concepts. Weaknesses: no practice problems for exams",
    "Certain lectures were very engaging and fun, but others felt abstract and unsupported by scientific results. For example, I did not feel very compelled by the concepts and genetic essentialism lectures.",
    "Really great topics and really great engaging lectures. The prof tries really hard and it shows. There are daily quizzes but they are completely manageable. I will say that because some topics have so much overlap, it's difficult to keep minute differences straight. But otherwise, would take it again.",
    "I really liked the professor and I thought she was very engaging.",
    "The strength was definitely Professor Ahn herself -- an amazing lecturer that can captivate the entire audience. One of the weaknesses were the complexity of some of the lectures. Because she had to pack so much in for a topic in a given day, it often felt rushed and became confusing for students.",
    "Strength was that it was a fun class, although very rarely did it seem slightly artificial. The fun definitely helped to make the class engaging, especially with that many students enrolled. Weakness was that I have a feeling the exam could be improved to have a more accurate assessment.",
    "Strengths - the content was great and engaging. The assessment structure was good with end of class quizzes, papers and exams - broad range of testing. Weakness - was very large which removed how personal it was (kind of inevitable)",
    "The material is interesting, but it was hard to engage with the pressure of daily lecture quizzes.",
    "Professor Ahn does a great job of making the course applicable, engaging, and thought provoking. The course has a number of interactive activities and Yale-related jokes or examples that make it easier to comprehend the material. Each lecture is very structured and has a brief quiz at the end to assure that we understood the basic idea of each topic, which was helpful for grasping the bigger picture of each lecture. There is not a lot of work for the course, besides three exams (no cumulative final exam) and two papers. A weakness of the course, however, is that lectures often get repetitive as we go over study after study; some variety in the course content would be beneficial.",
    "This class was very accessible, thanks in large part to Professor Ahn. I do think, however, that its size should be limited in the future. It was easy to get lost in the 500 person crowd.",
    "Strength: very interesting, helped that the professor allowed the students to rewatch the lectures online Weakness: sometimes it was hard to hear the professor",
    "Any strength you could ever think of.",
    "Material presented very clearly and expectations laid out at the beginning. Perhaps a little more leniency regarding the class quizzes.",
    "It was great! No need for a paper though",
    "I really liked the daily quizzes. I think it really helped me pay attention and then retain the things I learned.",
    "It was very organized and very easy to study for the exams because of the review sheets.",
    "At certain points, the topics\/experiments that we learned about felt a little disconnected which made it hard to follow throughout the course. I really liked the way the slides were presented,as it was clear and organized.",
    "The course was very organized, which is impressive given its size",
    "It was a very interesting class but the first exam was too hard.",
    "The exams were trickier than they needed to be. The questions were phrased a little weirdly... sometimes got stuff wrong even when i knew the answer.",
    "The strengths are Prof. Ahn, she is amazing. She is funny and engaging, and makes the lectures interesting and fun even when the content is at times mundane or self-explanatory. Another strength is that everything is very well-organized, the exam study guides tell you exactly what content you need to study, and the lectures are recorded to look back on. I think having quizzes at the end of each class was also a strength, because it forced me to pay attention in class which really did help when I was studying for the exams later. A weakness was the papers - I thought they were rather unnecessary and didn't advance my understanding of the concepts at all. The amount of time and effort I put into completing them, versus what they are worth (only 6% of your grade - 3% each) was frustrating for me.",
    "The lectures were engaging I thought the grading structure didnt make much sense and the class is filled with trick questions",
    "Strengths are daily quizzes and engaging teaching, weaknesses are lack of student involvement",
    "This was a fantastic course. I thought the papers were graded a bit harsh, but they were only 6% of the grade so it didn't really matter. I don't have any complaints outside of that.",
    "I thought the class was extremely well taught and laid out. There are daily in-class quizzes, but they are extremely easy and useful in learning the material.",
    "My strength of the course was paying attention during lectures and having at least a small grasp of the concepts. My weakness was the application of the concepts that we learned during lectures. I can improve my application of concepts by reviewing each lecture after the class.",
    "The lectures were very fun and engaging, and I felt that I already had a good command of the material after each lecture. The quizzes were fair and helpful to cement the ideas of each lecture, and the exams pushed us to really learn the most key aspects of the class. This is a wonderful course, and I am at a loss to come up with any way to improve it.",
    "it is very well organized, the professor makes sure to go over everything very clearly and concisely while still keeping things interesting. One area that could be improved is a more detailed break down of studies on the slides to ensure that everyone is on the same page about them.",
    "Strength - lectures were engaging Weaknesses - annoying: two essays worth 3% of final grade... not enough to actually impact your grade much but enough so that You have to still care and try... and most likely planned to be that way Annoying about test security too. you couldn't review graded Canvas tests except at special office hours when you had to do it from a TFs laptop.. like really?",
    "Strengths - everything done on the computers, made it easier.",
    "Extremely well-taught. Concepts were excellently explained (using the very strategies we learned in class!). I have no suggestions for improvement, besides some incorporation of the neuroscience that we now know underlies some of what the class discusses.",
    "The exams for this course were extremely dumb. They didnt really test the material and basically if you fell for one of the many trick questions, your grade immediately drops by like 4-5%. Also, why did we do those papers? I spent way more time on the two papers than I should have (although you kind of need to) and they were worth absolutely nothing! Doing well on those papers was equivalent to getting one extra question right on a quiz, which is just flat out ridiculous. Also the grading for those was absurd too - the average score on the second paper was like a 75 if I remember correctly.",
    "No weaknesses. The quizzes were so helpful and the course was incredible.",
    "I thought this was a very well thought class. It was always interesting and engaging and fun to go to.",
    "Strengths: The information is fascinating and relevant, it is presented in a very engaging way, Professor Ahn is amazing Weaknesses: Daily quizzes are a bit stressful at times, some of the TA's were less well-versed in course material",
    "Strength: easy to understand and very interesting material to read and learn about Weakness: none",
    "Professor Ahn is by far my most favorite professor at Yale. The lectures are recorded, you have daily quizzes, and there's a genuine emphasis on learning practical material. The structure of this class was the best I've ever experienced and I can't rave about this class enough.",
    "One of the strengths is that she gives you a lot of good quality information with lots of examples to make sure that you really understand the concepts she's teaching. I think that everything she taught is also very relevant to our daily lives and the things I've learned in the course I've thought about and used in my life since. She moves through material very fast which can be stressful when you're trying to take notes, but once you get used to her speed of teaching, it becomes much easier. Sometimes the difficulty of the quiz and test questions just comes from tricky wording, which can be frustrating if you feel like you understand the concepts. Overall though, I thought it was a great class.",
    "The daily quizzes are a strength unique to this class as it makes you stay focused throughout class and process the info",
    "This class is incredibly engaging! I really enjoyed attending class. However, it was a lot of memorization instead of application.",
    "Good course",
    "The lectures were really fun and dynamic. Professor Ahn was so funny and used fun examples to illustrate things, so I was very engaged at the lectures. The main thing I disliked about this course was the exams, specifically how they were not always the same difficulty. The average on the first exam was an 80%, and I didn't do great so I credit-D'd the class. But the average on the next two exams was a 90%, and I did very well without studying any more. So that was frustrating. I understand that the average at the end should be in the B range, but I wish all the exams had reflected that.",
    "I loved this course. The examinations and assessments were incredibly fair. At first, I was nervous about the daily quizzes, but I found that they were reasonable and did improve my ability to stay focused and engaged during lecture. The TFs were also incredibly helpful",
    "Strengths: very clear and engaging, many examples and media to help explain concepts Weakness: a lot of information to memorize, papers are worth very small amount of grade and are graded harshly",
    "I liked the lay-out of this class and appreciated that it was filmed for reviewing later.",
    "There were a lot of people and sometimes it was easy to feel lost. Prof. Ahn and all the TFs did always have office hours and were available through email though.",
    "The quizzes after each class are a smart tool to encourage attendance and I felt like I retained the information from lectures much better knowing there would be a quiz after",
    "Course was great except sometimes review sheets were a bit vague and Professor wasnt always helpful with answering questions\/review sessions were not always well explained.",
    "most organized course ive ever taken at yale",
    "Although I was initially hesitant about the daily quiz format, it is actually a strength of this course. They served to reinforce my learning, making it easier when it came time to review for each exam. The papers were also a great way to explore how the concepts taught in this course apply to important real world situations. Finally, Professor Ahn was one of the most engaging lecturers I've been taught by in my time at Yale.",
    "Everything was well done, I wouldnt say there were any particular weaknesses.",
    "I think Professor Ahn is a great lecturer but sometimes we moved through material too quickly to really grasp what she was saying.",
    "Strengths: Easy to study for since all of the lecture slides correspond to the material we need to know for exams. Additionally, Professor Ahn provides a review sheet containing all the essential information, so we knew what we needed to know for NON-cumulative exams. Professor Ahn has a policy where we take quizzes after every lecture in order to improve memory retention and it really helps with course understanding imo. I would say that I also liked the range of topics we go through as this is a survey course and, in reality, lectures were made to be fun. Weaknesses: Because this class was such a huge lecture, it will be hard to receive any help outside of the lecture. TA's aren't too helpful even though they are the point people to talk to. Additionally, it was very hard to receive proper feedback on tests because the test was graded so strictly that you could be docked points for some dumb things. Overall, the strengths > weaknesses",
    "I thought the lectures were very interesting and the professor is funny and charming. Having to take a quiz every class was exhausting at times, and stressful if you had to miss a class for some reason, but it wasn't that bad.",
    "A great course overall. Professor Ahn is very engaging and a great lecturer. Topics were very interesting and taught well.",
    "I think the materials very interesting. I think the weaknesses are that the topics are somewhat subjective and can be interpreted in various way. I did think the quizzes were a little bit annoying. I think that something that can be improved about the class would be to have section. I think that the materials was fascinating and I would have enjoyed getting to talk about it.",
    "I thought the review sheets given to us to study for the exams were extremely helpful. One thing I think could be improved is putting up the lecture slides being used a day before class. The lecture is very fast paced and you won't have time to write a ton down so having the lectures beforehand to take preliminary notes would be very helpful",
    "Strengths were the demos and lecture slides that kept me engages and retain the information being taught just from going to lecture. At the same time the information was disorganized so preparing for test entailed basically organizing what information was taught in a Google doc.",
    "strengths very well taught, crystal clear, lessons for real life weaknesses sometimes moves too quickly, test material disorganized",
    "Strengths -- quizzes are easy and fair if you have paid attention in lecture. Lecture was great Weaknesses -- tests rely on rote memorization and sometimes ask obscure questions referencing a single aside in a single slide.",
    "Fantastic professor, intuitive lecture structure, fun assignments and lectures. Overall an amazing experience.",
    "The professor is great, and the course material is very engaging.",
    "The lectures were very engaging, entertaining, and actually enjoyable. Professor Ahn captured the class's attention and strategically had fun (and applicable) video throughout the lectures. I also felt that the course was well-balanced. It kept a steady pace and didn't accelerate a lot towards the end of the semester like many classes tend to do. The exams and papers were well scheduled so that all of the material could be test and incorporated evenly. I would've preferred the last exam not being the day we got back from Thanksgiving break, but I appreciated not having a final exam.",
    "I enjoyed the material and was interested in it so found it very interesting and enjoyable",
    "YOU WILL NOT GET AN A. This course is designed to make an A nearly impossible. An A- is achievable with more memorizing that you're used to before the exams. You need to memorize all examples given in class. But an A is very unlikely, by design. The questions on exams are often obscure, ambiguous to the point that you don't know what is being asked, and graded with a razor-sharp pick. But a good C\/D\/F or passive B+\/A-. Professor Ahn puts a lot of effort into the course, but the result is a pedantic course. For example, she spends the time to break down each study, describing step-by-step the method and the results. This clearly takes time. But imagine having to memorize dozens of these (in which box did the researchers put the cookies in the second experimental condition?). I really disliked this course. It was boring, peppered with interesting tidbits you could read in any long-form article online.",
    "Course material is very interesting and presented in a good way. Well structured, but maybe the papers could be more involved and the exams could count for less",
    "The class is very organized and assignments, expectations, and grading are all very clear. Despite being huge, Professor Ahn and the TFs were very engaged with the students and did a great job communicating. Lectures were very interesting and engaging, and the quizzes at the end were helpful. However, I do think that lectures moved a little too quick sometimes.",
    "The material is really exciting and fun, but the course is set up so you only need to really memorize facts for a few days to take the exams, which sometimes makes it feel like rote memorization is the heart of the course, which it ultimately should not be and is not.",
    "I think all of the examples and topics covered in the course were really interesting. Wish it was a seminar style.",
    "Professor rude",
    "I liked the daily quizzesI found them helpful in making sure that I stayed engaged during the lectures, but they might now work for everyone.",
    "Strengths: interesting content, engaging lectures Weaknesses: huge class, sometimes the content would get unnecessarily and arbitrarily detailed",
    "I think it was a very good class, except that there should be discussion sections for smaller classes and more individualistic learning.",
    "This course is incredibly interesting, but it is taught in a way that requires no critical thinking. I feel like I never had to actually engage my brain with anything just memorize. I feel like courses should require a little bit of critical thinking, or at least prompt us to think about how the studies were preformed and whether their conclusions follow logically.",
    "Strengths: 1) very engaging lectures, 2) manageable course load, 3) daily quizzes made sure people were paying attention in class. Weaknesses: 1) lack of depth for topics This course can be improved if we cut down on the amount of material covered and instead focused with a lot more depth on a fewer topics.",
    "I really appreciate the review sheets. The lectures are really fun and thoughtfully planned.",
    "The logistics were a bit confusing. things changed a lot, and students didnt always know what was expected of them as a consequence. Maybe outline all the technicalities of the course from the beginning.",
    "This class reads like it's supposed to be a super easy gut, but then we were all screwed over by the first midterm and had no chance to get a sense of if we could bring our grades up before the credit D deadline. I ended up credit Ding it when everything after that was ridiculously easy. Overall, this class seemed kinda mismanaged and a waste of my time, but I'm also a neuro major and already had taken a lot of psych stuff. The exams being on canvas was honestly kind of difficult for me, especially with the format of the first. I would have benefitted greatly from having a copy of the test printed out in front of me to mark up and see my progress with.",
    "Overall no weaknesses",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. The strength was definitely the professor, and the weakness was probably the size of the class.",
    "Strengths: quiz at the end of each lecture, productive lecture style, how topics are split among classes Weakness: Making the papers only 6% of the final grade",
    "I thought the lectures were very interesting. However, at the end of the semester, it began to feel a bit tedious, as if Professor Ahn was trying to tie in more unrelated material to the immediate purview of the course.",
    "Great lecturer Went a bit quick",
    "It was a great course! The quizzes were a great way of making you pay attention during class and also help you process all the information immediately after the lecture. I also really liked the way the exams and papers were structured.",
    "The course offers super engaging and interesting lectures, while also not being entirely too easy that you forget what youve learned. Sometimes, especially around exams, Professor Ahn tends to get a little bit too wrapped up in helping students aim just for a good grade, by essentially spelling out every last detail that the exams will test. While this can be helpful to many students, it also causes the inevitable side-effect that you actually have to memorize all of the info on the study sheets because it will likely be on the test. Honestly, the overemphasis on memorization just before the exam, especially in such a structured manner is a little annoying for students who are genuinely intent on learning psychology. However, at the end of the day, her lectures are engaging and thoughtful enough that it makes up for it. I think the course pretty much offers what you put into it, so its well-suited to both students looking for a So gut and students who want to learn about rationality\/behavioral economics. Plus, Professor Ahns super cute dog, Pablo, is at office hours and review sessions, which is a huge plus.",
    "Incredible organization. NO HOMEWORK. In class quizzes everyday, but those are easy. Fair tests. AMAZING PROFESSOR (always makes class fun and uses psychology to help you learn). The two essays seemed to be graded a bit harshly at times, but that's the only weak point of this course I can think of.",
    "Strengths - class time was spent very efficiently with lots of information and fun facts. Weakness - can't think of any. I sometimes found difficult to get to know other people in the course but that's usually how it is when taking a huge class.",
    "The course has an excellent structure and gives you many real-life analogies and illustrations to understand the discussed theories in a vivid way. However, one should be aware that you'll be tested regularly and that you'll need to attend every class because there is a quiz at the end of each lecture. Moreover, I think one should give more grade contributions to the papers. Having only an impact of 6% to the final grade seems to less for the considerable time you have to invest in these two papers.",
    "Strengths: Professor Ahn is an engaging lecturer, and breaks down difficult topics in ways that are easy to understand. Exams are well spaced out (except for one we had right after Thanksgiving break), and you can do well on them with a bit of studying. Weaknesses: I felt that the two papers we had to write were very disjointed from the flow of the class overall, and worked mostly to drop my grade. The size of the class also made the professor and TAs less accessible than I thought going into the class.",
    "I think a strength of this course were the quizzes that were given at the end of each lecture, I think it was a great review of class material.",
    "A big weakness is that tests make up 72 % of your grade and they are hard, so if you are not a good test taker it might be hard to get a good grade on this class.",
    "Strengths: engaging lectures and not much work Weaknesses: it's impossible to remember all the experiments so I'm worried I'll just forget everything we learned",
    "The professor was very considerate and worked hard to keep the students engaged and provide a manageable course load. The course was very focused on the learning rather than the testing aspect which I really appreciated. The course material was very interesting as well. I do wish that the class size was not as big, but that is a minor detail, and I do regret that I did not visit Professor Ahn's office hours due to a schedule conflict, but it would have been nice if she offered other times.",
    "Strengths: No homework, Ahn is an engaging proffessor, material was relatively easy, and testing formats were predictable after the first midterm Weaknesses: Class in NOT curved (even though it has 500+ students) It was very difficult to do well in the first midterm because it was unclear how it is graded (friends lost marks for now including 'key terms' in an answer even though their answer was technically right.. that should have been stressed), the first midterm had a slightly unfair distribution of knowledge vs marks (just because i was unsure on one small thing, i lost 6 marks because the question kept getting repeated), Ahn moved through lectures at hyperspeed towards the end -- it was very difficult to keep up (perhaps shift around the content so there isnt SO MUCH to cover in the last few weeks?)",
    "Strengths: Interesting lectures, quizzes at the end of the lecture were helpful, little workload Weaknesses: Having section for this lecture I think would have been really beneficial.",
    "Amazing! Prof Ahn is so funny and a great lecturer, and the content was always good.",
    "Great lecture style, very engaging and entertaining. Large class size means low pressure and large peer community to help you through.",
    "Unlike some other students, I actually liked the format of the course. The daily quizzes weren't too difficult, and the placement of exams made it easier for students when finals period rolled around. With that said, the lack of any sort of weighting system made it hard for me to recover after a poor score on the first exam, and I was forced to credit\/D\/fail.",
    "Great lectures and the assessments after every class helped retain information. Assessments were appropriately difficult. Could have made grading of essays more clear. The essays didn't feel fairly graded.",
    "Strength-very engaging despite being a lecture",
    "Strengths are how interesting the course is, how well Prof Ahn teaches it, the use of quizzes in the lectures (I found these helpful in retaining information), the exam reviews were really good also. Only weakness I can think of is the huge size of the class, it would be nice for it to be in smaller groups as this would have been more engaging and would probably encourage more discussion on the topics however this cannot really be changed by the professor.",
    "The lectures were very fun and engaging. The quizzes at the end of each class made sure that I paid attention, allowing me to fully learn and grasp the material. Furthermore, by making lecture slides and recordings available online, I could make sure I fully understood the material. It could be improved by making the tests less memory-based. It might be my own fault, but I feel as if I just memorize a bunch of experiments and concepts for the exams and then forget everything a few days or weeks later. Something else that could be improved is to make the powerpoints have a more logical progression. It was hard to take notes directly because sometimes the next slide was a subpoint, new point, or side point and it wouldn't be very clear.",
    "Strengths - literally none. Weaknesses - too many to count. It sucked. Do not take it.",
    "the lectures are super engaging and professor ahn does an amazing job of making the material relevant.",
    "I liked the daily quizzes as they allowed me to retain the information longer. Professor Ahn is not out to trick you and the exams were super reasonable. The study guides helped with the exams.",
    "The material in this course is interesting, and the professor is engaging and in tune with the minds of college students. The information learned is immediately relevant and applicable to students' lives and other classes, which makes it really feel like you're learning and opening your eyes to the world as a result. The professor includes case studies that one really appreciates knowing as a citizen, let alone a student. It is relatively easy to get an A-, but harder to get an A, because there are few grades and the assessments do not provide for creative thinking or multiple acceptable answers. Exam and quiz questions are sometimes worded in a tricky way that one hopes not to encounter in college, as they are not so much a test of knowledge as of understanding how the professor works. It is especially frustrating when TFs admit that they too were stumped by the question--that surely indicates that it's not a good question. Once, I was sure that a question was actually incorrect in its premise; I raised this with a TF, who defended it incoherently, and then the professor stood up and announced that that question was in fact incorrectly worded. So, that part is frustrating. The course could be more rigorous in the research aspects and overall engagement with the material, but there is a lot of interesting reading provided for those who are interested, and a lot of people take this to have a light workload.",
    "The tests were much harder than the quizzes, so I felt slightly unprepared because I was not expecting the level of difficulty on the tests after getting 10s on all the quizzes.",
    "Strength: little quizzes after class helped to retain knowledge and were very easy Weakness: it's a huge lecture so there's not a lot of accountability or engagement",
    "Professor Ahn is engaging in lectures. It would be nice if we had a practice exam for the first exam. Even the professor said that the first exam scores are always the lowest.",
    "The course is great in keeping a low workload and introducing interesting questions and insights. The course could be improved by reducing the number of early assignments as these are difficult to handle during shopping period.",
    "Strength: engagement in lectures Weakness: Remembering concepts",
    "strengths: very well taught and organized, powerpoint slides always included all key bullet points, love how all lectures are recorded",
    "Great course, taught by a fantastic professor. The daily quizzes ended up being very repetitive, although they ensured that students remained engaged with the material. Assignments that were 1-3% of the grade seemed unnecessary--I'd recommend increasing the weighting",
    "-strengths: explore thinking in a variety of different ways -weaknesses: too memorization focused, but understandable for a class of this size",
    "The quizzes at the end of class every day were a bit stressful.",
    "The quizzes were an excellent way to incentivize me to stay focused during lectures! However, I would not go as far as to say many of the true-false questions on the exams were \"unfair,\" but I certainly don't think they accurately gaged my understanding of the material.",
    "The course is fairly well structured and the lectures are well presented, but some of the exam questions did feel unfair and repetitive, especially for the first exam. Most of the material was not very challenging to understand and there was no homework, which was nice. The professor addressed whether this is a 'gut' course on the first day of class, (which it would be if not for the intentionally tricky\/ambiguous\/repetitive multiple choice questions on the first exam), and proudly revealed that the average GPA for the course was lower than Yale's average (always beware professors who brag about low grades in their courses). The remaining two exams were much more fair, but the first one should be rewritten and not include repetitive, identical multiple-choice questions. But I doubt that will happen- again because the professor is proud of students doing more poorly in the class than is actually representative of their knowledge of the relatively simple material.",
    "Strength was the topics covered and weakness was the beginning of the course. Just power through it and it's a great class overall.",
    "The daily quizzes were a practical substitute for weekly homework and encouraged lecture attendance.",
    "Highly engaging course that requires some getting used to in terms of the courses structure (quizzes at the end of each class, test format) but is a highly enjoyable class.",
    "I wish there were more resources\/supplementary materials for us to understand course content\/expectations",
    "A weakness that might be difficult to fix since it definitely appeals to many in the class is that the readings are optional. Due to this, I didn't complete any of them except for the papers despite being interested in the material due to time constraints. It made me feel removed from what we were learning and forget it very soon after the exams. I wish there were short responses on the quizzes for each class because it was very difficult to know how well you understood the material just based off of the quizzes which made me think I knew more than I did for the exams despite rewatching all of the lectures, studying my notes again, and doing the study guides. The exams felt more difficult than necessary simply for the sake of not letting the class be a gut when in reality it could've been more relevant to what we emphasized in class. Another weakness was having the papers be worth 3% of the grade despite requiring a fair amount of work. They were graded rather harshly because they were worth so little when I think they should've been worth 10% each and graded more reasonably to balance out the exams.",
    "Maybe an extra credit way to go back and review old concepts of the course.",
    "I loved the lectures in this courseProf. Ahn is extremely engaging and fun. I also liked this quizzesthey kept me on track and, for the most part, made the exams less stressful. The only weakness of this course was the ambiguity of the study guides sometimes unnecessarily stressed me out before the exams.",
    "Strengths were that the class was very organized. Weakness was that it was very large so sometimes it was hard to get help.",
    "I liked that we took quizzes every class. I felt like it helped affirm that I knew what was covered in lecture.",
    "The class was very fast paced, but having lecture videos online really helped reviewing. I liked how Prof Ahn gave many examples of each topic we discussed, which made recall much easier. Also her lectures often had student interactions, or jokes, and were very engaging.",
    "Having a quiz each class proved a very effective format to check my understanding, but it's not necessary to keep you tuned in because Professor Ahn is a very engaging lecturer.",
    "I think having three non-cumulative midterms allowed students to delve into each topic further than we'd have been able to with one cumulative final. I would have liked to ask more questions during lectures, but I understand that's a difficult task for a large lecture.",
    "strengths are most definitely the design of the class - quizzes after each lecture help you retain the material learned and they're not too difficult, so it's a nice way to contribute to your overall grade! the exams are very straightforward and you know what's going to be on it beforehand. professor ahn is also an amazing, engaging professor. the only weakness i can think of is that you could only view the correct answers to quizzes immediately after you take it - it would be nice to have the opportunity to view answers later on to review for the exams",
    "The professor is extremely fun and engaging, and the form of assesment is great for learning.",
    "This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The lectures are well organized and very entertaining and you actually learn things from them at the same time. The daily quizzes are a good way to keep accountability amongst the students as well. No suggestions for improvement, it is great as is.",
    "Professor Ahn is lively, funny and passionate. Each class entertained me. The material is fascinating and covers research that is current. Weaknesses: none. (Unless you were hoping to skip classes... you must show up to every class to do well on the in-class quizzes)",
    "Strengths: Low stress class with interesting lectures. High lecture attendance was encouraged by easy daily quizzes and it was nice to be in a lecture hall that was always full. Weaknesses: I wish the class dove deeper into the core question of how humans think, without so many tangents into keep psychological experiments that are only related slightly to the idea of thinking. It felt too much like a general intro to psychology course.",
    "The paper rubrics were a little subjective (like being graded on creativity and feasibility), especially since they were designed to get us really thinking. Perhaps it was just that they were graded harshly for what they represented. Nonetheless, I think I strength of the class is the fact that it incorporated short papers in addition to quizzes and tests, because they did make me think more deeply (and creatively).",
    "this course was good but could be improved by having more papers or other work that wasn't just exams",
    "Strengths include the teacher and the content. The professor makes the class enjoyable. One of my favorite classes.",
    "Strengths include interactive lectures and interesting topics.",
    "too big of a lecture.",
    "It can be very daunting to ask questions or answer questions in a lecture theatre with so many students I like that there isn't a huge amount of compulsory readings and the lectures alone are enough for the exams",
    "The strengths of the course are that is engaging and interesting. The weaknesses are that at times it feels too basic and too impersonal. I understand this is an intro level class, but if the class pushed a little bit more into the math behind certain theories or delved more deeply into the foundation of ideas and equations I would have found it much for interesting. Additionally, I think it would have been useful to have discussion sections to make the lecture feel more intimate and personalized.",
    "Providing more practice exams before the midterms. I know a lot of people who were caught off guard for the first midterm in its difficulty, but then the next midterm was much easier.",
    "engaging and insightful. The size of the class was the only drawback.",
    "Strengths is that a large amount of the courseload is very much applicable to real-life. Additionally, while there is minimal amount of work outside of class, the in-class experience is very intense and reaps great learning."

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course to any student who is looking for an \"easy A\" course. Since the professor has stopped curving the class, it is much harder to achieve desired scores.",
    "Yes but only if you're willing to deal with opaque policies. Otherwise the class is very good.",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ALL STUDENTS (even if psychology isn't your thing).",
    "Yes, I think this course is a good class to take that isn't too stressful, and you still learn a lot. I think that the value of this course is that you can really apply everything you're learning into your own life. The workload is also really manageable even though I was taking many other classes.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. It is my favorite class I have ever taken.",
    "Not if you do not want to go into the psychology field or are not interested in the subject",
    "Yes, the material was interesting and relevant to our daily lives. It was also pretty easy to follow the ideas and lectures.",
    "I would indeed recommend this course! Lectures were quite engaging and exciting, and I learned so many concepts in depth.",
    "Yes, you get a greater understanding of how people think and react in different situations.",
    "Absolutely-- I loved the class. It was fair and interesting and I genuinely feel like I learned a lot. I looked forward to class each week.",
    "Yes. If you are new to psychology or familiar with some of the subject areas, there is definitely something to learn from this course. Professor Ahn is an amazing teacher and lecturer, and the content is so familiar and engaging that you will be surprised, invested, and enthralled the whole time. Lectures are fun and interactive, and hardly boring. Frequent quizzes mean the material is freshest in your mind when being assessed. There is no homework unless you wish to learn more. While exams are heavily weighted, they are extremely fair and not cumulative. This, along with the absence of a final, means you can engage with 1\/3 of the curriculum at a time without having to stress about over-memorization. As a whole, I recommend this course to absolutely anyone. I had no experience with psychology but am interested now in other courses. There is no better way to get exposed to the field, especially since this isn't a traditional\/lackluster intro course.",
    "Yes. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in psychology or about the way people think. This course has taught me so much that is applicable to my own life: I find that I am finding ways to applying the methods and systems we discussed in class to my own thoughts and actions. Thinking also has very little homework, so that can be an added benefit for anyone who wants to take an interesting, yet easily manageable class.",
    "If you are even slightly interested in psychological concepts then I would highly recommend this class! Although I feel like actual psych majors may get more out of other courses, this was a great class for people of any major to get their feet wet.",
    "Absolutely. This is the best class I have ever taken (at Yale and before it). I learned so many amazing things and Professor Ahn is such a joy to be around. She somehow was able to make class fun and interactive, even though more than 500 of us were taking it. The quizzes at the end of each lecture were very straightforward and just asked true\/false questions about studies that we had just talked about in lecture. If you pay attention while taking notes, you will do perfectly fine here.",
    "Probably not. It is a fine Credit\/D, but honestly just save your credit for a class that is more interesting and engaging.",
    "Yes",
    "Take this course if you feel you lack common sense and are out of touch with reality. If not, it's probably a waste of time.",
    "I would recommend this class, as it brings with it extremely interesting concepts that have to do with behavioral economics, everyday decision making, etc.",
    "You learn some really interesting things, and the workload is light, but it's difficult to get an A\/A+.",
    "I loved the information presented in the class, but class as a whole no.",
    "You need to take this class. It is a perfect filler class if you are taking 4 other classes. I'm sad I only took 4 classes and not 5 because with this class, I could have taken 5. There is no work outside of class except for two wicked small essays that don't effect your grade all that much. Your grade is pretty much 3 tests, in which she gives you a study guide for. You also have quizzes every class. Each quiz is worth 1% of your grade so you should probably go to class so you can take the quiz. Don't worry about the quizzes. For the most part, they are wicked easy and reflect what you learn in class that day so that you pay attention. If you want a good social science distrib., this is the class to take. Each class is a slideshow but has fun videos and showcases interesting experiments. Some times there is audience participation, which is not mandatory but it is fun. Good Looks",
    "Definitely! The course is very engaging and the workload is quite manageable. You walk out of the class learning a lot about how people make cognitive mistakes and how to improve\/eliminate such mistakes",
    "YES!! So interesting and applicable -- This class has fundamentally changed the way I approach making decisions, and how I make judgements about others. I genuinely looked forward to going to lecture, and it was overall minimal stress.",
    "This class is a great class to get you interested in psychology and really considering how psychology affects you on a moment-to-moment basis.",
    "yes",
    "Yes. Yes, yes yes. Maybe my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Very engaging. The exams are very doable as long as you follow the incredibly helpful review sheets.",
    "Yes, it's fun, interesting, and not stressful.",
    "I would! Content is really interesting and not that difficult!",
    "Definitely. If you are looking for an interesting course with a minimal amount of work, take this course. There are quizzes every class but they are on the content just covered so they are fairly easy to do well on. Be prepared to have the bulk of your grade be determined by exams though.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course to another student. I thought the exams were misleading and vague that made the exams unnecessarily hard.",
    "Yes-- the information is very interesting. While it may have been considered a gut in the past, she made an attempt to make this class less gutty by simply loading on the information. This class isn't curved, so you have to show up every day (especially with the daily quizzes) and make sure that you are studying hard and a couple days in advance.",
    "Yes! I think everyone should take this course if you get the chance. It is wonderful to see psych concepts in everyday life. Although there is no homework on a day to day basis, be prepared to study for the exams because they are by no means easy.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, even if they are not interested in psychology. The content of the course has a lot of real-world application and Professor Ahn is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes, a thousand times yes. I will think about and reference information learned in this class for the rest of my life. This is one of those classes that you will kick yourself for not taking in your limited time at Yale.",
    "I would highly recommend it! It's really similar to other intro psych\/cog sci classes, but it's really well structured and it includes a lot of different information that is really interesting. I encourage it for all majors!",
    "Yes! She makes lectures really interesting, funny, and engaging.",
    "YES! It'll change your life. I learned more about myself and the way the world works than I ever have before. This should be a required class.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed this class and the content and the grading was very fair.",
    "Definitely! I learned a lot and was very engaged, but the class never added to my stress significantly.",
    "Yes, the content is interesting, Professor Ahn is very engaging, and there are quizzes every day but they are not hard and actually made it easier to study for the tests.",
    "I would recommend because it is a more fun and practical course than other classes at Yale, it is pretty straightforward",
    "would recommend as an easy gut to supplement a harder semester. pretty interesting content as well and Professor Ahn made me smile",
    "Definitely! I think it's interesting and helpful for people of all backgrounds and intended majors to get a background in how we make decisions and an overview of some key psychology topics. Lectures were always interesting, humorous, and incorporated modern references. Professor Ahn is such an engaging lecturer.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student - I learned so much about human psychology, but in a very fun and engaging way rather than through a dull textbook.",
    "Yep, especially if you need a fifth class.",
    "This course is fairly interesting and not that much work. If you're looking for a course like that, I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "Meh, if they wanted to study for the exams then yes without doing any Homework. A good fifth credit, the second two exams are easier",
    "Honestly, the only reason to take is class is the low workload. No work except for 3 midterms and 2 very short papers. The class itself is not great and very boring. Getting a high grade is also not that easy. Would only recommend it if you have a busy semester.",
    "I would especially as a fifth class because the workload is pretty low beside the midterms. I think it's hard to do well on the midterms without a lot of preparation tho because they are content heavy and you have to memorize things exactly as Professor Ahn interpreted them (eg you will get points off for not including certain wording or a small detail of a study).",
    "Yes! Make sure you're interested in the material, and it is not a gut you actually need to pay attention and prepare for the tests but it's a good class she is a great lecturer",
    "I would recommend it only if someone was unfamiliar with cognitive biases and was genuinely interested to learn more - not just because the ratings are high or because it isn't a ton of work. (It isn't a ton of work, but that's different from an effortless A, and sometimes it can be hard to know exactly what the TFs are looking for when they grade.)",
    "If you want an interesting social science credit or interested in the decision making\/psychology or want to be more conscientious, this class is for yiu",
    "I would recommend this course to students looking for a course that extends upon Intro Psych, but it was similar to Psych and the Good Life in my experience.",
    "I really enjoy my work spaced out over time, so the structure of this class was really helpful in spacing out my learning and giving me incentives to go to class. The material is interesting and I really enjoyed the teacher's lecture style! You can tell that she tries incredibly hard to be engaging and interesting. Considering it was a 500 person class, I would say she did a fantastic job. However, I would shop it first as the material does go by quite fast.",
    "I learned a few interesting, applicable aspects of psychology in this course that have been useful in my daily life. However, the course went very quickly and it was difficult to keep up. Recommend this as a credit\/D course, but not really worth the effort to take for a letter grade. Interesting, and maybe worth taking for a grade if this is relevant to your field.",
    "Yes. I really liked this course. Professor Ahn is really funny and engaging and I looked forward to this class every week. I thought that she was engaging and did well with explaining the material most of the time.",
    "Definitely take this course if you want an easy additional class where you can learn something useful about life.",
    "Yes. Thinking is a fun class that makes you think more about yourself and others. It is content that sticks with you.",
    "Yes, learnt many things that were applicable to everyday life.",
    "It is enjoyable, but can be formidable if unprepared or if one does not put in effort.",
    "If you are interested in learning about the various gaps in human thinking, Thinking is the course to take. Note that it covers beyond just how we \"think,\" as lectures can cover unexpected or unrelated topics. The course is not a significant amount of work but exams, which make the majority of the grade, require thorough studying and memorizing of concepts and studies.",
    "Absolutely! This was my favorite class of the semester. It was not too demanding, but very informative. I use many of the topics that we discussed in class (in relation to effective studying, especially) on a weekly basis.",
    "Yes, it was super interesting and every lecture the professor made it as fun as possible!",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely -- entertaining lectures, pretty light workload, useful skills\/knowledge gained. Review sheet provided for exams, and if you complete it well and study it, the exams are not bad at all. Quizzes are just basic comprehension; papers are only 2 pages.",
    "yeah",
    "Yes! It was very engaging while having a low work load.",
    "Absolutely I would. Every lecture is very interesting and I looked forward going to class.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Ahn is very engaging and the class is well designed to facilitate learning.",
    "yes! super fun, right amount of work",
    "Yes! This course was awesome.",
    "I would recommend if they are trying to take in introductory psychology course, but if one wants more in-depth information or is a psychology major other courses might be better suited.",
    "YES! amazing course and professor Ahn is a great teacher. Definitely recommend. Fun class",
    "Definitely. It might end up being one of the best classes you take at Yale!",
    "Yes, as a Credit\/D\/Fail...not worth the stress of trying to get a good grade, but incredibly interesting",
    "Yes! It was really enjoyable and very little work compared to other classes I've taken.",
    "Not really it was a weird grading structure",
    "Yes as it was very interesting and taught good ways to study",
    "YES!! Definitely take this class. You need to go to class every day (there's a quiz-- it's easy) but other than that the workload is essentially just 3 non-cumulative exams. For these tests, Professor Ahn gives you a review sheet with literally everything you have to know and if you study that you'll get an A. Then there's 2 papers of the topic of your choosing but they're only worth 6% of the grade. Lecture is super interesting and definitely worth going to. Amazing class... must-take at Yale!!",
    "Absolutely! Prof Ahn is amazing and the class is really interesting and exciting. I took it with a handful of friends and it has been one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "I would greatly recommend it to both psych majors and non psych majors as this course is engaging and provides interesting information.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is both enjoyable and a good kind of frustrating that alters the way that you think and perceive the world.",
    "Absolutely!! This was an amazing course - easily one of my favorites here at Yale. The lectures are fun, the material is interesting, the assignments and exams are wonderfully designed to make us engage with the material further. The things you learn about the way your brain processes information is useful in its own right by raising awareness, but Prof. Ahn goes further and teaches you techniques to counter or harness the quirks of our minds. If you have the space to take this class, do it!!",
    "I would recommend this class. The material is interesting, well-taught, and the workload is not nearly as much as a could be.",
    "No unless you need it. I thought it would be a fun, interesting gut for a non psych major but i was mistaken...",
    "Yes, psychology majors and non-psychology majors!",
    "Yes. If you are to take any single psychology course, it should be this one (as opposed to something like Introduction to Psychology).",
    "No. The course is set up in a way that is NOT conducive to actually learning the material, but doing rote memorization in an extremely unproductive manner.",
    "I absolutely would recommend to ANYONE. It is so great.",
    "Absolutely. It was a fun course, and I enjoyed every class and the teacher very much.",
    "Yes! Professor Ahn puts in a lot of work to make sure the lectures are engaging and up to date. She covers aspects of thinking that are counterintuitive, so you are sure to learn something new every day. Plus, the course load is very manageable.",
    "Yes - the topics were so interesting and were relevant to everyday lives. Also, the workload is very manageable.",
    "Absolutely. If you love psychology, this class is for you. Professor Ahn is amazing and the content is interesting. You have all the resources you need in the class to be successful.",
    "I think it's a great course for anyone that wants to understand why people think and behave the way they do and the irrationality behind all of that. I think I learned a lot and will retain the information she taught us and it made me more interested in taking similar courses.",
    "Yes!",
    "Great class! Easy and interesting",
    "Yes! We covered tons of interesting topics. Prof. Ahn is a very engaging and funny lecturer and makes the every class enjoyable. She made every effort to tie the concepts we were learning back to the real world and gave us every opportunity to engage with her in office hours and chat.",
    "Yes! This is a interesting and fun class, but it is NOT a gut. Be ready to study a good amount for the exams!",
    "Yes. Easy course. Just go to lecture and pay attention. Great CR\/D\/Fail course. Prof Ahns lectures are super funny and engaging.",
    "Yes, if they're looking for a chill introduction to psychology. I am not a psych major, but I got the sense that the class may have been too easy for them. Most of all, yes, I learned a lot and had a lot of fun!",
    "Absolutely. The class is enjoyable and the workload is incredibly reasonable. I found myself looking forward to attending class and eager to apply its insights to my own life.",
    "Yes, every day was interesting and fun.",
    "Yes! Its a super interesting topic and Prof. Ahn is super funny and engaging.",
    "Only if you're a Psych major or credit D",
    "yes very organized so you know what is expected from you",
    "Yes, absolutely. This course will change the way you reason and think through problems, making it one of Yale's most applicable and relevant courses to your own life. It is also a fantastic course for anyone interested in behavioral economics and cognitive psychology.",
    "Yes, this class was awesome. I loved the material and going to class was easy because of how engaging Professor Ahn made it.",
    "Yes if they were going to take it Credit D -- I think the exams were challenging.",
    "Looking for a survey course of psychology that is not intro psych but is very fun and can be applied to real-life immediately? This is the class to take. It is one of those classes where you get what you put into it; the lectures go through a lot of experiments and concepts\/terms and it is fun to apply them and see them at work in the real world. However, you can also slack off and review everything before exams. With that said, the class is a gut in terms of workload, but it is not a gut grade-wise. Personally, I thought the tests were graded too strictly and points were taken off for unclear reasons. Breakdown of grade is standard but if you want to do nothing and walk out with an A, this is not the course.",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and I liked the topics covered in class.",
    "I would recommend this course! The lectures are super engaging and the topic material is fascinating!",
    "Yes definitely. She is an amazing lecturer, the material is interesting and class is always engaging even for a 500 person lecture.",
    "Absolutely! The course was super interesting and Professor Ahn was very engaging and a great lecturer. I always looked forward to coming to class and the topics we learned about are incredibly useful. The daily quizzes seem daunting at first but they really arent that bad. Definitely take this class if you have room for it!",
    "Yes, this is a good fifth course as it is interesting and not too much work.",
    "Yes. It's a really interesting course that doesn't have a ton of workload and is applicable to everyday life",
    "Yes- it was soo fun and I learned a lot about myself and others through the course",
    "I credit d'd the course and didn't even write the second essay or do ten of the quizzes. I just had to study for three hours before the test using a Google doc someone else put together and was fine.",
    "everyone should take this course!",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The class was really enjoyable, Dr. Ahn is a fantastic lecturer, and the material was interesting. The weaknesses of this class pale in comparison to those of other classes (though they are still serious), so I think it's a no brainer.",
    "YES! It is one of the courses every student at Yale should take. The concepts are essential!",
    "Yes, it's very interesting to learn about rationality and reasoning fallacies.",
    "Yes, this course is amazing! The material is so interesting to learn and the workload is so easy. There's just a quick 10-11 question quiz after every lecture and that's it, for the most part. There are 3 papers, but those are super easy, as long as you pay attention in class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because of how applicable it is to almost every field and aspect of one's daily life.",
    "definitely! It's honestly a fun and enjoyable class.",
    "absolutely esp if interested in why people make the decisions they do. Daily quizzes after lecture instead of weekly psets.",
    "YOU WILL NOT GET AN A. This course is designed to make an A nearly impossible. An A- is achievable with more memorizing that you're used to before the exams. But an A is very unlikely, by design. The questions on exams are often obscure, ambiguous to the point that you don't know what is being asked, and graded with a razor-sharp pick. But a good C\/D\/F or passive B+\/A-. The course is dreadfully boring. You'll have to fight sleep as you listen to the the carefully described (a credit to Prof. Ahn) studies, preparing to memorize the 5 experimental levels of some study and the specific examples given in class for an exam.",
    "Yes absolutely. It's a great and low-stakes way to learn a lot about the way we think. The lectures are really interesting and Prof. Ahn is absolutely fantastic. Never felt bored in lecture. If you have a really busy schedule and you need to fit in a social science credit, this is a great option",
    "Yes, if you are interested in psychology, this is a great beginner's level course.",
    "Yes, absolutely",
    "Definitely! The content is so interesting; I think it gives really valuable insight into our minds and beliefs. Professor Ahn does a great job making it interesting and relevant to contemporary life, and lectures are pretty entertaining. I have learned so much this semester and I constantly find myself thinking about and recognizing the things I have learned in everyday life.",
    "I took the course with friends (which I would highly recommend) and found so many of the studies and concepts applicable to my everyday life and the way I make choices in the world.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in behavioral psychology then I would highly recommend.",
    "Yes but beware Professor. Disrespectful",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to really go to the lectures and pay attention. I would have found it incredibly difficult if I hadn't.",
    "Yes, the content was interesting and lectures were generally fun to attend. Good as a fifth class; it's very low stress.",
    "Yes, a very interesting class, not too much workload.",
    "I feel very lukewarm about this. Content-wise it was interesting, but I feel like it fails to be intellectually stimulating to the level that it should be to be worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This is because not only does it have a relatively light workload, but it also is a great and engaging introduction to various reasoning fallacies\/phenomena.",
    "Yes, but definitely not a gut.",
    "YES. This course is so fun and really taught me a lot. I always looked forward to going to class every time.",
    "Yes! If you want to know more about the irrationality and functioning of the human mind, this is the course to take.",
    "I'm not sure honestly. For as easy as this class seemed to be, it also seemed really hard to get an A. At least with the unnecessary difficulty of the first exam.",
    "Yes, it was very applicable to my life, I found myself regularly quoting things from lectures.",
    "I would highly recommend the course.",
    "Yes, the subject material was really interesting and informative, professor was very engaging.",
    "I would, but I would warn that this is not a gut in the sense that it is an easy A. When there is not an exam, there is little to no work for the class. The readings are optional and there is just a requirement to attend lecture (because there are daily quizzes). But the exams do require studying, and the two essays are graded fairly seriously (depending on the TF). Speaking of TFs, they ranged widely in quality, but Professor Ahn was readily available for assistance. It would be a nice fifth course.",
    "Yes it is interesting and engaging",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is such an interesting class and a good way to get some exposure to psychology.",
    "Yes, take this course!! It's a really great introduction to behavioral economics as well as the psychology behind decision-making, biases, and thinking. Professor Ahn is a great and engaging lecturer and makes class fun to go to!",
    "Yes! very interesting material and presented in a way that will stick with you",
    "Professor Ahn does a great job of consolidating higher-level psychology concepts and bringing them down to a level that requires basically no prior knowledge on the subject, and she does so in an interesting and often humorous manner. Her lectures are fast-paced, and she covers a ton of material in each class, so its certainly not the kind of class in which you can sit passively. The daily quizzes require that you pay attention throughout class, but as long as youre engaged with the material, theyre really not that difficult. I think the course is well-suited to students who are cursorily interested in psychology or are looking for a low workload social science credit. She oftentimes glazes over deeper aspects of the concepts she teaches and doesnt always go into as much depth as one may want. However, seeing as she manages to cover such a diverse array of material in one semester, it makes sense.",
    "EVERYBODY SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE. Literally every major and profession will use the skills taught in this class. In fact, the world would be a better place if more people took this course to avoid biases, logical pitfalls, and other psychological pitfalls.",
    "No, I personally wouldn't recommend this course. I found that most of the material wasn't challenging (in part because a lot of it you hear in other psyc courses), yet was often taught in a way that made it much more confusing and complex than it had to be. Sometimes, lectures also went very fast and covered way too much material all at once. The in-class quizzes were in my opinion inaccurate assessments of knowledge and a drag, and I didn't particularly like taking online exams that were mostly multiple choice.",
    "Yes!!! It was very interesting to learn different fallacies that we can easily observe in our daily life. And figuring out why we tend to fall into those fallacies and how to prevent them to happen was helpful and fun!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to every student who is interested in the ways we think. This class will not only give you some insights into human psychology, but it will do it entertainingly so that you have some laughs during class.",
    "Yes, but to take as a junior or senior, possibly with Credit\/D. Looking back, I could've better used the time\/credit it took up in my sophomore fall to a class for my major, or one that was more enjoyable.",
    "Yes I would, I think you learn things that are very applicable to everyday life - no matter what your major is.",
    "Only if they really like psychology or love professor Ahn's lecturing style.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to either a first year or an upperclassmen who have space in their schedule for a relatively fair course that is very engaging and informational as well. I truly liked forward to each lecture as I had found learning about people's behavior to be very eye-opening, so if you need a credit, then I highly recommend taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, especially if they have an interest in psychology, economics, or other social sciences because it stretches so widely across different disciplines. Additionally, it was a very entertaining class.",
    "Yes! Amazing course, even if you've never taken psychology before.",
    "Would recommend this for anyone curious about psychology, behavioural science and how we think. Great learning opportunity, especially if yo utake it credit\/D and take it to truly learn. For majors and advanced psych majors, this may be a little bit basic.",
    "Yes, the material was definitely more interesting than other Yale courses that I have taken.",
    "Yes, take this course to learn how to apply psychological principles to real life. Very entertaining and fun.",
    "I totally would even for students who are not thinking about pursuing psych or cognitive science as their majors.",
    "Yes, it was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Yes! This is a class that you will be happy you took while you were at Yale. It was my favorite class this semester and I am able to see the concepts taught in class play out every day in real life.",
    "yes",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Don't take this as an evaluation of the Psychology major though, because it is not rigorous or representative enough for that. But whether or not you are thinking of majoring in Psychology, you should take this course or watch her lectures.",
    "yea, straightforward if you study and come prepared.",
    "Yes - workload is very manageable and the lectures are engaging with lots of examples that you'll find applicable to the real world",
    "Contrary to the title of this course, there was very little thinking involved. Challenges on tests came from ambiguous questions and erratic grading.",
    "I think it would be hard to get an A. Taking this class credit\/D was when of the better decisions of my senior fall.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want an less rigorous course-load and are interested in learning about how people think from a psychological perspective. Any learning would come from sustained interest in the course and this can only be maintained if students are genuinely interested in the topic. If students are not, they will not be pushed to participate much in the course due to the large student body and relatively few assignments where one needs thorough preparation.",
    "Yes. Interesting and applicable to many things",
    "Yes, if you're looking for a nice introductory psychology course because lectures are fun and easy to understand and professor is very engaging",
    "Absolutely--great class, great vibes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course because the content is so relevant to society and our personal lives. The whole purpose of the course is to change and\/or improve our mindset and natural tendencies in certain situations. There have been many times where I've been able to recognize certain patterns in my behavior or inclinations in how I think, then apply what I've learned in class to break those tendencies.",
    "It's a fun course for sure--Prof. Ahn always manages to keep things lively and interesting. She places an emphasis on real-life applications, which is nice--you get to decide how much you will take away from the course to apply in your daily life.",
    "Yes! This class is so interesting.",
    "Yes, this was the first time I had ever taken a psychology class and I am now considering majoring in it. It is a phenomenal course and is incredibly interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning about the descriptive and normative frameworks through which we can understand human processing of information. Also, this is a great first psychology course to take. It was mine, and now I'm certain I want to take more.",
    "Depends. It's an easy fifth class due to the fact that there's no homework, but it's not very intellectually challenging compared to other courses at Yale. The first exam is poorly written and since 3 exams make up about 75% of the grade, it is the reason the average GPA for the course is a B+\/A-, rather than an A-\/A, which one would expect of a gut like this.",
    "Yes, for sure. Thinking is one of those classes that's among the Yale classics, and for good reason. Professor Ahn is a great professor, super relatable, and knows how we're ~thinking~.",
    "It is a great introductory course to Thinking, especially for students with little to no experience in psychology.",
    "Absolutely; if interested in psychology but unsure whether it's worth taking PSYC 110, this class is the perfect cross between fun and informative",
    "If you want to actually get something out of it you have to go to office hours and do the optional readings so if you're willing to do that yes. Otherwise I'd recommend it if you're just looking to have enjoyable lectures and a manageable class but okay with forgetting most of it afterwards or just having a very surface level understanding of it.",
    "Yes",
    "Absolutely! Its a fun, informative class, where you get to learn a lot",
    "Yes, especially for those with no background in psych.",
    "Yes! It is extremely engaging and fun.",
    "Yes. The class is not terribly hard, except for maybe the few days before a test, but super informative and engaging!",
    "Yes I would. I felt that the information was really interesting and engaging.",
    "I would recommend this as probably an elective, and to someone who is really interested in special psychology and decision making.",
    "Absolutely. You will leave nearly every class with a more complete, tangible understanding of how and why we think the way we do and make the decisions we make.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student; I think it is a great way to be introspective about the way you think.",
    "YES would highly recommend! See my answer for the strengths of the course ^",
    "Absolutely! It is great both for one's personal life but also enlightening in an academic sense. It introduced me to many great researchers, studies and insights.",
    "A solid fifth class. Very interesting topics and Prof. Ahn makes the material fun and easy to understand.",
    "Yes, this class is an amazing way to get a Social Science credit without putting in much work but while also learning a lot of interesting and relevant things. It is a total gut in a very good way - its not a class that you do nothing and learn nothing, its a class that if you go to lecture and actively listen and take notes you will learn a lot and never need to study or do anything else for the class. There is no homework and the tests and quizzes are verbatim lecture slides. So if you are alive during class, you will find Professor Ahn entertaining enough to learn the basics and that is really all you need to do wonderfully in this class.",
    "YES!! I would highly recommend this class to anyone, regardless if they decide to pursue psych later, because you learn so much about how people function and how you can use these concepts to your own advantage. Additionally, the courseload overall is pretty light because there is no homework except for a quiz at the end of each lecture. However, this also deceives students into thinking that the exams are easy or that they don't need to prepare that much which is false because there's a lot of content to review and none of the exams are curved.",
    "Yes. I am a psych major and this was one of my favorite psych classes I have taken. Professor Ahn is funny, energetic, entertaining.",
    "It's an easy fifth class if it's taught the same way. Low workload. It would not be difficult to get a B+ or an A-. I would not recommend it if you have already taken some psychology courses because you will find it repetitive.",
    "I think it's a great survey course of many important topics in psychology. I like the emphasis on empirical studies and I like that the professor gave multiple examples for every phenomenon. It moves a little fast and we sometimes spent only a day on a topic, so for that reason you may get more out of it if you have some psych or cogsci background already.",
    "yes, as long they're prepared for lots of hard exams",
    "Yes. It is a great introductory lecture for anyone who is interested in psychology.",
    "Yes you learn a lot.",
    "Yes, very easy-going and fun to learn",
    "It was a fun 5th class, but hard to get an A in because the exams require lots of memorization.",
    "Yes, very interesting and useful subject matter.",
    "I definitely would if they are interested in the subject matter.",
    "Yes I would because you learn new and important concepts that you will quote in your daily life."
