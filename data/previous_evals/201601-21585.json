   "comments": [
    "Homer's Iliad is a phenomenal course. We met twice a week--Mondays and Wednesdays at 9 AM--and each session was extremely high energy. Professor LeVen balances each week's lessons, going the extra mile to ensure that classes suit each student's intellectual interests. Classroom discussions were always held at a high level, and LeVen encouraged us to engage with one another's ideas through presentations and in-line commentary. On to the workload; you're going to want to put a lot of time into this course if you want to do well in it. Each quiz--worth five percent of the grade--covers an entire book of the Iliad, and you're expected to be able to translate on sight any passage from that book, as well as to be able to provide grammatical commentary. The workload is absolutely fair, though, and there is certainly a learning curve to the Homeric dialect. The paper--on a topic of your choice--is a great way to delve deeper into your interests in Homeric studies. The course allows students who are independent-minded to direct their own course of study, a wonderful feature given the sheer breadth of material covered.",
    "It's a good class. We read a substantial amount of Homer along with a great deal of secondary literature. Professor LeVen is a kind and knowledgable instructor. Even if you haven't read Homer before, you can figure out the language easily enough. Class spends more time focusing on broad issues than nitpicking at grammar in translation, which is fine if you're comfortable reading, but the translation quizzes will hurt if you don't keep up. Would definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely take it if you feel you have the background. It is not the L5 course to jump into but if you have some preparation, especially in terms of grammar, you will love it. Take the advice offered by Prof. LeVen or whoever is teaching the course really, and try to stick to the timetables provided as much as possible."
