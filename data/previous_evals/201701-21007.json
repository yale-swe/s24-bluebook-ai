    "The course is essentially a graduate seminar, so it's easy to see how the technical level of the discussion and emphasis on (somewhat arcane) debates in the secondary literature might put off those without much experience in ancient philosophy. But for those with more experience, the discussion could be enlightening and engaging. Nonetheless, there could have been some more effort to connect the interpretative debates to philosophical issues of broader interest."
