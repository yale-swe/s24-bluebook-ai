   "comments": [
    "It didn't directly influence my research, but the methodology in which we approached the subject will be something I'll take with me.",
    "This course gave me a deeper understanding of what vernacular architecture means, and how it evolves over time. It has given me a greater respect and value for 'everyday' buildings, and has taught me how to look critically at a building to evaluate its evolution. These skills will help me in my architectural studies.",
    "Prof Cooke is an exemplary teacher and scholar. I learned from him what it means to be a good teacher (e.g. how to respond to students' comments, how to lead a seminar\/ academic discussion, how to respond to questions meaningfully) and what it means to really know a subject well. I'm thankful for his encouragement and, most of all, the liberty he gave us to pursue our interests. The latter enables me to experiment and venture into unknown territories (re: subject of study and art history -writing-). The readings he chose are excellent. The class had a jovial atmosphere and I looked forward to it every week. He made learning truly enjoyable and pleasurable. The experience has been extremely important to me as an aspiring art historian."
