    "The breadth of the course material was very broad. For example most the the architecture from the Modern Movement could have been included in the course because hygiene and cleanlinesss were such an obsession of the time. Nonetheless, this doesn't mean that they should ALL be included. More curating and editing of which historical projects discussed would have been better.The best part of the course was when it reached contemporary projects. I think that if the course focused on this period of time, people would be more enthusiastic about the course.",
    "I think the format of the class was pretty standard for a seminar: required readings every week, short lecture, and then a class discussion. I appreciate the many different perspectives and writers of the readings and the small \"interruptions\" in the regular flow of class with student presentations, typology research, etc.",
    "I think the topic was fascinating but not well organized. It was hard to find a common link between projects even within a single lecture. I think Professor Sample is very knowledgable but needs to improve her lecture skills and organization of lectures. She came across as a bit uninterested in the class",
    "The material presented was highly interesting, though it could have been presented in a more concise and engaging manner. The lack of organization with the administrative portions of the class as well as time management in class took away from the effectiveness of the class. The timing of the class on Monday mornings detracted from the quality of attention in class. Professor Sample's lecture style can also be more engaging.The assignments were manageable but effective. We had two presentations on urban and architectural typologies, and a presentation on our final paper. All of these were discussed in a seminar setting, with a lot of interesting dialogue between the students and the professor.",
    "I really enjoyed much of the readings for this course; however, I did not find the lectures as enlightening or revealing. I think that by organizing the course in terms of different projects and architects, it made it feel more like a architecture history survey course. It would have been more interesting if the lectures focused more on the historical \/ medical context, rather than the design. The most engaging lectures and readings were those that explored how disease or health had a direct effect on the architecture and urban design (for example, the first lecture on mapping in London).",
    "I wish there had been more of a presentation of the relationship between architecture and disease, not just buildings that are functionally related to health\/medicine\/etc. While many of the readings were very interesting it seemed that much of what was discussed in class was in a sense a survey of modern architecture made to be disease related.Assignments and the sequence of the course were totally adequate.",
    "Material was very interesting and quite new to me - I think the body of the class could have been edited more - seemed a bit too broad for one semester. Class discussions were best when covering contemporary issues. Readings need to be edited down - too broad and extensive. The sequence seemed arbitrary.",
    "This class sounded very interesting, and the fact that prof. sample had justfinished a book on the subject was encouraging. However the class continuously failed to present a thesis, argument, or coherent framework to why design and disease are interesting and important.",
    "I think that this course was very interesting. Looking at architecture through the lens of health was new to me. I feel that while we mostly looked at work by architects that I already knew something about, we looked at work by those architects that I had not previously been exposed to."

   "comments": [
    "I approached the course with one basic objective: to define \"design\" and \"disease\" in my own terms. The course certainly let me do that with regards to the final paper, for which I am grateful.",
    "The class as a whole was slightly under my expectations. The content was eye-opening and exciting, but it was presented in a lackluster manner.",
    "I expected this course to explore how disease and health issues have affected design over the years. Instead, the course focused more on the design of different hospitals and health facilities, without spending as much time as I had liked on the medical and historical context. I had hoped the course would also touch on issues of humanitarian design and how underdeveloped areas have dealt with disease and natural disasters. Unfortunately, the course was more interested in the usual architectural canons (with a few exceptions).",
    "I expected more analysis of architectures role in spaces dealing with disease and disease in general. How disease\/health can be viewed or altered through the lens of architecture. This was not effectively met.",
    "I expected the course to be a broad overview of the intersection of health and architecture - this goal was achieved and my eyes were opened to a lot of projects and issues.",
    "I didn\u0092t really know what to expect from this course, but I really enjoyed the content."

    "I valued the open-mindedness of the course and the caliper of readings we did each week. I also valued the clear interest our instructor had in the materials.",
    "I am really interested in the subject matter of the course. Therefore, this course was the perfect retrospective history course that whetted my interest on the subject matter as a whole.",
    "Although the course was not all I had hoped it would be, I did find it valuable. As it was the first architecture history \/ theory elective course I took at Yale, it was an interesting and unique way to learn about certain architects.",
    "The course was valuable in that I got to explore the intersection of health and architecture.",

   "comments": [
    "Hilary is extremely knowledgeable about the topic materials. She very much encouraged class participation and wanted for this to be more of a symposium than a lecture. However, my only criticism is that I think sometimes this backfired; sometimes students would say comments that weren't particularly backed up by anything, and I think Hilary needs to step in more often to police the quality of discussion. I think that, despite what you might assume, sometimes having lofty standards makes students want to speak more - they are always hoping to say that brilliant thing that resonates well with the class.",
    "Professor Sample's lecturing was somewhat unenthusiastic though the material presented was highly exciting. Though these impressions may be biased by the fact that almost everyone came to class lacking in sleep.Our trip to NYC was amazing. Meeting Paola was inspiring and highly educational.",
    "TA was very helpful, clearly knowledgeable, and always available when needed.",
    "Again I feel that the course could have been more streamlined in terms of the readings and the overall sequence. The assignments - bringing in examples - and the paper seemed a bit 'up for grabs' and not very integrated with the material of the course.",
    "The weekly lecture format was very ineffective, their needed to be a framework or argument about how we should be approaching the topic that was just never made effectively.Lis Cena was helpful, contributing to discussions, and keeping things organized.",
    "I think that the instructor was very effective in communicating subject matter. However, I think that it would have been better had we had more in-class discussions."

    "The research papers could have been dealt with in a more rigorous fashion. If there was truly an intention of making a collection of student research in a book or compilation, then more structure for research development ought to have come from Prof Sample or the TA",
    "I have only one suggestion outside of what I said above (stricter standards for discussion contribution), and I actually think that this might help that. Based on the subheading of the course (\"new typologies,\") I should have assumed that we would be looking at mostly buildings. While I think that we might continue to look only at buildings, I think that framing each class around a certain type of building (hospitals, asylums, pharmaceutical headquarters, etc.) might have made it more difficult to understand evolving attitudes about health. I would propose organizing it more thematically than typologically - we could use the exact same case studies, but framed more in terms of \"health as ____\" instead of a building type. The reason is that I think I observed a tendency in the class to assume that most building typologies shared a similar attitude towards health, and that these perspectives varied from typology to typology, but not necessarily within each typology. I think it might elevate the discourse to see how certain philosophies of health might be materialized in very different ways, on a variety of types, scales, and contexts.That said, I very much enjoyed the class and felt it was an excellent seminar...the fussiness of my criticism is a compliment to the course.",
    "Change of class time would be good.More discussions on different types of typologies, as well as more information on present day design strategies and trends.More visits to healthcare facilities.",
    "I suggest thelectures focus more on the disease aspect rather than the design. As mentioned earlier, the most engaging lectures were those that really illustrated how disease had a direct effect on the design of our built environment. I also think it would be valuable to discuss how humanitarian design has tried to tackle issues of health in underdeveloped areas.",
    "More linkage to the readings. More inspiring\/creative lectures?",
    "more structure in class, less out of class assignments.",
    "I think that the course could be improved if we had more in-class discussions."
