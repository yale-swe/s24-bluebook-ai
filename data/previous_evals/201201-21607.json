   "comments": [
    "easy. I did no psets and did fine on the final. if you're quantitatively inclined its cake. Maybe a little less easy than first semester",
    "It's a fun course, interesting material, but you need to learn things on your own outside of class. For problem sets, you've just gotta go to section. It's stupid, but it's the only way.",
    "Good basic physics class, especially for pre-meds. The problem sets are near-impossible, but the midterms and quizzes are much more approachable. Go to the Sunday help sessions, and shop TAs for section.",
    "its much better than phys170, the psets are totally doable (but still done in section :D) the material is more relevant and i actually understood what was going on in (some) lectures.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning about a bunch of really interesting biological processes in terms of physics. If you took 170 you know what you're in for.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting way to fulfill the general physics requirement. The biological\/ medical applications are actually quite compelling and very relevant to those who are interested in applying to medical school. The workload is manageable and the quizzes\/ exams are fair, though problem sets are often very difficult and will require countless hours with TAs and a study group. But overall, great introductory physics course!",
    "I found this class to be relatively low stress. There is no point in attending lecture, which saves you a lot of time. Go the tutors or review sessions for problem set answers and then spend the day leading up to a test mastering those p-sets, and I was completely set.",
    "Yes",
    "Often a requirement but my biggest suggestion for you is to GO TO STUDY HALL\/SECTION\/TA's OFFICE HOURS and study the online resources (notes, practice problems\/tests). Simon and the TAS provide all you need for you to succeed, you just have to go to them and learn!",
    "sure, you need to right?",
    "Take it definitely if you're premed. The work is extremely difficult at times, but it is always possible to do well if you put in the effort.",
    "Yes. Although I am not a 'physics person'i found the lectures easy to follow. As long as you practiced you will be fine.",
    "NO. don't take it. do some other physics and actually learn something",
    "Phys 171 is good overall intro physics course. The workload is manageable, and the course expectations are reasonable. The weekly quiz and problem set can get tedious, but they force you to keep up with the material, which makes studying for exams much easier. Professor Mochrie really wants to help students, so he creates plenty of opportunities outside of class to get extra help. He also provides lots of practice problems before exams, which are really useful. If you have to take an intro physics course, I would recommend Phys 171 as a pretty painless option.",
    "Take it if you have to but be prepared to be more confused than in 170. Ok curve.",
    "It is a lot of work. There are problem sets and weekly quizzes. It is the type of class that you really have to keep up on throughout the semester in order to do well at the end. I would recommend it to a fellow pre-med who needs to take an introductory physics course.",
    "Take it if you are premed, but if you need the prerequisite for some other major consider taking 180 so that you will just learn physics (and not biology, too).",
    "More confusing and obscure than 170, but it's closer to \"normal\" physics than last semester.",
    "I would not recommend Physics 171 to a fellow student.",
    "if it's a premed req or you have taken physics before take it.",
    "If you have to... problem sets are IMPOSSIBLE. If you prepare well (do lots of the practice problems) for the tests, you'll do fine though. Material is difficult and I don't think I really understood much of it.",
    "Yeah, take it if you need to take physics. It's pretty okay.",
    "It is okay. The psets take an inordinate amount of time and many are not able to be completed out of sheer difficulty. The peer tutors, if still available, were helpful in this regard. Also take advantage of the TA help sessions on Sundays, as they all do a good job of reviewing the lectures and preparing you for Monday's quiz. I wouldn't take it for fun, though I doubt you would be if you are reading this.",
    "Overall, PHYS 171 is very similar to PHYS 170 in terms of teaching style (same professor), types of problem sets, weekly quizzes, and types of exams. The concepts taught in this second semester course, however, are much more difficult, and the math used may seem initially confusing at first. Nevertheless, I still felt like I learned from this course.",
    "The course was a fantastic overview of SHM, waves, and electromagnetism. The professor was great. I really enjoyed the class. If you are looking for a physics requirement for MCDB or premed, TAKE THIS COURSE OVER ANY OTHER COURSE! You will not regret it.",
    "This class gets very frustrating, and I would not recommend it. If you have the proper math background, take Physics 181. The problem sets are impossibly hard, so you need to go to section where the answers are given out. The tests and quizzes are actually very easy so the curve is usually very high. This makes for a poor structure overall that is not conductive to learning. Additionally, the topics taught in Physics 180\/181 are much more relevant for the MCAT.",
    "Chill premed class, but the math was difficult. The biological applications were more relevant and the TAs were as awesome as ever.",
    "Yes, for pre-med.",
    "It's interesting, though the psets take a while. Quizzes and exams are fairly easy (or at least, certainly doable), and the curve isn't bad at all. Take it if you're less interested in quantum and all that 181 stuff and are okay with biological switches and using imaginary exponentials a LOT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to pre-meds. The curve is very generous (I'm pretty sure I got an A) and you should definitely take this if you are grade conscious (which you should be, if you are premed).The only downside is that you don't learn MCAT physics, but it is still nice to receive an A grade and have physics be done with.",
    "You probably have to take it. It's not very interesting material but Simon is a very fair professor. He really wants everyone to do well.",
    "It is a solid introduction to physics. If you have a good background in physics, take something higher.",
    "Take if if you need to learn physics and are interested in its applications to biology. Really rewarding and a great start to your Yale career.",
    "It's a uniquely interdisciplinary physics course that can be as interesting and illuminating as it is laborious. So if you are willing to invest adequate time and energy, it's well worth your efforts.",
    "Great course. TA sessions are wonderful. Simon is great. Tests are a good representative of the course material. Very fair.",
    "A lot of emphasis is placed on formula derivation, so the lectures aren't too helpful. Very friendly professor though.",
    "Weekly problem set along with a weekly quiz. TAs are allowed to be helpful on problem sets BEFORE they are due, so go to the help sessions! Simon is a good teacher with realistic expectations for what biology majors can learn in the course. I'd take it over PHYS 180!",
    "If you're thinking about taking this, you're probably a pre-med, in which case you don't have too much of a choice. I picked this over 180\/181 because I didn't want to take multi-variable (recommended for 181). The problem sets are rough but the exams aren't too bad.",
    "Some interesting concepts. More mathematical than Phys 170. Very difficult problem sets that usually aren't helpful at all for the exams but the exams aren't terrible so you're still likely to do well",
    "it takes a lot of time but if you put effort into it you can get a pretty good grade. i'd recommend it to someone if they're premed and need to take physics",
    "Physics 171 is the only class that you should take after Physics 170, in my opinion, just because you'll be used to Mochrie's system and you might not have learned enough in Physics 170 to switch to the pace of Physics 181.",
    "The material is probably a bit more difficult than 170, and there's a lot of unnecessary and convoluted derivations, but it's pretty much the same style as 170 so if you got the hang of that you should be fine! It's definitely a class where all the resources you need to do well are available, so if you just put in the time and go to the sections and review sessions (there's a lot and it takes up some time which can get frustrating), then you will do well in the class! Even if we got tough questions on midterms sometimes, they always graded really fairly. You will learn a decent amount of what you need to know, and it's very possible to do well in the class.",
    "This was a good class and I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject of physics. It is also a good class for fulfillment of pre-med and biology major requirements.",
    "I think you should probably take 180 if you really want to learn something. I don't think I learned much from this class.",
    "PHYS 171is exactly like PHYS 170 in format and logistics (weekly Sunday help sessions, Monday in-class quiz, Monday night study hall, Tuesday sections, and Wednesday problem set due date; two midterms and a final exam; and the option to have your final exam count as 100% of your final grade). The main difference between PHYS 171 and PHYS 170 is the content: the material in PHYS 171 is a lot harder and more difficult to grasp. The material involves a lot more (complex) math, and the lectures are devoted mostly to derivations and solving differential equations. Almost the entire semester is spent on oscillators, waves, and electricity and magnetism, which lends itself to a lot of math; the problem sets are also a lot of math. Some of the problem sets are exceptionally lengthy and time-consuming, but towards the end they become more manageable.",
    "If you are not a physics enthusiast, I would suggest taking 171 over 181. It is not as much of a time commitment as other premed classes - I would actually consider it the class I did the least amount of work in this semester. The problem sets are frustrating and long, and you and your friends have to go to section and other extra sessions to get the answers. That being said, the professor and TAs actually care about the students and went the extra mile to help us. Lectures are long and pretty boring, but Prof. Mochrie does have some cool demonstrations. The midterms and final are not too difficult, they just take a lot of practice problems beforehand to know how to understand and answer the Prof Mochrie's questions. I would recommend it for a student who is premed, and doesn't want to be stressed out by other physics classes. Overall, it's a low stress class. It doesn't exactly match up with the lab course. It is a different type of physics than I was expecting, but you're not expected to know how to do complicated math. I don't think I learned a large amount from the course, but I enjoyed the professor and TAs, and it was a low time commitment.",
    "Take it if you're premed.",
    "Overall, Physics 171 was an engaging course. The pacing was good and it was well organized and run by the professor and teaching fellows. I learned how to understand physical situations using equations, which is a crucial skill.Professor Mochrie is very approachable and understanding. He is one of the few science professors I have had who really care about the students: he tries his best to tailor the course to our interests (e.g. biological applications), and is open to students' opinions about improving the course. However, often times he incorrectly gauges students' prior knowledge, which leads to us being lost and confused during lecture, but he admits this mistake.Overall, he is a great person and I really liked him as an instructor.The 2nd semester of physics is more difficult mathematically and conceptually, but the Physics 171 curve is more forgiving than Physics 180 or 200.",
    "yes if you have to take a physics class. everything seems a lot harder than it is. problem sets take a really long time and weekly quizzes seem sort of random, but once you get the hang of it, it is not as terrible as it starts out to be.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you have to take it (because 180) is much more work) e.g. if you're premed and just need to fulfill the requirement.",
    "This class was challenging\/confusing at times but a blast to be in thanks to the charismatic quirkiness of Simon Mochrie. I recommend this class to anyone who needs a Physics course to fill a requirement for a major, even if you're not pre-med.",
    "Less pleasant than first semester for sure!"
