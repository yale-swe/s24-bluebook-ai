    "This was the first year that this course was merged. I wanted to share my feedback separately for each course.Mike Ferucci's operations course: I thought overall the course was really useful and the readings, field trips, and exercises were well planned and designed. Mike is really good at explaining material, and very responsive to student feedback.Chad Oliver's Managing Resources course: I thought this part of the course was pretty disappointing overall. I found the lectures very difficult to follow, almost incoherent, and the readings were similarly vague and mostly repetitive. The exercises were frustrating and time consuming and I heard nothing but negative feedback from my fellow classmates on each and every one of them. The final exam is similarly just a series of really vague and open ended questions that really don't teach anything tangible. The only redeeming quality about this class is that Chad is very flexible in terms of allowing students to design their own project and he is also very flexible with deadlines.I think it is a mistake to have joined these two courses, and I think people who want to learn more about forestry operations are much better suited taking a separate class with Mike. I found the Managing Resources section to be one of the most frustrating classes I've had at FES. If I could get a refund, I would.",
    "Mike Ferrucci's portion of the course was great, but he was only given limited time. The following comments (except #14) are in relation to Oliver's portion of the course.",
    "The entire course was extremely disjointed without any structure. There seemed to be minimal linkage between the Operations section taught by Professor Ferrucci and the other material presented by Professor Oliver.I walked away from the course with very, very, little benefit.",
    "This is really two separate courses- the management course taught by Dr. Oliver and the operations component taught by Mike Ferrucci. The management component was poorly taught, did not follow any logical path, and was a significant waste of time. The operations component was okay, but still did not cover some important elements of practical forestry, such as contracting, monitoring logging jobs, log marketing, tallying, etc. These would be very good additions. If I hear another lecture about feller bunchers and forwarders I'm going to fall asleep.",
    "The course improved my understanding of resource management global perspective.",
    "class was an inappropriate combination of two materials - logging operations and general resource management",
    "To all questions: these are evaluations of Chad Oliver. Mike Ferrucci's portion of the class was very valuable. I feel cheated that I did not get to take his full course.",
    "Mike Ferucci gave good lectures. I don't know if I learned a single thing from Chad Oliver.",
    "1--Not really any assigned readings. Just some documents thrown up on the class website. Never read anything2,3,4--The material taught in the class had no relation to the Exercises so going to lecture seemed completely pointless. The pace was slow because the lectures were illogical and seemed to contain no content. Some exercises required dozens of hours of work while others required making spreadsheets look pretty5,6,7--The Operations field trip I went on was really great and valuable--there should have been more that were not on Saturday but I understand the difficulty of competing with Silviculture.",
    "This is the worst class I have ever taken in my entire life!!! My comments are for Chad Oliver's \"managing resources\" half only, Mike Ferrucci's forest ops class is very valuable and should remain in the curriculum as it's own class. In fact, mike should also teach a wildlife management course. Chad, on the other hand, should not be teaching at all. There was no organization of the class. Students had no idea what was expected of them, and had to keep asking each other just to be met with mutual bewilderment and eye rolling at the complete ridiculous waste of time we were being put through. The lectures were rambling stories with no frame of reference that we're impossible to extract information from. Despite the clear syllabus, none of the listed topics or skills were taught. The required exercises had unintelligible and incomplete instructions for that amounted to tedious, out-of-date busy work. Chad's TA was awful and unwilling to help or make herself available to help with the exercises that any student would need hours of help with. She did not attend any of the classes to interpret Chad for the students either or help with any of the class organization. But it doesn't matter, because this class is beyond the help of a good TA! (Mike's TA Tommie was great, by the way)!So to conclude, this class should cease to exist, period. It was a colossal waste of time, and caused a great deal of stress. I want my money back!! The administration has failed it's students horribly. The worst part of all is that most of the students only took this class fulfill a requirement. Any other elective would have been better. This does not belong in an accredited degree program. I think Chad Oliver is a very valuable asset to FES in many ways, for example through independent study, but NOT a structured class.",
    "The course had two instructors. I found the operations component to be very helpful and relevant for students pursuing Forestry degrees. The management component has the potential to be helpful over the longterm, however, it would be more beneficial if organized better. Particularly, the forest modeling\/inventory (LMS, FVS) was a bit clunky and inaccessible. If more emphasis and organization were placed on fewer cases it would greatly help."

   "comments": [
    "The field trips were great and were directly relevant to the course. However, presentations on the field trip material seemed to reduce the amount of time there was for the Managing Resources Section. It would have been nice of there was time to do some of the exercises (Excel Toggle, LMS) in class with the professor but because of the divided amount of time between the two professors, it was not possible to spend an entire class just learning to do the exercises.",
    "The flow of the materials should be improved. It was pretty difficult for me to understand the material because of the collaboration between the managing resources and forest operation.",
    "I think Forest Operations should be a separate course so that there is more time to actually dig into the material, do more field trips, etc.",
    "The organization of the lectures is beyond confusing. I did not learn much in regards to the \"managing resources\" portion of this. A new instructor would significantly improve this.",
    "The course was completely disorganize. Students typically hadno idea what was going on. Often I would leave a lecture with no idea what I was supposed to take home from it or how it applied to anything I was interested in.The course assignments, with the exception of operations, were an absolute waste of time. They were mostly irrelevant or so poorly presented that students were left extremely frustrated. The assignments require MAJOR revisions if they are to be anything but a waste of time.",
    "Coordination between two lectures",
    "The lectures across the board were terrible. The management lectures were absurd, and the operations lectures were slow, repetitive, and only moderately engaging. I think that Mike Ferrucci would do a much, much better job teaching on his own.",
    "Lecture organization, and more field trips.",
    "logging operations component needs more time - if we dont have time to go the field to see operations, we could at least spend time watching videos with the narration of the instructormanaging resources component was impractical - maybe a useful overview for an undergrad course but not useful material for grad level",
    "Chad Oliver needs to stop teaching. While he may have been a leader in the field in past decades and his experience would be valuable in other settings, his teaching style and course content no longer resonate with students. Managing Resources and Forest Operations should absolutely without a doubt be two separate classes. It was a massive mistake to combine them. I spent a total of four hours outside of class working on the Managing Resources portion of the class. It is insulting to me that Yale allows students to waste their time and earn credit for a class that required next to no work. The course expectations were unclear from the start of the class, to the point that during finals week students still had no idea if they had completed enough assignments. I must repeat from other comments, however, that Mike's part of the class did well with the time\/space it was given.",
    "Anything that Chad Oliver did was of little or no practical use. His lectures were scattered and poor, and the projects were ill-conceived and had little value for learning. My time would've been much better-spent doing literally anything else.",
    "All of it--the exercises were useful but were not connected to anything in the lectures (and vice versa)The Operations section should have been given equal time as the Managing Resources section. The two classes have great potential to be blended, so if they continue to be co-taught I think the class needs a serious overhaul and redevelopment to make that blending happen!Managing Resources had great potential to be logical--the Four levels of Management (Operations, Tactical, Strategic, and Policy) could have been explored more explicitly and in depth while also examining each within the six styles of Management (Exploitation, Preservation\u00e2\u0080\u00a6)",
    "The management exercises could be better executed. Mainly, the exercises would benefit from organization. I would suggest to focus on fewer exercises and partition them so that students could get feedback as they progress through the exercises for improvement and understanding. Also, more information on the operations component would be helpful."
