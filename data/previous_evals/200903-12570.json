   "comments": [
    "Overall the class was pretty good. It was a bit disorganized at times, and I thought that there was too much overlap between the book and lectures. The topic was very interesting though and I liked the progression of what we learned. I felt as if I was at a disadvantage to students who knew linguistics, but the TA was really helpful in helping me catch up. Professor Paul was very passionate and knowledgeable about the material, and she really cared about all of her students. She learned everybody's name (and the class had about 50 people in it!) and made sure to include discussions in her lectures which really added to the class. Her only weaknesses were in some of the nitty gritty teaching stuff, like how assignments were presented, how much they were worth, when they were due, etc.The thing I'd be most careful about would be the time of the class. Don't underestimate how much it sucks to have a class that doesn't end until 5:30. This class was during prime nap time, and it was VERY difficult to pay attention and even stay awake sometimes.",
    "This class offers many perspectives, mostly psychological, on how humans acquire their first language (L1). For students who are interested in the theories of L1 acquisition or language development in the school-age years, this class offers a great primer on the subject. For students who have been fascinated with the idea of being able to transcribing child speech and perhaps evaluate their speech pathologies, this class offers a great introduction to such techniques.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who may think they are interested in linguistics. I had never taken a linguistics class before and I feel like I have a good general knowledge of the field. I found the class very interesting without a lot of work. Although the 4.15 to 5.30 time slot was no fun.",
    "I'd recommend it to people who are really interested in language. It's not very psych or cog sci heavy at all.",
    "This class is good. Grading is entirely transparents, and quite fair. The assignments can be a bit time consuming, but some were satisfying. Lectures themselves can be missed without too much consequence (slides are online), but I often found myself making a special effort to attend because I like Prof. Paul and her lectures were good. Shop it and see if you like her lecture style.",
    "It's an easy course. If you're interested in the material it will be worth it. If you're not, it will probably be worth the grade.",
    "A good descriptive overview of what happens as children learn language. You learn more about how things happen than why they happen that way. Definitely don't need any background in linguistics. How interesting lecture is really depends on the material for that day. The five assignments that make up your grade (20% each) are very doable, and there isn't any other work unless you want to read the textbook assignment every week.",
    "Great class if you're interested in language acquisition or developmental psych. There's a lot of info, but it's manageable and easy to grasp.",
    "I don't know why this is cross-listed as a linguistics course.This belongs in the psych department.The linguistic elements of this class were cursory looks into the domains of linguistics--coupled with arbitrary developmental stages assigned by \"child language\" researchers. Well, that may be a bit harsh. There is some great stuff going on in this kind of child language research, but for a more linguistics-oriented look at language acquisition, look elsewhere.For a nice look into the psych side of language (and research methods), this is a good course to take. I'd say for psych majors, it's optimal. For linguistics majors--and I'm not even one, but I am interested in linguistics--it's far from optimal. Do an independent study with somebody actually in the linguistics department.",
    "I highly recommend this course. There is no other course that clearly focuses on the subject of language acquisition.It was very enjoyable.",
    "This class was pretty good. The subject is interesting, and while the lectures aren't always thrilling, they're not bad. There are too many assignments though, all of which were graded on rubrics, which made the grading seem completely unrelated to the actual quality of your work. But if you're really interested in learning about language development I would probably recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to any student who is interested in linguistics, psychology, or childhood development in general. The course was engaging and interesting, and the intsructor and TF were accessible and helpful. The course is a normal amount of work with only five projects and reading for lectures. The book is a great resource with the lectures. This course is relevant and useful and requires a solid amount of work, but not too much to swamp you with material. It is just the right size because the professor is well prepared for lecture material but welcoming for questions and student interaction. All in all, it is a great class for anyone with those interests and provides just the right amount of work.",
    "Language Acquisition is a really interesting class. I would recommend it to anyone. The workload is light, and I definitely feel like I learned a lot about a subject in which I had very little background.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student if they were interested in language acquisition and ok with being graded on rubrics.",
    "Take it! Professor Paul is excellent: gives clear lectures, is always approachable, and is very knowledgeable about the topic. The topic is interesting, the work load isn't too heavy, and you can get by without reading the book. There was a great dynamic in the class that I think is really missing from many other courses, with people willingly engaging in discussion during class even though it's a lecture course."
