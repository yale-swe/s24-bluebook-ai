    "I learned that after watching videos and hearing people speak french it was much easier to learn the language. Previously I had been taught through books but hearing the words in context previous to the video helped me to learn the vocabulary and also the grammar.",
    "Beginner's French.",
    "I took this class to get an elementary understanding of France. I feel like I learned a lot, and I am excited for the next semester.",
    "I definitely learned a lot of French very fast. It's a tough, fast-paced course, but you will learn so much!",
    "All of French basics!",
    "French, decent amount of exposure to speaking, listening. Less writing and reading than expected.",
    "A basic understanding of the french language, its grammar and basic vocabulary. Ability to write, read, understand and speak a basic level of french.",
    "I started this course with very limited knowledge of French and I was amazed at how much I have learned from it. Compared to my previous French classes at other institutions, I learned very quickly in this one. The oral exams and skit project helped me to develop speech and conversational skills that I never would have gotten out of my previous French classes, which mainly focused on writing."

   "comments": [
    "I thought the videos were very helpful. Professor Ngame is an amazing professor. I think French can be somewhat hard to understand sometimes but this course made it very easy to understand.",
    "Heavy workload but worth it; you learn a lot! Material was kind of weird though; was developed in the 80's.",
    "This course moves very fast, but looking back, I am pleased with my language growth.",
    "Great intro language class. Rigorous and thorough. Wish we had studied and spent more time on pronunciation.",
    "You will learn French in this course, but you will also learn a lot. French is one of the more structured and demanding languages. It forces you to work a lot everyday, but because you have to put in so much work, you improve very fast. (The bad is that it is hard to take French with a difficult and full schedule, but the good is that it is worth it.)",
    "Class time was interesting and the videos were pretty effective. However, I felt like the workbook could be tedious and not very useful at times. The exercises from the course packet were much more valuable.",
    "Made a hard language easy to learn",
    "The cappretz method doesn't work for all students, myself included.",
    "This course was very well designed to help the students be able to actually speak and interact in French, rather than simply reading and writing and understanding grammatical rules. The weekly oral exams and listening exercises helped the students recognize speech patterns and improvise their own sentences, combined with the daily review sessions and in class work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it is definitely a good deal of work if you have not had any prior exposure to French. Having taken french before I found it pretty manageable.",
    "Yes! Hard but fun and you learn a lot.",
    "It's a lot of work, but the payoff is wonderful: you can speak a considerable amount of French, start watching French movies without subtitles, and enjoy listening to French music with some general idea of what's going on. Not bad!!",
    "If you want to learn French, you will learn French. However, I do caution that if you simply want language credit and do not care about the language then French is not the way to go at Yale.",
    "I do highly recommend this course, especially if you get Prof. Ngame! French is a fascinating language and you will really feel accomplished after you take it. Be forewarned that it is a tough class and it moves very fast, but I felt like the grading was fair.",
    "Yes!",
    "Very well organized course",
    "Yes, it is a very hard class but is also rewarding and you will learn a lot."
