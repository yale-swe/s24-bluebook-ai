   "comments": [
    "I thought this was going to be a good game theory class for me because it was international relations-heavy. However, I think it ended up being harder than the lecture class game theory. It was much more math than I expected.",
    "This isn't an easy class and although the material is interesting it should be a lecture not a seminar. I would not recommend this class to another student. It is not a terrible class and it really is quite interesting to apply game theory to war, but one should be prepared to be able to really do game theory",
    "Good class and good professor, but I'm not sure if I would recommend it to others.The class was done in a lecture-style and split into two sections: 2\/3 of the semester was devoted to learning basic game theory concepts up to Bayesian Nash equilibria, while 1\/3 was devoted to learning rationalist explanations of war and how game theory and international relations work related to war are related.I liked the class because I felt like I learned a lot, but I still felt unprepared for the exams (especially the final exam). Professor Debs was helpful and provided explanations of each problem set and final exams online, but I felt like the exams tested us on our ability to apply our basic game theory concepts on problems of a nature we had never seen before, and I felt really unprepared for that. His explanations seemed to rely on intuition, and though I could follow his reasoning in the practice final exam explanations, for example, I had no idea how I could reach that train of thought on my own and produce it myself. Take it if you have a comfortable background in economics and want to explore something new (game theory); don't take it if you don't already feel comfortable with economics.",
    "Only if you really want to learn game theory, and are willing to put in the time. Prof Debs does some amazing work in political science and IR theory using game theoretical frameworks, but if you're more keen to learn game theory in its traditional economic applications, this is not the best class. The psets are not too hard to handle, but the exams are killers.",
    "A difficult course in which you use game theory to study whether states will go to war. You learn about game theory for the first few weeks and then apply the concepts to political science and real-world events during the last few weeks.",
    "This class provides an interesting look at how game-theoretic concepts relate to the study of international relations and war. The class is pretty math\/concepts heavy (and the concepts for game theory can be pretty tricky) with less emphasis on discussing international affairs in the beginning of the course. The discussions in the second half were pretty interesting though.",
    "This course goes far further than the other game theory classes, but unfortunately that means you have to learn most of the material on your own. It is pretty challenging.",
    "Game Theory and IR is a really solid overview of game theory. Personally, I really enjoyed what I learned in class and Prof. Debs is great; he sincerely cares about the students and whether or not they understand, and he is very helpful esp. in office hours. He also does small things to try to make class funny. On the flip side: this class is NOT a less-math-oriented version of the lecture. I took this class thinking it would be a great way to be exposed to game theory and see how it applies to IR at the same time. However, the class involved a lot more math than expected, and not as much IR...However, I would give the class a chance. I made it through, and I think if you go into class knowing what you are getting, the class teaches you a lot and you feel accomplished at the end. Go to office hours, check every problem set with a group, you and you should do fine. Prof. Debs is a very understanding professor and he will work with you.",
    "Take this course if you want an applied understanding of game theory",
    "Part introduction to game theory, brief overview of a few theoretical models used to explain wars."
