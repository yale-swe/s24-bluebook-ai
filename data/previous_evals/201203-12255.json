    "This class is a wonderful survey study of fascinating colonial Latin American literature and the vivid written culture of the Americas. The class has two small tests, no midterm, a small essay (3 pages) and a large final summary essay (10 pages). Professor Adorno is very funny, interesting, and provides a focused approach to literature studies. She gives you study guides for the tests and is always available to discuss essays, ideas, and of course the literature. This is the ideal L5 Spanish course because it helps with reading, comprehension, writing, and speaking; an overall great experience. She is seriously the best and you L% Spanish people NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "Seriously guys- this is the best class at Yale. If you don't know any Spanish, I encourage you to start at L1 so you can take LAST 266. The texts we read were the perfect amount of work, not too much not too little. The course flowed very coherently. Profesora Adorno is an absolute scholar in her field. When it comes to colonial latin american literature, she is one of, if not, the most educated in the entire world (google her, she's won a million prizes, including something from Obama). She made this class incredible and she is the kindest woman in the world. If you ever get a chance to take a class with her, you absolutely must.",
    "If you need it in some sense, yes. I mean it's not a bad class, though the readings can get a little dense, and it is undeniably a period in literature most people our age aren't too interested in.",
    "Spanish 266 is a great course if you are interested in the course material. However, I was not and I did not feel as if the take-home message varied from reading to reading. It's all quite redundant and didn't really capture my attention. But like I said, if you are interested in the readings or the time period you'll like the course. But be warned, the professor does speak as if she's teaching an L2 class.",
    "LAST 266 mostly covers literature that deals with Latin America's colonial literature -- you read a lot of writings by conquistadors, and by spanish friars describing the new world for the first time. If that's what you're into, take this class. Profesora Adorno is incredibly knowledgeable about the literature, and it's sort of cool to read people like Hernan Cortez in the original language.Work-wise, its not that bad. There are (mostly) short readings, two easy tests, one short paper(3 pages), and one final longer paper (8-10 pages).Be warned -- it's more of a lecture than a seminar, so it's easy to let your mind wander, but she does grade class participation, so you can't completely zone out.",
    "Absolutely necessary to study later and modern Latin American texts.",
    "It's a straightforward foreign language course. All abilities welcome, though I was out of practice and always felt nervous speaking in the class. I took it to get an idea of the foundational texts of the New World and I would recommend it as a class for that purpose.",
    "I would recommend it to other students. The workload is not too bad, although the final essay is quite long, and Adorno is great. The material is very interesting and will quite probably be new to a lot of students",
    "Well taught class. You must be confident in your ability to read, write, and most importantly, to communicate in Spanish if you want to enjoy this class in any way. If you are a native speaker be warned that the speed of discussion may get annoying from time to time, only take this class i you are ok with that.",
    "This is a wonderful class that I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "Spanish 266 is an in-depth study of many of the major works of colonial Latin American literature. I would definitely recommend this class to another student, particularly if they are interested in reading and analyzing primary sources as a means of understanding history. Professor Adorno is extremely kind and understanding, and she made herself easily available even outside of her office hours. She always held extended office hours before our tests and essays. The course did not have too much work--we typically had a reading assigned for each class, which Professor Adorno then discussed during class. We read a good mix of native and European authors. The readings are not long, but can be a bit difficult because of vocabulary and awkward phrasing. Overall I really enjoyed the course, and I am glad that I had the opportunity to read and analyze important historical and literary documents."
