   "comments": [
    "Math 115 is a very useful class if you want to do anything in the Math, Science, Economics, Engineering or really any other quantitative field. It is a must for anyone interested in these fields.",
    "Necessary evil.",
    "Math 115 is not easy, but it is not impossible. I found the flipped classroom to be very useful because the class was more focused. The problem sets and midterms were sometimes difficult, but they are completely manageable.",
    "Math 115 is Calc 2. I would recommend this course to someone who needs Math 115 as a prerequisite for something, but I do not recommend this to someone solely looking for a QR credit.",
    "I would summarize Math 115 as demanding and challenging. Mostly, I would not recommend Math 115 to another student. This is because I really did not like the flipped classroom and thought it hindered my learning more than it helped it.",
    "Take it if you need math for your major, but take something else if it's not required. It's hard to learn it as a flipped classroom structure, so although it's doable, be ready to teach yourself everything.",
    "A required class for most STEM-related majors. The exams are generously curved, but sometimes the grading on midterms and problem sets can seem pretty unfair (for example, flipping the sign of the final answer of a problem that requires many steps to solve = 4\/10 points for the whole question). Problem sets can take a good amount of time, but there are lots of tutoring resources for help. Professor Rolf is the best at explaining the material out of all the Math 115 professors and you should do anything to get into his section(I've heard that some of the others are pretty bad).",
    "A class most people have to take and no one really enjoys. It is a ton of work. Hard tests and hard p-sets.",
    "Very standardized course but taught well by Professor Rolf. The flipped classroom is very helpful for studying the material and being able to come up with questions before class.",
    "I would recommend it but only if the student has taken MATH 112 or AP Calculus.",
    "Math 115 is a challenging class and the problem sets take a lot of time. You should dedicate a good amount of time studying for midterms\/final because the questions are more difficult than in class.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially if you can get Jim Rolf as your professor. Math will never be super exciting for me, but I did learn a lot from this course.",
    "If you need to take a math class, take this one! Dr. Rolf will not fail you, and the learning makes the work worth it.",
    "Take only if you need to",
    "Course is not too bad. But I only suggest you take it if you have to for a major. Otherwise-it's probably not worth the time.",
    "While a bit too much work to take for fun for most (unless you genuinely enjoy math), it's definitely a worthwhile and rewarding experience if you put in the work. A great way to learn Calculus II.",
    "The material itself may not be very easygoing, but the professors will walk you through. There is no need to fear.",
    "Math 115 is a great course to take either for QR credit or a review of high school calculus or intro into college math. The workload is constant but doable, and there are lots of resources available. I would recommend everyone who wants or needs to take math to start with this class.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course, although you do need to work hard; don't expect it to be a regular calculus course in high school.",
    "The class is excellent for reviewing Calculus II concepts, especially if you felt your experience in math in high school was far too cursory and lacked depth and analysis. I would recommend this class if you have a goo teacher. Mine was Prof. Rolf and he was wonderful. If you have a poor teacher as some of my friends did, then this class will not be a pleasurable one.",
    "A very solid calculus class. I would recommend it to anyone who needs it for their majors or to move on to Math 120.",
    "Take it! It may feel like a lot of work while your doing it, but in retrospect, I really appreciate this class and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in math.",
    "You learn Calc BC in Math 115. Don't be fooled though, if you took BC in high school, Math 115 can still be a challenge! There is a flipped classroom, so you watch short video lectures and then do practice problems at home, and you come into class with questions and then we do more problems there. I would recommend this class!",
    "Math 115 was a pretty demanding course."
