    "Absolutely-- The Tempest will not be offered again, of course, but take Toni's production seminar, whatever it may be. It will be worth your while. You will learn to understand language differently--etymologically, sonically. You will act comfortably outside your comfort zone. And Toni is a rare professor. She cares about you, she talks with you, she laughs with you--and you learn all the better for it.",
    "I would compare this course to being thrown in the deep end of a pool--but in a good way. If you're unfamiliar with Shakespeare, or any theatre for that matter, it is a great way to grow as an actor and gain essential skills that you can use in theatre, for giving speeches\/reciting poetry, or to cultivate a love of words. I would advise anyone who thinks they are serious about theatre to take the course. It's not easy (Don't let Prof. Dorfman's personality fool you) but it'll definitely be worth it."
