   "comments": [
    "Well, it's required if you're film studies, but if you're interested in the HISTORY of theory of media, it's a perfect class for you. If you're more into contemporary things, it'll be more frustrating, but section was a great place to get into things like...oh, the internet.",
    "Yes. The readings are very good and Professor Casetti is hilarious. Throw in a pretty light workload and you have a perfect 5th class.",
    "This is one of the few easy classes I've taken at Yale that still manages to be incredibly interesting; you don't have to do the readings, but you'll enjoy them (though some are quite dense and abstract). There aren't really any other classes offered here yet that cover anything remotely similar to this material (which is strange and upsetting, as a side note), so this one is definitely worth taking if you're interested in media.",
    "Yes! SO SURPRISINGLY INTERESTING. The class sounds like it's going to be awful, but Theory of Media is actually really interesting and cool and makes you think about things (technology) in a completely new way. Loved it.",
    "Hmmm...this is tricky. See, I would totally recommend 'cause the workload is not very heavy and the class is, like, the opposite of intesnse...but I don't think you'll get much out of it unless you're a Film Studies major or really interested in abstract applications of media concepts. I mean, all the stuff is applicable to daily life--in any given section, we talked about Facebook&Twitter, CNN, Lost\/House, Pee-Wee Herman and his public shenanigans, etc. It gives you a new appreciation\/understanding for the information we are bombarded with through the media on a daily basis...but it's not easy stuff, and not always the most engaging material. Two short papers (5-7 pages), and at-home final, and weekly reading responses meant that there really wasn't an overload of work--but be prepared to put some work in to understand it. I really enjoyed it though!",
    "A fine overview of the development of media theory ideas over the course of the 20th century. The readings are very short and superficial, and the assignments are limiting in their required brevity. I probably wouldn't recommend this course to another. Just print out the syllabus.",
    "The class is a good overview of media theory and definitely makes you consider your use of media as well as how mass media is affecting our society. It's unfortunate Yale doesn't offer a media studies program, but this is a good class to start learning about the historic media theorists. There was not too much reading on new media since I guess it's a relatively new field, but the professors were both great and very knowledgeable about media and film.",
    "Theory of Media... really the name says all. Read theorists points and then discuss them.",
    "I would recommend Theory of Media to a fellow student. The course wasn't too work heavy and provided a strong basis for media concepts.",
    "Definitely worth taking if you're interested in media. Casetti can sometimes be hard to follow but generally is very knowledgeable and has a sense of humor that makes even somewhat complicated theory pretty easy to swallow (MacKay doesn't teach as often, but is good too, if a little 'theoretical' sometimes). The course fulfills a requirement for film, so take it if you need that! Also not too much work - short midterm and final essays (sort of take-home tests; short essays w\/ prompts given); readings can be dense but you probably won't be able to get through them all anyway, and that's okay. Expect to have a lot of questions and areas you're interested in exploring further after the course is over; it's a broad intro to a pretty new and expanding field.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in media now who wants to know the history of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the role of media today... Casetti is a great (and famous!) prof, and the readings are really good if you're into thinking about media and communication.",
    "Do not take this class unless you have to.It is a complete waste of time. Bad teaching, bad lectures.. you learn nothing.",
    "This class will be different than any other class you ever take. Take a risk and go for it. If you do the readings, it shouldn't be at all difficult.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they were already interested in the subject matter. It is an excellent course to explore the ways in which media affects social and personal life, and society as a whole."
