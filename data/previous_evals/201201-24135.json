    "Very fun class. Gruber is fantastic. Be ready to put in the hours outside of class for group projects. Take it as your Research Methods requirement if you are a Psychology major.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend.",
    "TAKE IT!! This is the best way to learn about how psychology research is actually conducted. The focus on a particular aspect of psychology, happiness, provided a more directed topic of study and the research project is such a rewarding undertaking. Though it seems difficult to form a research project, paper, and poster, Professor Gruber and Sunny's enthusiasm and expertise will definitely help. I'm very glad to have taken it this semester and feel more confident about the psychology major and my ability to pursue my own project for the senior requirement.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! It is a great research methods course that, though challenging, is extremely informative and highly enjoyable. Since it is a small class you really get to know your classmates and there is a lot of discussion during lecture time. The workload is greater than other psychology classes but probably similar to other research methods classes. Requirements include reading responses, weekly lab assignments, a final 20 page paper (you write drafts of each section) and a poster + presentation of your research project. Definitely take this class if you are thinking of writing a senior thesis - it will prepare you really well! Professor Gruber is extremely knowledgeable and a fantastic lecturer and very approachable if you need help. All in all one of the best psychology classes offered at Yale!",
    "If you have to take research methods, take this one. It's interesting, you get to talk about happiness, and only once a week. You work on your final project all semester which is a pain but very helpful in the end. The professor is hard to read sometimes but overall approachable.",
    "This sounds like a good class, but it really isn't great in terms of teaching research methods. If you don't care about research methods but just need it for your major, then take this class. It is easy, kind of annoying (the material is very repetitive and the grading is really random), but overall just manageable.",
    "Good class and you get to do some really cool tests. Great way to fulfill your research requirement for psych majors",
    "I would recommend Psych 231. The class was a fun way to fulfill a research methods course for psychology. The class discussions about happiness were very interesting and probably my favorite part of the class. The class also gives you a lot of experience working on a research project and writing a research paper which I found very valuable. Just be warned that Professor Gruber is particular about the final research papers, so put a significant amount of effort into perfecting it.",
    "Don't be fooled by the peppy title--Research Methods in Happiness is a legitimate methods course involving lot of hard work. This class isn't bad, but only take it if you must do a research methods course. You will spend many hours meeting with your group members trying to figure out what the professor is looking for when grading your project, since her sample papers contradict what she says to do. On the bright side, Prof. Gruber is friendly, approachable, energetic, and seems to care about what her students are doing outside of the classroom. She broke the final project down into manageable parts so that we didn't have 25 pages to write at the end of the semester. Though it was a lot of hard, detail-oriented work, all of the group projects came out looking excellent.",
    "I definitely would not recommend this course for the following reasons:1) The paper that you spend all semester writing feels like a \"pretend\" paper because you write it about a study that you have no role in designing or carrying out. You have to make up a rationale\/lit review after the study has been carried out, and the same goes for all other sections (hypotheses, methods, conclusions, etc). Basically, the paper is an exercise in APA format writing - I didn't learn much from it. As an attempt to get students \"involved\" in the research, Prof. Gruber had us shadow experimenters as they ran participants, which meant sitting in a dark room doing schoolwork for 90 minutes at a time while the participant worked on a nearby computer. I found shadowing boring and learned absolutely nothing from it. Which leads me to my next criticism of this class...2) In mid-February, Prof. Gruber informed us that we should start spending an additional 4-5 hrs in the lab each week, in addition to class time and our usual 1 hour of weekly lab time. I did not have that kind of spare time during the semester (especially during the hours of 9 am - 5 pm, which was when most of it had to be done), because I had built my schedule based on the course commitments professors had laid out during shopping period. This lab commitment was never mentioned in January, in class or on the syllabus. I called out of work shifts at my job to try to fulfill this surprise requirement and was still unable to fulfill it. It also depends heavily on participants signing up for time slots that overlap with the student's free time. I had a conversation with Prof. Gruber about how this might be a problem before spring break. When I talked to her about it again when it became apparent that I wouldn't be able to fulfill all the hours before the deadline, she acted as though it were my fault that this was a problem, as though I had never mentioned it until then, and she penalized me by adding on more hours to my requirement. I do not think she handled the situation well at all.3) I spent a lot of time on my section of our group's conference poster in order to convey the substance of our experimental procedure in a concise and clear manner. When Prof. Gruber gave us feedback, she erased most of my work and put in pictures instead. all of my group members thought this made the poster less clear and less professional-looking, but we had to use her pictures anyway. It was insulting to see my work not just edited but actually erased.4) I got the general impression that Prof. Gruber thought her class was more important than students' other commitments (including other classes). Most professors assign work that takes time to complete, but they let students do it on their own schedule, by a certain deadline. For this class, work often had to be done in a specific time slot (like when the lab was open \/ when participants had signed up for the study) or on a specific non-class day (like an all-day Palm Pilot study, in which we were graded on how many times we responded to beeps, regardless of whether we had class or work that couldn't be interrupted)."
