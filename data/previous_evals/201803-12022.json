    "I learned elementary Indonesian as well as more about Indonesian culture and foods.",
    "A basic knowledge of the Indonesian language.",

    "Strengths: There are many different teachers to work with, meaning that you will hear different accents and truly come to understand spoken Indonesian. The class is fun and this has made the class a better learning experience. I am always excited to go to Indonesian class and see the teachers.",
    "Sometimes sentence structure is confusing, but I understand the vocabulary!",
    "More clear instructions",
    "It was always a fun and engaging class that managed to also cover a lot of material.",
    "Learnt grammar, vocabulary in a well-structured manner. Perhaps use of online tools such as Canvas can be enhanced.",
    "One of the weaknesses of this course was not enough vocab tests. Although it is a weird thing for a student to be requesting more tests, but I thought it would be useful to make sure we are keeping up with the knowledge that is expected out of us.",
    "The course was organized well and it was fun to engage in."
