   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to another student, especially someone who wants to solidify their grammar before taking more advanced, conversation classes. I think it's definitely worth it despite the heavy workload.",
    "Span 243 offers a chance to learn very subtle yet important rules in Spanish grammar (most of which have never been taught in high school or college introductory Spanish courses). Although the workload is larger than most classes, it is very fulfilling to practice and perfect these grammatical guidelines. In addition, if a student ever considers studying abroad, this class offers important rules on how to speak correctly and consistently in a Spanish-speaking country. I would definitely recommend this course to another student due to its usefulness and excellent professor.",
    "Ok, so there's a lot of work. That's my disclaimer. However, I think this is hands down the most useful Spanish class I've ever taken. If you want an in-between for L4 and the lit classes, this is your class, and frankly I think anyone who wants to learn Spanish should take it. Trust me, there are plenty of nuances that you never learn that are taught in this class. Take is with Sonia! She allows for a decent amount of speaking in class and tries to encourage discussion. She's also a wonderful person.",
    "SPAN 243 is worthwhile for those looking to keep brushing up their Spanish skills from L4. It was a lot of repetitive grammar work, which wasn't thrilling, but it was good practice and an effective learning strategy. Take the class with Sonia Valle!",
    "I would say this is the perfect L5 Spanish course to start out with because it will prepare students for the writing in other classes by refining grammar skills.",
    "This class is great for reviewing, learning, and solidifying language skills. My class was very small which led to a lot of speaking time and getting along really well with other students and the professor. You do a lot of different kinds of work, and there's a lot overall, but once you get the hang of it and figure out how to balance it with your other classes, it becomes very manageable. Grading is really fair, and I could definitely see my own progress. I always felt like I could talk to the professor about any concerns, Spanish or otherwise. The language partners part was more challenging for me, and it ended up being a bit of a crapshoot based on who your assigned partner was: I was lucky and met a really cool guy and so the video chats were really rewarding for me.",
    "There is a good amount of homework and effort that is required for this class, but it will definitely expose you to upper level grammar which is valuable for other college level Spanish classes, especially those that involve writing literary essays."
