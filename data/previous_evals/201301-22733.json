   "comments": [
    "I would recommend for a relatively easy science credit. The notes are very clear and informative, and the tests are relatively easy to prepare for. You can get an A simply by attending every section, as there are participation grades in the form of pop quizzes (which you get points for by making an \"honest effort\".) Professor Bradley is helpful and makes the lectures engaging.",
    "ANTh 212 is a course on primate genetics and how it affects primate behavior. I would recommend it to another student if they're interested in primates. Definitely a great course.",
    "This class is about using molecular methods to learn about primates, like their behavior and family structure, among other things. In the beginning there is quite a bit of introductory material, but once you get into the case studies and especially late in the semester with looking at genes that influence certain behaviors or phenotypic traits, it is quite interesting to learn about. The class is mostly learning from a power point presentation, but Professor Bradley has a great sense of humor and makes learning a lot of material relatively painless. Workload is not too bad, and the midterm and final were pretty fair as long as you paid attention in class and studied a bit. I would recommend it as a good introductory anthropology class. If you're like me, a good a way as any to get your SC credit.",
    "This was a very good class overall. It is a good science credit if you aren't really a science person. The time in class is split between lectures and discussions, both of which were really productive and beneficial for learning the material. Professor Bradley is great and willing to help you out if you are struggling. Take this class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in genetics, primates, or evolutionary biology. Otherwise, one would find it boring. There are periodic quizzes, but you get full credit if you simply try to answer every question. The tetsare not bad as long as you study a lot and know every lecture well. We also had a 10-page paper that wasn't too bad. I think this is a great \"not hard\" science course for anyone interested.",
    "Take it if you're interested in the material and willing\/able to memorize a lot of information. The details in this class are important, so if you can memorize, you'll be fine.",
    "Good intro class. Tests were much harder than I expected. Definitely need to spend a decent amount of time studying and preparing for class",
    "I really enjoyed the course, thought it was well organized and taught, and a reasonable amount of work. Course information was interesting, and I would definitely recommend, even without a background in anthro or science.",
    "Monkey stuff for people who like monkeys, but also a lot of good intro to molecular ecology in general.",
    "Yes! Great class. I thoroughly enjoyed this class.",
    "Fascinating class! If you're interested in the subject, it's a must. Professor Bradley is phenomenally organized and enthusiastic about the course. Heads up, if you're not interested in the subject matter, it will be a lot to learn for the midterm\/final. But if you are, it is super interesting and well-taught.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Take it!",
    "If you are interested in Biological Anthropology then take this course! It is extremely interesting and highly informative.",
    "id recommend if you have any interest in the subject!",
    "Yes, if you're invested in the class. I had too much stuff going on and didn't really have time for it.Stay engaged and it's a great class.",
    "Really interesting material, would not recommend for non-science major."
