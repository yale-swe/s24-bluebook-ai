Maybe setting a tone early that \"we will be gathering at these discussion sections to go over any questions you may have from class, but also to debate and hopefully bring in current or real-world examples...\"",

    "More coordination between reading, problem sets, and lecture. They certainly corresponded very broadly, but they did not always serve to make each other more comprehensible and thus during exam time students seemed to be learning material solely to answer exam questions. I felt as if I was highly engaged during lecture, but that did not assist me to a great extent on the examinations.",
    "reading material",
    "Coverage of economics of climate change could be improved; subject treated in broad generalizations which failed to impart skills for student assessment of the issues. Breakout session for graduate students would facilitate deeper engagement of the material, more gratifying learning process, perhaps providing greater opportunity for applied analysis. Explanatory language of the homework assignments was often erroneous and\/or unnecessarily confusing, which led to many hours of wasted effort over the course of the semester."
