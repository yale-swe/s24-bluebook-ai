   "comments": [
    "You really need to attend lectures and pay close attention. Sometimes, what he asks on exams will not come from the textbook. You also really need to review undergraduate quantum mechanics in some details as you move along in the course. Do not try to predict what is on his exams....you will not be able to. They are much more difficult than the homework he assigns.",
    "review of undergrad QM but developing concepts in a more general formalism. Handful of new topics like general theory of rotations\/angular momentum (and symmetry in general), Feynman's path integral approach.",
    "The course gives students with prior experience with Griffiths familiarity with Dirac notation, and derives the assumptions of wave mechanics from symmetry considerations. Well worth taking for anybody interested in the material.",
    "As is, I'm not sure I would recommend the course since I didn't like the fact that it was taught directly out of the textbook.",
    "Standard Quantum Mechanics course; math foundations, spin systems, angular momentum, etc.",
    "You've got to take it!",
    "Physics 508 is an excellent introduction to advanced topics in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. Take this class if you would like to learn about applications of algebraic methods in physics and if you would like to build a deeper understanding of the underlying formalism.",
    "Great course, but needs some thinking on the student's part on how to best prepare for the difficult exams.",
    "What you would expect from one semester of quantum mechanics.",
    "This is a great intro to advanced Quantum Mechanics; while not an easy course, it is very helpful in establishing comfort with the fundamental tools and language of Quantum Mechanics. I would certainly recommend this course.",
    "This course helped my understanding of linear algebra immensely. I would recommend it if only for that reason, because it had a sort of unifying effect on different areas of my physics knowledge. It was also pretty cool to see classical mechanics principles applied to the very small.",
    "We cover the basics of quantum mechanics and the angular momentum formalism. The content in chapter three was new, or at least in a new perspective, to me. I think this is all important to know, and would recommend it to anyone seriously interested in physics.",
    "It's very useful for both theorists and experimentalist. Would definitely recommend it to other students."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Extremely important and definitely deepened my understanding. However, i think it was all very intimidating.",
    "Quantum mechanics is the basis for pretty much all modern physics, and this class helped familiarize me with the formalism most commonly used at the graduate level.",
    "Quantum Mechanics is for sure incredibly useful. It is fundamental whichever type of physics you do.",
    "This semester I had a very algebra-heavy schedule, and it was very interesting to see applications of algebraic methods in different contexts in physics. Taking this class was useful for me because it presented the basic formalism of quantum mechanics in a way that makes it easier to generalize to the quantum field theory picture. I eventually would like to do research in particle physics, so I believe that what I learned in PHYS 508 will help me in the future.",
    "I have had graduate level QM courses before, but this course hands-down the best. In that sense it helped clear out some difficult points that I had previously poorly understood, in particular, the links between angular momentum and group theory.",
    "Review and revisiting of material",
    "The aspects of the course I expected to be relevant to my discipline were conveniently skipped in this course, but I expect them to be covered in the second half.",
    "I'm sure that understanding the basics of quantum mechanics will be absolutely essential in research."
