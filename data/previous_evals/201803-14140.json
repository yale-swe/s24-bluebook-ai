   "comments": [
    "The course is overall very good. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "Im very pleased with the class.",
    "Strengths: Talks about linguistics and characteristics of the language, which is unusual for language classes but very much appreciated; professor readily answers questions, even if they aren't explicitly related to the lesson of the day; class encourages speaking a lot; grading is lax, so I could focus more on learning than on just trying to get a good grade; some writing assignments were a bit long but fair, and very good for practice Weaknesses: Some students don't take the class very seriously, leading to us having to spend some classes in the middle of the semester reviewing extremely basic concepts rather than doing the more advanced work we were supposed to; emphasizing that students need to take material more seriously, say by giving more assessments, may help. Class doesn't emphasize the correct usage of tones and dots when writing; I know that this can be difficult to do, but it seems like an integral part of the language, and it may be good to encourage tone usage in the future. Never got the language table together. Assignments need more specific titles so that students can know what has and has not been turned in.",
    "Sometimes we moved too fast",
    "Weaknesses is that theres a lot of work like an insane amount. Strengths is that you really learn a lot of the language in a short period of time.",
    "Strength: He explains the material well and is patient with us. Cons: grades could be systemed better.",
    "The teacher and TAs were very helpful. the class could use more time to grasp each concept"

    "I would. the course is well organized and well taught.",
    "Yes, its a very good way to learn Yoruba.",
    "Yes, especially if you're Yoruba! I'm Yoruba and have been wanting to learn the language for a while, and this course has given me the tools to speak with my family more and to engage with my culture in ways that go beyond just language. The professor is great and the class is chill but facilitating of learning. Some students take it more seriously than others, but if you put in the work you'll really benefit, and you'll definitely find other people who are willing to put in a lot of effort, too.",
    "Yes, a lot of work but relatively easy language class",
    "Only if you really want to learn the language specifically not if you wanna pick up a random one.",
    "Yes, i think it is a good course if your interested in the language",
    "yes, it is a very thought provoking class"
