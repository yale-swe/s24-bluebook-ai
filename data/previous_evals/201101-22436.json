    "great course, hands on and fun.",
    "Better take this one if you can get in.",
    "Great class to take senior year - really improves your speaking skills and made me pay attention to the nuances of speech giving and writing.",
    "give speeches. talk about speeches.",
    "This is a great class. Take it if you get in - you won't regret it. It's fun, the material is interesting, and the professor is great. The workload is also very manageable.",
    "It's a fun class, but we never really discussed the content of the speeches. The format of the class was that each day, someone gave a brief \"introduction\" to the speeches we were supposed to read and then the class critiqued their style of presentation. Rarely did we discuss the speech itself, and as a result a lot of people didn't do the reading. Then at other points you give famous speeches of history and that's fun.anyway, whatever, it's pretty good just do it if you want to hang out with charles hill",
    "Take it if you can get in.",
    "Take it. Great for life and future careers.",
    "take it if u can",
    "Definitely take it. A great group of seniors and it will improve your public speaking skills.",
    "This class was a useful in that I gained a good background in public speaking styles, strategies and skills. Charles Hill cares about teaching undergrads, and it shows. I would take this again. however, I would not take this class solely on the basis of the aura that surrounds everything related to Charles Hill. He is a caring teacher and the course is interesting and uniquely engaging, but no person can live up to such hype.",
    "A class on speech GIVING, not speeches.",
    "It is a class with a very light work load. It is the type of class that you take if you want a fairly easy, straightforward class, that is more fun than stressful. However, that also means you won't learn as much either.",
    "You learn a lot, about Oratory, and about how to navigate things that are potentially pretentious.",
    "Really great course. I recommend everyone take it.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Most fascinating class at Yale, and you get exposure to some of the most amazing people. A must take before you graduate!",
    "I really enjoyed taking this class, particularly during my last term at Yale. Every week, several students give speeches and every aspect of them is critiques by fellow students and by Hill. I loved having this public speaking practicum that covered everything from tone, tics, pacing, and clothing.That's the good part, here's the caveat. There's very little feedback on content or speechwriting. You won't be polishing drafts and the feedback on specific choices of phrasing is well nigh nonexistent. The readings are almost never discussed during class.I really like taking it as a delivery workshop, but don't bite if you want speechwriting help."
