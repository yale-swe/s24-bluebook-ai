   "comments": [
    "I learned how to critically identify the silences and erasures present within an academic discipline and what they reveal about larger structures of power.",
    "This course offers something of an alternative canon for tracing the geneology of anthropology through black and subaltern scholarship. Professor Jobson drew out the relationship between \"critical\" scholarship and the \"crisis\" of blackness in America. The course was really centered on the discipline of anthropology and its capacity for anti colonial politics.",
    "This course should be a requirement for all anthropology majors. Part of what I value about anthropology as a discipline is its ability to self-evaluate. This course highlights this in a way that to some extent subverts the field. And I'm not sure that this is a bad thing at all. But I feel far more equipped now to be able to approach anthropology with a clearer sense of purpose regarding my relationship to the discipline, but also to critically assess scholarship and attitudes that while prevailing, perpetuate erasure and injustice.",
    "I learned how to approach anthropology for the first time through an African American Studies lense.",
    "As a first-time anthropology course, I learned about the anthropological approach to research and ethnography and developed an appreciation for the anthropologists desire to contextualize all findings to avoid suggesting the universality of truths. We also briefly discussed the colonial history of the field, the ways in which Black anthropologists have struggled to decolonize anthropology, and the ways in which race has been discussed across the discipline.",
    "It was great to be introduced to anthropology through the lens of Black scholars who are working to decolonize the field. I so valued the perspectives that we studied and the voices that were elevated through the syllabus. I feel that the axioms of decolonized anthropology can easily be applied throughout academia, and I intend to take them with me wherever I go: a new lens with which to view scholarship."

   "comments": [
    "Phenomenal reading list, wonderful discussions, and a professor who clearly put so much effort into making this a productive, valuable, and welcoming experience for all!",
    "I liked that this course was accessible to non-anthropology students yet still provided a new complement to students who had taken the main offerings of the major (anthro theory, field methods, etc). It is also one of the most explicitly politicized courses I have ever been in during my time at Yale, which I really appreciated. The course made space for students to respond personally while still centering and addressing the assigned texts.",
    "I think that it's overall a strong course that encourages engagement in the texts and with other students. My only criticism is that the workload in the course (specifically writing) was very heavy at the end of the course. Requiring completion of some earlier in the semester might alleviate some of this.",
    "Strengths were that it was very independent work. The syllabus and readings were awesome and the conversations and class were also very interesting.",
    "The class had a well-organized syllabus that was thematically well clustered. The two written assignments and the flexibility involved in choosing their topics (book review and final essay) was also pretty helpful in allowing us to better understand the themes of the course. Having the flexibility to write a book review of an ethnography of choice allowed me to more closely engage and critique with the text. Also having an opportunity to write about a topic of interest for the final paper made the essay very rewarding to write. However, group presentations were often not particularly helpful for discussion (and seemed to be created purely as a way to assess students). Being assigned a reading response instead of the group presentation would probably have been a preferable alternative. The readings, though interesting, also did not seem to articulate clear controversies or areas of debate within the discipline. It could be helpful to include two opposing anthropological viewpoints for each week and then have class discussion be centered around the debate addressed.",
    "I really enjoyed the readings we were assigned for this class, and I feel that the assignments were appropriate. If any complaint, it would be that I often wished class discussions were more structured. Many weeks, the discussion was dominated by only a few people, and it spiraled into unanswerable questions about the nature of truth and the purpose of social science - questions that are certainly important but that are not an efficient use of seminar time. I would have enjoyed if the discussions were more grounded in the great texts we read, and more balanced across the class to allow more timid voices to be heard.",
    "I came to this course without any experience in anthropology, and so some of my issues with the course may stem from that. However, as I was writing my final paper, I realized I wasn't ever sure what we meant by our central question how do we decolonize anthropology? I think to make this a stronger course that question would need to be more explicitly defined, or perhaps closed to non-majors if a base knowledge of more traditionally colonial anthropology is expected."

   "comments": [
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to another student, particularly if Ryan is teaching it! It really enabled me to think more deeply about issues surrounding knowledge production- something that I wish all Yale college students would be required to engage with it.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone engaged in the social sciences. I think it provides history and context that are both crucial and often omitted. The class was a really important space for considering questions that feel relevant and engaged to me as both an anthropology student and a member of society \/ human being.",
    "YES!!!!",
    "As previously mentioned, this course or something of very similar content should be required for anthropology students. I think that for those not directly interested in the field of anthropology, it is an effective way to think about racecraft and black identity, and I would highly recommend it.",
    "YES!",
    "I'm not sure I would recommend this course to students that are interested in generally learning about the ways that blackness is discussed in anthropology, because many of our discussions were more focused around how anthropologists approach methodological challenges in their research than on the conclusions they reach. This course might be more rewarding to students who have taken prior courses in anthropology (rather than those who are interested in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of discourse around race). The quality of the course was probably also influenced by the quality of class discussion, which often became entangled in vague, general questions likely because many of the readings did not appear to make particularly novel or controversial claims.",
    "A good course with really great content. Prof. Jobson is flexible and has some really great and important ideas about not just anthropology, but academia in general. Take it for a strong intro to the foundations of decolonized ideologies and an overview of the history of Black anthropologists. At times, class discussions got somewhat unwieldy and unmanageably profound, but overall, this course was interesting and insightful."
