    "This is a good intro course for people who've at least had some music experience. I can't really picture what it would be like if I didn't have background in music. It's definitely worth taking if you want to know more about theory. Sometimes it would get a little dry if Kevin tried to stretch the material out for a longer amount of time than we should have covered it. It's a lot of listening activities, both to songs as well as ear training (wasn't expecting that). Kevin was seriously awesome though. He taught barefoot, was extremely lenient with assignments, but yet knew so much about music and taught us all a lot throughout the semester.",
    "Awesome class! Definitely of my favorites at Yale. I always looked forward to doing the homework, and it was a nice change of pace from other classes. Most people in the class had some sort of musical background, but it's really not necessary as you start with the basics.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn basic music theory thoroughly."
