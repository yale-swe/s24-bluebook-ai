   "comments": [
    "Knowledge on architecture, spatial awareness\/perceptions, appreciation for aspects or architecture such as the role of light, form, proportions, etc.",
    "I learned about the architects who built cool buildings on campus. I learned how to describe and draw architecture in a more clear and accurate way.",
    "I gained drawing skills, spacial awareness, and a deeper appreciation for architecture in general as well as New Haven urban design.",
    "I learned the basics of architecture and it made me appreciate my surroundings much more since we have such beautiful architecture at yale. with no previous art or design background, i thought i learned how to sketch and create models well. learning was facilitated well through the course: the lectures and sections really complemented each other well to maximize knowledge intake. professor purves is so kind and caring about his material and it shows a lot in lecture because the material is fascinating and so is his analysis of buildings\/structures. you learn about light, load, material, etc.",
    "The biggest thing I got out of this course was a reminder that Yale's campus is full of beautiful architecture! I loved the lectures that also talked about particular elements such as shape and structure.",
    "A basic overview of architecture history and theory.",
    "Architectural theory and observation skills in lecture, drawing during section and assignments.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of buildings around me and also improved my drawing skills.",
    "This course improved my drawing skills and allowed me to look at architecture in new ways. It also was my first time making an architectural models or anything like that and was a lovely introduction.",
    "Learned a lot about architecture, the lectures were good when I went to class.",
    "I learned how to view and analyze my built environment more carefully. Ive learned about different architectural elements like form, material, space, and light. I also learned how to create architectural drawings, concepts and models.",
    "Broad knowledge of architecture and drawing skills",
    "Fundamentals of architecture (elements, theories, urbanism....), drawing techniques, model-making experience",
    "I learned a lot about architecture in general and gained a lot of knowledge in many aspects.",
    "I learned about design, sketching, what ppl are thinking about when they create a building or a city.",
    "I learned a ton about specific architectural theory, form, and function but more than anything came to appreciate all of the architecture around us from the aesthetics of a lamp shade to a building. Whereas before I could say very little more than whether a building was nice or not I feel as though I can speak about the building for hours at length.",
    "Everyday walking to and fro places, I started to actually look at the buildings around me. It's a completely different taste of life - 100% recommend if you value new perspectives.",
    "Ill start by saying I loved this course. I learned TONS about the entire process of perceiving, experiencing, contemplating and designing the built environment. Im considering a career in architecture and thought this course (Professor Purves and the TFs especially) were an incredible in depth introduction to the field.",
    "I learned about architecture and architectural theory as well as improved my drawing skills.",
    "I grew my fundamental understanding of architecture, and improved my drawing skills. It was also my first model making experience, which was extremely rewarding.",
    "I learned how to see in a new light... it gives you the flexibility to grow on your own as a designer or aspiring architect",
    "I learned how to view buildings through different lenses with regard to how they function in terms of form, organization, and public spaces. I also learned a lot about architectural conventions.",
    "I learned a lot of different works of architecture around the world and how it shapes our thinking and behavior, as well as how it represents society and culture. I also got more practice in drawing, particularly in architectural conventions.",
    "Gained a lot of insight into the foundations of Architecture. My new architectural eye has totally changed the way I see the world. I also gained abilities in architectural applied skills, like drawing, modeling and analytical writing.",
    "The most important thing that I learned from this course is how to engage with the everyday architecture around us. Prof. Purves is an expert about all types of \"architecture\" (both Architecture and architecture - if you subscribe to that distinction) and the coolest part of the course was learning how to analyze the architecture in New Haven and on Yale's campus.",
    "sketching, overview of the study of architecture",
    "I learned how to accept criticism better and learn to productively talk about other peoples work.",
    "This class is a pretty basic introduction to architectural concepts and history. For anyone who has taken classes in the subject, you don't necessarily learn anything new, but the assignments present great opportunities to mix your own design ideas with the ones we learn about in class.",
    "Design thinking, sketching, creativity",
    "I developed a better understanding of the basic aspects of architecture.",
    "This course teaches you how to think about the built environment around you. Lectures are inspiring and fun, its a great and interesting class both for majors and non-majors.",
    "Through this course I gained a basic vocabulary for speaking about architecture. I also learned how to employ the basic techniques of representation (plan, section, elevation, perspective, axial, etc.) that are commonly used in architectural depictions. I developed a keener eye for detail, and through the sketchbook assignments I learned how to experiment with different approaches to drawing.",
    "I learned how architecture can be viewed and thought of in so many different ways, and the sketchbook assignments pushed me to be more creative.",
    "I learned quite a bit about architecture in New Haven and around the world. I also learned to draw more effectively.",
    "Practiced some sketching skills, learned about some buildings and architectural techniques.",
    "Got a basic understanding of the field of architecture and learned to look at buildings more critically. I also improved my drawing skills.",
    "I learned a lot about architecture from many different perspectives, theoretical and practical and also artistic. I become a better drawer and also a more architecturally conscious human being."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: The sketchbook and final assignment were all very interesting and enjoyable, and applicable even to students without a background in art\/drawing. Weaknesses: No grades were given out throughout the entire semester, even though we had weekly sketches, a paper, and the final assignment. This was a source or stress for many students throughout the semester, as no one knows how well\/poorly they are doing, and have no idea what their final grade will be before it is posted.",
    "Sketchbook assignments were very helpful in understanding the course material more clearly. Professor Purves and the TFs were very supportive and thoughtful.",
    "strengths: great professor and great TFs. the people taking the class are also kind people as i have never met a snakey person in architecture classes. the material is interesting and makes you appreciate the structures around us more. challenges you to think in a different way from other classes and you can really see that you have learned a new skills et and knowledge at the end of the course. weaknesses: maybe a little bit more of guidance\/help for sketch assignments could be provided for students who do not have any art\/design background because sometimes it could be intimidating to go to section and show your work when other students come with masterpieces. also 9:25 is kind of early.",
    "The first half of the class was great! I really loved the weekly drawing assignments that pushed me to become more aware of Yale's own architecture because sometimes we tend to forget how beautiful this campus actually is. And through these assignments, I also learned I can draw rather well! The midterm and final projects were also a lot of fun to do. Aside from the final lampshade project however, the second half of the course was honestly pretty dry. There were a couple guest lecturers that came in but the material was not too engaging and the weekly drawings also stopped. I wish the second half of the course continued like the first...",
    "I loved the assignments! Discussion sections, were we would discuss the assignments, were instructive and interesting.",
    "As someone with little background in drawing, it was tough for me to improve the TFs were helpful when I sought out individual counsel, but there isn't drawing instruction during lectures even though all of the assignments are drawing-based. It was tough for me to gauge my status in the class and get advice other than to spend more time on the assignments.",
    "The main strength was my TAs! Emily and Christine were amazing! Very friendly and understanding while also pushing people to improve and giving good advice. The assignments were mostly pretty good. Professor Purves was also good and gave very insightful lectures, although by the end of the semester I began to lose interest as it can be a bit hard to stay focused early in the morning when Professor Purves is talking very quietly. The guest lecturers were of varying quality.",
    "Strengths: Great lectures from Purves. Workload is just right and you really just get out what you put in. Section is chill and fun, you just sit around talking about each others' drawing\/projects. Weaknesses: Guest lectures were pretty boring. Readings were okay. No grades until end of course, which makes it hard to tell how you are doing in the class. (However there is a midterm review of sketchbooks by the TAs, which helps).",
    "I enjoyed the assignments, especially making the model. I would have enjoyed making more models rather than doing drawing most weeks.",
    "Strengths are a fantastic TA team, engaging professor with fantastic lectures, great assignments to flesh out in-class concepts and interesting readings. Weaknesses may be a few of the guest lectures, which seemed a bit hard to understand or somewhat detached from the rest of the course.",
    "Awesome course all around",
    "na",
    "The lectures could be a bit bland. But section, the drawing assignments, and particularly the final project were engaging.",
    "This course provides a great introduction to the concepts of design. Through weekly drawing and design assignments, you learn how to brainstorm ideas and make them come to life through plans, various types of drawings, and even 3D models. The lectures and assignments are very engaging.",
    "This class required little hard work but did need a significant amount of time each week in order to make the drawing of the week. The lectures were very interesting and Alex is amazing.",
    "Maybe it's because it's an intro class, but a lot of the feedback on weekly drawing assignments was too \"anything goes\", with little negative criticism.",
    "Professor Purves and the TFs were incredible: they had such great insight in both lecture and section (reviewing the homework assignments). I thought the homework assignments were great and appreciated how they built on each other. However, I wish we learned more (and practiced some) about the construction\/development process.",
    "I think the strengths are Professor Purves, who is a great lecturer, and the assignments, which covered a lot of breadth and were interesting. I think this course could be improved by having office hours where you could ask for help with the sketches and projects.",
    "The lectures were incredibly engaging. Every single class flowed very well, resulting in an entertaining but informative course.",
    "Purves is great but his guest lectures are absurdly boring We don't know any grades until the term ends which, in combination with unclear feedback from certain TAs makes ot difficult to know what to do better",
    "Strengths: well-taught, gave a good overview of architecture, reasonably paced, good workload Weaknesses: very white, very male outlooks on architecture; rarely ever included women of color and most readings referred to the architect as \"he\" and talked mostly about how men were affected by the spaces",
    "Strengths were that I thoroughly enjoyed the lectures, I really liked the professors and the TAs were very nice and approachable.",
    "The course was overall extremely well taught. One thing that might be improved is the slate of guest lecturers at the end of the course. I didn't ding them as powerful or interesting as Professor Purves' typical lecture.",
    "Strengths - Professor Purves is incredible! So kind, generous, astute, and well spoken. The TAs (especially Dan Whitcombe) are fabulous mentors and really helped me develop as an artist. Cons - because Prof Purves is so amazing, the guest lectures always seemed subpar (with the exception of Keller Easterling) and pretty dry\/outdated",
    "engaging lecture, fun assignments more time for design projects, more feedback",
    "I love the professor as well as the TAs. The people involved in the course definitely made it a really enjoyable learning experience. They were also always happy to answer extra questions which I really liked.",
    "The class is a very gentle and respectful environment to begin learning\/ practicing architectural ideas. I really enjoyed the discussion sections and opportunities for feedback. The final review was actually really enjoyable. More opportunities to see other student work would maybe make this strong class stronger.",
    "The lectures are amazing, Alec Purves is by far the best teacher I've had at Yale. The guest lecturers also give a different and interesting perspective to the class. The TAs are fun and helpful, but sections are unrelated to the class and the readings. They would be far more engaging if they felt like a continuation of the other elements of the course and not a different class. The feedback on the drawing assignments is not very helpful.",
    "The sketchbook assignments were a great strength to the course. Giving each student the chance to explore different techniques and approaches to depicting architecture, or creating it, was a great way to maintain an engaging creative curriculum. The design projects were also fun, stimulating, and thought-provoking. The lectures were always interesting, as Purves is an excellent speaker and can really communicate the wonder and beauty of architectural forms, almost like poetry, but also through the help of compelling powerpoint imagery. The discussion section was a great addition because it gave a chance for us to discuss some of the material covered in class even though there was often very little overlap. Can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "I think the strengths are that the lectures are often pretty interesting and not difficult, but section is usually a bit boring we just go around in a circle looking at other people's homework for the week. I'm not sure how much others get out of doing that, but I didn't feel like it was conducive to my learning.",
    "The lectures were fairly interesting -- Purves does a good job at keeping his lectures interesting and engaging. It would have been nice to receive more regular grades and feedback throughout the semester, though this is more a criticism of the TAs. The final project is designing a lampshade, which is actually pretty fun.",
    "Purves is clearly an expert in the field, and his slides were mostly from his personal photos from trips so that's cool. The final project was fun-ish. But overall the course was pretty dry. Lecture was boring and section felt useless.",
    "Dr. Purves is a great lecturer and the drawing assignments were very helpful. Although I understand that the course was designed to be topic-driven instead of organized historically, I would have appreciated a brief historical overview since I was coming in totally blind. That said, the focus on Yale buildings and the ample photographic examples were very conducive to learning, and the drawing assignments were both fun and helpful.",
    "I think the readings should be required and we should be tested on it. The lack of requirement made me be too lax in the readings but I bet there was a lot to gain from them. Other than that the course was great."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Despite issues in grading, the class was very enjoyable and intellectually challenging in a way that is different from many other classes at Yale.",
    "Yes, because it is very fun to draw and explore buildings on campus, and you get to develop a better understanding of architecture and architects in general.",
    "Yes, this course greatly shapes the way I now see the world. Even as someone who is not an architecture or art major, I benefitted greatly from taking this course.",
    "definitely would recommend to other students because i enjoyed the course a lot. makes you think and learn in a different way and you can see your improvements throughout the course of the semester,",
    "I would recommend it as a Hu credit because the weekly assignments and projects are honestly a lot of fun. There aren't that many courses where you get the opportunity to be creative. I would recommend people who are on the fence of deciding whether or not they like architecture.",
    "Definitely! Even if you dont want to be an architecture major, its an interesting and different class",
    "I see aspects of architecture on campus differently, and Alec is a cool lecturer. If you have skill in drawing, think of this class as a series of lectures you would attend for fun that also lets you draw. Tougher to come at without background skill or knowledge in drawing and architectural concepts.",
    "Yes. If you're not an intended architecture major, it is still a great supportive environment to try something new while broadening your understanding of the world around you. I had never really drawn before, but found that it was a fun challenge to push myself out my comfort zone. I really improved my drawing. There are lots of people taking the class just for fun too, so you don't stick out as being \"worse\" than anyone else. Everyone is pushed to improve and graded on effort and improvement.",
    "Yes! I really enjoyed lecture and all the projects. It makes you think but is not too much work. 10\/10 would recommend. People and TAs are great too. Don't stress too much about the lampshade and definitely take the TAs recommendations into consideration.",
    "YES! This course is great for anyone who is interested in architecture.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to any student with even a mild interest in architecture! It teaches you a different way to see the world and new methods of capturing elements through drawing and models.",
    "Absolutely. Even if you have a passing interest in architecture, you should take it. The material is relevant to everyday life, the workload is what you make of it, and you'll walk away with projects that you'll be proud of by the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this to underclassmen, but probably not upperclassmen who won't find the material of the lectures engaging, although they might enjoy the projects.",
    "Yes!! One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, if they're willing to put in effort into the drawings, midterm, and final models. Otherwise, a very laid back class.",
    "Yes especially if you are interested in architecture",
    "Yes((:",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It was a nice break from other very rigorous courses at Yale.",
    "Yes!! If you're looking for a low workload but also something to add a new perspective on life, this class is definitely the one. Not stressful at all, and you'll learn a lot of new things that you might actually think about when you walk around and look at the buildings on campus.",
    "Absolutely, understanding the built environment that we live in (even on a baseline level) is applicable every day and every student should should know some about it.",
    "For non-architecture majors, I would recommend this course if you need a humanities credit and have an interest in drawing and architecture.",
    "Yes! This is a great course even if you do not want to be an architecture major. It makes you think in completely different ways and changes the way you understand your surroundings.",
    "YES, take ot whether or not you're interested in architecture. it's a fantastic class and you will love sweet Purves and if you have a good section you will love your TAs too",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were looking to gain a broad understanding of architecture and its conventions",
    "Yes! It is a great introductory course into learning about architecture and the assignments is designed to make you think in ways you've haven't really before.",
    "For sure. I loved the course, and its completely changed my perspective. It's actually got me to consider majoring in Architecture.",
    "YES! This is an amazing course if you are in anyway interested in architecture. the way professor purves presents material is so digestible. also, attending class is equivalent to sitting down with a warm cup a tea and hearing a super well read and knowledgable story weave together a narrative of the present and the past, through the lens of architecture. this class is a treat!",
    "yes! it is a fun and engaging class that provers a good overview of the study of architecture",
    "Yes, this course really is an open discussion about your work. Everyone wants you to improve and continue to try new things without judgement. It allows for trial and error of ideas that might otherwise not be explored.",
    "While everyone considering the major must take this class, I would encourage students in subject unrelated to architecture to take this class for the heck of it. It is not a huge commitment but also allows you to produce interesting work.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's a very fun and interesting class, especially if one is interested in a general overview of architecture.",
    "Definitely would recommend this course, one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. While I recommend doing the readings, which are amazing, they are not necessary for section. You can put as much effort as you want into the class, but most people are committed to it because of how engaging it is.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in getting, well, an introduction to the field of architecture, and also anyone interested in drawing, art, or other creative practices. This class was filled with assignments that forced you to look at things in different ways. Anyone who considers themselves creative should take this class--it rocks.",
    "I think so. I had never taken this kind of class before, and you definitely learn a lot from the lectures despite it not being much of an intellectual challenge. The assignments can sometimes take a long time to do, but they're just once a week and it provides a pretty nice balance to the rest of my (non-drawing) homework anyways. Good for a fifth class.",
    "I would probably recommend this course to other students. Some skill in drawing is implicitly requisite for taking the class.",
    "It's super low workload (couple of sketches, a short paper, a kinda fun final project, no one does the readings), but also pretty boring.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, even if you aren't interested in pursuing architecture. The drawing assignments took up some time each week, sure, but they were so different from the rest of my homework that I actually looked forward to doing them. You aren't graded on the quality of the drawing so much as the effort you put in and the improvement you show, which I felt very freeingas long as I tried, I knew it would be okay. I took this course Credit\/D and regretted it. Despite not receiving any grades until the end (and I guess I don't know what grade I got, ultimately, so maybe take this with a grain of salt) I never got any indication that I would get anything less than an A. So, not a particularly harshly graded class if you show some engagement and really enjoy the assignments. I'm not going to be taking any more architecture courses, but I am very glad I got my feet wet with this one. Professor Purves is very enjoyable to listen to (although some of the guest lectures were a little less interesting), and the final lampshade project was a joy to work on.",
    "I think learning about architecture is important and it can help you perhaps appreciate the things around you. Besides this class is a lot of fun and lets you express you creativity which is not something all classes allow you to do."
