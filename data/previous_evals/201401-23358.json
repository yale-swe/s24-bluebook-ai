    "If you're interested in learning the standard model and you don't mind difficult problem sets, you'll probably enjoy this class. But be aware that the material is at a much higher level than 440 and 441, and a background in group theory would be extremely useful. The problem sets are every other week, so in spite of being challenging the overall workload of the class is not extreme.",
    "Very difficult material although not a lot of work",
    "This is a good class to take Credit\/D\/F if you're interested in seeing the material (an overview of the Standard Model, with a lot of group theory) for the first time. You won't understand it, but it's good to be exposed to it before grad school.",
    "If you really want to see quantum field theory as an undergrad, and don't feel comfortable taking a graduate course, I would recommend taking this credit\/D and making sure William is the TA again. Otherwise, it will likely be extremely stressful come finals. The final for this class was the most difficult I have ever taken.",
    "Physics 442 delves into the physics I have most anticipated since I took up the physics major. The material is far from easy, and it moves quickly. Field theory is strange. But it is awesome. Lectures often move more quickly than students can keep up, though they come directly from Professor Goldberger's fantastic notes, which he posts online, such that it is straightforward (also imperative) to review the notes after each lecture. Despite my criticism that there is often a seemingly unmanageable amount in the lectures, I am very excited, looking back, by how much we covered. I am glad of the homework structure - six (challenging) problem sets total - since they provided time to delve into the material. The lack of a midterm might provide strong responses both positive and negative, though I myself am rather neutral on the point. I do think that additional recommendations of supplementary resources might have helped, as I gained a lot late in the course from studying other sources, simply because multiple types of explanation to be helpful. Professor Goldberger's notes are quite thorough, though, and seeing that they could pretty well constitute a book of their own, they are a significant achievement. Overall, the course was intense, sometimes frustrating (if you get lost in the material from time to time), but ultimately hugely, hugely rewarding. It has made me much more seriously consider applying to physics graduate school in the future.",
    "If I had to describe this course with one word, it would be, \"absurd\". If you take this course, I would take this course credit\/D. Seriously. At least start it credit\/D and switch over later. This course is extremely fast paced. I took more notes in this class each lecture than a week's worth of notes from all of my other courses combined. And you need to take notes, as the book is pretty useless for any of the homework or the final. While the material is interesting (we did cover math behind the entire standard model (Higgs boson, quantum field theory, etc), the course is so fast that it can be hard to absorb any information. I think ultimately, I am glad that I took this course because I did want to see this material some time in my life. And, now that I have taken this course, I can tell you that I won't be seeing it in grad school..."
