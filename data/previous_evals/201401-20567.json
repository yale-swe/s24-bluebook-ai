    "Yes, take it!",
    "Yes, this was a great history course.",
    "Amazing class! Even if you're not interested in Japan you will be by the end. Professor Botsman is an amazing lecturer. Even if you don't know anything about Japan he will make it easy for you to understand while also entertaining you along the way. Also if you can try to get Nicole as your TA, she was awesome.",
    "Take it! If you have any interest in modern Japan but know little about the factors that led to it, this is the course to take. Relaxed, medium-commitment, and highly accessible to non-history or East Asian studies majors. I found it somewhat 'easy' as a student of history, but I nonetheless learned a great deal. Between a single 5-page paper, a midterm, and a final, I never felt overwhelmed either.",
    "I was honestly a little disappointed in this course. Professor Botsman is a great teacher, and it is a great LAAA credit, but most of the readings are only okay, and the paper topic is handed to you, so it's not fun to write. Additionally we had to watch a painful movie. But it's a solid and pretty easy lecture if you are interested in Japanese history.",
    "Basically an overview of Japan before modern times (the title is deceiving I think). You will get a great background of how Japan became the country it is today which is actually more necessary than you would think. You will learn a lot and enjoy it too!",
    "The class is good. Lectures are very good. The reading is often terrible. It can be excruciatingly boring. One paper, one short paper, and two exams, so there are quite a few things due, but the class is front-heavy. Only the final exam after spring break, at least this year.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best classes you can take if you're a History major looking for LAAA credits (though it's also just a great class to take in its own right!). Fascinating culture, well-taught, kind and brilliant professor, interesting readings, very reasonable exams. Yes.",
    "fascinating course. great professor. even if you're not interested in Japan. you'll learn a lot about the one country in Asia that successfully modernized in a window of a few decades to become a state on par with those in the West. you'll learn about how Japan's defeat of Russia in 1905 sent shockwaves through the world (WEB Dubois rejoiced). You'll learn about how the modernization of Japan was made possible by a resurgence and re-creation of the \"samurai spirit.\" You'll learn about the roots of Japan's aggression towards its neighbors that still causes regional unrest today.",
    "If you are intersted in the time period, take the class! It is fascinating and Professor Botsman is amazing. The lectures are really interesting and he is such a nice person. You do need to be prepared to learn a lot, especially if Japanese names and history are foreign to you, as they were for me, but it is totally doable with no background in this kind of history and such a good course!",
    "Examination of Japan from about 1820-1912. Yes, I'd recommend it.",
    "This course covers the basics of the Tokugawa period, and the long-Japanese nineteenth century--from the early 1800s to the Russo-Japanese War, focusing on how the Tokugawa system failed and how the Meiji state was conceived and made in its aftermath. Many of the lectures seem to be based off of Marius Jensen's \"The Making of Modern Japan,\" taking a primarily political viewpoint on the period, but also incorporating cultural, social, intellectual, and urban history.",
    "Look at the syllabus. It spends a lot more time on the Tokugawa period than you might expect. That said, it's a good introduction to the time period.",
    "Definitely take this class. Very well organized and taught. I looked forward to going to this class.",
    "Take it. Interesting materials and a charming professor.",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is the perfect introduction to the history of Tokugawa and Meiji Japan. Take this course. Professor Botsman is a dynamic, clear, and organized lecturer. I loved listening to him twice a week. He hands out an outline of the lecture at the beginning and gives you key terms. As long as you follow this outline and pay attention, you can't do badly. The secondary source reading he chose often just expanded upon what he stated in class, so you don't really get any different perspectives on the history from them. This was definitely a weak point of the course. The primary source readings were very interesting but we were not tested on them, which made it so fewer students actually completed the reading regularly. TF's were not knowledgeable about the subject. Since the TF's rarely knew more than the students about Meiji Japan, students knew their TF's would not know if they hadn't really done the reading, making sections frustrating. Also, the final is 60% of the grade, which is excessive seeing as you write a 7 page paper earlier in the semester that should count for more than 15% of your grade. Basically, Professor Botsman is great, most of the TFs are not good, but the course is definitely worth taking.",
    "Yes the class is good. Great lecturer, no final essay and the exams are fair so long as you go to lecture and you learn the major IDs.",
    "This was a reasonably enjoyable history course, though it felt a little disorganized at time. Prof Botsman doesn't really use dates to anchor the narrative, and lectures jumped around and sometimes focused on themes that didn't really play into the bigger picture. He's a fun lecturer and if you're interested in Japan you'll enjoy class. The readings are never tested and discussed only in broad strokes in section, and to be honest I rarely did them and it didn't matter at all (they were usually isolated primary sources unrelated to our major questions). The class itself is very little work, 1 short assignment, a short paper, a reasonable midterm, and a semi-cumulative final.",
    "Excellent class for anyone interested in Japanese history, the history of modernization and imperialism, or just for history majors who need a ROW. The first half of the course is a little slow but it is absolutely necessary to understand the fascinating second half, when Japan re-establishes its ancient system of rule only to embark on a whirlwind modernization and militarization process to try to challenge the Western powers. Botsman is incredibly committed to the class and his research on punishment and power is brilliant. The paper is pretty boring but at least it's short, and there's also a weird (yet worthwhile) movie, which Botsman got us Pepe's for so it was all good.",
    "Absolutely take this class. I came into it thinking that I would just pass to get the rest of the world history requirement. I left with a very good sense of this period in Japan. And, I loved the material.",
    "I adored this course, and while I tend to gravitate toward American history courses, this course more than surpassed my expectations. It deals with a fascinating time period in Japanese history \u2014 a period in which Japan went from a nation that rejected foreign influence and appealed to Japanese antiquity as a source of legitimacy and strength, to a nation that looked to the West as a model for modernization and attempted to assert itself as an imperial power. You learn a lot about Japan, but also about the ways Japan interacted with and reacted to the West. Professor Botsman is wonderful -- a great lecturer and very kind and light-hearted. Definitely recommended!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all students. I took it because I saw that it had great reviews and because I also needed a non-western credit for the history major. It turned out to be one of my favorite classes. Many students actually took Drixler's Japanese history class before JMR, but I didn't and didn't feel that I was at a disadvantage at all. It's a great summary course of Japanese culture, society, interactions with the West and other Asian powers that I knew nothing about previously but had so much fun learning.",
    "This is a great class about a highly interesting people. It clears up many misconceptions at least I had about Japan. I would definitely suggest this class to anyone.",
    "Great course for 'other world' history. Botsman is great! A must take",
    "The course was an exciting way to learn much more about an era and a place in which I previously had little experience. The class involved a lot of memorization and felt on the easy side, but Professor Botsman was a terrific lecturer who managed to tie together often disparate material. Overall, a solid non-Western course, if a bit large and not the most challenging.",
    "Great history lecture. Definitely recommended.",
    "I took this class because I needed a LAAA credit for my History major. This was a great lecture course with an awesome professor.",
    "An incredible experience. Probably one of my best at Yale.",
    "A fantastic class! Seriously one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is fascinating, even for someone like me who doesn't know the first thing about Asian history and isn't going to pursue it. This is definitely one of your best options for fulfilling the LAAA distribution requirement, and an excellent class for a humanities credit. The workload is light, and Professor Botsman is a gem. He makes everything really interesting and relevant, he knows how to present the material to a group of college kids, and you can tell that he loves what he's talking about. To top it off, he's the sweetest, nicest guy. Super approachable and reasonable, and enthusiastic about helping students. TL;DR: I could not recommend this class more highly.",
    "Yes definitely! Great class on an interesting topic, for history majors and non-majors alike.",
    "The lectures for HIST 303 were great. Professor Botsman was clear and organized, and he tapped into the right level of overview vs. depth. The grade primarily rested on the two exams (worth 25% and 45%), but there was also an easy 8-page paper off assigned reading. A great option for a rest-of-the-world credit.",
    "Take it if you're a history major! Take it if you have any interest in Japan!",
    "If you're looking for an easy fifth credit and \/ or are already interested in Japanese history, I would recommend this class. It was not a difficult history lecture. But I would not say it was phenomenal or changed my understanding of history in any significant way.",
    "Definitely recommend! Japanese history is so interesting and definitely something that is worth delving into more deeply. Great lectures and for the most part interesting readings, with a midterm, paper, final, and a small assignment at the beginning of the term. Take this class!!",
    "Although a few of the post-midterm lectures are poorly organized, JMR is an interesting course. For those interested in political history, it's a great way to fulfill the geographical requirements of the history major.",
    "This was an awesome lecture course! Interesting lectures every week, manageable reading load, and well spread out\/totally manageable exams and paper schedule. Definitely take if you're at all interested in the subject!",
    "Tons of fun. Take it! Prof. Botsman is absolutely delightful to learn from; lectures feel like storytelling sessions, and he really added an extra layer of enchantment to the already fascinating history of Tokugawa and Meiji Japan.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Prof. Botsman is an excellent lecturer and the it is a history course that offers a fascinating and in depth view of the political history of Japan during a critical period of its transformation from an early modern polity to a modern state.",
    "Great lecture course with a great professor! It is sometimes hard to study for the midterm and final because there are so many terms to study, but Botsman makes the material so interesting.",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is a survey course that focuses on Japan's political, economic, social, and literary histories between 1840 and 1910. The lectures are very well-organized, and my section proved to supplement my",
    "I would definitely recommend the class. Many people know little to nothing about Japanese history. This class also covers the general politics and culture of the Far East.",
    "Great overview of Modern Japanese History, and Professor Botsman is amazing. Not a tough class, and very accessible for non-history majors. Definitely shop it!",
    "You should take this class.",
    "If you're super into the material or Japan take it but otherwise there are better history classes out there.",
    "Yes, I thought it was interesting and enjoyable and not too much work.",
    "Good class, never took a history course before but loved this. The lectures are like listening to a deeply connected story, and the primary source documents are pretty cool because of how well they tie into the lectures. Learned a lot about the period leading up to the Meiji Restoration, and the consequences that followed.",
    "Favorite class of the semester. Interesting, with a really good professor who makes class go by fast with his style.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yiwen is a wonderful teaching fellow. She is very engaging and is incredibly knowledgeable about the material of the course. Section is always both interesting and fun. She is very successful at leading great discussions. Yiwen is also very dedicated to all students, makes a sincere effort to get to know everyone (she memorized all our names on the first day of section), and is always willing to help students on her own time in any way she can. It was a pleasure to get to know her.",
    "If you took \"The Great Peace\" you should definitely consider taking this follow-up course.",
    "Yale offers many great history lecture courses and this one is no exception. This is not only a great \"Rest of World\" credit for History majors, but one of the best history courses out there, among the courses that every history major should take. That said, I would highly recommend it to any student. The transition between the feudal late Tokugawa Period and the westernized, militarizing Meiji Period over the course of the 19th century is something that every human should know about because it is unique to history and it's something that American and European history aficionados especially can benefit from because it elaborates on the change in Eastern to Western culture and Western influences. Japan's Modern Revolution is truly a great course--my favorite of this semester. It's main strength is that the subject matter is fascinating, Prof. Botsman is a charming, light-hearted, easily understood, passionate lecturer. The TAs all seemed fantastic, especially Yiwen, who was the best TA I've ever had.",
    "This is a good course to take, both as a \"Rest of the World\" and for kicks otherwise.",
    "If it tickles your fancy and you have the time, take it. If it interests you, then definitely take it.",
    "It's a summary course of Japanese history. The reading was manageable, the lectures are interesting, and discussion section is bearable. If you're looking for a RoW class, this is a very good candidate.",
    "A good class to take. Especially if you don't have much of a background in history and just want to try a history class out.",
    "As a science major, this was an extra class for me, and I'm glad I took it. I don't know if I've been in a class at Yale in which the material taught was so simultaneously accessible and interesting. Botsman teaches in the classic historical narrative format, presenting each lecture as a story with characters and a plotline, which is very appropriate for a country that at this time pretty much had its own history that was distinct from the patterns of the rest of the world. At least for me, the Meiji restoration was a glaring gap in my high school world history courses, and it is cool to feel like I now have a sufficient and worthwhile understanding of how Japan's transformation came about.",
    "An awesome class about something that you have probably never learned about before. Take it, take it, take it!",
    "Take this class!!!! It is really really interesting and a topic in history that you won't really learn to this level in any other class. Professor Botsman is really really interesting and engaging in lecture. He makes the material fun and easy to learn and is definitely the highlight of the course. That said the readings and basically only useful in section as most of them are primary source documents and get repetitive and if you don't go to lecture you will be lost by the time exams come. But going to lecture is really not that tedious as Professor Bostmam makes the time very enjoyable. This class really is not a lot of work as long as you go to lecture. Take it!!",
    "Take it. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "Japan's Modern Revolution is a great non-Western history course. Professor Botsman is an engaging and clear professor. The course is very heavy loaded with two papers, a midterm exam and a lot of reading assignments. The second half of the course is less intense, although the final exam that covers the entire semester. I would recommend this class, but not as a fifth class."
