    "If you are coming from Spanish 110, this will be a big step up. The amount of work is dramatically more, and the class is harder. You will improve your Spanish ability but will be working everyday. If you are placed into Spanish 120, it will be a hard semester for you. Most likely your Spanish will be rusty, so practice before taking the class or else you will feel behind of people who came from 110.",
    "Would recommend, even if you don't need it for a language credit. A good course.",
    "Contrary to what some other students have said, Spanish 120 is actually a bit easier than 110. This, however, is coming from someone who never took Spanish beforehand. Sign up for Professor Juliana Ramos-Ruano's course if you can. She's funny, dynamic, and an altogether great professor. She'll make learning Spanish fun\u00e2\u0080\u0094plus you'll get more cookies than in other sections.",
    "Spanish 120 is WAY harder than Spanish 110. The professors grade more difficultly and are less lenient with lack of participation, tardiness, etc. Be prepared for more work.Juliana is great! Very helpful and enthusiastic that definitely wakes you up in the morning.",
    "This class was a lot of work and very difficult to do well in. It is not a class I would recommend just to take, but if you want to improve your Spanish you will do that in it.",
    "I would recommend her as a teacher. I don't care for the language particualrly, so I might not recommend taking the class for that reason."
