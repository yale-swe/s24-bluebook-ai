    "This is hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. The course has a lot of reading, but the material in incredibly interesting and applicable to everyday life. It will change the way you interpret your own actions. Professor Rogers is probably the best Professor in the Anthro department and among the best at Yale. I was really great to take a course with him in my final semester. This class is a must take if offered again.",
    "This class is pretty intense (like, really intense) but also super interesting. It really opened my eyes to anthropological approaches to culture in a way that I'd never encountered.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "Fantastic course. Every reading is interesting and exciting, the professor is great, I enjoyed writing the papers...and I'm not even an Anthro major! Trust me, take it take it take it."
