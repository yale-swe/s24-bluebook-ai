   "comments": [
    "QED, renormalization, gauge theories",
    "Some familiarity with deriving and calculating Feynman diagrams for various interactions, renormalization and other calculations involving loops, non-abelian gauge theory (QCD), path integral approach to QCD and some primer on spontaneous symmetry breaking of global\/gauge symmetries",
    "This was a great continuation of the first semester of Quantum Field Theory. I really enjoyed learning about renormalization, QED and QCD.",
    "I learned an immense amount about essential topics on quantum field theory. I developed a large vocabulary in particle physics because of it .",
    "This course will naturally extend the material of part I. You'll finish developing the tools necessary to work with QED, and from that spend a good part of the semester learning about the systematics and implications of renormalization, which is a fascinating topic in and of itself. From there, the remainder of the semester focuses on QCD, developing the path integral, and understanding the Higgs mechanism and the Standard Model more broadly.",
    "I learned fundamental techniques of quantum field theory, including renormalization in the dimensional regularization plus minimal subtraction scheme; non-Abelian gauge theory; functional integral methods; and the physics of spontaneous symmetry breaking.",
    "Intuition behind renormalization and path integrals, rigorous understanding of QED and structures of QCD\/symmetry breaking"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very detailed worked examples. Can probably discuss more on renormalization group flow.",
    "The strength of this course lies in the clarify of presentation and complete, thorough derivations of various results by Goldberger, who likes to make witty remarks. However, for the second half of the course, this thoroughness worked backwards in that things (starting from non-abelian QCD) got too complicated and the derivations were mired in too much math that it was hard to stay motivated near the end of the course. In fact, the take-home final project asked questions that were certainly beyond what was taught in the course, which was very unlike the previous problems sets that were doable given the lectures. So, I have mixed feelings: first half of the course, up to renormalization, was very clear and motivating, but from QCD onwards, the lectures were either too \"technical\" (i.e. too many calculations without much physical insight) or lacking in depth (esp. symmetry breaking) to adequately prepare us for the final project. I guess the professor could adjust the pace with the difficulty of the course, but it is hard to say - after all, QFT2 is one of the most difficult, if not the most, graduate-level physics course available.",
    "This class had amazing lectures that were very well organized.",
    "It covers a a lot of I formation and it does so thoroughly",
    "The problem sets for this course were the most challenging in any of the physics courses I've taken at Yale, but this was a strength rather than a weakness. By the end of the term, I felt like I truly had gained a great deal of ability for calculation and understanding into what I saw before as a truly difficult and inaccessible subject.",
    "This course was an excellent quantum field theory course. The only improvement I could imagine would be having typed lecture notes. The online ones for this course didn't allow searching by word, which made reviewing specific topics tricky.",
    "Ambitious in scope and very detailed, which was both a strength and a weakness. I'm glad that we were able to cover so much material, but I wish we had spent less time on QED and related developments and instead had dug into more symmetry breaking, EW unification, etc. The organization of the course is still a little mysterious to me. I'll have to dig through lecture notes to find sections that are seemingly unrelated to what happened in the first half of the lecture. The lectures didn't have the same organized focus as in QFT I. The handwritten lecture notes made the notes much more difficult to parse than the typed notes in QFT I."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, for any people interested in theories.",
    "Yes if you are a theorist that uses QM on some level (high energy, condensed matter, astro etc., not including biophysics and other non-traditional disciplines), since field theory is ubiquitous these days. For experimentalists, the workload will be too much, and I'd recommend simply auditing if you are really interested (unless you work in high energy, in which case taking the course would be helpful).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to physicists who want an introduction to quantum field theory and the standard model.",
    "For any serious aspiring physicist, especially theoretical but also experimental, this course is a must-have. I highly recommend taking up the challenge of going through this course.",
    "This course is absolutely necessary for anyone wanting to do research in quantum field theory. I highly recommend this course to high energy experimentalists and condensed matter theorists as well. The topics covered in this course are of fundamental importance to modern physics. This course is a lot of work though, and it goes very quickly! I would have done better if I had read the textbook and reviewed the lecture notes more.",
    "Highly recommended to those interested in understanding renormalization, path integrals, asymptotic freedom, QED, QCD, etc. The lectures span a lot of material, only a portion of which is really reinforced via problem set questions, but I feel pretty good knowing the breadth of ideas we tackled in this course."
