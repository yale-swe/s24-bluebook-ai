    "The instructor. It is great to be able to learn from an instructor who has very through understanding and historical knowledge\/experience of international environmental law.",
    "the extensive knowledge that Professor Robinson had on all the MEAs. He could answer any question about the international law system.",
    "Professor is very well informed, highly intelligent, articulate, and had well-planned lectures. course content was comprehensive.",
    "The general overview and temporal presentation of the material. The professor clearly knows what he is talking about- he literally wrote the book on the subject.",
    "The instructor and his breadth of knowledge. Also, we often relied upon primary documents and thus is gave one an authoritative understanding of relevant topics.",
    "Gives you a really thorough overview of the current state of international environmental law, as well as a good historical understanding of how the body of law developed.",
    "The ground it covered. And that there were 3 hours per week since it gave the lectured time to set out the topics in detail.",
    "Professor Robinson is an entertaining lecturer. I appreciated his \"storytelling\", and the timelines that he uses through the class. He was very enjoyable to listen to, and the class was very structured, so you knew what to expect from each class.",
    "The knowledge that Prof Robinson had was impressive and he gave great lectures that were both interesting and informative.",
    "Nicholas Robinson. He is THE MAN! Great lecturer, very knowledgeable, approachable.",
    "Professor Robinson is an amazing person. It is great that he spends time at FES and we are lucky to have him.",

    "Professors knowledge and insights - he is very experienced.",
    "The professor's extensive knowledge of and experience in the field of environmental law; Prof. Robinson also used timelines to teach the course of environmental law development for each topic, which were extremely helpful and an organized way to approach the complex and involved histories of environmental policies. Also, Prof. Robinson really encouraged the class to take on environmental policy problems for ourselves- to use what he taught us to come up with our own solutions.",
    "The knowledge of the professor and his passion for the subject. And how he applied the principles of international environmental law to current events and problems."

   "comments": [
    "NA",
    "this is a three hour lecture once\/week and NEEDS a discussion within the lecture somewhere. it's just too much to sit there for 3 hours without any dialogue. The professor said the time would be split (2 hours lecture, break, then discussion) but we very rarely had discussion and when we did it was for about 10 minutes.",
    "A lack of discussion time in class. It was more a 3 hour lecture than anything. This would be all right, except the class was presented as half lecture, half discussion.",
    "The schedule.",
    "The classes tended to be 3-hour lectures rather than seminars. While they were very informative, I think the course would benefit from some more dialogue between teacher and students, and\/or between the students themselves. Perhaps the mid-term could involve some group-work or something like that.",
    "Cannot think of anything that needs to be improved.",
    "I understand the purpose of having a midterm and final paper, but it would be good to have other assignments to distribute the weight of the grade. Also, there are so many interesting topics that are covered, it would be helpful to have an opportunity to explore topics that we generate, and not only answering questions that he gives us.",
    "The essay topics on exams - Some students in the class were law students, some were not. It would be nice to have some choices of topics to discuss on the exams. It was a bit intimidating to discuss an appropriate course of action for future laws without a more thorough law background. I personally lost interest in writing my essays after 30+ hours of work on each exam. Yes, I learned a lot, but maybe they can be restructured somehow for more effective utilization of the materials discussed throughout the course.",
    "group discussion would be helpful or small classes with more discussion would be very helpful.grading system - all the grade was based on the final paper (80%)",
    "The questions on the midterm and final were a bit hard to understand and could have been articulated more clearly."

This course helped extremely in the history and development of such institutions. It was also extremely helpful in my internship with a UN mission this past semester.",

    "I am interested in international policy, and always wanted to take an international environmental law course.",
    "I am a joint JD\/MEM and it was the first (and I think only) course that focused on INTERNATIONAL environmental law which was very interesting and relevant to what I am doing.",
    "Very helpful for those considering a future in international environmental policy-making or law. This class should be required of those who participate in the UN class.",
    "I am interested in water policy so this class was very helpful.",
    "I am an undergraduate student, and was thrilled to have the opportunity to take this class. For an undergrad EVST major, classes in environmental policy and law are pretty limited, and most law school classes are also unavailable. Although not all of the course material was new to me, the international focus was really enlightening and I left the course feeling like my knowledge of policy and law is a lot more complete.",

    "Do not be put off by the 3 hour lecture. Because Prof. Robinson uses a historical narrative to explain law, it is like listening to a story. And take detailed notes. The questions on his exams can look complicated but, it is all from the material he uses and what he says in the class.I did not realize how much I had actually learnt from the course till I took the mid-term (take-home). Overall, one of the best courses I have taken this semester.",
    "Do all the readings, they help immensely with the course.",
    "Be prepared for LONG lectures, take snacks, pace yourself on long writing assignments",
    "Do all of the readings before the class so the lecture makes more sense. Give yourself time to absorb and reevaluate each lecture, because a lot of material is presented in a condensed amount of time.",
    "I found the casebook (which is only a recommended text) to be very helpful.",
    "Keep on top of the reading for each class - otherwise the mid-term will feel like a lot of extra work.",
    "Keep up with the reading and attend the office hours that are offered.",
    "This is a great course. Professor Robinson is a very good lecturer, and you will learn a lot. Sure the class is three hours, but it is a good three hours, and goes by fairly quickly.",
    "take good notes!",
    "\"Think outside of the box\", but don't over think things. Utilize the information the professor gives you to assess the questions he poses.",
    "Start your paper early and talk to the professor.",
    "There's quite a bit of reading on the syllabus,- always skim before class, but most of the relevant reading can be digested while writing your midterm and exam. Be prepared to take on questions of environmental law for yourself- do your own research outside of class on the UN and UNEP. The better an understanding of international relations you develop for yourself, the more useful this course will be to you.",
    "Go to every class even if you cant do the reading because the professor's lectures and knowledge are the most valuable part of the course."
