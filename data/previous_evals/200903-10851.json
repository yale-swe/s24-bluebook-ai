    "This class was interesting because it centered so much around the field trip to the Basque Country of Spain. That was the core of the course and all the work before and after the trip revolved around preparing for, analyzing, and synthesizing data for the field trip. So it wasn't exactly like a normal FES class. It was hard and times, and easy at times.",
    "One of the best classes at FES. Very hands-on learning with the trip component, and we tackled real world problems. Ashton is such a great professor too, and it is very evident that he cares about the students learning a lot."

    "The professors good nature and keen interest and belief in our capabilities. Also the support and peer learning that takes place.",
    "Mark is a great professor. He has a way with students, he's a really fun and good teacher, and he loves what he does it seems. The trip was excellent despite the trials and tribulations of international travel with a large group.",
    "See question 11 (the trip and the prof! Also, small class size made it quite intimate and easy to get to know the other students).",
    "The professor and TA selected a well rounded and dedicated group of people for the task\/class - it was a crucial part of an excellent course to have a diverse groups of experiences and confidence in fields among the 9 members.",
    "This was one of the most useful courses I have taken because of its practical applications. It was extremely beneficial to go through the exercises of preparing for a rapid assessment as part of a team, and Mark has done this so many times that he was able to provide clear leadership where needed and give us freedom where that was useful. It has been very interesting to see the process, group dynamics and product all develop before, during and after the trip."

   "comments": [
    "The course is an advanced seminar course and largely relies on having the students teach other with Mark as a guide. Mark is an excellent guide but I would have liked to have seen how this technique of rapid assessments plays out in the real world more. Perhaps invite in a guest speaker or two to see how other people approach the process - in the end, without anything other than the professors word I am still left wondering how useful the process is, how economically and environmentally viable it is to fly eleven people from connecticut to spain) and how I would incorporate it into future work (or create work from this newly developed skill).",
    "Can't think of anything.",
    "It would be great to finish up work before the end of the semester rather than having the paper drag on after the break, but it's also nice to have the extra time to do a good job on the paper... not sure how to resolve this tension!",
    "Administration and sharing of reference materials was somewhat problematic for this collaborative and fast-paced project. Perhaps setting up a framework of folders on a simple FTP site before the semester is under way would help this issue (a detail, but one that is time consuming to tackle during the course of the semester)"

   "comments": [
    "The class was essentially a rapid assessments team. We all carried out individual pieces of the larger research and assessment mission, but collaborated continuously on the project. The disadvantages are just dealing with lots of unique personalities and channeling them effectively into one project.",
    "The whole class worked as a group which was a very positive experience.",
    "Very loosely though.",
    "Our interests and interpretations of the topic were somewhat different; however, I feel this made our product stronger.",
    "Self-segregating into teams by interest split up the group into personality combinations that probably wouldn't have happened otherwise, which was useful and informative. I enjoy the collaborative process of writing with a peer very much and it is much better motivation than deadlines to keep things moving."

    "This was my favorite course I've taken so far at FES and I feel that I've learned the most as well. The structure the course was perfect for learning a great deal and limiting the size to 8 is about right (no more for sure). The key to class is being ready to work alot independently and who the other students are with you in the class. Having good classmates is essential as I learned as much from them as from the course itself. The course is alot of work so be ready for it.",
