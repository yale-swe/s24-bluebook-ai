    "This course is really great! There aren't too many intellectual history courses at Yale (I know that I had never taken one before), so I think that I, along with several of my classmates, were caught off guard. That being said, it was taught very well. The reading is very manageable (100 pages\/week or so) and usually quite interesting. 1 midterm paper (7-10 pages) and 1 final paper (20 pages). No weekly reading responses, which is really nice. That being said, you still have to do the readings because the course is small and its already hard enough to pick up on what you are supposed to pick up on that if you don't do the readings, its even more awkward. Prof. Dean is a pretty lenient grader, and always incredibly helpful at office hours if you go to discuss a paper you are working on.",
    "A great class that explores human rights as a concept in an intimate classroom setting. Tough material, but worth it. You will not be overwhelmed by the amount, just be ready to have to put in a good deal of effort. It's totally worth it.",
    "Amazing. Must take for anyone interested in western intellectual history, ethics, political philosophy, human rights, ER&M, etc. YES. Great professor. Great topic. Just great.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! As a history major who has taken many history seminars i would recommend it as being very different than previous classes i have taken--much more of a cultural history class which i loved.",
    "If you are interested in human rights, or if you just want to take an interesting class - take this one! Not a lot of work, but something that is engaging."
