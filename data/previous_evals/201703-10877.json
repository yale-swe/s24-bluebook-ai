    "I learned basic macroeconomics. The AS\/AD model and its limitations. I learned how to think about the macroeconomic news we read about on a daily basis.",
    "Basic macroeconomic course knowledge, current econ events",
    "I learned a lot more about the real world economy than i had expected, and the theories we learned were all very applicable.",
    "Pretty standard intro macro course. How the economy works and stuff.",
    "I learned how to apply macroeconomic theory to everyday life. I really learned about how all these concepts are extremely related to one another and I enjoyed the class overall!",
    "I learned very little from this class.The content was not particularly difficult, but the course structure and lectures were not conducive to learning at all.",
    "This is a great course to gain an understanding of the macroeconomy and learn things like the Fed, the interest rate, exchange rates, etc., things you hear everyday but might not really understand before the course.",
    "Learned Macro trends which is actually kinda interesting and glad I have some know-how now.",
    "Basic understandings of the macro economy, namely how unemployment, inflation, and production are regulated and interact.",
    "You'll learn to analyze market effects. Very simplified economic model, really interesting class. Not math intensive, a bit arbitrary.",
    "Learnt a lot not just about macroeconomics but about how it has influenced politics of the 20th century and today - while the syllabus was rather dry, Professor Fair really got the students to engage with concepts - we all had to present on a piece of macroeconomic news in lecture at one point in the semester and it was very interesting.",
    "Basic (and then some) knowledge of how the macro economy works (interest rates, exchange rates, etc.)",
    "Broad Macroeconomic view of the US and the world.",
    "If you ask me something specific,to be honest, I couldn't reply back with anything. You learn some specific stuff for the pset and then you forget. There are some overarching themes that you do recognize but may not be able to explain that well. I think it's this way because you teach yourself. The actual class does not help in the course. If I were to take this class again, based on how it was taught, it would serve me best to just read the book outside of class during class hours. that's a better use of your time. it's kinda harsh but honestly that's what a lot of people think.",
    "Knowledge about american macroeconomic models Working within the U.S. model",
    "This course engaged me with the world in an economic context to an unprecedented degree. I am grateful to it for teaching me a lot about economics that are tangible in almost every aspect of our lives. I have learned how to analyze economic policy and understand the foundations of both our economic decisions and our financial institutions.",
    "very relevant to real world and intuitive information. learned how to understand basic economic language and processes",
    "This course taught me valuable content about Macroeconomics. Even if it's only an Introductory course, I thought the material was abundant and gave me a better grasp of world economies.",
    "I learned how to evaluate and discuss the macroeconomy. The textbook gave a pretty solid foundation for understanding how households, firms, governments, and other entities interact.",
    "I learned how to think differently about the economy, i.e. in terms of macroeconomic view instead of the microeconomic view which I had learned the semester before. However, I do not feel like I fully gripped the subject.",
    "Basic survey of macroeconomic models and policy.",
    "I learned basic macroeconomic theory, as well as maintaining apprised of current events concerning the macroeconomy. Attained a good understanding of the basic AS\/AD model and how certain changes in the economy create shifts. Understood flow of money through the economy and how an increase or decrease in one sector affects the others, as well as inter-country spending. Overall a good overview of macroeconomics.",
    "I learned to follow the real world around me in economic terms. The news became much more meaningful to me.",
    "I gained a broad overview of macroeconomic principals. This course was good at providing a conceptual understanding of economic functions through evaluations of models.",
    "Got a better grasp on domestic and global economy; knowledge was very applicable to everyday phenomena",
    "Knowledge of the open market, how changes in the market effect the macroeconomy.",
    "General ideas and skills in macroeconomics.",
    "Basic concepts of macroeconomics",
    "I got an understanding of how the United states economy works. I learned the mechanisms and economic intuitions that allow for modeling and predictions and overall being more informed.",
    "I gained an general understanding of the world economy and how changes in one country can affect other countries around the world.",
    "I learned how to interpret macroeconomic data and see how it effects the economy.",
    "I gained knowledge about how the U.S. economy works in general and how it is extremely complex to accurately predict what happens in the future. Learning about the marcoeconomy taught me to be more critically thinking about the consequences of my actions and how they can set off a snowball effect just like how a change in fiscal or monetary policy can start a chain reaction.",
    "Critical reasoning. Fast writing. Being able to study material that I'm not particularly interested in with a high level of attention.",
    "A reasonably strong understanding of basic macroeconomics. An appreciation of the relevance of macroeconomics to everyday life.",
    "This calsses explains the basics behind the institutions and intuitions of the global economic system, with a focus on the AS\/AD curve and multiplier model.",
    "An understanding of the effects of monetary and fiscal policy on the macroeconomy, as well as the general factors that affect it like consumption patterns, investment, the stock market, etc.",
    "A broad overview of macroeconomic topics.",
    "I developed a decent foundational understanding of the US model of economics including fiscal and monetary policy as well as a very fundamental understanding of international economics and exchange rates.",
    "Intro Macro",
    "Learned a lot about why things like poverty and unemployment exist. Material that definitely opened my eyes to a new part of the world. Still, the class is taught horrifically. I have never attended a lecture so vapid and lazily thrown together. Practice tests aren't given with the answers!!!!!! WTHH!!!!!!!!! Just read the textbook during class.",
    "I learned a great deal about how national and international economies work and interact with each other. In addition, I learned how people's confidence affects the markets and how the markets impact the overall economy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof. Fair is not a particularly riveting lecturer, so the class could be improved by encouraging students to be more engaged.",
    "Strengths: Professor knowledge, section organization Weaknesses: Pace",
    "I like that there was more focus on understanding the theories than understanding the math that they involve, but i think the course flowed a bit awkwardly and would've liked tit to be a bit more concise and clear.",
    "Ray Fair is a lovely man but he CANNOT teach. I feel so bad about saying it but his lecture notes are an abomination and I have a tendency to fall asleep because he is definitely BRILLIANT but he's just not very ... energetic?",
    "I thought the sections were very helpful, I think lecture slides\/notes could be a bit more detailed, it was difficult to study from them -- but that was alleviated through the fact that Prof Fair wrote the course textbook which provides extremely detailed insight that helps understand the course material very well. His practice midterms and practice final were also very helpful to help prepare for the exams",
    "My teaching fellow (Marnix) was amazing. I did not enjoy the professor's style of teaching and fond that it was very hard to be engaged during class.",
    "This course has great TAs who answer all your questions but unfortunately, lecture did not help me learn the material much. I felt that the slides were just talking points, rather than a comprehensive presentation of the material. The textbook really helped in this matter.",
    "I had a really hard time connecting with the lecturer and digesting what he was saying. I heard words, and could write them, but something was just not clicking with me, and I ended up learning all my information from the text book and my TA. I think a strength though is the cold-calling with the news stories! I have never been so engaged in the news before so that was cool.",
    "There is pretty much zero engagement here, you're on your own",
    "Strengths: textbook follows course well and Ray Fair is a distinguished economist, fun to learn from. Weaknesses: class can sometimes be dry, and the lecture notes are somewhat indecipherable without context.",
    "Professor Fair makes it very interesting by getting students to engage with current affairs from a macro viewpoint, but he is sometimes unclear over what material we are actually responsible for - a midterm question asked us why the 1970s saw unemployment, another why the Fed started buying mortgage-backed securities in 2008...a lot of intuition (and prior knowledge) involved that led to a very low average - but it's curved so not really a problem.",
    "Excellent course with an excellent instructor, TA's and very relevant info.",
    "The professor is too monotonous. Nothing of what he says sticks with you. Due to this, it's a waste of time to go to class. Or at least it feels that way. Marnix, the TA, on the other hand, did a great job during section. I can't emphasis enough how much better he taught the material. he really broke stuff down and engaged with the students. Professor Fair might as well have been reading out of his text book word for word...that's not useful.",
    "Strengths: - You would get the most out of the class if you are able to pay attention in the lecture but readings are essential Weaknesses: - Hard to engage in class - Student motivation is low",
    "This course is ultimately burdened only by the broad, idealized nature of the material. As it is an intro course, one can only expect so much from it and the method presentation can only do so much; however, the material is interesting and all the instructors are clearly very knowledgeable.",
    "This class is extremely unorganized. The basics are not emphasized before moving on to other material and this leads to huge gaps in our education.",
    "strength is psets being completion because it encourages students to try to understand and work out a problem on their own instead of trying to find the right answer when doing homework could be improved better notes on power points because some stuff was hard to read",
    "The Professor and TA's were super responsive to questions both in class\/section and over email to clear up any confusion on a topic, and there was ample review for both the final and the midterm. Some of the lectures were hard to follow and the notes posted didn't explain concepts as much as they gave the Professor talking points in class.",
    "The strengths are that you learn a decent amount about macro, that the course isn't difficult, and that you get an econ requirement out of the way. Also, you really don't need to go to lecture. The main weakness of the course is that Prof. Fair, as smart as he is, is horribly boring and ineffective as a teacher. I am interested in economics and would have gone to every lecture if I thought I needed to. As the semester progressed, it became clear that the hour and a quarter block occupied by Econ 116 would be better used napping, eating, clocking work hours, studying for other classes, or just relaxing. Yale needs to do something about this problem.",
    "The strengths of this course were the textbook, which explained most of the topics very well. This was necessary, because the subjects were not taught very well during lecture. It would also be useful to improve slides, so that it is easier to follow as a student, who has never engaged in macroeconomics before.",
    "The problem sets were helpful in understanding the material. Section was often very clear and provided a great deal of help with the problem sets. The textbook was very digestable and well-written. However, lecture was a complete waste of time. It was disorganized and ver very dry. I often left lecture feeling less comfortable with the material than when I entered, so for the second half of the semester I didn't even go. And I was not alone. During exams it was amazing to see how many people actually took the class because once their name had been called to report your economic news one time, people just stopped coming, except to drop off their problem sets once a week.",
    "The lectures could certainly be made to be more engaging. The slides also contained very little useful information, or if there was information, it was not clearly labelled and thus difficult to understand outside of the lecture setting. I think the class would benefit immensely from more explanatory and well-planned slides with pertinent information. The PSets were helpful however, in reviewing and attempting to understand confusing material.",
    "Lectures were not very helpful in understanding course material.",
    "Having to bring in the news was great, although I wish it were for a grade, so that the course would be more thoroughly engaging.",
    "I enjoyed the order in which material was introduced and howProfessor Fair related the concepts to real world issues through the review of news stories. I think that the lecture slides could have been clearer.",
    "Lectures & slides should be improved! I struggled to understand the uploaded pdf files, especially later when I had to match them with my notes. PowerPoint slides or another presentation method would be better. The book is really helpful and the problem sets are good.",
    "The course is taught very poorly. The pedagogy is so painful that people don't show up to class but instead read the book. It's truly a shame to have such lackluster teaching at such a fine university.",
    "I love how we discussed real world situations and examples. So a strength was the sharing of current events during lectures. A weakness would be that the lecture slides were not very helpful.",
    "The assistance from the TA's was far below par, they declined to answer questions, and gave false information about the final exam time and date",
    "Class of very current. I like he incorporates real time events into the class lesson.",
    "Ray Fair is a great economist but does not belong at Yale University. He is a disappointment to such high-quality students.",
    "Lectures are boring, no one goes. Ray Fair isnt a great lecturer.",
    "The strength of this course was definitely my TF Marnix. He was very knowledgeable and brought new insight to every section. I really enjoyed going to section to learn more about the material to learn in class and to receive a comprehensive review of the in class lecture. The weakness of the course may be the way the lectures were organized. I had difficulty keeping up with the slides and going back to the slides for reference because they were really brief. I ended up having to rely on the textbook for help on problem sets and for studying.",
    "Professor Fair is extremely knowledgeable and a very interesting person, but his lecture is also very boring. His style is low energy and attendance\/engagement was often low (I'm not sure which direction the causality goes). I had a really excellent TF, but there seemed to be significant variation in their quality. The textbook was co-written by Professor Fair which helps, but there is also no good way of checking the answers to the practice problems. There is a course administrator which I'm not sure I love because it seems to increase confusion about division of labor re: content and grading policy.",
    "This class cold be improved by focusing more on real-world examples of economic theory, and a broader focus on more ways to look at the macroeconomic system rather than focusing solely on one or two models of the system.",
    "I definitely learned a lot from this course, so material-wise there isn't much improvement I can think of. However, the reason I was able to learn was because I put in the time to read the textbook and go to section; lectures were confusing and disorganized, and really difficult to grasp if you had no prior knowledge of the material. I would say this course needs MUCH more well-organized lectures (real power points\/ lecture notes would be a great starting place).",
    "Class was large - Ray made it engaging. Aso, very attuned to current events.",
    "The gradin was very unclear on the midterm. The lectures were monotone and hard to follow.",
    "The lecture for this class was only moderately helpful and I found the majority of my learning came from section, which is definitely a strength.",
    "There are no surprises really, but it's hard to stay engaged.",
    "There was no teaching done in this course. I learned NOTHING in lectures. Lecture slides were three pages of sparse scribbles on the professor's part and he'd mutter random things to fill up time and that was lecture. What a waste of time. Don't go to lecture and just read the textbook or read it during class. The textbook is a fantastic teaching tool. Section is also essential because you'll end up learning a lot of material there, too.",
    "I think having the final worth 50% makes the weeks leading up to it seem less significant, so it would be better to put more weight on the midterm to balance out the course. I thought section was really worthwhile which was great."

   "comments": [
    "If you're taking this course, it's probably a requirement for you. And I wouldn't say it's so awful you should avoid it with everything you have, but some advice - Professor Fair is incredibly smart, impressive, and kind. He cannot teach however. Skip lecture but read the book religiously -- it actually makes sense. If you have a choice, Marnix is exacting\/abrupt\/not super forgiving, but he is by far the best TA esp compared to Antoine who is lovely but not very organized about his sections or good at explaining things.",
    "If you would like to learn about the economy, I would definitely recommend this class",
    "If you are interested in macroeconomics, go ahead and take it. You have to do the reading on your own to fully appreciate it because lectures are not great.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, because i genuinely feel more well versed in terms of my ability to understand what is happening in our economy and to the economies of other countries in present day.",
    "yes",
    "Probably take it on cycle, unless if you really care about your grade that much, in which case the curve is prob slightly better in the fall yea",
    "Definitely if you're thinking of becoming an econ major it's a requirement, but if you're just looking for a SS credit, this course is great because it provides useful insight for how the macroeconomy is run -- that said this course if much more conceptually challenging and based on understanding over all concepts vs microecon which was based more on math",
    "If you are self-starting and willing to largely teach yourself these concepts, you can do fine. The grading curve isn't too bad, and the textbook is helpful. However, the lectures were not engaging; this was one of the worst courses I've taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to learn about the economy but does not have the motivation to learn it him or herself.",
    "I don't think I would, or at least not in the way I took it. I really enjoyed the subject matter, and now that I'm past it I like that I've taken it. But the process was not necessarily enjoyable and I feel like there are better ways to learn this knowledge.",
    "I mean you gain a solid understanding of financial markets, and is especially helpful if you don't have an econ background. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine, lecture was terribly boring though and completely useless",
    "Yes, a requisite for informed individuals. P-sets are very straightforward and the tests aren't too tough.",
    "Good course - made Econ pretty interesting, psets are check and check- (never heard of a check- being given) so it's not a course that stresses you out from week to week, and the TFs provide good input for the exams.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Definitely would recommend this to anyone.",
    "I would recommend it because I think that the material is of great importance. However, I would suggest that reading the textbook is a priority. Go to class only if you want to have an overarching sense of where the class is in terms of the pset. Definitely go to section, those are always useful.",
    "- I would recommend it only because it is a requirement.",
    "I would recommend this course, either as a requirement (in which case taking it is necessary), or simply because it is useful as means of gaining a basic understand of economics and how they manifest in the world around us.",
    "yes it is helpful stuff to know in the real world",
    "Yes I would recommend the course, interesting stuff that was fun to learn",
    "Yes, if you are willing to put in the time to go to lecture and pay attention",
    "Yes, because it is easy, doesn't require a major commitment in terms of time or workload, and fulfills a departmental requirement. Just be prepared for a boring series of lectures.",
    "As this is an introductory course, and prerequisite for a lot of majors and following courses, students will find no way around taking this course. However, if there is any way to not take this course, I would advise that. Or, be aware that it will be a lot of independent learning.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. However, if you are truly interested in econ, but not an econ major, this class will likely disappoint you.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in economics, solely because it is helpful in getting an overview of how the economy works. However, I would not rank it highly among the courses offered by Yale College.",
    "I would recommend it as a way to understand the economic trends that are so often talked about in so many different fields. It is an incredibly important course.",
    "I would recommend this course because it good at establishing a foundation of basic macroeconomics and it did so in a way that was not overwhelming or stressful",
    "Take it if you have to, read the book. Wouldnt recommend for fun; Prof. Fair is nice but quite dry.",
    "I would not, the prefer is frankly pretty hard to follow if you dont share the professors highly analytical form of teaching. Would probably recommend taking it with someone else.",
    "Only if you need to fulfill the major.",
    "I would recommend this course because it focuses on real world analysis.",
    "Yes if you are interested in learning macroeconomics.",
    "Amazing material, and without the wonderful TA's, the course would have been a total flop. Ray Fair must never teach introductory macroeconomics again.",
    "Nah",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about the macroeconomy. The professor is highly respected in his field of work and extremely knowledgeable. If you do take this class, consider going to office hours and learning as much as you can from the TF's and professor.",
    "I think it's a very manageable version of introductory macroeconomics.",
    "I would recommend this class to students studying economics, and anyone interested in understanding how the macroeconomy works.",
    "Unless macroeconomics is something you're super interested in or you have to take this as a prerequisite, I would not recommend this class. You will definitely learn a lot, but only if you put in the effort to do that learning outside of class (in section or through the textbook).",
    "Of course you should take Intro macro if you are looking to have a basic understanding of how markets work, but if you have no background in econ from high school I do not recommend taking the class with Ray Fair.",
    "No, not unless you have to, and in that case take it in the fall. The curve helps less but the material is a lot clearer and it ends up being easier.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who wants a basic understanding of macroeconomic principles.",
    "Only take if it is a requirement for you.",
    "Take this course for the material, but with the understanding that you will be reading the textbook on your own time and teaching yourself the course. The teaching from the professor is nonexistent. It may be helpful to go over problem sets with TAs though. Section and office hours were very helpful for material.",
    "I think this class gave me a good baseline understanding of macroeconomics. I really got a lot out of weekly section and now have a genuine interest in the activities of the Fed."
