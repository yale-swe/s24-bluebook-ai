    "There were more than enough resources available.",
    "Most resources necessary were made available to the students, including readings, case studies and supplemental materials. Access to instructors was also great. Feedback on homework assignments was the only area in which students' benefits were greatly lacking.",
    "all were adequate.",
    "The library is entirely inadequate for its collection and for its policies (especially that students are only allowed to borrow one book at a time for one day). This was not an impediment for this course, but it should be an absolute embarrassment for the school. Otherwise, everything was beyond satisfactory.",
    "Resources were adequate.",
    "The resources were adequate.",
    "Yes.",
    "yes.",
    "I felt that the resources for this course in particular were less than adequate. Though the array of software for studio is dauntingly complete, I would have appreciated the project management software (Microsoft Project, etc) to be installed on all computers and some instruction with what is available in this respect.",
    "the resources made available to us by phil and his team were more than adequate for us to carry out our assignments and to understand the course material. howeever may i point out that the course readers should be available electronically (through v2 or otherwise) rather than being obtainable only from the printers located substantially far away from the school premises.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, the classroom and resources were certainly adequate. The format set up on the Class v2 server worked well for postings and homework submissions."
