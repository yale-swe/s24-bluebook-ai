   "comments": [
    "Well for people who are not great at math - are looking at linear algebra and all for the first time, it is really tough to take in all of that and apply it to econometrics. I would have loved it I was given a list of topics I need to thorough with before joining the program so that I could be well-equipped and not struggle at this point. So I would recommend that the future students are either made to take a mandatory class before the program starts or at least be given a list to say that better be aware of these topics beforehand.",
    "The class was overall enjoyable, but I wish we were able to take our time with the matrix stuff. It kind of came out of nowhere and felt rushed.",
    "The parts taught towards the end were a bit rushed.",
    "It is very math heavy, and what we learn in class is not necessarily tested in exams.",
    "Very challenging, some foundational stuff got missed (e.g. how to work through sigma notation). Could use more prep in the summer, additional resources to see before coming into it. Ran out of time in the course, which was stressful.",
    "Good for building a foundation for understanding regressions but a lot of material on probability, statistics and matrix algebra were redundant from undergrad."

    "No. I would rather take an undergraduate advanced econometrics class. This class is purely theoretical.",
    "Very, very challenging. Hard to see where it was going and how some of this can be applied, given the depth and level of complexity of the material. But the first half of a full year course, so I'm sure it will be fine.",
    "No unless need econometrics for advanced classes or future career"
