    "Although the course was very intensive, I think that the abundant assignments and checks for understanding helped me learn the language quickly and more thoroughly. The assignments force us to learn - and they're also pretty fun. I always felt very engaged in the course. However, one of the minor issues I had involved the audio examination; I think that better preparation is necessary within the classroom to prepare for the exam.",
    "Overall great course, I wouldn't change anything.",
    "I did not enjoy doing the prepared sketches and take-home group presentation activities. I would have preferred more structured, in-class discussion that more resembled natural conversation.",
    "not a lot of focus on speaking skills and development nor was there much focus on vocab both of which seem like they would be very helpful in learning the language.",
    "I love the fact that we meet very regularly, as this is good for corrections and practice. I also found the workload to be mostly reasonable. My largest critique is the attendance policies. 5 classes is less than 5% of the class time. To heavily penalize students for absences which are often out of their control (club sports, illness, etc) seems a bit much, especially when there is no other option. It is important to be in class every day, but perhaps if there was another option for unavoidable circumstances, that would be kinder. For example, if a student could make up class in a different section, or via additional assignments. One other critique is that, because we are immersed in the dialect of one Professor, sometimes the auditive exams felt more fair than other times. For example, our professor did not speak the same dialect as my professor last semester. When it came time to take auditory exams, there was greater difficulty in perceiving the words than I expected. It would be nice if, over the course of the semester, we heard from several people (professors, guests, or otherwise) in order to allow us to practice comprehension of multiple dialects."

    "I would definitely recommend SPAN 120 to another student, especially if they have a background in Spanish and are looking to relearn the basics. It covers every foundation quite well and provides so much cultural context! It is the perfect precursor for studying abroad in a Spanish-speaking country, and a must for any hopeful Spanish speaker.",
    "Yes! Easy language requirement compared to some other departments, but you definitely get a good grasp of a very useful language.",
    "This class has a ton of busy work with less of the enjoyable conversational parts of L1.",
    "Yes. It was a lot of work but I learned so much.",
    "sorta cause its necessary and not terrible but engagement isn't the best and the work load is kinda sporadic.",
    "I'd recommend this course if you want to learn Spanish and need a language credit, otherwise there is really no point.",
    "Yes.... But only if you love languages or have to for the requirement. It's fun, but the workload definitely put pressure on my success in other courses."
