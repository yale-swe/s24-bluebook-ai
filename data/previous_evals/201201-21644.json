    "Take it if you're good at studying on your own.",
    "If you're interested in behavioral neuroscience research, unless this course is changed from when I took it, it will not give you a decent overview of what the field is all about. It focuses on neuroanatomy for a couple of weeks, which is the only part I found helpful and well done, and then switches to electrophysiology for the rest of the semester. As a hopeful neuroscientist who dislikes electrophysiology, I found it frustrating to be focusing on this for so long when I was hoping to finally take away practical techniques from a psyc course (all the others tend to be theoretical). I found this class challenging as I had to teach myself what I would be tested on and what I had to write my papers on; lecture was not useful for the majority of the course so be prepared to put in a lot of extra hours unless electrical signaling comes easily to you. That said, Prof. Donegan is very nice and approachable if you ever have questions. It's just a matter of: are you interested in the material that is presented in this course? and are you ready to teach most of it to yourself?",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in neuroscience research. I learned a great deal, and the lab experience is incredibly valuable. The workload can be intense at times, but you get as much out of it as you put into it. The papers you write for this course will be great practice for papers that you will write if you ever go on to work in a lab. Taking this class was a very rewarding experience.",
    "Much better than last years reviews made it seem. It seems the professor took the suggestions to heart. There was more materials and equipment to do work with, which made the class much more hands-on and fun. If you're interested in Behavioral Neuro, it is definitely worth it. If you think Behavioral Neuro is an interesting topic to study, this may not be your course. It's a research methods OF behavioral neuro course, not a behavioral neuro course.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you have to take it. Friday labs with long-winded lectures are difficult.",
    "I mean, you're taking it because you need it for Psych, aren't you?"
