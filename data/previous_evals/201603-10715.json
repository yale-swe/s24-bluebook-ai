   "comments": [
    "The most influential skill I developed from taking this course was how to write a college level essay. Many aspects of college writing, from structure to syntax to close analysis, differs highly from high school level writing, and this was a wonderful course to explain and refine those necessary skills. I now feel comfortable taking any english class at Yale, as I feel I have the necessary background skills in writing that will enable me to succeed. I also was able to hone my analysis skills in this course in the complex yet highly interesting stories we read.",
    "I learned how to express myself more clearly through writing. I learned how to structure an argument, especially in my introduction paragraph. I learned how to enter into an ongoing conversation, utilize scholars and put them in conversation with each other.",
    "My writing skills definitely improved throughout the semester, as did my ability to articulate ideas in discussion.",
    "I feel somewhat pressured to make sure all my grammar and punctuation is correct in this evaluation. I believe that through this course, I have been able to significantly develop my writing by practicing concision, clarity, and continuity in my essays. Personally, I have a tendency of writing long-winded and complicated sentences; this class taught me to articulate my thoughts in a more precise manner, as well as in a more professional tone. In addition to this, I have also developed my close reading skills; by analyzing texts through the various suggested lenses, I have gained more insight on how to read and interpret different types of literature, regardless of whether people consider it as \"good\" or \"bad.\"",
    "This amazing course taught me countless valuable skills, which I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Among these were how to develop a forceful argument, how to close-read a text, how to best structure a paper, how to discuss other academic conclusions in my papers, how to actively participate in a seminar classroom environment, and an infinite number of other lessons. These skills were particularly beneficial because I was a first-semester freshman, still adapting to college classes and college writing. I am so grateful to have taken this class. Additionally, I learned an enormous amount related to this course's topic, \"Good Literature\". With help from Professor Wepler and the rest of my class, I discovered what I believe makes good literature so 'good'. The idea of literary greatness occupied my mind constantly throughout the entire semester (and it still fascinates me just as much). I have always loved literature, but this course added fuel to that fire in a way that no other class had previously. English 115: Good Literature cemented in me a passion for great literary works. I am forever grateful for that, too.",
    "after taking this class, I became more confident in my ability to develop better-structured paragraphs and compose clearer, conciser sentences while writing essays. It also made me a fast thinker because coming up with theses were for some reason more challenging for this class and I became better and better at it gradually.",
    "I learned how to write a college-worthy essay and unlearned some of the things I was taught in high school such as the five-paragraph essay. I also learned how to construct an introduciton"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There is very little I would recommend to improve this course. I love its structure - 4 different essays with various focuses as well as numerous short stories, a few novels, and many critical essays discussing what makes a piece of literature \"good.\" The classroom setup was also very favorable, as a small amount of people in a seminar style class facilitated easy learning and sharing of ideas. All in all, I do wish we spent a little more time deeply exploring and analyzing the pieces of literature we read, yet I do understand that not everything can be analyzed so closely in a limited time frame.",
    "I thought that the subject of the course was wonderful; there are enough facets to the question of literary quality that I did not run out of ideas to explore.",
    "Generally speaking, the course was very well structured. I was very engaged in the class and the topics we talked about. I think the course did a particularly good job at exposing me to different types of literature and literary debate. Through this, I was able to further develop my interpretations and writing skills. I think towards the latter half of the course, \"Style\" got a little lost as we focused more on reading the books. This can be easily remedied by incorporating it into one of the assignments.",
    "I cannot think of a single weakness this course might possess. On the other hand, every one of this course's qualities is a strength. Professor Wepler is brilliant, well-spoken, hilarious, patient, and kind. The workload is both rigorous and reasonable, and the texts we read in class - from novels to poems to articles - are always deeply engaging works. Our class discussions were lively and productive, and I always left class feeling like I'd discovered something extraordinary in literature - something that would make my life much richer.",
    "I think this course is fine if you're interested in literature but I think it is more challenging than the other intro writing classes. There's a lot to read and on top of that students are required to provide responses about the readings before each class which seems easy at first but becomes harder to keep up with especially during midterm and final periods.",
    "One strength of the class was the it was small, so we were able to have in depth discussions each class. It was also very focused on the students and tailored to teaching freshman how to write. It went at a great pace and the material was always engaging"

    "I would highly recommend this course to any Yale student. Whether a prospective English major or a student just trying to fulfill a writing credit, this was a truly enjoyable course with a very brilliant and engaging professor. Not only was the course material interesting, but the discussions were stimulating and the workload was very easily manageable. I truly enjoyed taking this course, especially because of Professor Wepler, and I would strongly urge as many students as possible to take it as well.",
    "ENGL 115 was a great introduction to English courses at Yale. I learned how to write an effective, clear essay. As this was a literature seminar, we read more fiction. This was definitely a strength for me as I enjoy fiction and reading works in the western canon.",
    "Yes. Professor Wepler always made the classroom an engaging, informative and even fun space. I learned a lot of skills that I foresee myself taking into my classes and my writing in general in the future.",
    "I would recommend this class! I generally do not like english classes as much as other humanities, but I really enjoyed this one and loved the chemistry my class had. Everyone easily expressed their thoughts and felt heard.",
    "I would absolutely, 100% recommend this course to another student. This course not only develops your writing skills (as it can be used as a WR credit), but also your close reading skills, which I think are just as important. The course was thoroughly enjoyable, but then again, if you don't like to read, don't take this course. A lot of what you gain from this course relies on your personal commitment to reading everything and articulating your opinions. Then again, Prof. Welper is amazing and he keeps things interesting and fun throughout the semester.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student without a moment of hesitation. Professor Wepler is the greatest instructor you could ask for, and he is also a truly good man. You'll read important, beautiful, fascinating works. You'll have captivating class discussions. You'll learn to write more clearly, your essays will be better organized, and your theses will be much more compelling. For the rest of my time at Yale and afterward, I will vehemently recommend Professor Wepler and his classes. This course will make you a better reader and writer. If you get the chance to take it, please seize the opportunity. You will be so glad you did.",
    "I recommend this class only if you're really interested in reading and frankly enjoy analyzing literary pieces.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any freshman. It is a fantastic way to learn how to write in a college setting"
