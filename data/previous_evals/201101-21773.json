    "Take the course. Great senior seminar.",
    "Yes, it was a very fun economics class.",
    "Melinda Miller is a visiting prof from the naval academy so she's not that familiar with yale policies, but is very nice and helpful. Only criticism is that we have no idea how we're doing in the class throughout the semester.",
    "One of the few classes on natives at Yale. It's sad mElinda won't be here to carry it on",
    "take it!",
    "Professor Miller was a great guest professor. She was extremely knowlegable in her field and made each class interesting and enjoyable. The work load was manageable and the seminar format was well-suited for the topic. I had no prior interest in this field but ended up being really glad I took the class and learned a lot about american history!",
    "Great class with great readings (but a lot of people don't do the reading).",
    "I would highly recommend Econ 470. Take this class. It is interesting and you learn a lot about a topic that is not very popular at Yale."
