She has a particular gift of offering criticisms in ways that build up, but she also doesn't hold back. She knows it's too important. I always found her observations, both of my sermons and the others', absolutely spot-on.",

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - great feedback, encouraged respectful but truthful class discussion, very considerate of students, obviously very knowledgeable about the subject matter. Weaknesses - none, truly",
    "Pastor Jones was an incredible practicum instructor. Please see my comments above regarding him.",
    "Hopie did a great job. I was always impressed with her insight and wisdom. I am thankful I had the chance to be in her section.",
    "She was so organized and so encouraging. Just an overall lovely person. She also challenged us though. She did a fantastic job creating an environment of love.",
    "Shelly was very direct. I appreciated her frank feedback.",
    "She is incredibly passionate about preaching, and so genuinely caring when it comes to finding ways to make sure her students find their voice. I am so grateful for Professor Tisdale. She helped me find my voice, and I can't wait to preach more, and I was dreading taking preaching.",
    "When I was debating whether or not to take this course this semester, I told myself that if I were not placed in Hopie's section, I would not take the course. I am thus very glad that I did get placed in her section because she is an outstanding teacher of preaching. When she is at her best, she brings a unique combination of passion and insight to both the pulpit and to her students of preaching that inspires us to preach at our best. She also has a way of bringing our best out when we are in the pulpit with a few simple, encouraging and also sometimes convicting words. When she is not at her best, however, she is lacking in energy. This lack brings the rest of the section down with her, and this term, there were many days during which she did not bring her familiar energy to section. I believe this is so simply because she splits her time in so many different directions that she has little, if any, time to care for herself. There were several sections during which she clearly had not slept very much, if at all, the previous night, and there were even a few sections during which she had to either cancel or as for a substitute instructor because she was feeling too unhealthy to come to section. This problem is easily remedied, but I do believe that it needs to be addressed and fixed soon, for her own good as well as the good of others.",
    "I was overjoyed to be in Tim Jones's section. He pushed us all respectfully and engaged with our preaching styles with respect to our traditions and personalities. I can see the ways I grew a lot under his and my section's guidance and through our conversations throughout the semester.",
    "Great evaluation. She dug deep - she didn't only give surface remarks. That helped us grow.",
    "Professor Randall was very committed to the growth of her section members, treating each week as an opportunity and each session as a sacred one.",
    "Our section led by Hopie was probably the saving grace of this course for me. Hopie was easily able to create an atmosphere of trust and respect in our section, allowing our group to frankly and honestly congratulate and critique one another when needed. I am incredibly grateful to her for making the class worthwhile.",
    "Nora is so warm and welcoming. She really fostered an open environment. The only note I have is that I often felt that she assumed everyone knew the Bible (or preaching technology\/terms) as much as she did. Since this is a class required of all m.divs and not all of us are going to be pastors (or some from different traditions) it would be helpful to assume that not everyone is as well versed in Biblical and preaching tradition. One particular example of this was in our section when we were asked to preach off-the-cuff. It was nerve-wracking to try and find a scripture passage.",
    "I absolutely loved having Hopie as my instructor. I was very excited to learn that she would be my section leader. I loved that she had us write down are feedback for each student. I think it led to really fruitful feedback and engagement with one another. I also appreciate her clear energy, passion, and love of preaching and her students. I think that she made each and every one of us feel valued, encouraged, and also challenged. I felt honored to be able to get to know her better and learn from her style of preaching, story telling, and preparation processes, and engagement with her listeners. My only feedback for Hopie is that it would have been really amazing to get feedback on the assignments that were due every Tuesday. She clearly puts a lot of effort into the feedback that she provided for our larger assignments and sermons. I really appreciated this and will hold onto her feedback. I just wish I could have received some of her wisdom concerning those assignments as well (even if the feedback was not as in depth!)",
    "She gives very detailed comments and strikes a great balance between affirmations and constructive feedback. Her enthusiasm for the subject matter is contagious."
