    "Good overview of Biotechnology methods. Lots of overlap with previous lower-level MCDB courses, so lots of review.Weekly journal meetings + responses; quizzes each Wednesday, and a midterm + final. Work-wise, it isn't killer, especially considering that the material is genuinely interesting and up-to-date.Mostly senior pre-med MCDB-types, with a few grad students mixed in here and there.Would recommend the course to all MCDBs looking for an upper-level bio to fulfill - this one is probably one of the more interesting, socially relevant ones out of all of them. The only good lecturer is Wolenski. Nelson can be dry. Deng is incredibly difficult to understand. And Isaacs rehashes a lot of a) lower-level bio material and b) material that was already covered in the class by one of the other 3 lecturers.",
    "MCDB370 is a useful course to take if you're going into the sciences\/research. They cover a lot of emerging methods in science which i hadn't really understood until this class. Overall, the lecturers are pretty good, especially Dr. Nelson. That said, it's a lot of work: weekly quizzes, 1-2 papers to read every week which you have to write up a 1 page summary about. One midterm and one noncumulative final. Take it if you're interested in it. What you get out of the class depends on how much time you devote to it.",
    "I liked it a lot. The level of detail was perfect; we learned enough to become well-versed in every topic without the amount of information being overwhelming. Very interesting subject matter, and the guest speakers were all amazing and interesting.",
    "Yes, take this class. However, this class is very time consuming. It's literally Cell Biology on steroids.",
    "One of the best upper level MCDB classes. Really covers topics in biotechnology well and gets you thinking about the subject. Interesting guest lecturers from biotech companies are also great. Workload not too much, a reading response and a quiz every week plus midterm and final.",
    "A must take biology class.",
    "great senior class, and good survey of current state of biotechnology. ties everything together",
    "This year, the course seemed to be very different from previous years (at least from what I've heard and from the reviews I've read). The old course used to be 3 noncumulative exams, which were supposed to be very reasonable. However, this year, the increase in workload was surprising, almost unreasonable. There were two noncumulative exams (one during finals week), weekly 10-minute quizzes, and weekly 1-pg literature reviews on about a 6-page scientific article. It might not sound like much, but it takes a few hours to read an article and really understand the figures, and an hour or two more to write a good review, not the mention that section attendance was also mandatory. However, I will admit that I am much much better at teasing through primary literature, in that I am more familiar with how they are set up, the style of writing, and also many of the important topics that are up-and-coming. It was not the nicest thing to have multiple professors, since they each had a different style and you never really knew how detailed they the questions they were going to ask on the quizzes or exams would be. Nelson and Isaacs were the clearest, in explaining the material, but Nelson was more fair in the questions he would ask about his material. Deng was also clear and fair in his material. Wolenski was always way too ambitious, covering too much, and too difficult material, asking us to learn all of it, and finally sneaking in the precise question he was going to ask, during a review session. So if you missed that review session you were screwed. Strengths: Nelson, guest lectures (they really give you a glimpse into the peronsality of the field and industry of biotech), reading primary literature, onlyhaving 2 noncumulative tests (split into a fair amount of material for each). Weakness: extremely varyng expectations depending on the professor (and even depending on the TA, for the review responses and section participation), too much work than is necessary to get a lot out of the class. Also, Isaacs material overlapped in a weird way with the stuff we started with in the semester. The order of lectures was not the ideal.",
    "Yes",
    "This was a great overview of current biotechnology advances.",
    "I took this class as a senior requirement for the MCDB major. After reading that this class was laid back and enjoyable, I found out that it was the exact opposite: stressful and overwhelming. It's too much work to have a quiz every week, homework every week, and a section every week. At times the quiz questions seemed arbitrary (just one from the entire lecture). And, you couldn't just rely on the lectures to do well, but had to study the weekly papers in depth. I understand why the instructors thought papers and homework and quizzes would be useful, but instead of allowing you to focus on one thing and learn it, it caused you to split your attention between to many things and learn each poorly.",
    "This class is a high level overview of the many disciplines within biotechnology, from drug development to genomic advances to biophysics. Not much is covered in great depth, but the material is very interesting and well presented for the most part. Weekly quizzes keep you up to date with lectures but are not difficult. The weekly journal clubs were often the highlight, with really interesting, VERY current articles selected for reading. Overall, I'd recommend the course if you are broadly interested in learning more about biotech, but not if you have a particular field that you want to focus on.",
    "Biotechnology is one of the best science courses that I've taken so far. It is unique because of the material it covers: Most of the course focuses on very recent and ground-breaking discoveries in molecular biology. The weekly journal paper discussions are also very helpful in teaching students the art of reading scientific papers.",
    "Good course, I'd recommend it as an upper level bio elective. This year we had weekly quizzes which at times were frustrating, but overall the material is interesting and the work is manageable.",
    "Great course summarizing various advances in biotechnology! A cursory look at all the things going on in the field. Fair, not too difficult course - that is really interesting!I finally found biology exciting, relevant and interesting :)"
