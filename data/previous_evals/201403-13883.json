    "I could not recommend it more highly. Light workload, interesting course material, not terribly difficult to get a decent grade. Plus Prof. Reed is a stud... Best course of the semester--",
    "I would recommend it since the material is interesting and it isn't too much work since it is an elective. However, I felt that I had to learn most of the material myself outside of class since lectures were so difficult to follow.",
    "Nanotechnology is a Science\/QR geared towards non-majors but which I would not exactly call a gut. Problem sets usually required a trip to see the tutor (Farhan, who was great) but on the other hand there were only 4 of them. Homework = 50%, midterm and final = 25% each in tabulating the final grade. Homework was easy, midterm was doable, final was pretty difficult. Unclear whether course was curved. Professor Reed is good but not very approachable; did not hold office hours I knew of and took way too long to hand back assignments (although I believe the TF took care of grading these). My attention often wandered during lecture but it was pretty good as far as science\/QR lectures go.",
    "The class is a really broad overview of nanotechnology: the history of the field, the basic science behind it, what the field is working on now, etc. It's taught by Mark Reed, who basically invented quantum dots and continues to do very legit research. Reed is easygoing, clear, and very passionate about the material, so I found the lectures always really engaging, fun, and interesting. The class had less work than any other Yale course I've ever taken, which I didn't necessarily expect coming in - I wasn't looking for a gut. Miraculously, I found one that also happened to be really interesting and worthwhile, which has never happened before (and which is why I usually avoid guts like the plague and think they're an incredibly good way to waste some of the greatest privileges and opportunities offered to anybody anywhere in the world as a Yale student)."
