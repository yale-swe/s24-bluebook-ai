    "I feel I received a succinct introduction to graphic design and look at printed matter and graphics differently as a result of this course.",
    "Developed a more critical eye to incorporate during the process of creation and evaluation.",
    "As it is a follow up to Intro Graphic Design, this course focuses more on typesetting and more advanced compositional aspects of design. However, I feIt as though I gained more insights on how to expand my graphic design work conceptually, rather than technically during this course.",
    "This course helped me a lot to expand my visual language",
    "I definitely developed a greater general sense of how the process of graphic design works, very similar to architecture, but also started noticing and thinking about details and meaning in a way that I hadn't before. Although not nearly educated enough in typography, I have a much greater understanding and appreciation of font families and their uses. I think the most important skill that I developed in this class is the ability to investigate and test the ways that Graphic Design can either enhance, distract, or simply host its content.",
    "This course certainly changed the way I view 2D design and how I interpret graphics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Weeklly crits were very helpful in engaging with my work and work from other students.",
    "The assignments given during the course were very strong overall.",
    "No major weaknesses",
    "I would really love to have some time in class to work on assignments. This may be uncharacteristic to the way that Graphic Design is typically taught and learned, but I am sure there are other students out there, like myself, who learn from watching another go through the process. Of course, there is never a single right answer or process, but I think it would be so helpful to work on some projects, or start them, during class. I really loved the smaller exercises that we did do during class and the speakers that came in. The speakers were some of my favorite classes. I think the classes where we split into two groups to review work was the most productive use of our time and I would really try to limit the full class reviews to two per semester. It could be productive to have half the class in a review discussion while the other is working with the TA on the next assignment and then the groups switch, or something of the sort. I loved the small workshop our TA gave for a small group on tips and basic rules at the beginning of the semester. It could be really nice to start the semester where all students participate with the Professor and TA in a discussion about tips and rules for Graphic Design, since students are generally expected to come in with some experience.",
    "The instruction of this class was excellent and I enjoyed the professor. However, I felt that class time could have been used differently. Every class included a very long critique which I think sometimes could have been substituted with tutorials or work time. Overall, it felt like too much experimentation and skill development happened outside of class since we would prepare our work and then critique it in class, rather than come up with the idea or learn new techniques during class time itself. Or perhaps it had more to do with changing the class structure more often. It was also difficult at times to mix undergraduate students with graduate students."

   "comments": [
    "For students who have an interest in graphic design I would recommend this course. The weekly assignments made the workload quite large overall, but never overwhelming. Being able to re-work assignments and receive feedback on the same assignment more than once was pedagogically helpful.",
    "Absolutely recommend to students interested in design as a means of expressing ideas. A great follow up to intro that follows a similar structure",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to be able to push yourself in terms of design and get critiques on your work.",
    "Definitely take it if you took Intro Design and enjoyed it. This is a top-notch course with superb teaching and guests coming every other week (e.g. managers of creative agencies, collectors, art critics, book designers etc.) The assignments are very creative, challenging, and diverse. Be sure to start early as it takes a couple of days to come up with a compelling solution. Even though the workload is very heavy (expect to spend up to 25 hours a week), the assignments are so enjoyable that I never felt overwhelmed by them. The vast majority of assignments are expected to be produced digitally, so you have to have a decent familiarity with InDesign and Photoshop. Pamela is an absolutely brilliant instructor. I learned quite a lot from her feedback.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who not only has an interest in graphic design, but that also has some background in it. Definitely not a gut or intro class.",
    "Yes I would, with the suggestion to make sure their schedule allows for the workload this class requires and deserves."
