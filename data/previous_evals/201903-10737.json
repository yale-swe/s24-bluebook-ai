    "I feel like my speaking skills are my biggest weakness, so I wish that there was ore opportunity to speak Chinese.",
    "STRENGTHS - Great speaking practice - All teachers are extremely kind and patient - TA was amazing! WEAKNESSES - None, really - Didn't feel like the Quia (or, at least, as many Quias as we had) was necessary?",
    "Really great instructor. Really tough course. Lots of things to remember",
    "It is a great course for a comprehensive overview of the Chinese language",
    "The class's strengths far outweigh its weaknesses, and I honestly struggle with thinking of any areas in need of improvement. It is certainly a rigorous course that asks a lot of its students, but, by the end of the semester, the rigor feels well worth it. Small class sizes allow students to connect with their peers and professors in a meaningful way, and the one-on-one weekly tutoring sessions are an immense asset to the course. The class structure substantially strengthens students reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills. There are no surprises in the course, and students can quickly slip into the routine, which is set up in a way that I personally found very helpful: pre-class quizzes, online and in-class dictations, grammar\/vocabulary and reading online homework assignments, written tests, oral tests, presentations, and then the final. I thoroughly enjoyed my CHNS 130 experience.",
    "Strengths: all the professors in the Chinese department truly care that each and every student understands everything that is going on in the class weaknesses: none"

    "Yes!",
    "If you are interested in Chinese, then yes. It is a lot of work but in the end you come out having more knowledge than you would have expected.",
    "Yes! You definitely improve leaps in pronunciation and sentence structure.",
    "I would not. Its really hard",
    "Yes, if they want to learn Chinese!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student with zero hesitation. CHNS 130 Is the perfect course for an intermediate-level student that wants to grow in their fluency of the Chinese language; as a student that plans to study abroad in China in the coming years, I feel like this course has truly supplied me with the skills and confidence necessary for that endeavor.",
    "YES - learning any language is an important skill but Chinese is spoken by millions of people so it is a valuable language to learn"
