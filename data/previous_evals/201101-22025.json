   "comments": [
    "Great, challenging music theory course. I would only recommend this to those with strong interest in the music major, as 210 begins to deviate from the broad scope intro classes, and students really get their hands dirty with classical music. NOT A COMPOSITION CLASS. While you compose, they are merely models of theoretical constructs, rather than free composition.",
    "I enjoyed this course, and the theory was definitely enlightening, but I also found that theory does a great disservice to the natural beauty of music. There are so many 'rules' derived from Bach's work that seem arbitrary and pointless, and while the masters can break whatever rule they want (and be justified using some convoluted explanation), you can't, even if what you do sounds good. Studying the form of pieces was more painful; the terminology was ambiguous, confusing, and completely irrelevant for understanding musical content. The structure part of the course should be just eliminated, in my opinion. The course structure was a bit monotonous: collect homework, go over the reading, listen to examples, practice writing music with the new material. However, the composition projects can be interesting and there is a certain amount of freedom (as long as Bach and Mozart agree with them), so you can let your composing juices flow. Overall, it was a worthwhile experience, but I am convinced that I won't be a music theorist.",
    "Only take this class if you have to fulfill the prerequisites for the music major or if you are taking lessons for credit.",
    "Yes I would because I trust the music department will improve the class for next year.",
    "It's a fun class--you look at a lot of theory in relation to how it is used in composition. Composing the projects was a lot of work, but super rewarding and a lot of fun.",
    "Decent class, theory is not that fun though, so only take it if you have to.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in music.",
    "Music 210 is an intermediate music theory course in the sequence of Music205, 210, and 211. I would recommend the course to anyone who is a Music major, in which case you have to take it, or to anyone interested in knowing more about music with the intention to compose or arrange.",
    "210, as a prerequisite for the music major, is probably an important class to take. If, however, you're looking for a basic overview of music theory, 210 is probably not your best choice. The workload is much more intense than 205 and the concepts are surprisingly trickier to understand. If you're willing to put in the time, however, 210 is a good class and covers a lot of material very thoroughly."
