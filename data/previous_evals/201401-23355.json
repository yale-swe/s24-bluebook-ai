   "comments": [
    "Interesting subject material, the class is taught like a literature class as its humanities classification implies, not like a philosophy class. There is isn't that much work, other than a term paper. The term paper, though, is not necessarily based on the class material, so theoretically you could have never shown up, never read the material, and still get an A in the class, if you write a good paper, I suppose. The discussion could be all over the place, but I feel like seminars in general have been like that. I would recommend it to humanities majors, not so much to people looking for rigorous philosophy.",
    "This is a solid course with very low workload (just readings, films, and a final paper). Cecelia is super nice and smart, and is good at thinking up discussion questions. The readings she assigns are also quite interesting and touch on a lot of different topics. My one caveat with her style is that she doesn't provide enough of her own opinion on the topics we discuss. Some of the discussions ended up being *very* open ended and thus seemed a bit like discussions I had in more fluffy high school literature classes (especially when we discussed philosophical arguments). Basically what I'm saying is that Cecelia is smarter and more knowledgeable than her students so I think we could benefit more from what she has to say.",
    "PHIL 426, The Problem of Other Minds, is a class with little homework (well, short readings that you are expected to know very thorougly), and sometimes unfocussed discussion. But I would recommend it. I really enjoyed it, and learned new ways to approach (philosophical) problems and consider their implications. If you are looking to take one typical, rigorous philosophy class, I would not take 426. This course is a little more abstract in its topics.",
    "The topic is definitely really interesting, and there was a good balance between different kinds of readings and other materials (movies). I definitely expected the course to be more \"philosophy-heavy\" than it turned out to be, but I don't think that it detracted from my experience. I would really recommend this course to anyone interested in the problem of other minds, experience, and consciousness.",
    "I thought this class was really great! A really nice break from the regular class dynamic. I looked forward to every class. Also there was NO work. definitely take this class. I am not a philosophy major, nor was a majority of the class, and it was a fun class of conversation.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student, because it is a manageable workload, and the discussions are always pretty interesting.",
    "It was an alright class. Not too much work (actually barely any work, really). Discussion was student-driven with very little, if any coherence, to the readings and\/or the overarching philosophical comment under exploration.",
    "Yes."
