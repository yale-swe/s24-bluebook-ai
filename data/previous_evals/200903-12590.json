   "comments": [
    "I hope Dr. Holmes becomes a permanent Yale professor because this course was absolutely excellent. The course design constitutes a final paper, reading notes (not formally graded), being a discussant, a presenter, and two written assignments. It may all seem like a heavy work load, but it is all very tolerable. The readings are fairly heavy, but you can really focus on just a few of them and prepare for the discussions. The class was incredibly small: 5 students. It was targeted at graduate students, but we only had undergraduates. In all, the discussant\/present model really facilitates a learning environment. It demands that you be more engaged, and you will learn to re-assess your viewpoints. In the end, the course was rigorous to a degree, but Dr. Holmes most certainly rewarded us well for our efforts.I strongly recommend this class.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class. It's a lot of work, but totally worth it. You'll learn tons.",
    "Expect a LOT of reading, but the class is amazing. If you are interested in the relationship between the US and Europe, take this course! It's not heavy on theory, allows for ample discussion, and Professor Holmes is outstanding!"
