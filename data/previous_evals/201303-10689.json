   "comments": [
    "The course is severely disorganized, with Professor Veal often choosing not to show up to class or changing the topic of lecture at a moment's notice. His style of presenting the information was also all over the place, and it was often hard to get anything meaningful or concise out of lecture. The only way most of the students managed to prepare for the tests was because of section with the TAs, who took the time to organize the necessary facts and concepts for us. I am entirely outraged that this course be required for music majors, as it was pretty useless.",
    "Absolutely the worst course I have ever taken at Yale. But you have to do it, so....sucks for you.",
    "353 could have been a good course had it been better organized. Prof Veal seems very knowledgeable and interesting to talk to; however, the lectures were hard to follow, and half the time we just watched movies or waited for the speaker system to start working (which never happened). It just seems a bit too hard to have an overview history course in an aspect of \"world music\". Maybe it would be better to have several more specific seminar options. Anyway, I can't recommend the course to a non-music major, but the workload was fairly light.",
    "I probably would not recommend this course to another student. It's required for the music major, but there are better classes you can take than this one if you don't have to. Even though it's called \"Topics in World Music\" this class focused exclusively on the music of sub-Saharan Africa. Most of the music I had never heard before, so the material was definitely interesting, but the lectures were very disorganized and not all that worthwhile.",
    "This class had mixed opinions when I took it. I LOVED THE CLASS! It's not a typical music class in the sense that it is more like an \"intro to musicology\". You will be looking at music in social and historical contexts. For example, what is the role that music plays during post-independance in Ghana? How did Colonialism change the \"Jeli\" tradition of the Mande culture? How does the music of South Africa reveal the plight of the people during Apartheid? In Africa, music is inextricably linked to these issues and this class will explore these relationships in detail. I happened to have taken \"Introduction to Ethnicity Race and Migration (ER&M 200)\" and this class was a great continuation because it investigated the same issues of race, colonialism and national identity but in the context of music.Also AFRICAN MUSIC IS NOT JUST ABOUT \"DRUMMING\" AND \"RHYTHM\". There's more to African music than that! This class definitely made me appreciate African Music in this regard.",
    "The music you'll encounter in this class is INCREDIBLE- if you let yourself delve into it wholeheartedly, you'll love the course.",
    "I recommend it. I did not expect to enjoy the course as much as I did.",
    "Picture the music department as a restaurant. It's as if a student said to the waiter, \"For my semester I'll have a double portion of the Highly Politically Correct View of Non-Western Music, hold the subtlety. And hold the music too.\" This you have to eat if you want to be excused from the table, music majors.Predictably, if not happily, the dish's essence is a facile narrative you can turn around and slather on any written exam like a honey glaze: choking hazard is minimal.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. If you are a music major, do your best to petition the music department to abolish this class as a major requirement. While I think world music is very important, the current incarnation of this class was terrible. Lectures became increasingly disorganized and unproductive throughout the semester. Veal seems like a nice guy, but his \"interactive\" teaching style left me very frustrated. Discussions in class felt very unsubstantiated because no student had the background in post-colonial theory that would be necessary to discuss the material to leave the class with any interesting insights. If this class is offered again, make sure to get a good TA, that will make-or-break what little confidence you have in this course.",
    "a very broad unfocused overview of subsaharan african music, you must take it for the music major",
    "Required for the major, but a great course nonetheless. Since it's \"world music,\" Veal can tweak it to whatever he wants; when I took it, we focused solely on African music. I think that was for the best; we examined several different musics from the diaspora (Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa) and they were all connected through the thorny political and cultural contexts in which the genres developed. Readings are interesting and thought-provoking (though since Veal's lectures are a bit tangential, you can skate by pretty easily with only having read a little). You don't need that much music knowledge at all (just basic theory and some rhythm will help); the course focused very much on political events (e.g. apartheid) that influenced the music that the native Africans produced. A great intro to ethnomusicology.",
    "It's hard to know exactly what kind of person would enjoy this course. A large part of it is just history and musical concepts\/genre identification, but it's all viewed through a philosophical lens, mixed with guest visitors, film days, and a ton of lengthy readings (that few finished). In the end it was pretty pleasant, especially because the large units really helped compartmentalize the info we had to know, but the fantastic sections were what made the course comprehensible.",
    "353 is the \"World Music\" course of the Music Department. If you're a music major, you have to take it. If not, and you're simply interested in non-Western music, the class still will be worthwhile.",
    "Overall, Music 353 provided a look into many musical traditions going on in several West African countries as well as South Africa, AND how this music related to events going on in these countries socially, culturally, and politically. I would recommend this course to a student interested in West African music and music of South Africa. Anyone interested in studying Apartheid would find the last unit on South Africa especially helpful. HOWEVER, keep in mind that this course often seemed overwhelming in the amount of sociocultural and musical information it tried to pack into a one-semeser lecture course.",
    "In the end, I did enjoy this class -- but that is mostly a function of spending more time with my classmate friends. Michael Veal's lectures are highly unstructured, so it is difficult to gain more than a general sense of the material from each lecture. I reckon section was much more useful than lecture time."
