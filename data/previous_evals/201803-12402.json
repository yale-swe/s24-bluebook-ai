    "I learned a completely new alphabet, vocabulary and grammar structure! Basic past, present and future verb tenses and a solid amount of vocabulary. Learned how to write about 2 double space page length on essay describing family and a holiday as well as how to give an approx. 6 minute length oral presentation on similar topics. Also learned about Persian culture, and how to be more comfortable speaking up in class!",
    "Learned a lot of Persian language and culture! Surprised how much we were able to learn in just one semester. I could probably find my way around easily in Tehran now if I was dropped off.",
    "You really do learn a significant amount about both the Persian language and Persian culture in this class. The alphabet, vocabulary and basic grammar along with literature, history, art and geography are all covered in the thirteen weeks. I feel like I can speak at a very basic conversational level about most things.",
    "I was able to learn a broad range of beginner Persian skills and vocabulary through this course. I learned the Persian alphabet. We also learned a fair bit of Persian history and culture. I received a foundation in writing, reading, speaking, and listening.",
    "If you take this course, you will learn to write a 2-3 page essay and deliver a 5-6 minute oral presentation by the end of the semester. Pretty amazing! You will also learn a lot about persian culture (authors, dynasties, geography, cities, ethnic groups)."

    "Ostad is an incredible professor. The class pedagogy is phenomenal and the amount you learn in one semester at a comfortable pace is really mind-blowing. Ive taken language classes in other departments at Yale and none have been as well taught as L1 Persian! Really, the amount you learn (considering the workload never feels too stressful) is nothing short of amazing. One thing to be mindful of if you are going to take this class: Ostad will cold call you and publicly shame you if you didnt study\/practice\/if you make a small mistake but it wont be specific to you. She does it to everyone. You just have to remind yourself that she is not doing it maliciously and rather because she wants you to learn. That said, cutting students a little more slack and acknowledging the fact that they are students who will make mistakes and sometimes forget things would be helpful. But the great thing about Ostad is she has very high expectations of her students, which is a good thing in the end when you can already write 2 page essays in Persian and talk for 6 minutes on one subject. The community youll form with your classmates, as well as the knowledge youll start to develop about Iran and Persian culture, are also great plusses. Just be prepared to be roasted a little and some days a lot! Also, another major weakness that could be improved is just attention to time! We were often held ten or so minutes after class, and getting up to leave felt awkward.",
    "A lot of information and a lot of learning. Sometimes the progression seems counterintuitive, but it works.",
    "This course is organized but I really do wish Ostad, as we call her, was more forgiving. Some days, Ostad is perfectly nice and has the air of a firm but caring mother. Others, she seems much harder to please, and I found it hard to ask questions about the material comfortably.",
    "The class is a great introduction to the Persian language and students will be able to pick up basic skills very fast. The course relies heavily on a Persian textbook which can at times be slightly confusing. I believe the course would benefit from the use of more materials and handouts to supplement the textbook.",
    "I felt like the material was interesting. But I did feel that we spent a high proportion of class time talking about culture, whereas we could have studied this on our own time in preparation for the tests. I wished we could have allocated some of this time to talking about confusing grammatical concepts."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you want to learn a lot of Persian in a amazing structured way!! Will be an exercise in thick skin though!",
    "Yes. If you are interested in learning Persian or Persian culture, this is a good course and necessary to build a foundation.",
    "I'm not sure. The course itself will help you reach a better understanding of Persian. That said, the teaching style will not work for everyone.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who are very dedicated to the language of Persian. This class can be at times very difficult and only full dedication will lead to success.",
    "If you want to learn persian at an intro level and gain a fair amount of knowledge pretty quickly, this is a good course to take."
