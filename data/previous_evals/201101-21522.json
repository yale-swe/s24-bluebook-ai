    "I would recommend this class for any student whether or not they are a Theater Studies major!",
    "This once-a-week course involves weekly reading responses to the week's readings and video clips (about 100 pages of reading and up to an hour of viewings). In class we would mostly have seminar-style discussion following a period of the professor elaborating more on the subject. After the first couple of weeks, each class will begin with student presentations that last about 15 minutes each, relating to the dance style or period studied for that week. There is a 10-12 page final paper at the end.This class was very illuminating, I think both dancers and nondancers alike would learn a lot from the class. The discussion was a little stagnant at times and sometimes the class would feel very long, but the material was always interesting. The guest teachers and demos were also great to familiarize us with the dance styles studied for that week as well as a change from just sitting in a discussion circle.And Emily Coates is awesome. She has worked with a number of the choreographers studied and can provide great insight into not only the lives of the choreographers but also their pieces and work style.",
    "No. It wasn't really AMST focused as I had expected. If you want to learn about various dance then it would be a great course.",
    "Absolutely. This is not just for dancers. Really this class is applicable to anyone interested in creativity, or even just the process of how you do research.",
    "This course is a comprehensive introduction to the various styles of dance that have emerged in the world of dance. Weekly readings and viewings provide essential background knowledge for discussions held during class. I would recommend this class for a student wishing to broaden his or her knowledge on the different forms of dance.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. You don't need to know famous choreographers, techniques, and movements prior to this class (if you do, that's fine too). Because you'll learn all about them and MORE in this seminar. This was probably one of the best seminars I've ever taken at Yale. I highly recommend this course especially to those who have some kind of passion for dance.",
    "Yes! Best class I've taken at Yale so far!",
    "It was a seminar in a dance studio. You will arrive and hear presentations by your fellow students. then there is time for discussion at the end. Some weeks there are little bits of movement to keep you on your toes. You have to do weekly blog posts which count for a lot of your grade, so make sure you stay on top of this:)",
    "I would most certainly recommend this course for both dancers and non-dancers alike, as well as both theater and non-theater majors.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Each week we dropped down in the middle of a different dance movement, writing 200 word responses to the reading each week and a larger final paper at the end."
