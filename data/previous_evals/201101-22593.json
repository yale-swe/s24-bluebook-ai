    "Absolutely. This class will impart upon you a wonderful sense of idealism in the best possible way. Understanding nonviolence as a political tool able to defeat the most powerful totalitarian regimes will give you a unique optimism in considering the future of humankind and hopefully inspire you to be the change you wish to see in the world!",
    "Look through the reading list, see if you're interested. Schell is an amazing professor in section. He's brilliant and loves what he does and is interested in your thoughts and how you work through the issues in the course. I absolutely recommend the course, especially if you have any interest in the subject of nonviolence.",
    "If you are interested in learning the history of a number of highly influential non-violent movements and the theory behind violence and non-violence\u0097all through some very stimulating readings and well-directed class discussion, this class is for you.",
    "Absolutely take this class. The small class size and professor made it one of the best classes I've taken here at Yale. There is a lot of reading but it is all very accessible, and leads to very interesting discussions. Schell offers a lot of guidance in writing the final paper so it really is not that daunting.",
    "Great class.A wonderful introduction to the world of nonviolence and its many instances around the world (and no, it's not just Gandhi).Jonathan Schell is great, has tons of life experience and is willing to share it.",
    "Highly recommended. The class covered the most important examples of nonviolent resistance, getting to the root of why nonviolence was chosen and how the nonviolent tactics played out. Our class had the benefit of watching at least one nonviolence movement unfold in real-time, but I'm sure Egypt will be discussed in class for years to come. Discussions and readings are both excellent."
