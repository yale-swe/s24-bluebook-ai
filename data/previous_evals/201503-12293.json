   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Professor Summers is fantastic - funny, knowledgeable, and willing to ask provocative questions when needed - and the material is quite interesting. The class is centered on a selection of readings ranging from scholarly journal articles on Dengue fever, to Randy Shilts' history of the early years of the AIDS epidemic (And the Band Played On), to Albert Camus' absurdist philosophical novel The Plague. Class discussions used those readings as a starting point, and often broadened to address important issues of medical ethics, the role of government, and other moral issues relating to public health. The workload is not especially heavy - a 1,500-word midterm paper and a 3,000 word final paper plus the readings - but the class is quite rewarding. I highly recommend Epidemics in Global Perspective.",
    "Apparently, the class grade is based on how much he likes you, which makes sense given that no assignments have numerical grades on them, and the midterm paper \"can't hurt you.\" If you don't participate, I'm not sure how you can actually get a good grade. Great class chemistry for a seminar though.",
    "Not a very specific topic but an interesting look into epidemics and a rough sketch to get you more interested in each epidemic more thoroughly.",
    "Definitely! This will probably be one of the most interesting and fun courses you take at Yale.",
    "Hums 076 is a course designed to make one think critically about epidemics, a concept less stresssed in traditional high school courses. During this course, we learned a great deal of new information. Although I had some prior experience with a seminar environment in some high school courses, this seminar gave me the full experience of a course centered around discussion. People (not books) proved to be our best resources for new ideas, as our discussions were very fluid and open. I would recommend this course to any student, because it helped me learn more about global health. More importantly, this course helped me practice lifelong skills, such as writing and discussion.",
    "A great course to help introduce me to seminar style learning as well as introduce me to the field of HSHM",
    "HUMS 076 01 is a great freshman seminar that works well as a transition into college. The class has great reading assignments. The class is a great addition to any schedule.",
    "I would hesitantly recommend the course to other students, and I already have. As before, I told them how much I enjoyed the course, the material, the discussions, and the professor, just not the grading, or lack there of.",
    "If you have an interest in epidemics like plague and Spanish flu, you should take this class. Be prepared to participate in class because professor Summers lets the students drive class discussion so if you are interested and engaged, it will be a good class. I highly recommend it.",
    "Epidemics is a great, great freshman seminar. It has all of the key elements: legendary, endless-wealth-of-knowledge professor in Bill Summers; reading that's interesting, but kinda-sorta optional; great, thought-provoking in-class discussion. The final paper (3000 words about your favorite epidemic) is fun to write.",
    "Epidemics in Global Perspective was an awesome ride. Don't expect the course to delve far into the scientific specifics of different diseases, but if you're interested in exploring the social and ethical dilemmas involved in responding to epidemics in different societies, this is an excellent course to take."
