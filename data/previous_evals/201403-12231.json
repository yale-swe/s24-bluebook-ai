   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who want to grasp the fundamental set of ideas that shape the intellectual background of jihad today. There are a lot of interesting readings that should be done not only for the course, but also for personal development.",
    "This course covers the political history and ideological\/religious developments of the major countries in the Muslim world (e.g. Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, Palestine, although North and West Africa, Central Asia, the Balkans, and Southeast Asia are not covered). It also covers the main foundational ideas of Islam, Sharia law, and jihad and fundamentalism. If you'd like to learn a little bit about the Middle East\/Islam\/fundamentalism, this is a great class. Griffel is an awesome lecturer and the workload isn't bad at all. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I took it Credit\/D, and ended up basically treating it like an interesting lecture series on the history of radical Islam. Prof. Griffel was definitely good for that, but the readings assigned were pretty dry and I ended up basically stopping doing them. Definitely worth shopping\/CreditDing though.",
    "Definitely recommend it given everything that is going on in the world right now. It is a lot to know though, and the names and terms are difficult to spell\/remember.",
    "I would recommend taking this class if you are interested in or want to learn more about the subject. Professor Griffel is a good lecturer and the work load is very light.",
    "By far my favorite class. Learned so much and I feel like I really understand conflicts in the middle east better now that I've taken it. There is section-this is not on the syllabus.",
    "This course is solid. I'd recommend it as a 4th or 5th class. It's not an amazing class, but it gives you concrete and useful information that is especially prevalent nowadays. It's informative and generally interesting.",
    "This class was okay. It was useful and good information to learn, and some of the additional readings (outside the books) were really interesting. But I was expecting a bit more from this class--after the midterm, it became a lot of let's-learn-about-another-country-every-class-and-not-really-know-much-about-it. And lectures were pretty much just Professor Griffel (who does seem nice\/funny) putting up slides that were kinda hard to see of paragraphs of historical information...I wish there were more big themes and Griffel would make a bit more of an argument\/connect groups in class. He also says \"in this case\" every other word, fair warning. BUT I did learn a lot in this class.",
    "Yes, good for students with all backgrounds and an interest in current affairs.",
    "YES! TAKE IT! This was my favorite course at Yale. It is taught extremely well and the topics covered are very relevant. My only qualm is that there was SO much to memorize in terms of IDs. Midterm, final, and one paper (either 5 pages or 10 pages, depending on if you went to all the sections or not). Not a terrible workload!",
    "A survey course with a goldilocks level of depth for each country\/ideology. Only complaint is so many names that were difficult for a non-Arabic speaker to memorize\/differentiate between.",
    "Excellent class, very important for everyone to take it. Very informative and very intense, a lot of reading and a lot of memorizing.",
    "This class is a great combination what is happening in Arab and Islamic states and fundamentalist groups in those nations with ideological bases and thought that inspires groups. I feel like I gained a lot from this course. There is a lot of reading, but the course is manageable and the lectures are interesting if you are interested in Islam in the contemporary world.",
    "For someone studying a course related to the Middle East or Islam for the first time, Islam Today provided a rather comprehensive (though overwhelmingly so) overview of Islamic fundamentalism, tracing its genealogy starting from the origins of Islam as a religion, going through major Islamic thinkers and important junctures in the history of Islam, on to a variety of middle eastern countries and the relationship they had with Islam, before finally looking into Islamic fundamentalism and recent events. I expected the course to only be about the last segment, given its title, so the amount that we covered was rather too overwhelming for me. I found it difficult to keep up with dealing with so many facets of Islam and a ton of details, even though I kept up with most of the readings. Speaking of readings, there was not much engagement with them in both lectures and sections. I also felt that it we spent a lot of time on going through content and less on analysis or being equipped with theoretical lenses with which to view these things.",
    "Take it. Relevant knowledge and not alot of work. Also easy tests",
    "Islam Today: Jihad and Fundamentalism is a wonderful class and one of the best I've taken at Yale. It offers a thorough investigation into the ideas and histories of various regions, from Egypt, to the Middle East to Central Asia. Take this class to learn more about a subject and regions that the media often distortseach lecture is fascinating and you won't be disappointed.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Great class, relevant readings, interesting, relevant topics. There is one midterm, a final, and if you attend most sections, a five page paper. (If not, a 10 page final one). I feel much more knowledgeable about many of the events that have been front page news for the past few years.",
    "Yes",
    "This course is a good basic course about various aspects and history of Islam spanning across a lot of countries in the Middle East. There is weekly, manageable reading, a midterm, a final, and either a 1 5-page paper that you can re-do one time if you want to try to get a better grade (this option is available if you attend every section and miss only one), and otherwise you write a 12 page final paper. The lectures are sometimes hard to follow though, so it is helpful to go to sections. I would take this course if you don't know anything about Islam in the Middle East and want to gain basic knowledge. I learned a lot.",
    "I would, but would recommend that they take an introductory course on Middle East Politics first. There isn't a great deal of background to most of the countries, people, or events we discuss in this class, so it is helpful to have a good foundation.",
    "Yes, I would certainly recommend this class to another student on a number of grounds. 1.) the material is very interesting (at least to me) and very relevant for today. If you have no interest in these movements or the Middle East in general than you probably won't enjoy it that much, but even if that is the case I suggest trying it because the material may surprise you.I even thought the readings were great, and when I wouldn't really of them for a given week, it was only because I didn't have time, never because I didn't want to. 2.) Professor Griffel is a great, engaging lecturer who brings a lot more to the lessons than just the information itself, but also a lot of personal insight and experience. 3.) The work is not that bad, especially given how much you learn after this class. The reading is very manageable, and really only needs to be for discussion section. 4.) The lessons you learn from this class are excellent, and helps you seethe ideologies behind these groups you keep hearing about, instead of just what they are doing around the world. I highly, highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, I highly recommend this class! I knew very little about Islam or modern Middle Eastern politics when I began this class, and now I feel like I understand this extremely relevant topic very well. There is a decent amount of reading, but not all of it is important so you can just skim. The exams are fair and if you study enough you can definitely do well in the class, even if you are not a \"history person\" or a \"poli-sci person.\" Professor Griffel is an organized, funny, fair professor and a good lecturer. If you are looking for a class to widen your horizons, this is it!",
    "A good class but sections are TERRIBLE. Great background on a lot of countries though it's a lot of memorization and regurgitation",
    "Yes! It's important stuff to know, and a good way to learn it.",
    "This is a great class! It's more focused on extremist perspectives and very relevant to today's global issues.",
    "It is a great course! Take it!",
    "Great survey course. Focus is more on politics than a thorough analysis of theology, but you will feel your perspective grow and shift completely. Lectures are good but a lot of fact dumping so just be ready to process a lot of names and dates.",
    "I would recommend the course since the subject is interesting and definitely very relevant, but it is a lot of work to follow closely and the exams are difficult.",
    "A good lecture class to take if you are interested in learning more about jihad and political Islam, which is largely misrepresented in the media. In hindsight, I probably would not have taken this class as a freshman (I would have taken it as a sophomore). The workload is very manageable (minimum of one 5-page paper if you attend all the sections) but I would have wanted to take other classes that are more appropriate for freshmen.",
    "DEFINITELY A 100%!",
    "Great course to build a solid foundation of understanding in Islam, its history, and modern implications. I feel like I have a much better understanding of what's currently going on in the Middle East. Professor Griffel is engaging and clearly passionate about the subject matter. Michael was a good TA, he broke things down well and facilitated interesting discussions. Overall, I highly recommend taking this course if you're interested in international relations, the Middle East, Islam, or are just tired of reading the works of old white men.",
    "Really great class, highly recommend it! As someone from the Middle East, I felt the topics presented were particularly relevant and gave a great academic background to a subject I had been informally exposed to growing up. Even for someone not from the region, the class still provides a really good insight into Islamic\/Religious groups, and in turn the effects of these religious groups in the history\/politics of the country\/region as a whole. Grading was fair, and as long as you revised properly the exams (ID section and then a few essays) shouldnt be too difficult. Section with Michael was really great. Take the class!",
    "Yes",
    "A very good class that more people should take. Professor Griffel is incredibly knowledgeable and a good lecturer. The topics we learn are extremely relevant, covering the histories and emergence of Islamic movements in various Middle Eastern countries. We learn both about the history of the country and movements as well as the works and ideas of important thought leaders.",
    "Excellent introduction to the complexities of Islam today, clear and nuanced.",
    "Broad course about political movements in Islam since the 1850's. Lots of reading, lots of material: be prepared to memorize. More about politics than Islam as a religion.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course."
