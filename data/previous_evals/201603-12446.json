    "This course not only gave me access to a great deal of historical texts, but also offered a great deal of insight with regards to ancient Chinese history, thought, and the origins of the modern language. It also allowed me to think outside the typical language box due to the fluidity of the grammar, and even a taste what reading premodern texts would feel like.",
    "I learned the basic grammar of literary Chinese and got a lot of practice reading original texts.",
    "Learned how to read basic Classical Chinese, traditional characters, understand the grammar, which also informed my understanding of modern Chinese. Gained some familiarity with ancient Chinese thought and social convention. Overall a very fulfilling course."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the regularly scheduled way the course ran, because it meant that it was constant and reliable. The only suggestion I would have would be maybe easing the transition from textbook-guided readings into actual texts, because it was a bit of a plunge off the deep end (which served as a helpful wake-up call to the unfriendly world of research, I suppose).",
    "This is a great course, really well-organized and well-taught. Can't think of any glaring weaknesses.",
    "Regular translation homework helped me developed a firm grasp of the language. Good that it was taught it in English to make it more accessible to people of different backgrounds. Not much I would change."

    "For a student who is genuinely interested in premodern China or the long history behind the modern language, this is a fantastic course to take. I personally enjoyed it a great deal because I'm very invested in this area of study, which means that everything was new and exciting and very relevant for me. If you're just looking for an low-work low-stress L5 language credit, this class may not be for you...",
    "Great class. Professor Hunter is a phenomenal teacher and a great guy. Literary Chinese is difficult but I had a ton of fun learning it.",
    "Take this course if you're at all interested in reading older Chinese texts, want an opportunity to (be forced to) learn traditional characters, or just have a much better understanding of how the modern Chinese language developed from its classical roots. Lesson texts are also a great fun to read and translate, though tedious at times, providing fascinating windows into various aspects of ancient Chinese thought and culture, whether it's kings ditching their male lovers or assassins disfiguring themselves in service to their lords. A very fulfilling and engaging course.",
    "If you are really interested in literary Chinese then take this course. It is informative and interesting. That said, if you are just looking for a higher level Chinese course and do not have a special interest in literary Chinese, do not take the course. The translations are great but very time consuming. This class is worth taking just to spend time with Professor Hunter."
