   "comments": [
    "I learned how to use some important parts of the French language (subjunctive, relative pronouns, etc).",
    "all facets of my french improved, particularly, my grammar and writing. my speaking ability is still lackluster, but that is my fault, not the course's",
    "Coming in after almost two years of not taking French, I definitely had an improvement in my lingual capabilities throughout the duration of this semester. Specifically, my writing skills got much better and I gained confidence in writing in French on a personal level. I also feel that I gained a lot of cultural context and admiration for francophone countries and their authors.",
    "Taking L3 befroe L4 definitely helped prepare me well for L4.",
    "I gained a more in-depth knowledge about divers french cultures around the world and developed my grammar and writing skills.",
    "I definitely feel like my French has improved across this semester by a lot. In general my reading and listening comprehension have improved the most, but my oral and writing skills are definitely getting better as well. In terms of knowledge\/insight, we spent a long time discussing various aspects of WWII with regards to France and other francophone areas of the world, so I would say that my understanding of that subject area has improved.",
    "I grew confident in conversing and presenting in French. I became able to quickly read and comprehend even difficult French texts. I learned much about French history and culture, as well as those of former French colonies. I finally grew comfortable with difficult grammatical concepts, especially the subjunctive case and the language's many pronouns."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved all of the parts relating to a work of literature and, as always, hated the drudgery of vocab lists and grammar exercises that I know are a necessity",
    "Strengths; Madame Burton meeting every day the review materials the final presentation class size Weaknesses: the audio programs stories are generally pretty boring and depressing",
    "I think the best and worst thing in this course are the fact that it is so structured and standardized. This reality allows for prediction of course load as well as extensive material present on what we learn, however, I feel that lingual classes should flow much more in the direction the students take it. If the students need to work on a subject more, we should focus on that. However, because the course was so standardized, I felt that we divided up our time equally, even on topics that were relatively simple for us to understand.",
    "There is a ton of busy work, which makes focusing highly on this course as well as other courses quite a challenging balancing game. I wish I had more work geared toward my weaknesses and little in my strengths.",
    "strength- small class environment, constant engagement in class weakness- not enough presentations or opportunities to practice oral skills",
    "The main strength of this class (like most language classes, I imagine) is that having it every day means that you're speaking French everyday, which definitely helps you improve. Mme. Burton is an engaging professor and the texts that you read in class are fairly interesting. I don't know that this class has any definite weaknesses, but it is a lot of work. Having an assignment everyday for the next day can really add up and it's easy-ish to get behind.",
    "Strengths: The classes were always engaging and there was incredible variety in the style of pedagogy for a course that meets every day. The regular and frequent evaluations were helpful in solidifying a number of lessons without things becoming too overwhelming. The balance of exercises on grammar, speaking, reading and listening allowed for a very well-rounded improvement in my abilities. Improvements: More time for discussion would have been very helpful - I feel like I could have grown more in my speaking confidence by talking more regularly and more in-depth with the person sitting next to me. Less time spent in class going over the homework assignments, because my mind usually tunes out a bit and focuses only on whether I had the right answer or not."

   "comments": [
    "It's not awful-take it if you have to. I found Madame Burton to be a really good professor, so I would definitely suggest her section. The workload, of course, is a lot. This class suffers from what all math and foreign language classes suffer from at Yale: people of widely differing abilities being placed into the same level. Some people in my class were phenomenal at French, and the course was likely easy for them, while some, myself included, found the course to be quite challenging.( I'm praying for a B+) The readings are ridiculously diverse, which may prove interesting for some people; however, I found them quite depressing, and, for the most part, boring. The Holocaust section was, on the whole, more enjoyable. The final presentation seemed intimidating, but it was actually a pretty rewarding activity. I do believe that this course truly helped my French.",
    "If you are looking at taking this class to continue your French education, I would suggest taking it. Although the amount of work can at times be a little cumbersome, the course very effectively focuses on specific topics and covers a wide array of interesting literature. However, if you are looking to fall in love with French, the standardization of this course makes it mundane at times and only reaffirmed for me the fact that I do not like to learn languages in a classroom but rather through direct immersion.",
    "Yes. Would recommend to a student willing to put in a good amount of work to develop speaking, reading and writing skills in french.",
    "This class is a good continuation from L3. Most people take the language classes they have to for better or for worse, but this is definitely one of the better ones. The French department at Yale is excellent and I have not yet had a bad experience with it. The texts are pretty interesting and the class is engaging. The one downside is that there is a fair amount of work everyday, which can be tough to stay on top of, but overall I would absolutely recommend this course.",
    "I definitely would. It was challenging and ambitious without being overwhelming, and there was never a boring or useless class. I improved a lot with my French and am emboldened to keep moving forward."
