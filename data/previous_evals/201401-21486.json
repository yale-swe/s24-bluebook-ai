    "I would definitely recommend this course, but unfortunately Prof. Turin is leaving next year.",
    "This class was so so incredible, and I am sad for future students that it will not be offered again, at least not with Prof Turin- the reason it was so amazing. We all learned so much, and Prof Turin goes out of his way to help and encourage students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students, if something like this is ever offered again.",
    "This course was by far one of my favorite at Yale. Professor Turin draws from his extensive experience in the region in order to put together a dynamic and thought-provoking seminar. While we focus on the Himalaya, the issues and themes discussed are of global importance. No matter your experience with the subject area, Turin will help you find a way to connect your interests to the subject material. Professor Turin is an incredible instructor: he provides great feedback, makes himself available to students, and will always find a way to brighten your day. I always looked forward to class. Unfortunately, Professor Turin will be leaving Yale so this class may not be offered in the future.",
    "This is a phenomenal course for those with all levels of interest in the Himalayas. It connects to larger themes in many ways and Professor Turin is phenomenal. So depending on who teaches it now that he's gone, absolutely take it. You'll be a better person for it.",
    "Yes, if you can handle all the reading. Being already interested in Himalayan topics helps.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY! well, the problem is prof. turin isn't at going to be here next year (and if that's yale's fault that is the dumbest decision they've ever made) and I would highly recommend this class but the reason it was so great was because of him and can't say it will be good with another professor! although the himalayas are extremely interesting.",
    "Class involves a seminar once a week, weekly readings from articles and journals and books on topics ranging from language, ethnicity, religion, culture, and anthropology of the Himalayas. Guest speakers were incredible and students led discussions and also had a lot of flexibility in their final projects."
