   "comments": [
    "This is a fun class to take, the material to discuss is fun and you get to talk about a lot of issues without having to spend too much time really reading in depth about them. I would recommend taking it, Kaplan knows a lot, you get exposed to a variety of topics, and it's not too much work.",
    "This class feels like no work, and you learn tons all the same - a deadly combination. Kaplan is an amazing person and is very easy to talk to and get advice from. Very little homework - a few pages of reading here and there and a few films and youtube clips, and just discussions in class, but somehow you come out of the class feeling like you've learned a lot. Great class.",
    "Very nice syllabus. Especially strong in diversity of media. Could have benefitted from more material on the francais de souche perspective, rather than so much from the immigrant perspective. Nice balance of classroom work, class conducted in a manner generally conducive to learning.Very nice professor. Clearly an expert in her field. Finds a way to connect with students and encourage their learning.",
    "I would definitely recommend it- no reservations. Professor Kaplan is fantastic, and the material was so well-chosen. The class discussions were always fun and informative, and I probably learned more about France in this course than I have in any other course at Yale (except perhaps Fr 160, which is also good). This class is a non-stressful, very enjoyable way to keep up with French and learn more about the culture.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student! Definitely worth taking if you're interested in understanding contemporary issues in France!"
