   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand mating systems and mating preferences from an evolutionary perspective. It is quite a unique course.",
    "Good class, lots of outside work to keep up with but it's all super interesting content and a great way to give you an introduction to anthropology.",
    "Take it if you have a genuine interest in anthropology and biology, but NOT to purely answer questions about your own sexuality.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in an anthropology class even if they have had no introduction to anthropology before. This class was interesting especially in an evolutionary approach to love, sex, and reproduction. There was a lot of reading for the class and sometimes I did not find them useful. I would read an entire paper and fell that no conclusions could be drawn from the results.",
    "I would recommend this class! The class is great for a 5th credit, as it is very engaging and doesn't require a ton of studying or homework besides reading. Claudia and Eduardo stress that they want students to understand concepts rather than memorize facts, so the exams are not difficult as long as you were paying attention in class. I started out taking this class Credit\/D, but I did well on the quizzes and exams and I was doing all of the readings anyways because they were interesting, so I converted to a letter grade. The classroom environment is super supportive and collaborative- by the end of the class, my table was comfortable talking about pretty much anything! Long story short- take this class! You learn wide range of cool concepts (the evolution of sexual reproduction, female and male reproductive biology, monogamy in non human species, contraception, and many more) and it's not difficult as long as you pay attention!",
    "No. This class is a waste of time. I actually did learn quite a bit, but the experience was so frustrating I've decided never to take another anthropology course.",
    "I would recommend this class to those who have some interest in evolution of human mating systems. For example, it was soooo interesting to look at our social constructs of love and marriage through evolution. Things like this are what you examine in this class and sometimes the answers are unexpected to the point where we would just look around at each other in awe.",
    "Eduardo seems to really love his work with the owl monkeys but is not a convincing lecturer. I wish he hadnt discouraged us from taking notes. Claudia, on the other hand, is an engaging and passionate professor! She always managed to add love and humor into the course. Love her! The discussion sections for this class added no value to my learning experience. It did not seem as though the teaching fellow actually had any background in the course material and he generally lacked enthusiasm. Sections always felt like an awkward waste of time. The workload is not too bad. A few readings and a form each week, a midterm, and a final. Both exams are not too difficult. Still, I would not recommend this course if you are looking for something that will change the way you think or something that will add academic rigor to your life.",
    "The class is a good introduction to evolutionary biology and its concepts, and I didn't mind taking it, however I would not take it again if I had to pick it all over."
