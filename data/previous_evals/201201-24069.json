    "If you don't have any background in law, you will be behind most people but you will learn a TON. This course has both practical and theoretical considerations, so depending which one you like better, you will like the first half and second half of the course to a different extent.Kenneth Townsend is wonderful, humble, easy to talk to, and knowledgeable.The reading is manageable, and Kenny tries to incorporate our reading responses into class discussion so it doesn't feel like you do the responses for nothing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, but with the qualification that it will be easier and probably more enjoyable if you have some background in the subject, even though it is also intended to introduce those unfamiliar with the subject to pertinent major conflicts, opinions, andscholarship.",
    "Lots of fun. You'll read cases and theory that bear on super important issues in America today. Kenneth is a great instructor, very knowledgeable on the subject and able to stimulate and direct good discussion. Overall, a really well-run seminar with great material.",
    "Yes. I don't think it will ever be offered again, but it was great.",
    "I would recommend it to another student with the understanding that involves a lot of political theory.",
    "A wonderful overview of how American law has dealt with religion. A lot of time spent on political philosophy, too.I would recommend the course, as long as you personally find the material interesting and enjoy long, free-form class discussions.",
    "Pretty good class. Definitely not a discussion-oriented seminar, but Ken is great and very nice and the material is frequently interesting. There should be more undergrad classes that deal with actual case law.",
    "I found it pretty repetitive and tedious but Kenneth is really nice and helpful. I thought I got more out of the paper than the class but maybe with different students it would be more fun",
    "Take it! It's amazing!",
    "Definitely take this course. But be warned that the second half is mostly political theory an not just constitutional law. But the subject matter is relevant, exciting and well-presented, and townsend is the best!"
