   "comments": [
    "While full of interesting content and spanning a fascinating array of topics, the course ultimately lacked organization and felt a little bit hollow. Lectures left me feeling relatively ill-informed, and the readings felt almost haphazard. Still, I learned a fair bit in spite of all this. The TAing in particular was very good. With only a midterm, two response papers, and an 8 page final paper, it is not a particularly burdensome class either. If you have basic knowledge of even one of the countries discussed, it can get boring very quickly, however.",
    "It's a good introduction to Southeast Asian colonial and post-colonial history. Gives you a brief taste of most major SEA countries. Would recommended if you would like basic knowledge of this region's modern history and culture.",
    "Yes, but only if you really, really, really want to learn more about SEA.",
    "Good if you like the material... shop it to assess the lecturing style.",
    "Just a basic history course, not too much work, interesting to learn about this area of the world that we've had only recent, but very strong, interest in",
    "It's a great course to get to know the history behind the region of Southeast Asia. Even from someone who lives there, I realize now how ignorant I was about a lot of the region before I took this class. Lectures are interesting and sections are engaging.",
    "I would recommend this course to students interested in Southeast Asia because it was excellent at surveying each country individually and then reflecting on their similarities\/differences.",
    "Decent introduction to the key themes and threads of Southeast Asian history. It is an incredibly complex region though, so don't expect to leave this course an expert on it.",
    "Yes definitely. This is the first history class that I liked. Southeast Asian history is so much more interesting than a lot of people know, and Professor Kiernan makes it worthwhile to take a course on it."
