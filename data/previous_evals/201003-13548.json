   "comments": [
    "Strength: good material presentation; nice job for 1st time teaching itNote: with the workload of this course, the class should be labeled as a 600 level not a 500 level. We had weekly homeworks, a term paper, a midterm, and a final. This is more than any other 500 level course that I have taken in EPH.",
    "The course presented interesting concepts, but the workload was unanticipated. Weekly homework was time intensive, and coupled with a midterm, final, and major paper on top of weekly readings it was difficult to keep up at times. Perhaps the midterm could be eliminated?Also, when mathematical calculations were on the hw the methods were not always well described in class so it was frustrating at times to figure out how to address the problems. More examples in class or in handouts would have greatly facilitated the hw assignments.",
    "This was a terrific intro course to genetics and the impact it has on public health and the medical community at large. The guest speakers were interesting and the topics covered were varied and useful.The class was well organized and run perfectly. I would only add that it would have been interesting to see how multipoint linkage is as compared to single locus linkage.",
    "I learned a lot of very useful information in the course that I will undoubtedly use throughout the course of my career. The workload was enormous, but Professor DeWan was receptive to our comments about the length of the midterm and the final exam was much more reasonable.",
    "I took this class to get an introductory-level exposure to genetics so that I could read scientific literature and understand the basics, and that is exactly what I got. It was a great class for those of us who don't have a background in genetics but might want to work with geneticists in the future. I also really appreciated that while the homework assignments were difficult, Professor DeWan really worked to make sure we understood the concepts behind them rather than harp on whether we got the answer right or not--which I feel is more important in a class geared to provide a basic overview. I felt like I learned more as a result of the combination of homework, take-homes, and the final paper rather than if it had been purely homework or exam based.",
    "You will leave the class with a strong understanding of current techniques in genetics research; however, be prepared to work hard and struggle with the material. Too much material is crammed into classes thus creating a situation where concepts are not well explained. There are weekly homework assignments that require knowledge outside of anything presented in class or within the assigned readings. This was the first semester the class was taught so things may change in following semesters."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Andy is great. Very good with timely feedback and very professional. Teaching could be improved by including more student discussion (which he did at the end of the semester). I also really enjoyed the guest lecturers as they provided a different view of the material.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Andy was very well prepared and attentive to students when we had questions. However, the knowledge of mathematical approaches to the calculations was not always well described as detailed in the previous question.The breadth and depth of the course was great and Andy did a great job of covering the basics while extending the concepts to broader applications and challenging us to apply ourknowledge to a subect area of interest (ex through the paper).",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor DeWan is a great teacher and is very approachable. He is very gracious with his time and is more than willing to provide guidance and assistance outside of the scheduled class time.His responses to questions are relevant and he is very willing to help!",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0I really enjoyed the course and Dr. Dewan was a wonderful professor. He was very enthusiastic about the material and made class fun. As a first year, I found the course a little more challenging than the others in my schedule; however, Dr. Dewan was always available to meet outside of class to discuss questions.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0A good instructor. He overestimated the workload that would be appropriate early in the semester, but was very receptive to our comments during the course of the semester. He was always available for comments or questions outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Professor DeWan was very approachable and responsive. He also did a good job explaining concepts that were sometimes difficult for the class (including me!) to grasp, and was very patient with us when we required multiple explanations. The seminar-style of the class was also very conducive to learning.",
    "Instructor: Andrew T. DeWan \u00a0Dr. DeWan is very approachable and willing to help students outside of the classroom whenever needed. Too much material is covered in class, so much time is needed outside of class to clarify confusing concepts."

   "comments": [
    "good overview of genetics. Worth the time and effort if you would like to work in epi genetics.",
    "Excellent for grasping genetic concepts but the workload was quite heavy and lectures\/books did not always present the tools needed to perform the assignments. That said, the instructor was always very accessible and happy to clarify any questions. If one had the time to dedicate and the interest in the subject it is an excellent class.",
    "A great course for those interested in getting the basics of genetics. It covers everything from the underlying biology, to the statistical aspects, to the ethical implications.I would make it required for those that don't have much genetics background and are interested in pursuing genetics as it lays down the basic groundwork that will be required in the future. A great class all around.",
    "This was a very useful course but the workload was significantly greaterthan any other class I took this semester.",
    "I would recommend it for those who have interests requiring interpretation of genetic research. Otherwise the class requires more effort than return. If things were explained more clearly in class I would fully recommend the course."
