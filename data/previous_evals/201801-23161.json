    "I took this class as a mechanical BS12 and learned a lot about a whole new world of technologies which I previously knew nothing about. I was matched with a biomedical engineering grad student for the final project and we used his biomedical expertise with my mechanical background to develop a novel biomedical micro device. Rong is a great professor and I very much enjoyed taking this class as an engineering elective.",
    "This class was more of a survey of the field of bioMEMS and microdevices than a development of new skills necessarily. I gained a lot of familiarity about the field, but I would need to do much more in depth learning to fully understand each of the topics.",
    "I learned the process of microdevice fabrication, as well as the different functions of many different components to microchips and current microtechnology in the field. There was also a small business component added to this class",

    "Strengths - small class size, Rong is incredibly nice, fairly low course load, interesting final project and paper Weaknesses - difficult to learn the material well, fairly dry topic",
    "There isnt a lot of discussion, so theres a lot of simply sitting and listening to lecture without any interaction. I think the course could be improved by the implementation of some in-class participation or discussion",

    "Depends on what they want from a class. If you are interested in the topic of microdevices and also the biotech industry, I would take this class as it gives you a gentle introduction to the subject. It's also a fairly low course load class. The labs were cool. If you're looking for a very rigorous and serious class, probably not for you.",
    "I would only recommend this course if the student was interested specifically in the material beforehand, because its a very niche course, though it is very applicable to the microdevice field",
