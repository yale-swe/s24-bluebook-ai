   "comments": [
    "This is a good introductory course. The P-Sets are not that hard, but the midterms can sneak up on you if you aren't careful. The individualized sections are much better than the general lecture, and you learn much more in a smaller environment. 8 P-Sets, 2 midterms, and a final is not too hard.",
    "comprehensive, and if you do the readings and homework in a timely fashion, very doable",
    "This class was about as enjoyable as I think it's possible for an intro stats class to be. However, I found the second half of this course, taught by Professor Rader, to be much more frustrating than the first. Because she didn't post any of the lecture slides or give us practice problems other than those on the PSETS, I found it significantly more difficult and stressful to study for the final exam (a large portion of our grade!) Overall, I think Professor Rader would benefit from working to improve her teaching skills and her communication with students.",
    "This is a basic stats class broken into two parts. The first part is basic stats which wasn't too challenging and the second had a focus on polisci, which was more difficult but moved at a much slower pace. Overall, pretty boring class but good for getting rid of requirements.",
    "Good intro to stats. Take the PLSC section is you need to for the major or are specifically interested in voter behavior (the scope of the applications was pretty limited to this).",
    "Always wanted to be \"statistics-literate\", and now I'm on my way! Interesting format.., like the first half of the class with Jonathan Reuning-Scherer... very persistently cheery lecturer, despite boring students, clickers were a fun way to mix in participation...great lecture slides. 2nd half was interesting, Prof. Rader seems nice although unfortunately I didn't attend too many classes during the 2nd half of the semester...no lecture slides available online because Prof. Rader wanted us to be in class to see the slides... I understand where she is coming from but still felt like a little bit too much.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this course to anyone b\/c the material is the most tedious thing ever. That being said, I recognize that statistics is something that everyone should have some experience with and that some people have requirements to fill. Anyone with some interest in politics should definitely take this course though they may hate it.",
    "Take Stats if you want a pretty easy QR credit and a basic introduction to statistical literacy!",
    "Honestly, if I knew how the second part of the course was going to be, I wouldn't have taken this course. As a humanities major, I was looking for a QR I was familiar with, and I got entirely over my head. Maybe if I was mathematically inclined, my response would be another story. However, there isn't a clear guideline as to what individual sections are going to be like for your discipline. If you need this course, take it. But beware about breaking into sections. Choose your section very very very carefully. If you don't need this course, don't take it. Maybe it was the fact that this was my instructor's first time teaching, but it was bad. If Rader is teaching, think twice.",
    "Fine distributional requirement class. Work is regular, so no huge surprises. Curve is pretty unnecessarily harsh. P-sets are long in terms of time and class can be pretty boring because of content.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who is interested in Statistics but does not know any calculus. The concept could be a bit abstract without maths, but the concepts are useful.",
    "This class is deceptively difficult, especially for someone who has never taken calculus. This lectures were confusing and section was easily my worst experience in a class ever at Yale. Would not recommend. Kelly Radar's poli sci section was a disaster-- avoid at all costs.",
    "If you're humanities and need a QR credit, take STAT 102, but be warned. The first 8 weeks when everyone's together aren't the most interesting for every student. But in STAT 102 in the last month, Professor Rader is honestly the best QR professor I've had. She makes sure students know what's going on and how to do the different things, instead of just assuming everyone gets it right away.",
    "This class was very software based and I don't think having a high school background in statistics helped at all.",
    "Good intro stats course for people looking for a basic stats course.",
    "Very difficult and a lot of programming",
    "Introduction to statistics that also lets you explore a subject you are interested in. The teacher for 102 was new and that section could be improved.",
    "Would recommend this to a fellow student. However, it is much more statistical rather than polisci. More emphasis on statistics and math with a loose draping of polisci.",
    "I thought this was a really important class to take because stats is so important in every professional avenue. I thought this class was easily accessible and they made it easy to succeed, which I really really appreciated. I also like how it splits up, I found the political science part directly applicable to the work I do in the political science major and in my summer internships",
    "I would recommend Stat 102 to any student seeking a basic introduction to the statistical methods that might be used later on in social sciences courses (especially political science). It's not a course directed toward people who want a fast-paced statistics class or who already have some knowledge of the field, but as an introductory course it is effective. The teaching is good and the pace is manageable.",
    "This stats course is a great way to introduce you to reading graphs and charts. It also makes you realize that you may not have been reading statistical information correctly before. I would recommend this course to other students who wish to take a math course but are not in any math related major."
