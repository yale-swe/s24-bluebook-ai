   "comments": [
    "Maybe. There's a high likelihood in such a course for there to be a student who offers his (often misguided) opinion quite a bit. This would normally be OK, but more than any failing of the professor, I felt that lectures were slowed down by this sort of thing. I'd recommend it to someone if it were taught with more example proofs and lecture notes with these on them being handed out.",
    "Set Theory is a fascinating subject, a blend of math and philosophy that appeals to a range of students. The math is pretty simple, which makes the class great as a second math class for math majors, or a class for students who enjoy math but who want an alternative to the calculus track. I don't know if Professor Neusel will be teaching this class again, but she was great, clear and helpful, and very fair in her testing and grading.",
    "Good course. Very detail-oriented. You will build up mathematical structures starting with almost nothing, which is interesting, but doesn't exactly get you to anything novel.",
    "Set Theory is a gorgeous subject. It's really quite wonderful to be able to answer, absolutely rigorously, the question \"what is a number?\" I believe Professor Neusel is only here this year (though she's a great instructor, very clear, very nice, so you should take 305 with her next spring!), so a comment such as \"this was a really easy class\" or \"the textbook was solid, though not the best intro Set Theory book out there\" [Hrbacek and Jech, for those curious]would be rather unhelpful, but Gregg Zuckerman, who usually teaches 270, is also a very nice man, so...you should take Set Theory! (230 should probably be a prereq, though - the more upper-level math you've seen, the better you'll be able to understand the material.)",
    "Not good. Awful text (if the Hrbacek and Jech text is being used, you might as well burn it - it will be more useful to you as firewood than as a math textbook) and very little explanation of concepts from the professor. A poor course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any Math major or to anyone interested in the foundations of mathematics. It is difficult but not as bad as other math classes at Yale.",
    "This class is an introduction to Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory that develops the topic from the ground up. The course started with a definition ofsets, proceeded to define functions, relations, natural numbers, etc. in terms of sets, and then showed that the structures so defined actually had the properties we expected them to have. (This essentially showed how other branches of mathematics could be developed within set theory)I would recommend this to anyone interested in the foundations of mathematics or with a strong interest in abstract mathematics.",
    "This course provides a good introduction to Set Theory. Very eye-opening.",
    "This is an interesting class that is not too much work. There are usually only a couple problems due each week and in general they do not take too much time. The material is interesting and probably unlike what you will see in other math classes. Professor Neusel is extremely nice and very helpful. A warning however, her lectures can often be unclear and disorganized, so definitely read the book.",
    "If you've taken a class in which you've done proofs, and you enjoy theoretical math even just a little, the class will likely be good for you. It's a lot of fun to start from almost nothing and construct the natural numbers, operations, the reals, and so on.",
    "Set Theory is mathematics reduced to its fundamentals, and built back up again. Effectively, this course starts math over, and then redefines it more rigorously. The course answers questions I never knew existed regarding the nature of math itself. This, combined with a very in depth treatment of infinity, makes it a very interesting experience you will have trouble explaining to your parents.The work is all reasonable, and focuses entirely on proofs instead of computations. Take this course if you enjoy or would like to experiment with abstract mathematics.",
    "The subject is a little dry and rigid, but prof Neusel is very friendly and helpful",
    "Good course, professor, and textbook. The material can be tricky, but the amount of work is not that demanding."
