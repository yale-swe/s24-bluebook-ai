    "The class requires a lot of practice, but it's really good and useful for anyone that is involved in music. It teaches you to better hear intrrvals, sightsing, and just to think more when performing music. It's definitely a useful course to take to better understand music!",
    "I enjoyed this course very much, and came away with much stronger sight-singing skills, in particular, than I had before. However, I'm not sure that 'Elementary Musicianship' is quite an accurate name - I've taken three music theory courses at Yale, through MUSI 210, and I was still challenged at times by this course, especially by the piano labs (I'm definitely not an accomplished pianist!). Please don't let that scare you away, though - a lot of the class is designed for students to move at their own pace, and lots of extra help is available if needed. If you have any idea what Roman numeral analysis is, you'll be fine. For us, class met twice weekly, and then we scheduled once-a-week individual piano labs with the instructor, for which we prepared different exercises, working from scales up to harmonic progressions and inversions (with figured bass). The transposition project at the end of the semester was really fun! If you're interested, try to take it with Kara Leaman - she's the best! She's excellent at explaining musical concepts, and so patient and sweet. Class with her was always fun and enlightening. She was also extremely accommodating with rescheduling the weekly piano labs if needed, despite the fact that her own schedule is probably quite busy."
