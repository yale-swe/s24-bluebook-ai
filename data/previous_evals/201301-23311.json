    "I would advise taking this class as soon after Intro Screenwriting as possible, or when you have a lot of energy and excitement about a story idea and want to hear very blunt (but helpful) criticism of it, and how to tailor it for the professional\/hollywood style.",
    "NOT THE SAME AS INTRO. because you don't have that insane midterm you instead have to film a scene from your screenplay and it's very stressful. On the upside, you're done early, it's much less work, but it's hard to do it. don't take hte class unless you're serious about writing a 30 minute film. come into the class with an idea.",
    "Take it. It is similar to intro, except this time you are writing a 30 page short. You also have to film one of your scenes.",
    "Yes. It's fairly similar to Intro Screenwriting, but you have to write a 30 page script and film a short scene from it to present to the class. Good notes from Marc Lapadula and the other students make the class a great way to workshop your writing and improve.Take it if you're interested in the craft and you liked the format of intro.",
    "You write a 30 page screenplay, and films a scene. Very straightforward.",
    "I think the class is deffinitely worth the time if you can fit it in if for no other reasons than to think about screenplays once a week."
