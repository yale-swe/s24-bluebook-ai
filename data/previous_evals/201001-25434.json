   "comments": [
    "It's a great class for anyone looking to get a little more depth on the intricate details behind the confusing system of international law. If you have any interest in human rights or int'l affairs in general, and want to really gain some useful skills in law interpretation, this class is a good bet. The readings are significant and were on occasion overwhelming and dry, and I definitely had days when I skipped significant portions. But overall, I learned a great deal and am very happy with the new skills I've gained.",
    "I would recommend the class if you want a good grounding and understanding of human rights. You get to hear from a bunch of interesting guest speakers. Go in knowing that it's going to be more like a seminar than a lecture and Metcalf is great, but not the most exciting or inspiring speaker.",
    "This course was extremely interesting and I learned a LOT from the material. I really enjoyed some of our class discussions, as well as the speakers that came frequently. The workload was definitely TOO MUCH for an undergrad course, and I wish it had been structured a little better, so don't take it if you're not really interested in the material. but if you are and are willing to dedicate a bunch of time to the class, i think it was worth it in the end. just be prepared for a TON of reading. overall I loved the class and Hope was an awesome professor (reallychill).",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! If you have any interest in human rights, this class is a necessity in your education. Even if you think you know human rights, the other people will add so much to your experience. The readings are long, but the guest lectures combined with the professor make this class phenomenal!",
    "yes! definitely take this class. it is a lot of work and it can be daunting at times, but you really learn a lot about human rights.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject!",
    "This class has been easily one of the best classes I've taken here. The more technical examination of the international human rights structures at the start of the class can be tiresome but you have to know this stuff. The more case based section is fascinating. The project involves a 15 page paper written over the course of the semester where you analyse one specific human rights violation. There is a lot of reading but you don't have to do all of it. I learned an incredible amount in a short space of time and Hope Metcalf is frankly incredible. Definitely take it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend International Human Rights Law to another student, especially if Professor Metcalf is teaching it. The material is interesting and provides a comprehensive study of international human rights institutions and mechanisms, the class size made it possible to have engaged and active dicussions, and Metcalf's experience and connections with the many speakers she brought in gave us insight into a variety of ways to be involved in the human rights community. Take this class!",
    "Yes-- great overview of the subject if you are interested in international human rights law and institutions. Especially yes if Hope teaches it again.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Human rights are an increasingly important framework to understand and study.",
    "Run very much like a law school class",
    "I would recommend the course to students with a strong interest in International Human Rights *law*, because the course operates almost exclusively within a legal framework, which can be both helpful and frustrating. Lots of reading (including dense legal texts, which can be frustrating), but overall, not too challenging.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you're interested in international human rights, especially from a legal standpoint. My one warning is that the vast majority of the people likely to be enrolled this class (at least when I was in it) are unbelievably obnoxious, naive, and unintelligent."
