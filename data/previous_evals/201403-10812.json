   "comments": [
    "Takes a lot of time and patience.",
    "It's required so you have no choice really.",
    "I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not have to take it, not because the material is uninteresting, but because the way in which it was taught did not leave, at least me, with a deeper understanding of the material, which is both important, but also what makes learning rewarding. In general, I found this to be the case in all of the first-year courses: the teaching was for the most part uninspired, and professors were overly ambitious about how much material could be conveyed in the amount of time given. I would have rather studied fewer topics in more depth than many topics at only a shallow level. Further, it did not go unnoticed that teaching and teaching quality are not priorities, which added to the difficulty of gaining a deeper understanding of the material. I understand the great benefit the department receives from high-quality research, but to push teaching quality to the background in favor of professors' research seems like a poor choice in the long run. High-quality teaching seems like an investment in future high-quality research, which is something in which the department is likely takes an interest. Overall, I was substantially disappointed in the quality of teaching this semester.",
    "It is a required course I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Good introduction to graduate principles of microeconomics.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student because it is the foundation for any graduate level study of economics. What I loved about the course is that studying microeconomics up through general equilibrium gave me a clear understanding of the juncture between microeconomics, macroeconomics, and finance. The material presented in this class is crucial to master in order to study related fields in economics, and this class accomplishes that perfectly.",
    "I think this course is mostly useful for graduate economic students, and not very relevant to other students.",
    "Good foundation",
    "It is rigorous, and covers all basics for microeconomics. Even for people who have taken advanced microeconomics courses, this could be a good refresher course.",
    "Yes. It's a must.",
    "I would recommend this class, it was interesting and helpful"

   "comments": [
    "Will contribute to knowledge for my discipline.",
    "This course did not deepen my knowledge of the discipline as much as I had hoped. Perhaps that is was second year courses are for.",
    "Make me have a solid foundation of the economic theory, which prepares me for the following courses.",
    "It has contributed a lot towards my entry into the field of economics. I plan on implementing a general equilibrium model in research and so this course has been essential towards my progress.",
    "I was somewhat prepared for this course in advance,so it was not extremely important. I would suggest adding more applied material in the second quarter. Since all economic student study theory, on the first year, but not everyone studies applied theory, I think the micro course should include both. Learning one less proof in the second quarter would have been worth it if we would have learnt a recent example, at the research Frontier, or an example of why this theory is important.",
    "Learn fundamental methods of analysis of economic problems",
    "I don't know if it has contributed to my dissertation or research in anyway as of yet. But it certainly has helped me refresh concepts in microeconomics.",
    "It's a basic course that lays the foundation for future research."
