    "yes. take this class if it fulfills your requirements or even if you have some interest in empires. readings are interesting and discussion is great. workload is not that heavy.",
    "Empires and Imperialism has been a fun class, as the material being examined is engaging. We cover empires from Rome, the Ottomans, the Aztecs, Incas, to the European, British, and American empire. In particular, Michael Mann's \"Incoherent Empire\" was a very good read. The professors did not clearly outline how our finals grades were determined, so that is some cause for concern, unless they intend on grading everyone fairly generously. We, in some way, were being assessed on discussion, a short paper, a long paper, and a one time blog submission. The blog is a good outlet for people who do not talk as much in class. I hope Stamatov actually uses the blog to assess participation in addition to class discussion. One aspect of the course that truly impressed me is that we were allowed a second chance submission for our short paper. I believe that this is valuable, not merely as a tool for getting a higher grade, but as a chance to see how you can improve your research and writing skill.This course is mixed with graduate students and undergrads. So while the input from each person is interesting, it is also a bit intimidating since the grad students know so much about the topic already. The only minor complaints that I have is that it is very early, 9.25 AM. But since it only meets once a week, I think that this is very tolerable. Finally, the essay topics were somewhat limited by the prompts that we were given--I particularly didn't like that, but it was tolerable. Overall, I would say that this is a great, engaging yet relaxed course. It allows lots of flexibility for what you want to study via the blog, and the workload is manageable.",
    "A great course with one short paper of 5 to 10 pages and one longer paper of 10 to 15 pages. The readings are interesting and manageable and the in class discussion is free form and dependent upon the mix of students in the class."
