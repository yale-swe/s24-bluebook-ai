   "comments": [
    "A very helpful class, although the time spent on logistics was frustrating (especially in the lead-up to the midterm). It would be much less painful if logistic-related discussion was limited to 5 minutes at most, such that the content could be the primary focus of each class.",
    "Good course and definitely helps learning how to use SAS and do analyses",
    "It would be great that they could record the class online like it was done with Cost Effectiveness class (being a class given at Winslow it can be done), because the class goes very fast and if you missed something it's hard to catch up.",
    "AAMIE is one of those courses that changes your academic life. It really brings together what we are learning in epidemiology and biostatistics and challenges us to think about our own research goals. I liked the course being on Monday afternoons, because Monday was my \"busy\" day; I got a lot done. It would be nice to have some kind of SAS walkthrough during lecture, but with the current difficulty level it is not necessary. It seems that a more calculable grading system for the course would be preferred, but because of the nature of the course I can understand why this is not the case already. Examples for table summaries must be included in the future. It is too difficult to understand from week to week what is and what is not necessary in the summaries without clear examples in class. I love the take-home midterm and final. It allows me a fun coding session during midterms and finals that is much less stressful than other courses.",
    "The lecture is well organized. Topics are interesting and useful. I am happy about the course, and couldn't think of any weakness.",
    "For me, this class seemed to be too similar to Biostats. As an EMD student, I was also disappointed that the class was so focused on chronic epi and had almost nothing to do with infectious epi. It was helpful to learn the SAS code more in-depth in the labs, but I didn't find the lectures to be particularly useful.",
    "My overall assessment of the course is excellent. I liked the professor's teaching style. No weaknesses at all.",
    "Great course. Really nice and easy way to learn SAS.",
    "Really helpful for practical quantitative analysis.",
    "Very good course to practice skill in SAS. Only suggestion is that provide more examples in detail to students how others solve real questions",
    "Very frustrating grading system, that leaves very little room for improvement or any sort of mistakes. I couldn't learn from my mistakes because I was constantly being bombarded by minutia (for which I would get significant amounts of points off), and I share this critique with many of my fellow students.",
    "I went in hating SAS so much, and came out hating SAS a little less...but still hate it. We are beginning to understand each other though :) Mayur makes SAS palatable. He tries his best to keep the material entertaining, but helps also to tie together your learning in other courses. The slides contain a lot of information, which is necessary, but it is sometimes inundating to get through them.",
    "2 hours is a long time on Monday to spend learning about SAS. I do feel like I have a good grasp on the program now though.",
    "Strengths: Allows students to learn and not focus on grades. Labs clearly help students be successful on the exams while learning material that will be useful on thesis and beyond. Also allows students to learn how to create tables that are seen in peer-reviewed journals. Weaknesses: It would be great to do the coding while going through lecture. However, since this is not immediately feasible, it would be great for the instructor to run through the coding on the screen. At least then we can see exactly what is going on.",
    "I think the course is good. I like the overall structure and the way the exams reinforce what has been covered in a practical way. The slides have a lot of sas output on them, which is fine, but sometimes there would be 6-10 slides in a row that looked very similar and I would have trouble distinguishing were the professor was in the lecture and what he was actually trying to demonstrate. This could also have been the time of day of the lecture--the 3:00-4:50pm time is was challenging for students with a full Monday course load.",
    "Great class that ties in the concepts for biostatistics and epidemiology into a practical application. The lectures were clear to understand, the labs did a good job of building on the lectures.",
    "This course offers a wonderful opportunity to get knitty gritty with SAS. However, the bulk of the learning occurs during the labs themselves.",
    "The lab instructions are very clear and straightforward. The lecture slides could be clearer.",
    "Excellent-- like the libname video",
    "The main strength of the course is that it is very useful for learning how an epidemiology paper is actually formulated. The main weakness of this course is that lecture is long and not really engaging. Nearly 2 hours of coding on the wall is hard to focus on. Also the grading system is very confusing and unsettling. I think if the grading system would be improved, the course would be more enjoyable.",
    "for what it was, it was a good course taught by probably the best person that can teach it; however, SAS is a completely new language for most people in the course, and that becomes a huge frustration for people who are not necessarily into code but have to take this class as a requirement",
    "Makes things so clear",
    "Strengths: - extremely useful course for anyone who wants to learn SAS and be able to do basic statistical analyses and how to manage data in SAS",
    "This course should be more applied, less of a criticism about the foolish things that are published. Understanding the mistakes other researchers make could be useful, listening to endless rants is not.",
    "very good",
    "This course was excellent in honing our SAS skills and building upon our SAS knowledge base. For students who want to refine their coding skills and learn more about SAS on a technical level, this course is perfect.",
    "I appreciated this class because it made SAS more clear for me than BIS505A previously had. It also went into far greater detail of the SAS basics than BIS505A and B. However, the material was relatively redundant considering most of us were concurrently taking Epi II and Biostats II. The midterm was fair but the curve was a bit harsh. Additionally, more time could have been spent on the writing components of the course so all of us could have had a stronger understanding of what was expected going into the midterm.",
    "Weaknesses - class lectures were not always as helpful as they could have been. Having class on Monday afternoons was also tough, but I'm not sure if anything can be done about that.",
    "Thorough class about SAS and its applications. While Mayur makes the course engaging, it's hard to concentrate for two hours being lectured at about a statistical software. I feel like more could be gained from the class if the amount of lab time was increased or if it became more lab based.",
    "The class is great! The labs and lectures prepare you very well for the exams. I feel like I actually understand SAS very well now and could use it to do my own analyses.",
    "Difficult to learn that material via lecture, but much easier to do so in lab (since it's coding based). Would have preferred fewer lecture hours and more lab time.",
    "This course has been so useful and has improved my knowledge and skills with SAS. After my first semester of biostatistics I felt uneasy with SAS, and this class started from scratch and taught us the essential basics as well as how to do various types of analyses. Learning how to fill in tables will so helpful when it comes time to write a thesis and possibly research articles in the future. I really enjoyed the midterm and final exams. They were fun to do, and I heard many students say the same. One suggestion I have for the exams is providing a couple of additional minor hints, such as providing the N at different steps, throughout to let students know they're on the right page. I also felt like the lectures were too long. Listening about SAS for two hours straight gets a bit mundane, and I would rather have spent more time in lab working on assignments. We would often run out of time in lab, so maybe shorten the lectures and lengthen the labs a bit to get a better balance.",
    "This truly is a GREAT course. It is indeed the most applicable and skill-based course I took at YSPH. It taught me the true fundamentals of SAS and now I can feel confident tell employers that I am sufficient in SAS. The independent nature of the midterm and final exam make this course a true learning experience that is both challenging and rewarding. I highly recommend this course even if you don't have to take it!",
    "The course was a helpful introduction to SAS. The labs were the most useful portion in actually understanding and applying the material. The lecture could probably be significantly shortened and still convey the material effectively.",
    "In biostats, the data you work with is perfectly groomed. This class teaches you to work with more realistic, incomplete data sets while still being able to glean useful info.",
    "This course was probably the most helpful I've taken this semester. However, the grading system needs a little improvement. Mayur says not to focus so much on the homework assignment grades but rather on understanding the material. However, that is hard to do when you don't really know where you stand in the class. Suggestions: --Rather than making the lab assignments worth 3 points each, maybe opt for 5 points. If you make 1-2 small coding mistakes, you will lose an entire point, which is basically a 66% grade for that lab assignment. I understand labs aren't supposed to count for that much but when your grade is based off of just based off of homework assignments, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final, you want to make sure you're doing as well as you can in all aspects. --Have assignments returned to students the day before the next lab assignment is due. That way, students are able to know what mistakes they did in the past lab and prevent them from occurring again in the next lab. While we don't lose points for the same mistakes in the previous lab, the assignments usually do build off each other so it's likely that our answers will continue to be wrong.",
    "very good",
    "Best course taken this semester. Learned real skills that i can apply to real world situations. Mayur is literally the best professor at YSPH.",
    "For students interested in research specifically using SAS, this is a good course. I do not think this should be an SBS requirement. As a student interested in public health practice, I'm frustrated that I had to take this course when a better suited alternative would be more beneficial to my interests.",
    "I thought the first few class meetings of this course were superb. Learning the SAS fundamentals was useful and interesting. However, beyond those two classes, the class rapidly got excessively repetitive and slow. Looking at row and column percents week after week when the concept is fairly well understood becomes very tiresome. Going through the multiple types of regression was interesting and useful, but the basic concepts could probably be abbreviated in those secondary lectures, to reduce redundancy and increase student engagement. The laboratory assignments were frequently short and a bit scripted. I can understand wanting to limit the amount of time spent grading, but requiring similar code from everyone gives a fairly two-dimensional view of the program. Many of the slides used in the course were very old, and appeared to be taken from much older versions of SAS. While this does not cause any coding problems, since no major coding changes have occurred, the display out of the output has changed a fair amount over the years, so it is frustrating to try and read the different outputs, when they are named differently, etc.",
    "This class did not meet my expectations. This could be because previous students' rave reviews set a very high bar, but, regardless, I do not feel as if course material was presented in a way that will aid me in research as much as second-years have said. A major weakness of the class was the slides. White slides with black text were difficult to follow and difficult to extract important information from.",
    "This course is a fantastic SAS course. I really feel like I have a concrete understanding of SAS now and got to this point in a relatively painfree way. The assignments were all very well laid out and helpful and the assessments built on what we had practiced.",
    "I feel a lot more comfortable with SAS after taking this course. The lecture material was a little difficult to follow w\/o being able to see it in action, especially given out time slot, but the labs were really helpful in reinforcing the topics we covered in class.",
    "I had SAS experience beforehand, so I didn't learn all that much, although I did pick up some useful techniques (e.g. arrays). The workload and assignments were appropriate.",
    "It is a good applicable course. It is difficult to stay focused in class, because SAS is easiest to learn when you are actually in front of the computer. The lab sessions were very good. Maybe it could be more interactive, where Dr. Desai actually does the SAS in class with us and we have slides which require filling in. Exams were fair, and I did feel that after doing the exams, that I had learned a lot. The grading system is quite difficult to understand though.",
    "Excellent instructor, but I did not like the way labs were graded. It was also very hard to gauge where in the class we stood without a concrete grading system, but I think the point was to kind of get us not to focus on the grade so much and just focus on learning from our mistakes. I found the class particularly challenging for me, as I don't find myself to be very good at SAS, but I appreciated the course and still think I learned quite a bit. Assessments are fair overall.",
    "I liked the structure of that class. Grading of midterm was so ridiculous. We all made jokes because we have no idea what we got or where we stood in terms of grades Regardless we learned a lot.",
    "This was a great way to become more familiar with SAS and working with data. The strengths include the knowledgeable and engaging instructor and TFs. The only way it could be improved is by shortening the length of lectures or by teaching us even more in the same amount of time.",
    "The one thing that bothered me was the grading system. It is incredibly difficult to know where you stand in the class because the grading system is very different from what is normal.",
    "AAME is a great course to get familiar with SAS and to build confidence in their skills. It's a lot of work but ultimately a great opportunity to develop marketable skills. The slides for the course are very useful in developing code and understanding what each line of code represents. I also liked the practice of TAs waiting for students to give ideas for how to construct code which really solidifies our understanding of how to write SAS code from scratch.",
    "This is one of the top 3 classes I took so far. I loved Dr. Desai and he is an amazing teacher. I will definitely remember and adore the moments from this class through out my career.",
    "The course is very useful and helps get a better grasp on SAS. It may be helpful of what we learned in AAMIE coincided with what we were learning in stats or epidemiology.",
    "Worth taking.",
    "Very helpful and challenging. I learned a lot more than I anticipated and it proved to be incredibly helpful!",
    "This course taught me quite a bit of sas and was very helpful but a weakness was that TFs were not consistent with grading each lab and as a result would get points off on the midterm when the TF failed to do so on the homework.",
    "This course was very helpful in learning how to use the SAS program."

He tells great stories to keep us engaged in class and really takes apart all of the examples he gives so that we can understand them. His lectures are some of the few that many students feel comfortable asking questions in the large Winslow arena style classroom. I believe this is because of his forthright yet friendly demeanor and rapport with his student.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur is a very nice and responsible person who respond to question quickly.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Mayur has a great personality and is very upbeat; however, I wish that during the lectures he would stay more on-topic and focused on the lecture material instead of talking about minor details or side stories for long periods of time. This could easily cut the lecture by 30 minutes.",

He could very well end the class early on days when there is little material to cover, but he fills it up with unnecessary comments. Spending 40 minutes reviewing grading for the midterm was unnecessary.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Regardless of what he actually feels toward his teaching and his students, Dr. Desai exudes a fairly strong vibe of 'I don't care what you think,' to the extent that he'll probably stop reading this evaluation beyond this first sentence. Everything in the class seemed scripted toward his preferences and toward his convenience. He was perfectly frank with us about this, but it still was difficult to engage in a class where it didn't seem like the professor cared. The actual lectures were fairly scattered. Frequently, we would spend about 20 minutes at the beginning and end of class talking about fairly inane things that could be quickly explained in an e-mail, cutting out a significant portion of the actual teaching time. Not turning the lights down during the lecture made it a little difficult to see the slides.",
    "Instructor: Mayur Mahesh Desai \u00a0Dr. Desai is so personable and entertaining, however his teaching style was not compatible with the way I learn.

Mayur is very good at reminding us of things we have accomplished which helped me stay motivated throughout the course. Mayer is also very good at explaining what the various SAS procs mean and how they relate to the underlying statistical analysis that SAS is performing.

   "comments": [
    "This is a good course for students to take especially if they will be using SAS",
    "This is a class that will teach you step by step how to use SAS. I struggled with SAS during Biostats, and this was a course that made me feel comfortable and confident with SAS. The labs are a very important component of the course, because it is where you apply what was taught in class. I really recommend this class.",
    "A must take. Not a lot of outside class time work, but one of the only methods class I've taken and know that my professional life after YSPH will be much better off for it. Wish we had more classes like AAMIE.",
    "I have learnt useful epidemiology and basic SAS techniques through this course. It gonna help my future career in multiple ways. I would definitely recommend it to other students.",
    "More in-depth SAS coding but the same topics as Biostats. Useful for CDE students but less so for EMD students. Gets a requirement out of the way, but not sure how useful the class was overall.",
    "It is a highly practical and research oriented course. Hence, I would strongly recommend it to fellow students.",
    "I would recommend this course. I have no negatives to say about it.",
    "Really useful for practical quantitative analysis.",
    "Useful course if u are interested in research",
    "It is a good course to practice SAS skills and I would recommend to another student who wants to learn more about SAS",
    "This will suck up all of your time, and you won't understand why you get so much credit off for the tiniest things. Might ruin your semester.",
    "Challenging course, especially for SAS novices, but you will learn a lot.",
    "It's a very important course. It teaches you SAS application step by step.",
    "It's a great course, and I would definitely recommend to all YSPH students, especially since we are exposed to SAS the first semester.",
    "Good class- better if you like SAS. Even if you don't, you can get through it.",
    "Take if you want more experience analyzing data in SAS.",
    "This is a great course, especially for students who will go on to analyze data for their thesis. This is the only course that also shows how to format and create tables to accompany journal articles.",
    "The course involved weekly lab assignments, which get progressively more difficult as the semester progresses, as well as two take-home exams that cover the material covered in labs and lectures. It is good if you want to develop a better understanding of SAS.",
    "Great class to take especially before summer internship.",
    "I really enjoyed this course. The midterm\/final were definitely a lot of work, but were extremely fair and solidly grounded on the concepts\/techniques learned in weekly lab assignments. There were no surprises. I only wish the grading scheme for the course was a bit more transparent (I think this may have been a major issue for some)",
    "This course is very useful in forcing you to learn SAS in a practical sense.",
    "I would recommend it!",
    "very SAS-ified with the course",
    "Yes",
    "If you understand and can use SAS do not take this class. If you need practice you will get it from this class and the slides will be helpful for learning the codes.",
    "very practical",
    "I would recommend this course because it really enhances one's knowledge of SAS, which can be very useful later on in any data analysis a student engages in.",
    "I thought that AAMIE was useful for learning SAS fundamentals. However, the remainder of the course overlapped a lot with BIS 505B.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, because you will learn the SAS skills necessary to do your own data analyses of any projects you might work on. You will learn how to troubleshoot in SAS and become more confident!",
    "Would recommend; gives useful coding skills.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to other students, it is so helpful in learning SAS. The skills taught in this course are essential for MPH students.",
    "The course is a good introduction to SAS- I would absolutely recommend it to another student for its content. Personally, I didn't benefit from the lectures as much as I did from the lab portion.",
    "While it was difficult and challenging, Mayur's class was the most useful class I've taken this semester.",
    "Recommend it if you want to learn how to use SAS",
    "Great course! You will learn actual analytical skills that will come in handy in the future. Mayur rocks!!! Take this course, it is worth the exorbitant pricetag of YSPH.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student interested in conducting research using SAS. I do not recommend for students not interested in research.",
    "This class is useful if you know you're going to be using SAS later on in your career. If it looks like other programing languages will be more useful, I'd avoid this, since this class is only concerned with data management and analysis within SAS. The first few fundamental classes were excellent to learn, and would be great as an introduction in the fall semester of biostats, since SAS was used throughout that course without much information. However, the remainder of AAMiE could have been fairly seamlessly integrated into a biostats course without much trouble, since we had already introduced and discussed nearly all of the information and code by the time we reached it in AAMiE.",
    "A really useful class to gain a solid understanding of data analysis and feel prepared to endeavor on an analysis on your own- great going into a summer internship or thesis work.",
    "Great way to put SAS to use in an applied way. The course goes beyond what you learn in BIS505 and teaches a variety of strategies for data analysis.",
    "Useful, would definitely recommend it.",
    "The lecture material may be a little dry, but it is very useful for research and other classes. I would recommend it because you do learn a lot and can do basic data analysis with SAS.",
    "Mandatory for CDE students but I loved it. I actually feel like I know SAS now.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they feel they need more practice in SAS or if they are EMD students who don't want to take Epi II. However, if they don't plan to use SAS, they are probably better off taking some other class.",
    "I learned a lot about SAS! A little boring, but it definitely isn't an easy subject to make interesting. Overall very good course.",
    "Taking this class was the best decision I made this semester. This class allowed us to learn baby steps in writing and understanding the analysis part of a paper. If you ever want to write paper, you should take this class",
    "It's a course teaching SAS methods. Definitely take it because of the knowledge it provides.",
    "You can learn all the key analytic skills to write a CDE paper in this class.",
    "For learning and applying SAS this course is necessary. You'll learn a lot and be able to use SAS no matter your skill level upon entering the class.",
    "Very helpful",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was extremely helpful in helping me understand how to use SAS."
