   "comments": [
    "This course is highly recommended to anyone interested in the history of science and science and technology studies. Students will learn to think critically about scientific \"expertise\", objectivity, knowledge production.",
    "This reading course provides an overview of current scholarly work in the history of science, emphasizing three areas that often frame historical studies: expertise, embodiment, and global\/local. I would recommend this course for anyone remotely interested in the history of science. Paola is an amazing instructor and teaches much more than the content of each week's reading.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to other students. While it is inevitably of use for graduate students in the history of science, it also has applications for those in other disciplines within the humanities, not least because of the methodologies the field has honed to examine knowledge production. Paola Bertucci has also designed this particular version of the course with enough interdisciplinary breadth to be relevant a diverse array of scholars.",
    "The class is a great overview of the state of the field (History of Science). I would definitely recommend the course to another student.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone wishing to engage in the current debates and problems in the history of science and STS from the perspective of an historian wishing to write work in this area."

   "comments": [
    "As this course was a core requirement for me, what I learned will certainly guide the way I formulate a dissertation topic and gave me a firm grounding of what are the central problems that inspire the questions of historians of science.",
    "It was a great introduction to the field. The approaches and \"problems\" we discussed will definitely inform my future work.",
    "new insights and approaches were offered and we were able to discuss them vividly in class. writing reading responses before class helped me to focus on the important elements of each publication. at the same time, reading the responses from my class mates helped me compare the different approaches and insights every one of them offered and they provided a great starting point for discussion in class."
