   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in the Middle East, this is probably a good class for you. Professor Lawrence is great.",
    "If you have any interest in the topic, take it! The professor is great, the workload ideal, and the final paper offers you the opportunity to explore whatever subject you're interested in.",
    "\"Everything you wanted to know about the Middle East, and never thought it was politically correct to ask\" is what this class should be called. It kinda goes over everything about the Middle East, even if you think that's actually not possible. I think the week on suicide bombings pretty much encapsulates this class because it talks about what is stereotypically the Middle East. The approaches we took were also interesting because they werent highly-technical. Most of the class revolved around your (in)ability to figure out why the readings were always wrong and write about that (even if you agreed with them). TO some extent, the written assignments felt like you were in an English class, and not just a confirmation of your having done the readings, or had something sincere to say about the readings, as opposed to forcing a reason as to why what you read was lacking, or wrong, etc.",
    "I would recommend it if the student already had some background in the Middle East, which I didn't.",
    "If you're interested in Middle East politics, I would at least shop Professor Lawrence's class. She's a very nice person and she does her best to select interesting readings that foster good discussion. The class also doesn't have too heavy a workload (maybe 150 pg of reading\/wk, 3 2-3 page response papers and a final paper).However, she doesn't do as good a job at framing the readings in a way that articulates a clear thesis about the course. Sometimes I think she was still debating whether she believed that the Middle East was exceptional, which was frustrating. I also think she could have done a better job of communicating how to support one's opinion about the Middle East given the course material.Bottom line: if the material sounds interesting to you, I would consider taking the course.",
    "Tis is an interesting class on the Middle East. It's a good class if you're interested in the overall region, but not if you want to learn about any particular countries or topics. It lacks direction in terms of discussion and reading topics.",
    "It's a good class. You should be prepared to participate in section though. If that's not your thing, don't take it.",
    "It was a good course that provided some interesting materials and I would recommend it to a fellow student. But I would warn them to have a background in the Middle East if they want to get more from the course.",
    "While the questions this class poses (is the Middle East exceptional? and, if so, why?) are essentially unanswerable, some of the avenues of inquiry they lead to are very interesting.Professor Lawrence can generally lead a good discussion, the readings are generally interesting, and overall, this is your average political science seminar."
