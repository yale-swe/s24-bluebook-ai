   "comments": [
    "Biology 104 is the easiest of the 4 bio sequences. It's not fantastic, but it's not awful. If you have to take it, it's a nice way to end after suffering through the first 3 modules.",
    "It was great! A WELCOME relief from 103. Professor Donoghue is funny, clear, and seems to care about his students. The papers we had to read were kind of boring, but I also don't really like reading scientific literature so maybe that's just me. Also, the idea of going for a tour of the Marsh Botanical Gardens\/Peabody is fun, but I honestly did not enjoy my tour of the gardens. Plus they are SO far away",
    "It is a nice end to the biology modules and is quite enjoyable.",
    "The best of the biology modules, and I'm an MB&B major so I'm not biased in favor of the E&EB stuff. The best organized one since 101, and, in my opinion, the most tied to the real world. Also, if you've done 101-103, you might as well finish off with 104.",
    "It was immensely boring, but better than 103. You never know what you're actually going to be tested on though, so good luck.",
    "You're probably taking this because you have to. It's a stretch to call this a science class but it's an okay class, that's pretty easy.",
    "Biol 104 is like the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of the entire bio sequence. It is by far the most interesting and well-taught of any of them, and Prof. Donoghue is stellar.",
    "This is by far the best of the Intro Bio modules. Professor Donoghue really knows how to make his students excited about what they are learning, and teaches the important topics of EEB in a highly accessible way, without being boring to an EEB major like myself. The workload is incredibly manageable, and it is generally a very low stress class that is a very welcome period of relaxation (despite the large amount that you will learn) at the end of this grueling sequence of classes.",
    "BIOL 104 was hands-down my favorite out of all the BIOL intro sequence modules. I absolutely loved it and if it were possible to only recommend a single module, this would be the one. It's everything evolution and species-level that gets squeezed into a single module because we spend so much time learning about what happens inside a cell in all the other modules, that it's a welcome change to finally get to learn about bigger units of life. It's basically just a small taste of the extraordinary EEB department that Yale has, and this module has inspired me to take other EEB department courses here, even though I didn't start freshman year with much interest in that department. Donoghue is the best professor that you'll be coming across for a while, unless you choose to become and EEB major. He makes this the sort of class that gets you thinking about life and the wonder of it all (as sappy as that sounds, it's true). The workload is manageable (at this point, you've probably also taken BIOL 101-103, so you already know the ropes), with a final paper and a final exam. Start early and work hard on the final paper. Try to get into Surjit's section, she's the best.",
    "The course is quite a drag to get through, but if you're taking it you probably need it. Not the funnest or most exciting module (probably the most boring in my opinion) and the material isn't exactly difficult conceptually. Enjoy the ride.",
    "BIOL104 is a good break from the suffering that is BIOL101-103. The topic is easy to understand, and the class is easy to get through. I would recommend to anyone who needs it for a prereq or likes evolution\/phylogeny.",
    "BIOL 104 is way more interesting than the other modules. It's not much work (just two problem sets, a midterm, two papers, and a final), and Professor Donoghue really knows his stuff. He loves plants by the way, so if that's your thing, even better. Dude is a serial botanist. You also get to take a behind the scenes tour of the Peabody museum or the marsh gardens instead of your section one of the weeks, so that's super chill too. Overall, I would recommend 104 with a strong 12\/10. However, you have to take 103 first, so take those reviews into account as well (Hint: they won't be as positive).",
    "If you're at all interested in ecology\/evolution on a non-molecular scale, take BIOL 104. If you don't know what you're interested in, take BIOL 104. It's a great survey into the field of EBE and introduces you to nature in a very intimate way. Personally, I thought a lot of the things were learned were things I will never \"use\" in my life, but are incredibly fascinating facts that I'm glad I know because they make me appreciate nature, and further engross me in the beauty of science.",
    "Yes take this awesome class! Tests are extremely fair and the teacher wants you to know what will be tested and does not try to throw curve-balls, which I can not say for all biology classes at yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Highly recommend, a great reward for making it through the other three bio modules.",
    "By far the best bio module. Material taught is in a very different vein from the three others, giving you big picture ideas of how biology has developed over time and interacts at a huge scale. Look forward to this one if the modules are required for you, and if not, then consider taking this as a low commitment foray into biology ranging in scale from individual organisms to all of life, from a single Island to the entirety of the planet and it's environment.",
    "Take it if you have to for requirements, if not then take some other biology course. Intro classes not the best of the department.",
    "BIOL 104 was my favorite of the bio modules. The material was interesting and relevant, and Prof. Donoghue's enthusiasm is infectious. He's a great professor; class was always interesting and he was very accessible to students. There wasn't a lot of work, only a couple of problem sets that were fairly straightforward. The readings are actually pretty interesting and well-written papers (and they're short). The final project is open-ended, which allows you to make the class relevant to your interests.",
    "BIOL 104 is great. If you have a personal interest in the subject area, it will be an exceptional opportunity for you (the least of which will be fascinating tours of the Peabody Museum and\/or the Marsh Botanical Gardens). In general, it's a very reasonable course, and the professor is excellent.",
    "Interesting and fun module where you learn about the history of life, evolution, and ecology. I don't know if I'd call it life-changing, but it definitely helped me develop a better understanding of how connected all life on earth is. Also, going to the botanical gardens was so cool.",
    "A big step up from BIOL 103, particularly if you have Prof Donaghue. There isn't too much work, the lectures are interesting, and the exams are fair.",
    "If you need to take it, take it. It's way better than Biology 103--clearer lecturing, clearer tests, cool material.",
    "Please study well for your midterm and finals. Your sanity will thank you later. Also give yourself time for the big research paper in the class. It might seem like you can pull this off the day before but you have to be able to fully understand the primary sources you're using. Thats kind of hard when you're desperately trying to skim the papers for buzz words. I made this mistake and suffered for it. Please don't be like me.",
    "A good overview of ecology and evolution. I would recommend it - it's covers very interesting subject matter, and I really enjoyed it!",
    "The most enjoyable of the four modules, and worth looking forward to. Pay attention and do the work, and the course should treat you relatively well.",
    "This was the best module in biology in my opinion.",
    "It's not as bad as you think, I promise. Actually, it's pretty fun.",
    "104 is the good cop to 103's bad cop. I really genuinely enjoyed studying for this class, and I only wish I did it during the semester rather than waiting for reading week. The material is beautiful and accessible, so don't let being jaded by 103 spill over into 104.",
    "Would recommend! It's probably a required course if you're taking it, but it's also extremely interesting and well-taught.",
    "BIOL 104 is a much more fun and exciting class compared to the previous bio courses because the material is so different and the professor is awesome! I would say the work load is less than before because there are only 2 problem sets (pretty simple), a 1-page reading response, and a 5-page paper (which are all very doable). There are no weekly quizzes, just a midterm and final. The exams are very straightforward and require a lot of memorization of the slides, so pay attention to the power points! Professor Donoghue is such a great lecturer and a great person too--you'll really enjoy this course and I highly recommend it!",
    "Interesting bio course, if you're a pre-med you have to take it. The workload isn't terrible either!",
    "By far the best intro bio module if you take it with Professor Donoghue. He is a great lecturer and is clearly very excited and passionate about the material!",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The material is very interesting and easy to follow with how the professor presents it. The exams are fair and the lectures are designed to keep students attention.",
    "Most students are taking the BIOL101-104 series as a requirement, and most students aren't very interested in EBE, but I think many of the information in 104 is incredibly interesting, and ties in well with other topics we have learned. It really gives you a sense about how other organisms work, and you get to learn a lot of amazing things about the natural world. I would recommend it, it's very chill and very rewarding if you actually learn the material.",
    "I recommend this class because Professor Donoghue is a great lecturer, and very easy to understand unlike some other professors that teach the bio modules. The material learned in class was pretty cool too.",
    "Best of the overall poor intro bio sequence. Readings are pointless, but exams will cover minutiae, so you have memorize the slides cold.",
    "Yes, I would recommend.",
    "Good way to end the bio sequence. Very fun and engaging.",
    "The best of the 101-104 sequence.",
    "A great class and such a relief after the hell that is BIOL 103. I learned a lot!",
    "Best of all the bio series. You don't need to read the textbook (he even tells you this). You just study the clear lectures and you should be pretty prepared for the exams. You have to write one short reading response on a scientific paper, and one 5 page essay on an evolutionary topic, and then you have a midterm and a final. Like any science course, its gonna be some work, but its better than the other courses in the series! Overall I enjoyed the class.",
    "Learn about a variety of body forms and what evolutionary biology research is like. Highly recommend.",
    "A survey of ecology and evolution, including semi-detailed phylogeny of plants, animals, and fungi. The best intro segment - fun if you have to, fun if you're interested in the subjects! Take it with Professor Donoghue.",
    "fun class, cool material",
    "Wherever your interests lie in biology, BIOL 104 with Donoghue is by far the best-taught and organized module of the bunch. It's very easy at first but there gets to be some memorization once you get to the history of life parts (which I personally loved although I can understand why some might find them frustrating). Overall it's a very chill module where you get to do some independent research and are actually taught the material in a straightforward manner, which is quite a breath of air after the modules preceding it.",
    "You probably have to take this for a requirement, so yes, I would recommend it in the sense that it's not terrible as a prerequisite. Professor Donoghue is sweet and engaging.",
    "Pretty good course. Professor is clear and lectures are pretty fun. Grading can be hard because everyone does relatively well and class is graded on a curve.",
    "Bio 104 is interesting and well-taught! You're probably going to take it regardless, but you will definitely enjoy it.",
    "The best of the four bio modules.",
    "Bio 104 was the easiest of the biology modules. While the information was occasionally presented in a disjointed manner, it is pretty interesting and Professor Donoghue did a great job presenting it clearly.",
    "BIOL 104 is a great class and was probably my favorite module. Professor Donoghue is awesome and he teaches some very interesting material. The class is very fair and has a pretty light workload, although the paper at the end can be somewhat annoying. If you want to do well, just pay attention in lecture and try and get help from your TA on the research paper early enough that you can ask more questions. This class should come as a relief after harder modules and I think you will really enjoy it.",
    "Biol 104 was a relatively painless module that is a huge breath of fresh air coming after Biol 103. The lectures were coherent and engaging, and the assignments and assessments were fair. I would obviously only recommend this course if you have to take it for a major requirement, but know that its workload is not too heavy and the subject material is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class as it is a very interesting overview that explains a lot about ecology and evolution. However, a lot of memorization and time spent learning the material is involved, so I would recommend this only if you are very interested in the topic or need it for your major.",
    "Definitely take it with Donoghue. Milk this course like it's a cow.",
    "A premed rec that's interesting but you have to memorize a lot of irrelevant things for premed. That being said, it's cool stuff to learn!! And the best taught of any of the bio sequence.",
    "The best module of the sequence",
    "It's a good course - take it!",
    "BIOL 104 is one of the best modules, and I think it is a very enjoyable one that actually teaches you many things about evolutionary biology and some ecology. These are things that most people find interesting as well, so I think it's one of the most fun modules!",
    "Good intro to evol and ecology and can help you decide your bio concentration",
    "If you are premed, you will have to take this course, but I think that it is the best of the biology modules, and almost a reward after completing bio 103! Put in the work and you will reap the rewards!",
    "Most people have to take this course but I have a few friends who took it out of pure interest. This is not a course to take lightly. Those friends did well and learned a lot, but they had to put in work.",
    "Good",
    "TAKE! No point in not finishing out the modules. You owe it to yourself, because this is the only one that is any good.",
    "I would 100% recommend BIOL 104. It will make you want to get SCUBA certified, climb the Rockies, or go skydiving to get the aerial view of birds' wings...or, at least, go for a walk in the woods. Everyone should take this class. It expands your imagination beautifully."
