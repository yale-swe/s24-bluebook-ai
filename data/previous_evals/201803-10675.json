    "I think Prof. Mazzotta is the strength of the course, and any class with him is an exercise in getting to know what he thinks about really interesting texts or peoplewhich is really an underrated way of learning at Yale, since the university can be pretty obsessed with students 'taking charge' of discussions and whatnot. Instead, class discussion is fairly minimal here, but it doesn't feel stifling. Rather, we are all students at the graduate level, so we've certainly read the texts for class, and the presentations help us get a sense of what other people in class think about the reading. I suppose some students might find it helpful to be able to have a seminar discussion prior or after Prof. Mazzotta's mini-lecture (I would have found it interesting to know a little more about what my fellow students were thinking), but that wasn't something I really sought in choosing the class, so I didn't mind that it wasn't a major component."
