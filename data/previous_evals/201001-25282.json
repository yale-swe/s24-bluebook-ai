   "comments": [
    "This is not a gut class. While the grading scale is very generous, the exams are ROUGH. There is quite a time constraint, and LOTS of material to remember (including lots of dates). The class is very interesting, but don't take it thinking it'll be an easy A.",
    "This class is interesting, not a great deal of work, and made me think about crime and deviance in a new way.",
    "Maybe, the tests are really hard and the grading seemed all over the place. The material is interesting. The tests require a lot of memorization.",
    "not that bad of a classshop it to see if it interest you",
    "The coursework for this class occurs in spikes - lighter for the bulk of the course and almost unrealistically intense in preparation for the exams. The paper is fantastic and fairly graded, but the course is difficult to do well in due to the heavy weight on broad exams and exaggerated percentage distributions. For those just looking to fill a social science requirement, perhaps you should look elsewhere.",
    "YES TAKE IT.",
    "Not great.",
    "While the professor can be funny and lively at times, I found this class to be exceedingly boring after the first few weeks. The material quickly becomes repetitive, and the class about how much criminology theory can one shove down your throat in a limited timeframe. If you're looking for an easy A, then take it. Otherwise, I'd advise you look elsewhere.",
    "I would recommend it if you are actually interested in the topic. Otherwise, no, it's a waste of time.",
    "Good, straightforward class. If you put the effort in, you will do well. Recommended.",
    "Take it, but maybe consider doing it Credit\/D\/Fail.",
    "The material is very interesting, although lectures can be some what dry. Take this course if you plan on going to all lectures and do all readings.",
    "Interesting course. Fun. Workload very manageable. I would recommend this course to other people.",
    "OK course overall but not what I had expected. Lectures cover a lot of material and exams require a lot of studying (lots of memorization). Lectures are somewhat interesting, can be random though and there is not a clear structure of where the course is going. Prof Smith talks incredibly fast and since there is no textbook you need to type really fast to keep up - if you miss something it is basically impossible to get that info and TAs are not much help with lecture material either. The paper really is long but not too hard. Discussion sections are probably the more interesting parts of the course, and it is necessary to attend these since they comprise about 40% of the exams. Definitely not a gut class and not as fun as made out to be. Look somewhere else for an easy credit!",
    "It's not that much work until it comes to the midterm, the paper and the final. If you can plow through these 3 things, you'll be fine. It's basically just a ton of memorizing.",
    "This class is not as easy as people make it out to be. This is because it can be very hard to find the drive to do the work and pay attention in this class.",
    "extremely interesting and fun, but it is nearly impossible to get a good grade (dont let the threshold for an A being 87 fool you)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The material is actually very interesting, and there are only two required readings a week. Lectures are also interesting, I went to about every single one of them. If you're looking for a class that you don't have to go to, this isn't it. The two tests are based off of the notes you take in class since there are no textbooks that correspond with the material. Consists of a midterm, paper and a final. Overall a great class, I would definitely recommend it. A lot of memorization is involved.",
    "I would not recommend taking this class. This course was very disappointing. It should have been interesting and enlightening, but it was poorly organized and Professor Smith was not a very effective instructor.",
    "I would recommend the class, but be aware of what you are about to get into. This is a difficult class and you are required to memorize a significant amount of material. Be prepared for some really interesting days and some not so interesting days.",
    "Provides overview of sociological approaches to analyzing crime and deviance. Manageable workload (section, midterm, final, 1 paper) and covers some interesting topics, plus the readings are usually good. Smith is a great lecturer. Worth taking if you're interested in the subject.",
    "interesting material, not as easy of a class as you might think even though not a huge workload",
    "I thought this course was ok. Some of the ideas are really interesting, while others I found to be really obvious. It's a lot of work; lectures have a lot of information, the paper is a lot of work, and the readings - some are interesting, some are boring - are generally somewhat dense. I'd recommend the course if you're really interested in why crime happens (not so much the legal norms created for crime) from a qualitative standpoint.",
    "Good class content-wise. Gives you a very good idea of what sociology and criminology entail. STUDY IN ADVANCE FOR MIDTERM AND FINAL AND DO NOT FALL ASLEEP IN CLASS. Seriously.",
    "I would recommend if the subject matter interests you and you want a moderately easy fifth course.",
    "Good class, made unnecessarily hard by tough grading. The subject is interesting and it is fun to learn about deviance. Lots of applications to everyday life makes listening to lecture and getting interested in the subject easy.",
    "Not particularly unless very interested in the topic.",
    "Take this class! Beware, it's totally not a gut anymore. Sure, the readings a week aren't that long but the tests are graded SUPER hard so you reallllly need to know your stuff. But don't let that scare you off, take advantage of this class\/smith and you'll do just fine.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to another student.",
    "Pretty interesting lectures although everything is intuitive--oh, so it turns out that the root of crime is not genetic predetermination but concentrated economic disadvantage. It definitely provides cool anecdotes or facts to tell people. The readings take half an hour per week. Probably a 5th class. The grading for everything goes by a strict rubric and it felt annoyingly picky, at least to this humanities major.",
    "Sociology of Crime and Deviance is a great course if you're interested in the factors that drive people to deviant activities as well as the ways in which society perceives crime. Professor Smith delivers interesting lectures, yet he often seems to be rushing. Be ready to take copious notes and memorize a lot of theories and studies, because the syllabys covers a wide range of topics.",
    "If you want a challenge then take it",
    "Unless the course is reformatted before next year, I would not recommend Sociology of Crime and Deviance to another student. Thiscourse seemed to be more of a \"history of the study of sociology of crime and deviance\" and therefore is a lot of memorization. Coming away from the course, I feel that I learned less than I did in my other courses while putting in a lot more time and effort.",
    "Take it Credit\/D!",
    "This class is great. There's minimal work throughout the semester. The paper is enjoyable to write, and as long as you follow guidelines (and common sense), it's graded easily. The test's are not bad either, as long as you pay attention in lecture. The material is very interesting and not to be recreated in any other class at Yale.",
    "Yes its a great credit D class because of the fixed scale curve. For a grade its pretty hard but its just learning interesting stuff and memorizing theories.",
    "This class has much more to it than the syllabus says.",
    "Yes, but it's not as easy as it seems.",
    "This class is not for you if you are looking for a gut. It is pretty interesting but the grading is tough at the paper takes a while.",
    "Survey of Names\/Studies in Criminology. no critical thinking just memorization of important people and their research. could be a lot more interesting than it is",
    "It's a good SOCY intro course. Study for the midterm, it's a lot of information but it's not hard. Also consult the TA on your paper, go to section, and you shouldn't have any problems.",
    "This course is an overview of many different types of deviance in different societies. I would recommend this class to anyone because it was very informative and the subject matter was extremely interesting to me.",
    "It is a good lecture course on a subject matter that confirms or disproves previous notions about crime and deviance,",
    "I would summarize it as an introductory course into the nature of crime and deviance. I would recommend it because it is an interesting course.",
    "I would not recommend this course, unless you are interested in the material and want to have it memorized. The course is really about getting the info, copying it down in lecture, memorize it and write down exactly that at the test. Only in the essay you are challenged to apply a very small part of the material. The lectures are too straightforward and the material is not challenging, it is just a lot to memorize it perfectly enough to do very well on the test. No movies, images, guest lectures, just the prof talking in not a super, but rather interesting way. If that appeals to you, take the course. Keep up with the work over the semester (especially reading for sections), otherwise its impossible to have everything for the test.",
    "I would not recommend the course because it's large and there are a lot of TAs. The material is interesting but the powerpoints in class left me bored.",
    "I would recommend this class, with the clarification that it is a lot of memorization, and not as easy as it seems.",
    "It is a lot of memorizing names of sociologists and names of relatively pointless theories about common sense concepts. I wouldn't especially recommend it.",
    "Yes, but it's a lot more memorization than you would think.",
    "I absolutely loved this class, and it really got me interested in the field of sociology. That being said, I'm leaning towards declaring a sociology major, and I had a fair number of friends who didn't enjoy this class as much asI did.Reasons why you should absolutely take Sociology of Crime and Deviance:Professor Smith is very quirky, interesting, and a total genius. If anything, you'll like just listening to him. If you are at all interested in understanding crime and its meanings and causes, this class will be enlightening. The readings are worthwhile, but hopefully you'll get a better TA than I did.Reasons to be wary:If you think sociology is all about pointing out the obvious (it's not) then stay away. You won't get anything out of this class if you totally miss the point that sociology is about learning WHY we would even consider something obvious. Also, if you are horrible at memorizing names and theories and you agonize about written tests (which are difficult but nowhere near impossible) then you might want to reconsider.Overall, I consider this class completely worthwhile and very enjoyable.",
    "I would say don't take it if you aren't into sociology, not that interesting and you won't know the stuff for the exams because you will not have attended lectures.",
    "This is an interesting class. great course to take.",
    "i would recommend it if you're genuinely interested in sociology, if not it can be a bit boring at times. the workload's very manageable, only one paper (kind of long but interesting subject and not difficult to write at all)",
    "I would recommend it, but this class isn't focused on real world occurrences- its focus is on the theory behind different types of crime. TONS of memorization required- names and theories and studies.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a fair class that has typical requirements of a class and is comprised of material different from usual Yale classes.",
    "No",
    "Great class. Graded fairly toughly, thus not a gut. Cr\/D\/F",
    "Interesting class, but not as easy as is rumored. The exams are essentially rote memorization and the essay, which counts for a lot, has little to no help. Nevertheless, there aren't many classes where you get to read about serial killers. I would recommend it, but with the warning that this should not be taken as an easy fifth.",
    "First two classes are very entertaining. By the third class, I started to fall asleep. The only other entertaining lecture was the one on prostitutes. The class could be made much better by having more information and pictures on the Powerpoints. Powerpoints are not available online and the info on them is very hard to take down during lecture. Often it seems like the Prof is trying to cram a ton of info into a 50-min block of time, and thus it is hard to follow the overall themes\/outline. A lot of topics are very poorly explained and there is no course textbook for help. Midterm and cumulative final contain huge amounts of info to study. Not a gut by any means. 87+ for an A. Average for the paper assignment (40% of grade) was 33\/40.",
    "It's a great course! Very interesting topic, and Professor Smith's lectures are very enjoyable. The workload isn't too bad, either, but the grading on the exams is deceptively hard. Be forewarned that this isn't a gut class--but if you're interested in the topic and willing to put in the effort, it's very rewarding.",
    "This course taught students about various aspects of crime, but not only what the violation entails but motives behind possible convicts. It investigated the legal system in a statistical way while also exploring theories as to what makes a criminal. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the material is interesting and the professor is exciting.",
    "No I would not. I think you could learn the material just as well by reading wikipedia.",
    "No, they grade the exams way too hard",
    "Yes.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who has a pretty significant interest in sociology or criminology. Yes, there's not a lot of work and the subject seems pretty interesting, but this class isn't nearly as easy as it might seem. You have to absorb a lot of information, most of which is not just about hookers and serial killers.",
    "yes",
    "Incredibly interesting class. Professor Smith is a phenomenal lecturer and was extremely engaging. Highly recommend for any student, regardless of major.",
    "Great class! After fighting to get in, you may be disappointed at how the first half of the semester is just a bunch of names tied to theories. But after the midterm, the class gets really interesting, with topics like campus shootings, gendered deviance, sexual deviance, workplace deviance, etc. I really valued the discussion sections for this class and the reading was very interesting. One thing is it seems really hard to get a good grade in this class - it's mainly based on two exams and a paper, where the average grade for all seem to be in the C's (but I think there is a curve).",
    "It is sociology - so even if you like the concept of crime and deviance make sure you are comfortable with the sociological perspective or else this course is not for you. That said it is interesting regardless, particularly in the later parts of the course.",
    "its a fun class.",
    "Yes, it is very interesting, but it gets to be a little too much like teaching common sense.",
    "Terrible class. Don't take it if it's the last class available at Yale. Lectures are excruciatingly boring and the readings are unbelievably terrible. I read some of the worst articles I've ever encountered in that class, to the point that it'sunfathomable that they were actually published. The midterm and final are challenging, and the class isn't curved. There actually is not a single reason to take this class. Avoid it like the bubonic plague.",
    "Crime and Deviance is an interesting class that examines our perception of crime and why or why not this perception is accurate. It focuses on different theorists. I would recommend it to someone who enjoys classes that are heavy in memorization.",
    "If you know what sociology is and you are definitely interested in the discipline.",
    "It's a good survey course for sociology of crime and criminology but it's not the kind of a course that would give you a broader idea of what sociology is. It's not that difficult and interesting. Good course",
    "It's much more work than you think!Seriously, think twice!But really, ask a friend if it's a a true gut.",
    "Yes I would but this is by no means a gut class. The tests are graded very hard.",
    "Not a hard class but you do have to at least do something to do well. Weekly readings are short and easy to understand, you have a midterm, ~8 page paper, and final. If you go to class and take notes and at least have a general idea of what the readings are about you will do fine. Spend a little time studying for the tests and you'll be fine. Prof Smith is knowledgeable but not a super engaging professor; just basically stands up there and presents what you'll need to know for the tests.",
    "good introduction class. exams were hard but there was a great curve. the paper was also graded very easily",
    "the material is interesting, make sure to get a good ta.",
    "Great class to take if you're interested in sociology",
    "If you're interested in the subjects of crime and deviance, and want to learn a variety of sociological explanations for why people commit certain crimes, then I would recommend this class. The lectures are very interesting and you'll learn a lot of informative theories. While this class may not have a ton of work (weekly readings, a paper, and a midterm and final), I wouldn't take it if you're just expecting an easy A. You do have to put time into the paper and exams if you want to do well. The exams are detail-oriented and require you to recall specific theories, etc. There also is a relatively low amount of time given, especially during the midterm, so if you don't know the material well, it's easy to run out of time on them. But, if you're willing to put in the time, I would recommend this class.",
    "A different and professional perspective on seemingly simply observations. Recommended assuming an interest in crime motivation.",
    "Strengths: Course was interesting. Professor Smith provides great insight into a wide variety of areas that are intriguing. The PPTs make lectures easy to follow.Weaknesses: The class was HUGE. The grading isn't curved, and is harsh, particularly if you don't put down EXACTLY what you're supposed to on the mid-term\/final (which are cumulative!). The paper is great, but the TAs grade in silly ways, telling you that you could have added more of *this* when you're already operating under a 3000 word limit!This is the first course I've ever taken where what's talked about in section is never mentioned in lecture. It's ridiculous. The ties between lecture and section are abstract. Absurd.Good class overall, you have to work VERY hard to obtain an A."
