   "comments": [
    "CS major here. I was intimidated at first by hearsay of Skiba's 410, but quickly realized that difficulty was a property of the professor, not the course. Content was very interesting, and the lectures were clear, but it was very gentle, and not much was explored beyond the book. We covered the core 11 chapters of Taylor, roughly in order, as well as Hamiltonian mechanics, chaos theory, and special relativity. The book is very clear; its exercises (from which all of our problem sets came) are a bit on the easy side.",
    "Yup! Would recommend. Great class, engaging lecturer (if Prof. Poland). He's very nice and approachable. He doesn't usually do demos but there was one demo one day that blew our minds. workload wasn't too bad at all. There was even an extra credit pset :)",
    "Take it. It is *only* classical mechanics but it will be hard. Take it anyway - I learned a ton.",
    "If you're taking it, it's probably because you have to. It's quite interesting and teaches essentially all of the advanced areas of mechanics, as one might expect. Easier with Poland than Skiba, although the final was still quite hard.",
    "Overall a good course. With Poland teaching it the material was straight from the textbook (Taylor), but that doesn't mean that it wasn't hard. The first half of the semester was very similar to 260 (and in fact several of the hw problems were exactly the same), and so the midterm was not that hard. The final was incredibly hard because it was all on new material (coupled oscillators, non-inertial reference frames, inertia tensors). I don't know how it compares to 401, but you have to take it if you want to try for the BS intensive.",
    "A very cool approach to classical mechanics. Since I had Poland, who was new, I can say that this class was very manageable in terms of problem sets and exams--better than the usual course that's taught by Skiba. The problem sets did not get ridiculous unmanageable until the last few--which is better than the consistent 10-hour problem sets previous people who have taken the course experienced. Overall, a very good course and definitely interesting material too.",
    "Yes. 410 is a great class, but Poland teaches straight from the book. It's not necessarily a bad thing- the material is very interesting, and you definitely DON'T need to take notes as long as you have a copy of the book. Besides the interesting topics, the best part of the class was the students- 410 is generally taken by students really interested in putting a lot of energy into physics, and as a result study groups and in-class conversations are really good. This class is good, not great, but it's a good class that covers cool material and makes you think for yourself.",
    "This class is a great way to start really sinking your teeth into the physics major. Much of the material will be familiar, but you'll be treating it with a rigor and subtlety that really cast it in a new light. You'll also have the opportunity to see how these techniques led to the development of modern physics, and some of the connections are really profound.David Poland is a really good lecturer, who explains things very clearly, although he follows the textbook closely. He also seems genuinely excited about the material, which is a rarity among STEM profs teaching undergrad courses.Workload isn't bad; psets took closer to 5 hours per week than 10, on average, and exams were fair. Be warned that the material gets much more difficult after the midterm.",
    "PHYS 410 is a hard class. The material is very interesting but it takes you a long time to truly understand all of it. The exams are quite challenging but I feel I've learned a lot walking out of the class.",
    "Great course covering some of the deeper areas of undergraduate mechanics (Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations, general rotations, two-body problem, coupled oscillators, chaos). Poland is a great professor--he's a bit hyper, but his lectures are very clear. The homework is also very manageable (word has it this isn't so when Prof. Skiba teaches the class), but still good preparation for exams, which require some thinking but aren't too bad. This course will only make you more determined to be a physics major!",
    "If you've already taken 260, the first half will be sort of a review what you've already learned, but with more difficult problems and more precise derivations which with strengthen your understanding, and the second half will teach you several cool and useful new topics and techniques. It's not the most intense or mind-blowing class, but it's definitely worthwhile.",
    "I took Physics 410 to satisfy the physics\/science requirement for the Math major B.S., and I would definitely recommend it with Prof. Poland for other math majors looking for their advanced physics class. Poland is a truly kind, and relatively chill professor. I do not think the course was nearly as terrifying as with the previous instructor, but still solid& rigorous. He is super reasonable about grading, and also offers bonuses to help people with lower scores on the midterm boost their grade. The exams and homeworks are very fair. In terms of content, in this course you'll cover all but a few chapters of Taylor, covering each chapter in its entirety (most lectures are directly the material in Taylor, which might be boring, but this is extremely common in most physics classes from my understanding). You'll get really comfortable with Lagrangian\/Hamiltonian mechanics, rotational mechanics using tensors (matrices) and using complex variables\/linear algebra throughout mechanics. For math majors the math in this class is easy (just 120-level calculus, linear algebra, some differential equations, complex number manipulation), and whats hard is having an actual intuition for the mechanical problems (to solve some of the problems on the rather challenging final, the hard part is never the math, but is in interpreting and translating a physics word problem into math that you can then solve easily).",
    "Mechanics is a pretty good class overall. You learn a lot by the end, though it starts off a bit slow and the material directly parallels the textbook (Taylor). Problem sets are generally reasonable, though are often messy mathematically and can take a while to complete. Prof Poland is a good (and very animated) lecturer.",
    "An excellent higher-level physics class. I definitely recommend it. Not too hard, but definitely not boring.",
    "No, if you have taken physics 260 this class can be self taught in a third of the time.",
    "I felt very content about the work load. Some P-sets were harder than others, and I enjoyed overcoming some of the more challenging problems (I remember some glorious times of suddenly having the epiphany to finish an exercise).Lectures follow the text book closely and are thus very well structured.I recommend working with a small study group, and trying to solve P-sets (or resolve) without using notes, to better prepare yourself for exams.",
    "This is a useful review of mechanics with some more advanced methods and an excellent professor. Definitely take this class!",
    "Physics 410 is a huge improvement over any of the intro physics courses. David Poland is a clear lecturer who is genuinely excited by the material, and the material is actually advanced enough to be interesting and taught in enough detail to be accessible.I probably would have learned a little more if the problem sets had been more difficult, but then I probably also would have enjoyed this class less (and the final problem set was a bit of a killer, so I'm not complaining too much).",
    "Definitely recommend! Wonderful textbook-wonderful material. You come out really having learned something.",
    "410 reviews basic mechanics for a bit, except a little more mathematically, before moving on to cooler things like Lagrangian mechanics, general rotations, coupled oscillations, and so on. I would definitely recommend taking it, either for physics majors or anyone interested.",
    "It is a good class. Seems like it provides a very solid basis for the future physics classes we will take. You will learn some very important concepts such as the Lagrangian. At the end the professor taught us some special relativity and chaos theory for fun (it wasn't tested) which was really cool and enlightening."
