    "This class was everything I hoped it wouldn't be. I came away having no idea how to apply what I learned, and feeling like soil science is a big unknown. We spent so much time talking about what we don't know, and things that are not directly applicable to land managers. And when we actually talked about applied uses of this knowledge, it was all related to agriculture. You must know that half of the students in that class were either MF of MFS students who want to know how to apply soil science to forested landscapes, yet 90% of the examples dealt with agriculture.",
    "The instructor should maintain a higher level of involvement in instruction throughout the course. Instead, we broke into groups and had groups lead class discussions of the final 5 topics of the course. While an interesting exercise, Prof Bradford would have done a better job in actually teaching the remainder of the students.",
    "NA",
    "I learned less from this course than any other I've taken at FES. The first quarter of the class meetings were very useful and covered materials as advertised and as a Soil Science class probably should. The latter half to 3\/4 of the class was entirely student-led discussion. The student-run nature of the course gave the distinct impression of a lack of effort and investment by the professor (whether it was merited or not). I took the course to learn the scientific aspects of soil ecology and science. Instead, I got a glimpse at the meaning and use of soil from a social science perspective (led by students who know a similar level about the subject as me). While I can't be sure, I also had the sense that more rigorous scientific articles and readings were foregone and replaced with more open-ended, less conclusive readings in an effort to foster more \"interesting\" student conversation. I would have appreciated reading more seminal papers in the field, if this is the case.",
    "I like Mark Bradford a lot as a person, and I do believe that he cares about student learning. That said, I did not find his teaching style in this course to be effective. I enjoyed the first month of Soil Science, where lectures regarding the material were part of coursework as were problem sets. It felt like Mark no longer wanted to lecture starting before fall break, though, and after that I felt that the class was too student directed. I very much enjoy classes that allow for student engagement and interaction. However, with this class the amount of \"teaching\" done by students felt like a function of disinterest by the professor at times. I am hesitant to write this, because I truly do like and respect Mark, but I feel that the feedback is important. Also, as an MESc student I was often dissatisfied with the scientific aspects of this course. Our course readings so often had the answer of \"it depends on the soil type,\" no matter the soil quality indicator up for discussion. Though I'm sure that's true, this felt to me more like a philosophy class at times than a soil science class. We pay too much to spend a whole class period debating the definition of \"soil health,\" for instance, when I know there are MANY things to be learned from a professor as accomplished as Mark. This was very disappointing and at times somewhat maddening. I wish Mark had conducted an anonymous polling mid-semester to gauge student interest in the class structure, and I would suggest this when the course is taught again. Mark is a wonderful person with a lot to teach--and he is also a good lecturer. I would've liked to have seen more of him leading the class than we ended up getting.",
    "Mark's lectures are meandering and unclear; he is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject but presents random snippets of information without context and trails off halfway through sentences so that there's no way to follow what's going on or decipher your notes after class. I really wanted to learn this material and listened very closely every day but could never make sense of what the professor was saying.",
    "I thought the material was very interesting but the second and third module didn't really help at all. I would have preferred to just expand the first module and spend more time learning about soil science. There was a lot of information that we went through very fast and then the group discussions were interesting but mostly just repeating each other.",
    "I appreciated this course and all of the work that Mark and Emily put in to set it up. A few comments, in no particular order: I loved the flipped design of the course. It was a great way to engage with the material. I also enjoyed the structure of the course, with a significant focus on the science concepts early on. However, I do think it could have been useful to incorporate some of the discussion questions into the earlier sections of the course, to keep classes engaging and incorporate student conversations from the beginning. For example, after learning about bulk density and SOM we could have discussed whether or not SOM influences crop yields. In terms of the field trips, I think it would have been more successful if they could have incorporated some kinds of assignments or deliverables for students to work on. When studying soil horizons, we could have engaged more closely with the samples, even if as simply as measuring the different horizon depths and comparing them to the NRCS survey. I struggled somewhat with the major takeaways of this course. We continued to hear that the leading theories around soil science were being turned on their head, up for new debate, but the conversation around those changes could have been more focused.",
    "Terrible structure to this course. Went way too quickly through the most important materials, then spent way too much time on student presentations, which were frankly a waste of time for both the presenting group and the student audience. This is an incredibly relevant class and I felt it underdelivered in the most disappointing way possible.",
    "Mark is a great guy- we all loved him, but his style of teaching when in class made it almost impossible to follow his train of thought. This class was a wash unfortunately. I'm not sure how it filled any forestry accreditation requirements as the foresters coming out of this class will have no working knowledge of soil. It's sad to be giving such a poor review, because Mark has a lot of potential as a teacher. I heard that the course was dramatically reorganized from the previous year based off of course reviews. However, this class seemed to be an entirely different group of people who wanted and needed to learn soil science--not soil policy or how we feel about soils. It was like the pendulum swung way too far to the opposite end of the field."

The specific examples were much more rewarding, both because it's nice to have a semi-definite answer once in a while, and because the information and concepts, when applied, are really interesting and do seem genuinely useful.",

    "The discussions during the last module were pretty terrible. I don't know if it was that the questions were bad (since everyone's answer was always \"it depends\"), of that the class was too big, or what. but I gained very little from that module. The problem sets were also pretty bad. It was essentially question after question about converting units, and not actually applying any of it.",
    "I would have appreciated more time in the field and lab to actually interact with some of the soil principles we learned, and I didn't feel that the time at the farm provided that experience, as we were all crowded around small soil pits and didn't get the chance to apply much knowledge.",
    "Fewer in-class discussions and more lecture periods where we are exposed to soil science, rather than policy. I would have also liked to have had either more field trips and\/or more lab experience.",
    "This course should be far more technical in the future. The professor should be more involved in teaching concepts and guiding class discussion. Additional field-based, hands-on learning or lab work would greatly benefit the course.",
    "I have addressed that in a previous response, but I will re-state: in my opinion there's need for more professor-led direction, more teaching, and more science in general. Debating is fine in its place, but I did not expect or want so much of that in this course. The amount of time spent on defining soil health is a great example of this.",
    "The structuring of the course around the big soil science topics of the day, without a strong focus on either sampling\/labwork or specific analysis\/interpretation techniques",
    "I really wish that we spent more time on the scientific understanding of soil science. It felt like we really just scratched the surface of science behind soils, and the dynamics behind their role in ecosystems. Though I know it is difficult to cater to many different interests, it would have been largely beneficial for me, and I know of a few others, to learn more about the function of soils in forest ecosystems. The weekly readings and discussions were interesting, but perhaps a bit repetitive.",
    "The use of the socratic method was a nice idea for this class but didn't pan out as intended. Instead of teaching us, Mark and Emily trieds to get us to teach each other; I like this idea in theory, but most students are not experts in soil science so our discussions were minimally useful\/productive. We really needed guidance and instruction, and the professor did not seem willing to give it.",
    "The course has the potential to be great. Mark is a good professor and we all have a tremendous amount to learn from him. I think the set up of the course needs to be changed or expectations for the course should be managed. It was more of a discussion class then science based class.",
    "Unfortunately, it seems like many students disengaged during the discussion module of the course. This was a disappointment to me. This section had the potential to synthesize much of the \"science\" into real-world issues, but it often felt like only a few people were actually carrying the torch. I personally found that the readings for that module required a large time-commitment (although I know that I take a long time reading papers), and it was sometimes difficult to get through the readings for Monday and Wednesday. I always got a lot out of the papers, but it felt like the work load was much larger during the discussion section than the other sections.",
    "It would be nice if Mark lectured more. I liked the discussion aspect of the class, but many of us really wanted to hear more from him.",
    "It could have been useful to have at least a couple of specific case studies that allowed us to apply concepts of soil health directly. With the discussion questions, they were so open ended that the answer was always \"it depends.\" They were certainly useful in that respect, but think what was lacking was a more specific debate around a particular soil scenario and the appropriate response. Perhaps we could have worked more closely with the Yale Farm or another local organization, with the project of developing a soil management plan in the vein of the NRCS.",
    "I could have used more time on the introductory lectures. While the information was not new to me, it still felt like we moved fast in the beginning.",
    "Thinking through the actual syllabus - what gets taught, when, how. Online lectures are useful, classroom discussions are pretty useless. Hardly any students know anything substantial about soil science, so there is very little to learn from our classmates. The professor is an internationally recognized all star - why did he not teach more? This class should be mostly lectures. Readings from the textbook should be required. Submitting reading responses to journal articles is a waste of time.",
    "In tandem with my above comments on liking specific cases, I would suggest a little less dwelling on definitions -- maybe it's because FES inevitably draws pedantic people, but I felt that those discussions went on far longer than necessary (and, even though it is an important and inherently difficult topic to address when discussing soil health in the first place, any more than one class period felt like wheel-spinning). I personally would have preferred more emphasis on application in conjunction with theory.",
    "The entire \"discussion\" half of the course could have been way more productive as a single, coherent lecture. Please teach us soil science-- it's still a forestry school for now and we need someone who will.",
    "The readings from the Cornell Cooperative Extension were a good summary, but a more rigorous text should be used to provide ample background. I often felt like the other assigned readings provided an opposing viewpoint to background on soil science I simply didn't have. There needs to be more practical, hands-on experience and less discussions debating \"soil health\" and other theories.",
    "I found the second half of the course to be difficult to remain engaged with - the group discussions often did not increase my understanding of the material. On a non-content based note, I wish this course were at the same time on both Monday and Wednesday - having the course be in the afternoon on Monday and the morning on Wednesday doubled the number of other courses this one conflicted with."

    "Somewhat. I would have liked to have gained more field and\/or lab experience and to have spent more time discussing soil properties and processes.",
    "No. I expected a much more technical, scientific understanding of soil ecosystems as a result of taking this course.",
    "Honestly, not at all. This course felt as much like a soil philosophy course (if that's a thing) as a soil science course. In our first discussion board readings, I spent multiple pages learning about reproductive rights in India. Again, this was very frustrating.",
    "About half--I'm now familiar with the major disputes in soil science, but still have no way to apply my soil science knowledge to testing, etc. myself, or speaking knowledgeably with soil scientists on my team.",
    "Though we covered a lot of new material, I wish we had spent less time debating the theories around soil management, and more time on the scientific processes involved with soils.",
    "I had really high hopes for class and did not feel that I came away with much knowledge to speak of because we spent all our time on pretty aimless group discussions of theory rather than learning the nuts and bolts.",
    "My went over the relevant soil science so quickly that I probably won't remember much",
    "Yes. The flow of the class is clearly stated by the syllabus, so I essentially knew what to expect. The management emphasis makes sense here at FES where over 3\/4 of the students are Environmental Management majors.",
    "yes",
    "Yes, I would say so, though I do wish we could have practiced more specific application of soil science concepts, rather than keeping our discussions focused on such broad questions.",
    "I did learn a lot, but would have preferred to develop my technical skills more and spend less time on discussions.",
    "Most certainly not. Huge let down.",
    "Not at all.",
    "No, the majority of what I learned cannot be applied to my future career in forestry. Except for what I learned myself during the final project, the course was mostly theoretical. I gained no practical hands-on experience. I do not have the skills necessary for my future career, and there is no other way for me to obtain these skills while at F&ES. For example, if asked to identify a soil in the field and described its properties, I would be unable to because we did not have a lab to learn such techniques. Almost any other school would teach such skills in a soil since clara Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this course.",
    "I was hoping that I would have a bit more of the science drilled into my head - this was the class I actually wanted more problem sets in."

   "comments": [
    "Working as a group for the final project was nice because we could combine our related interests and create a presentations bout something we really wanted to learn about.",
    "It was nice to learn from the diverse expertise different students brought to the class. I enjoyed the group work for the most part.",
    "None in particular, though I think there was too much of it. Also, many of the discussions were focused on agriculture which is not particularly of interest to me.",
    "The only learning that took place throughout the majority of the course was a result of student knowledge of the material and a willingness of my classmates to share their experiences through group and class discussion. In that sense, group work was valuable.",
    "I loved the final project of this course, and I learned a great deal from my group. Otherwise, I felt that the group led discussions were not as effective as I would have hoped.",
    "Amorphous discussions, dominated by males in the group, focused on fundamental but abstract questions like what is soil health rather than the specific sampling and management protocols. Some student presentations led better group discussions than others--e.g., the ones that broke us up by topic of interest had more success, I think, because specificity helped bring people to the real issues at hand.",
    "Though I might have appreciated fewer group discussions, I did enjoy the ones we had, and I learned a good amount from students with many varied perspectives in the class.",
    "Group work would have been much more useful if we weren't teaching ourselves totally new concepts but rather reviewing. Since actual teaching was so minimal, group work idd not end up adding much because we were always guessing\/conjecturing about abstract concepts.",
    "I liked the group project at the end but the group discussion I didn't find helpful",
    "I was a little bit disappointed by my group for the final project. Perhaps I was not discerning enough to choose a more efficient team. But actually, this was the first real group project I have worked on in 8 years (since I got my bachelor's) and I learned a lot from it. I had forgotten how it can be hard to create a good product with people you like but haven't yet worked with. In the future I will remember to be more assertive if I start to sense that one or more group members are not effectively participating.",
    "it was a positive experience. No disadvantages.",
    "The class was huge, breaking down into group work that allowed me to work closely with classmates who's interests intersected with my own. Definitely an advantage of the class and really the only way to address the diverse interests of the class.",
    "I enjoyed the group project that I worked on; however, due to scheduling conflicts with group mates I didn't feel as though I was able to contribute as much as I would have liked -- leaving me feeling guilty and them (probably) feeling like they were stuck with dead weight.",
    "Week after week we all came to the same conclusions. The helpful part was when someone in your group had actual experience with the discussion topics.",
    "Since this class was very large, the groups were often too large to be effective because of there wasn't enough tie for each group to present. The in class group discussions often seemed redundant. The first few were very helpful, but after defining \"soil health\" and how to measure it, the discussions were no longer productive.",
    "I'm not a huge fan of group work - both my groups divvied up the work and then threw it together in a power point for the presentation, so I didn't really get much from it."

   "comments": [
    "If you are on the forestry side of things, take a close look at the syllabus before enrolling, and ask Mark how much of the time will be spent talking about agriculture, and how much will be spent talking about forests.",
    "Be aware that this course is heavily policy and management focused. This isn't necessarily a drawback but may inform whether a student will actually want to take it.",
    "Only take this course if it is significantly restructured in the future.",
    "I would have to know how Mark plans to teach in the future. If the course does not change, I likely would not recommend it to other MESc students.",
    "Get outside reading for yourself and choose a final project that involves hands-on soil sampling so you get those aspects of the course.",
    "If you are looking for a course that will give you more grounding in hard sciences you should probably take Physical Sciences instead. This course is great for diving deeper into the issues with managing soils on a global level.",
    "I would not spend time on this course again unless it were to get significantly revamped and lots more instruction added.",
    "This course has the potential to teach you about classical and emerging concepts of soil science and ecology, then synthesize these concepts in a series of real-world issues. Like with most classes, you will learn the most if you are willing to leave your shyness at the door and actively participate in discussions.",
    "Recognize that this course is covering a broad topic, so it will not be able to go fully in depth to all of the components of soil science. There are opportunities to focus discussions and final presentations on your own specific interests, but in general the focus of the course remains broad.",
    "Just read the textbook. Unless there are significant changes, don't bother going to class for student presentations. You could learn way more from just reading the textbook thank you could from going to class.",
    "Don't take it unless the course is restructured again.",
    "Are you interested in soil science? Take this course."
