    "Yes, if there is a research lab at Yale that you would like to join, I highly recommend 475. It is possible to be involved with labs on top of a full course load of 4-5 classes, but I think that taking 475 gave me a chance to really commit to my project and spend 10-12+ hours on my project, which is really the minimum time requirement to make some real progress on the experiments during a semester.",
    "Good class for those who need more time to do research during the semester.",
    "If you're interested in getting more involved with research, then definitely take this class.",
    "MCDB475 is an independent research course. Therefore, it is entirely up to the student what experience they get out of it. I would recommend it, if there's a project in a lab you want to pursue, or a lab you find really interesting. It's a great way to get credit while also doing research.",
    "A pretty standard research course. As a junior not fulfilling the senior requirement, I only had to write a proposal and a final paper. The proposal is short, but the final paper takes a lot of planning and time, so try to start it early. You mentor will appreciate not having to rush for you as well. Be aware, the class counts for absolutely nothing but graduation credit if you take it as a junior, which I think is ridiculous.",
    "I love doing research for credit. It's such a great break from the rest of the undergrad grind and if you find a lab and a project you really like, it can be so fulfilling.",
    "Yes, it is a good way to do independent research in your lab and get credit.",
    "As long as you are willing to commit a lot of time to research, this is an excellent opportunity to get credit for time working in a professional research lab.",
    "If you're already working in a lab and considering research for credit as an underclassman, I'd go for it. Not too much work beyond the lab time you're already putting in.",
    "Research for credit.",
    "Taking MCDB 475 is a good way to earn credit while conducting research."
