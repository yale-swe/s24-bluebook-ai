   "comments": [
    "A solid base understanding of microeconomic analysis that will facilitate further learning in the field.",
    "I learned the basics of Microeconomics, including how a consumer can maximize his utility, how a firm can minimize cost, and the structures of different markets.",
    "I learned the foundational concepts of microeconomics from both the consumer and producers perspective. You learn the basics of consumer utility maximization, firm theory, different market structures, and economic behavior.",
    "I developed a strong understanding of microeconomics and I entered the class with zero background in it. My understanding of basic principles as well as applied situations is strong, and this class prepared me well for future economics courses.",
    "Basic economic concepts, but with a more coherent and strung together way than in high school.",
    "I think the most valuable insight from the course was to start relating graphs and figures with real life policies and decisions. A lot of micro-economics are simple math questions, but I think there are brief moments in which its relationship with policymaking strike you - although it's something you have to actively think about - and makes the class really interesting.",
    "I learned a lot about the applications of economic concepts to common modern phenomena as well as the calculations and quantitative skills.",
    "I learned how to evaluate economic data, think more logically, and make better economic decisions.",
    "This course covers all the intro to microeconomics: supply and demand, some behavioral economics, and product and labor markets.",
    "I learned the basics of microeconomics.",
    "Basic microeconomics and introduction to behavioral economics",
    "As someone who's never taken econ in high school, this course built a solid foundation in microeconomics, which mostly is based around how consumers and firms make decisions.",
    "General knowledge on all the main topics in microeconomics.",
    "Critical analysis of both economic and social issues. Math skills, economics skills, thinking skills.",
    "Knowledge: I truly learned a lot about microeconomics, the applications of economics, and other fun details! A really good foundational course. Skills: how to look at problems and situations from an economic perspective, and think about potential solutions and the impact of each. Insights: how to look at the world from an economic perspective, which is highly interesting!!",
    "I learned not only about the basic principles of economics but about how to apply them to real life situations. I learned about being a rational consumer and about different theories of economics that are applicable to life situations such as the elections or the stick market.",
    "I acquired a basic understanding of economic thinking. Things like rational choice, utility maximization and marginal utility were all interesting and useful\/applicable to my real life. Also gained insight by looking at specific case studies, for example learning about why companies charge a membership fee or how insurance is necessarily bad value (although if the cost is prohibitive it could still be worth it). Learned a few miscellaneous skills like how to do calculations with different market structures and doing profit maximization using calculus, but I found these most interesting and useful when they were helping me gain a better understanding of the concepts, the calculations themselves feel next to useless.",
    "Basic understanding of consumer and industrial market behavior.",
    "Learned the basic of microeconomics.",
    "I began to see things from an economic perspective, especially during the firm-half of the course. I became very aware how businesses decided pricing and hired\/fired laborers and made other decisions.",
    "Intermediate level microeconomics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The core textbook was well written and I felt we covered all the necessary topics in a thorough and timely manner. No glaring weaknesses.",
    "Econ 110 with Tolga is an incredibly interesting and engaging class. The strengths of this course include its small class size, teaching style, and resources available. The capped enrollment allowed students to further clarify confusing material, and since most of the students got to know each other, study groups outside of class were common. Tolga's teaching style is one of a kind--he manages to make what could be a dry, dreaded introductory course into a fun one with his strange examples and jokes. It's very clear that he knows the material by heart. One of this course's most prominent strengths is the resources offered: Tolga held office hours every week and other undergraduates also held office hours weekly. If you were confused with a problem set or particular concept, there were many places you could go to for help.",
    "The problem sets were definitely a strength, as they allowed you to consolidate your knowledge of the material covered. The seminar itself, however, was very large and not very engaging. The class often got distracted, and it was easy to lose focus. I think that there should be smaller seminars and perhaps regular in-class quizzes to keep everyone engaged, and avoid getting into the final without any sure knowledge of the material.",
    "Strengths: Tolga is an amazing professor. He provides students many opportunities to succeed whether it be taking questions during class, hosting office hours, or posting lecture videos online for students to review. Weaknesses: the class can feel rushed at times because of the amount of material that must be covered. Sometimes much of class was spent on tangents.",
    "The instructing in the class was fantastic. Having a midterm and final which account for 80% of the grade is tough, because if someone has a bad day on one of those examinations, it can ruin their entire semester. I might have two midterms instead.",
    "The course is incredibly straight-forward and is strong in this sense. However, the assigned readings in the class were tedious and dull; lecture was much more captivating and provided better explanation of concepts. While I understand that the textbook provides many in-real-life examples, they appeared increasingly as filler as concepts became much more uprooted in graphs and numbers.",
    "The seminar-style of this class was really helpful because you could ask questions as they came up, which really helped to consolidate learning on the spot.",
    "I thought this course was very well organized and executed. The video lectures are a great tool, and Tolga makes sure he is always available if you need assistance. The problems and class topics were very interesting and relevant to modern day. We would always laugh in class, and Tolga made the environment very funny and welcoming. Weakness is definitely the strict curved grading system.",
    "Tolga is an incredibly funny teacher, and he teaches a lot in the span of just a semester. That is both the strength and the weakness of the course: it goes by incredibly fast and sometimes it is difficult to grasp information as it generally lacks repetition. Although his stories are much appreciated and loved, sometimes it may be helpful to go over more example problems at the end of the class rather than a long anecdote.",
    "The strengths are the way in which examples are presented and the way all the course information is connected. Weaknesses I would say is more just the ambiance of the class. There is excessive worry about the curve, and grades, and exams.",
    "I like the seminar approach of this course. Tolga is an amazing teacher and definitely take ECON 110 with him if you can.",
    "Strengths: Tolga is great - he's super engaging, makes jokes, and gets through all of the content. I enjoyed all the time I spent in class and I think I understood most if not all of the concepts when they were first explained. Weaknesses: Sometimes the class can seem a little fast, but if you review a little, it's definitely manageable.",
    "Tolga is a very fun guy who makes classes very lively and entertaining. However, we go through the material very quickly and not very thoroughly. Often, we are given formulas or graphs and we are not given an explanation of where these came from or how they were derived. I therefore felt like I only gained a superficial knowledge of microeconomics (which is probably all I should have expected from an intro class). Performance is given a lot of importance and we were constantly reminded of the expectations to beat the curve.",
    "Strengths: definitely Tolga! He's a really good professor and very patient and will repeat himself, and will answer all your questions in class. He also knows that economics and the long class time often leads to boredom\/falling asleep, so he will crack jokes, tell anecdotes, or something else to liven up the class. He also breaks down the complexity of the book well. Weaknesses: Tolga teaches really fast (you have to, in order to cover the entire textbook in one semester), and it's hard to keep up. Also, the concepts are difficult and if you don't already have an economic intuition, it may take a long time for you to understand fully (which is difficult as you only have a limited amount of time before the midterms\/finals). Improved: not much you can do in terms of teaching\/covering material. One suggestion is to hold more office hours\/peer tutoring sessions that is dedicated solely to answering questions\/explaining concepts\/reteaching material for students who are a little unsure or don't understand in the fast-paced class.",
    "I appreciated the structure of the course regarding the assignment timeline and how new lessons were introduced.",
    "The strength of the course was that it was interesting and related to a lot of real world situations. It was a small enough group that any questions could he answered. The class though, was fast paced and sometimes got extremely confusing with the graphs which were often unclear and messy.",
    "The strength of this course is in the engaging teaching style that a seminar allows for and the way it forces attendance upon its students. In addition I liked how closely the course material stuck to the textbook material, as it was very easy to go to the textbook and review concepts I didn't understand in class. I also thought that the textbook we used was really good, some sections at the end were a bit in the weeds, but overall it was really good at explaining concepts and focusing on what was important. The weakness of the course is that is feels diffuse and disjointed. A lot of topics feel as if they're basically unrelated, maybe there's a loose connection, but it doesn't feel cumulative at all. Often felt as if I was developing an understanding of 17 different things rather than one continuous field.",
    "Better balance between the amount of content covered in the first half of the term and the second half of the term.",
    "Tolga is generally an engaging lecturer more practice problems would be helpful",
    "The course had a decent teacher who loved teaching, but grading on the bell curve was cruel.",
    "Weaknesses: a lot of material to cover in a short time -- there need to be more ways that force students to review the material naturally from week to week -- optional examples and problems to review class sometimes felt slow because it can get off topic textbook is useless problem sets sometimes had problems that we weren't taught how to solve Strengths: fun lectures thanks to Tolga funny\/interesting examples to really imprint the material",
    "Strengths: Professor Koker makes learning econ genuinely fun! I hated micro in high school, but Tolga's anecdotes in class makes econ a lot more interesting and applicable to real life. OFFICE HOURS ARE AMAZING!! Weaknesses: I really can't think of any. I definitely wasn't the strongest student in this class, and I made a lot of mistakes, but I feel like I left the class with a pretty good understanding of microeconomics."

   "comments": [
    "Especially if they are considering studying in the social sciences (not just econ), but even if they aren't, this class is not too difficult and provides valuable insights into the field and into the way we live our lives. Highly recommend.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any students particularly interested in economics. My friends in Econ 115 often complained of how miserable and confusing their class was, but I was learning the same material and actually looked forward to going to class. The seminar is harder in the sense that you will have to be more engaged in class, but it is completely worth it. This class with Tolga is interesting, fun, and engaging, and it's indubitably the best way to learn intro microeconomics at Yale.",
    "I would recommend the course, because it is a prerequisite to other courses, and the professor is very nice, but I do think that anyone who feels that they learn better in smaller classes, should make an effort to really stay on top of the material over the course of the semester and avoid going into the final without having self-taught all along on top of engaging in the seminar.",
    "Yes, even for those not interested in economics the class is extremely accessible. It provides an important framework through which to understand the world.",
    "I absolutely would, although I would only recommend it if they were taking Professor Koker.",
    "Yes, if one is interested in economics-- and definitely over the large lecture class.",
    "If you're learning econ for the first time, I think this seminar would be a lot more helpful than the lecture class, because there is a lot of support in-class and in office hours. Intuition\/genuine understanding about economics probably take much longer to develop, but as someone who just started out learning economics, the course was informative and clear, I could see these connections forming and so I think it does its job as an intro class.",
    "Yes! Tolga is a fantastic teacher and he really makes this class enjoyable.",
    "Out of all of the intro-microecon sections, Tolga's section is the best. In general, ECON is a necessary skill for everyone to know about as it trains you to think more logically.",
    "Depends on how passionate they feel about econ. Tolga is a good teacher and he can be entertaining. But the ambience of the class is a little overwhelming, specially for an intro class. It is not a lot of work though, so if a person is passionate about econ, or just wants to try it out, id recommend.",
    "Yes, if you are going to take microeconomics, take it with Tolga.",
    "If you have the opportunity to take this section of micro, do it without any hesitation. Tolga is a great person to know and his class will teach you much more than the basics of microeconomics, you might also learn a few life lessons or two.",
    "I would recommend microecon for sure: it's an important foundational class for all college students. I would only recommend the seminar for two reasons: one, you want to make friends and have fun in class - two, you are only taking lectures and want to try a seminar class. However, I do think more hard-working people choose the seminar and that it is thus harder to beat the curve.",
    "Yes. It is a great class for intro micro. You learn a lot and it is not too difficult. However, the curve can sometimes be harsh, but i nonetheless recommend taking the seminar (110) over the lecture (115).",
    "Yes, definitely if you need to take microeconomics, or are interested in taking a basic economics class. It's much better than the lecture class in that aspect. However, don't fall asleep. Be engaged and eager to learn.",
    "Yes! The professor made the material very applicable to current issues in the world and made it easy to understand.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly Tolga's section. The concepts covered are incredibly interesting; and the way the Tolga teaches them allows for personal connections to be made to the lessons, allowing for deeper and more valuable internalization.",
    "Yes, it is very necessary to apply to other aspects of life.",
    "I would hesitantly recommend it. It's not going to expand your mind that much, but a basic understanding of how economists think is interesting. You also gain some practical understanding of how businesses maximize and how you can avoid scams and utility maximize in your own life. I got a bit of enjoyment from the class, but mainly I would recommend it because it's a pre-requisite for a lot of stuff and it is really not that difficult. If you read the textbook you should get an A-.",
    "If you want to learn economics, I would suggust starting here.",
    "I would recommend this course if that student was committed to studying a fair amount for this course. You have to actively review for this course week to week. You cannot just show up and expect to do well.",
    "Definitely! Tolga's seminar beats the lecture every time (trust me I've tried to sit in lecture and I now have major respect for the kids that had to do that all semester)."
