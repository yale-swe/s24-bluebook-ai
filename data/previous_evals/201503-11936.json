    "In Nonfiction Voice & Structure you write two drafts of two long-form journalism pieces (3,000-4,000 words each, or maybe longer). The first draft of each piece is workshopped in seminar. The first is supposed to make dramatic use of structure; the second is supposed to create an authorial persona that best serves the drama of the piece. During the first half of the semester, you read multiple long-form pieces from the course packet each week and discuss them in class (again, discussions are mainly focused around structure and persona, although we also had specific classes dedicated to snaps and endings). You continue discussing from the course packet throughout the semester, but by the second half you're returning to pieces you've already read. So, the reading workload drops as your writing workload picks up. Overall then, the workload of this class is manageable as long as you keep up with pitching and sourcing your pieces. Professor Strebeigh is always responsive to emails and is great at answering questions and helping you if you're ever stuck during the reporting process. Honestly, the opportunity to write two long, polished pieces of journalism is enough to warrant taking this class. And in addition, you improve so much as a writer, reporter, and reader. My approach to journalism has definitely changed, and I have a great appreciation for every step of the process in doing in-depth reporting. Lastly, Professor Strebeigh assumes that your work is for the world, not only for a Yale audience, which also pushes you to get your writing to the next level. I really appreciated that he treated us like real-world journalists, not mere college students. If you put the work in, you'll no doubt get a lot out of this class, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is serious about nonfiction writing. Get to know Professor Strebeigh before you leave Yale.",
    "This is a great class. This class is the perfect blend of learning via analysis and learning via doing. I learned so much about how to be a good nonfiction writer both in seminar and in the writing of the pieces themselves. In seminar, there is rarely a silent moment, Prof. Strebeigh constantly keeps the ball rolling, so that we are constantly evaluating a piece, from its macro structure down to a punctuation mark. He moves the seminar forward like a symphony (it takes time for people to adjust to this at first), weaving together people's comments to get to important points. (Best class, his class on \"snaps,\" ask him about it.) The writing of the pieces, involves working on two long pieces, which are then workshopped. His edits are crucial and thorough, like that of a magazine editor. I emailed him throughout the entire process, and he gives the best advice. If you want to be a non-fiction writer, take it.",
    "If you can, absolutely take it. First, it's awesome to be in a course surrounded by such interesting and hard-working writers\/reporters with such diverse interests. Workshops are, on one hand, awesome because you get to see what people have been working on outside of class--the places they have traveled, the people they have interviewed. On the other hand, the bar is pretty high, so that's nerve-wracking. Strebeigh's been teaching this class forever and it shows. Workload is pretty high--there's A LOT of reading (all really interesting), plus all the time you need to fully report two different stories, plus workshop feedback. Juggling both stories was hard at times, especially if you randomly draw a lower number - meaning you go toward the beginning. But if you're interested in longform, in narrative non-fiction, and in magazine journalism, you really should take this class - you'll be better for it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Strebeigh is absolutely incredible ridiculously energetic, with his own personal vernacular that is both hilarious and educational. He is endlessly dedicated to helping his students, and his comments on draft pieces are thorough, thoughtful and detailed. He does a lot of work helping his students understand what they would need to do to take their pieces up to national quality. The readings are fascinating (I'm keeping the course packet to pleasure read) and you don't have to read them in advance because he gives the class a few minutes to reread before discussion. The two pieces are time-consuming if you want to do them well, but other than that, no complaints.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who is very serious about journalism.",
    "Definitely take it, but only if you already have great story ideas in mind (as in, ideas that you've thought about extensively and perhaps even have sourcing for). Because you have to write two stories throughout the semester (in addition to doing the readings and workshopping other people's pieces), you'll want to have a head start. The deadlines come up quickly, and you want to be prepared. If you take the class, you'll have the opportunity to read incredible pieces selected by Strebeigh. You'll also begin to think about long-form in a very different way, paying attention to voice and structure. One note of caution: Strebeigh wholeheartedly believes in a very specific type of reporting, that of immersive\/in the moment\/I'm here in a boat in the middle of a river reporting on a river or something-type reporting. That reporting can be great, but it can also be limiting. It can be hard, for instance, to tackle much larger issues that don't really have an outlet for immersion. Think about whether that matters to you before taking the class.",
    "If you want to use your brain on THE WORLD AROUND YOU, take this course. I have never felt more positively challenged, integrated in my community, and satisfied with the reading and writing I did than I was in Nonfiction, and the class atmosphere is pretty motivating. While seminar is definitely long (and can sometimes feel too long), the dedication of the students and Professor Strebeigh makes the work feel important to both the present semester and all the interviewing, writing, and thinking you'll do after it.",
    "An fantastic class, the readings are excellent, and the papers are intense but rewarding. I would definitely recommend it, and Professor Strebeigh is wonderful.",
    "I would highly, highly recommend this class. Your knowledge of voice and structure in your writing will improve greatly, and you will come out of the class with two highly polished pieces of which you can be proud. Professor Strebeigh is one of the best, if not the best, professors I have had at Yale. His passion for the class and for the students is apparent daily, and the amount of time that he dedicates to each student's work is astounding. His comments are useful, insightful, and generous."
