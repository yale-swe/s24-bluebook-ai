    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale so far. Definitely worth getting up at 9 on a Thursday morning (if that's still when it's offered). Professor Latham is a truly captivating lecturer who never uses notes and entertains questions from the class whenever people have them. I learned a lot in this course about issues relevant to politics and to every human being's life. DEFINITELY worth taking.",
    "yes",
    "This is a super interesting class! The lectures were great. The material is interesting and was conveyed in an engaging way. The assessments are fair but not too difficult. Latham is a phenomenal lecturer, and also the material is really important for life, when you're out in the world and need to deal with the American health care system.",
    "Absolutely. It's relevant to every person who has been born, plans to have kids of their own, plans to be a part of a national system of healthcare, or plans to get old and die. I would definitely recommend it to anyone regardless their academic focus.",
    "Yes!The subject matter is very interesting and Professor Latham is a great lecturer. The downside is the lecture often moves very slowly and doesn't go into the depth I would have expected or hoped for. It's an engaging introduction and a low time commitment.",
    "It's too early but if they don't mind waking up id say take it",
    "This is good class if you want an introduction to how law informs real-world issues. Professor Latham is an excellent lecturer if you like to just listen to brilliant people talk. Workload isn't too bad at all, although if you really want to master all of the information, it is a lot of work. Would recommend the class, though.",
    "Interesting material, not terribly difficult format.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this if you are looking for a very interesting, low-key class with an amazing professor.",
    "I really enjoyed this class! Professor Latham was a great, engaging lecturer, which made it worth it getting up for the 9am lectures. You learn a lot about legal cases and the legal framework for a wide range of topics, like physician-assisted suicide, abortion, stem cell research, which is especially good to know for pre-meds. There's a lot of assigned reading, but you could get away without doing all of it and just study the lecture notes.",
    "I would whole-heartedly recommend PLSC 257 to another student. It was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and got me really interested in bioethics as a possible career direction.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Things you learn in this class are just things you need to know in general.",
    "Incredibly chill class. A midterm essay exam, one paper, and a final. Interesting topics, too--and Latham's a seriously excellent lecturer. Makes you think about relevant healthcare issues.",
    "Take it!!! It's an awesome class.",
    "Amazing. Do it. Do it do it doit do it do it. Seriously take this course! Become interested in bioethics! Alsoooo take the course he's teaching int eh fall that David Smith used to teach. You will not regret it.",
    "Absolutely recommend PLSC 257 to another student. It's fantastic, and if you can just will yourself to wake up at 9:00 AM, it is beyond worth it. The lectures are awesome, the material is interesting, and the grading is fair. If it weren't at 9:00 AM, I'd bet good money this would be one of the most popular courses at Yale.",
    "Take it. Take it. Take. Great lectures (get up for the 9am) and the info is amazing. Grading is fair (final was TOO easy and paper was chill).",
    "This course provides an overview of the major topics in bioethics from a legal perspective. The course material is grounded in federal and state law and many legal cases. Thus, the course served to help students think about these topics in bioethics through a \"lens of the law.\" Some of the topics covered include Doctor\/Patient Relationship, Informed Consent, Duty to Treat, Organ Transplantation, End of Life Care, Reproductive Rights, Public Health, and Justice\/Access in Healthcare. By the end of this course, I realized that I really had learned a substantial amount about these topics. I feel that this information is very useful and relevant both for students interested in entering the field of law and also for students interested in attending medical school.",
    "I found the material a little disappointing. Bioethics should be really interesting, but focusing so much on end-of-life-care and stuff made it kind of a downer. I wish we had foucsed more on like, biotechnology or something. That being said, it's medium-interesting and Latham is a very good lecturer. I don't necessarily like the lack of structure in the class though--i kind of wish there had been powerpoints or lecture notes to follow along with, or vocabulary words or something. I felt like a lot of the time he also avoided using \"big words\" to make ideas easier to comprehend, but it made things harder because he would just say stuff instead of being like, \"this is a law\" or like \"this is a judicial concept\" because he would phrase it as \"sometimes this happens...\" or \"sometimes people say...\" It's not particularly hard, though, so it's a good gut and if you're medium-interested in the material, it's a good so credit!",
    "It's not too bad. It's easy for sure, think I got an A, and kind of fun. Its interesting stuff to think about and none of it is really challenging. Having section is kind of annoying, but have it in the afternoon and its not so bad. I learned a lot and even though I don't really care about bioethics it was kind of interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in learning about bioethics and law - there are some really intriguing matters at hand.",
    "I thought Issues in Bioethics is a better class for someone interested in bioethics itself, which is to be expected. This class is still a very good class, and a good choice for anyone interested in the content.",
    "Lectures are pretty great. You'll learn a lot. I didn't do any of the reading, but I still came away with a solid understanding.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Stephen Latham is literally the best lecturer I've had at Yale. I know it's at 9:00, but I promise you it's worth getting up for every single lecture. The material is interesting and relevant to all of us, and you will come away from the class feeling like you've learned a lot. I'm not particularly interested in medicine or the law, and I LOVED this class - so DEFINITELY take it if you're interested in those things, and definitely take it if you're not.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in either bioethics, the law, or both. I say that because I was knew very little about bioethics but had an interest in the law that made me take this class, and it was worth it. Also: it's important to understand that there are only 3 things which make up your grade (midterm, paper, and final), so remember that.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "I would recommend Bioethics and the Law to anyone with an interest in law or legal philosophy; you learn a lot of cool\/weird stuff while discussing issues that are relevant to today's political discourse and that may still need solutions.",
    "A wonderful combination of just the right level of workload, interesting subject matter, engaging professor, and informative sections. My favorite class this semester.I recommend it to anyone and everyone!",
    "It was a solid class. Not too time consuming and you learn about pretty interesting issues.",
    "Interesting course that will familiarize you with some of the most widely discussed bioethics cases in the United States.",
    "Bioethics and the Law is a comprehensive overview of the legal issues surrounding organ donation, reproductive technologies, withdrawal of treatment, and public health policy. I highly recommend it!",
    "It's an interesting class but be prepare for the amount of reading required.",
    "Bioethics and the Law is an absolutely fantastic course that probes the main bioethical dilemmas facing our generation. If you have any interest in bioethics or in the law or in being a competent human being, you have to take this class.",
    "Survey class into American bioethics issues like abortion, healthcare insurance, assisted reproduction, assisted suicide, end-of-life care, and stem cell research. I would recommend it if you are interested in broadening your mind in these topics. Be aware though the the coursework is simple, it doesn't really incentivize you to do all of the work, which made me ill-prepared for parts of the class.",
    "If you're interested in the issues the class raises then take it.",
    "Professor Latham is a phenomenal lecturer, one of the best I've witnessed at Yale. This class is well taught, and the TAs are also great. The workload is not bad, but don't succumb to the temptation to put off studying for the exams until the night before.",
    "Bioethics and Law is perfect for someone looking for an engaging but not overly demanding lecture course to round out their schedule. There are a midterm (25%) and a paper (25%) before spring break, and only a final exam (50%) after. The midterm\/final consist of very open-ended essay questions that provide ample opportunity to show how much you know without requiring you to know nitty-gritty details. The course covers an interesting range of topics. Professor Latham is an extremely engaging lecturer. I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "Bioethics and the law is a really interesting class and Professor Latham is a really engaging lecturer. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Interesting Poli Sci class that covers relevant and current bioethics issues. Prof Latham includes current affairs like the Obamacare litigation into class which keeps it interesting. 1 midterm paper, midterm and a final. Its at 9 am though, if that is a deciding factor for you.",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in public health and\/or law. It was a great class, I just wish I could've gone to more lectures.",
    "Pretty good class",
    "Take it! Amazing class! take it without second thought! Waking up at 9am was hard, but this is the class for which you will do it without complaining!",
    "Really interesting class, gives you an idea of what's currently going on in bioethics and law, addresses organ donation, end of life treatment, abortion, health policy, and doctor-patient relationships. One short paper, one midterm, one final.",
    "I would suggest this class to another student because it is very interesting and you learn a lot of useful information here. There was 1 midterm, an essay, and a final so the workload is very manageable and the reading (if you do it) is interesting (but can be long). You don't have to keep up with all the reading, just know the lecture material and look up some of the cases in the book.",
    "If you like bioethics this class will be interesting for you. If you are looking to talk about it in a moral or ethical context, do not take bioethics and law. You will be tempted to fall into such arguments at times but the content of this class is strictly from legal perspectives. If that will frustrate you, take a bioethics class. If it is something you can do and get value from, this class is just excellent. The work load is low and not too difficult. It is pretty important to go to class and take notes so if you take it and expect to get the most out of this class you really need to commit. But it is worth it. I would recommend it for sure.",
    "An absolute winner. This is one of those must-take classes at Yale. Professor Latham is a brilliant and engaging speaker, and the subject matter is fascinating and delightfully controversial (abortion, birth control, end-of-life care, physician-assisted suicide, etc.). The workload is minimal--a short paper, midterm, and final--and all of the test content comes directly from Latham's lectures. Waking up for a 9am lecture is not so bad when Professor Latham is teaching it. Trust me, he's worth it.",
    "Definitely! The class has a low workload and the material is awesome. While the class is at 9 in the morning (which could be difficult at times), Professor Latham makes sure to keep the class interesting and teach about relevant biomedical topics that society faces. Take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "Bioethics and Law was my favorite course so far at Yale, even at 9 am. I even looked forward to the lectures because Latham was so good. It is not that much work, Latham is great, the material is super interesting, and there are only two tests and a paper. I would highly recommend this course for anyone, both poly science majors and not.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "Broad survey of the legal side of bioethical issues, but not without some attention to the moral\/ethical components thereof. Also provided me with an intro understanding of healthcare that has made me feel much more competent as a person.",
    "It\u0092s definitely a class worth taking. I think a lot of the ethical questions raised are really interesting, and it\u0092s a great introduction some current bioethical issues. You\u0092ll also learn all sorts of things about current health policy. Latham is phenomenal \u0096 the epitome of the Yale teacher. The workload essentially consists of going to lecture and doing the reading (which to be honest, was not necessary). The tests are straightforward, so don\u0092t freak out about those.",
    "If you're premed, definitely take it. Good way to understand what medicine looks like through the eyes of the law.",
    "PLSC 257 is a great course that makes you think about bioethics issues and their relation to the law."
