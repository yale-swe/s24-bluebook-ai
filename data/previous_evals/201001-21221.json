    "Maybe. Hacker is brilliant but should reconsider his approach to leading seminars. We spent about 85% of each class session painfully waiting as he tried to get us to solicit answers from the reading. We basically did the reading, but it's really awkward to answer point blank questions put to the whole class. A much better approach would be -- like the vast majority of seminars at Yale -- to spend the first 5 or 10 minutes (MAXIMUM) getting the facts straight with the Professor not afraid to either cold call or supply answers. Then we could actually discuss things for the rest of the time. As it was this year, I didn't really learn anything from class sessions or my classmates. I'm sure I could have so I thought it was really a sad waste.",
    "This course is essential for those who want to understand policy making process.",
    "Political Science 810 01 is a course that takes the student through a series of upper-level political science readings describing the effect of public policy on the overall political terrain. Having background knowledge in this particular kind of writing and research would, I imagine, be helpful for getting more out of the seminar. I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in reading the particular items listed on the syllabus, and who has background knowledge to bring to the table."
