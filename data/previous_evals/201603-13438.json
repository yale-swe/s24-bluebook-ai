   "comments": [
    "I learned how to analyze history and historiography in an unbiased context. I learned quite a bit about the history of Cuba. I also got a lot of practice writing and discussion historical analyses.",
    "This class certainly helped me develop my writing skills, especially in the genre of historical rather than literary analysis.",
    "This class has taught me to engage in nuanced discussions on regional issues and always remember the counter-narrative, the comparative and the context. I learned the Caribbean, and particularly Cuba, has such a rich history, and the extent of academic neglect on the region. I absolutely loved learning about a region we often take for granted. I also learned how diverse and exciting the subject of history is. The integration of readings from anthropologists, linguists, critical performance theorists, poets and philosophers alongside historians created a truly immersive study of Cuba.",
    "While this class was a lot of work, it was very rewarding. This class encourages analytical responses to readings and in depth discussion questions\/discussions.",
    "I further developed my critical thinking skills when applying them to every part of the history of Cuba, and my writing improved tremendously. I further understood the importance of having different points of view and lenses to view history.",
    "I learned how to look at historical events through secondary sources and see how there a nuances in each situation.",
    "Critical historical analysis, challenging dominant narratives, historical writing skills\/essay writing in general",
    "I learned how to read the work of historians for their arguments, and how to have meaningful conversation about those arguments. In the process, I learned a lot about the history of Cuba, especially the history of racial, social (class), and gender conflicts, and gained more awareness of the Latin American world.",
    "This course allowed me to deepen my knowledge and understanding about the Cuban nation and its history. From the colonization of the island to the years in which it became a communist country led by Fidel Castro, the Cuban people have faced a long struggle in determining their identity and freedom of rights. I read about different social, economical, political, and cultural perspectives, and discussing them with classmates."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class discussions were always very interesting, and I enjoyed them. The amount of reading was probably too much in my opinion because it just became overwhelming on some weeks. So less reading, or possibly reading more concise documents would improve the class. Overall, though, it was a good class.",
    "Professor Eller is an amazing teacher, however, I think that the workload for this course was a bit much at times. Often times there would be hundreds of pages of reading for one class, along with the weekly response papers.",
    "This course was easily my favorite of the semester. I don't think there are many changes to the syllabus I would suggest, except possibly spending a bit more time covering the period between the 1898 Independence and the 1959 Revolution. The coverage for this period of time was a bit lacking.",
    "Very interesting and engaging content. Takes into account different perspectives from authors of different backgrounds. Quality of discussion in seminar dependent on students, but content causes students to be fully engaged and driving discussion. Seminars at the beginning of the year start off a little slow.",
    "A strength was the conversation had in class about the material. A weakness would be the vast amount of reading.",
    "The strengths are that it covers many important themes and time periods in Cuba, and the class goes beyond just teaching us what happened. The weaknesses are that it is kind of hard to follow, for exactly the same reason. The historical facts are almost a sidenote to the discussions of race, class, and gender, etc... so it ends up feeling like you're doing twice the work; figuring out what happened, and then figuring out how to analyze it.",
    "The course is discussion-based and the readings proved central to the topics of discussion. I think the questions asked at the beginning of each class were very helpful in looking at important issues from different angles."

   "comments": [
    "I would only recommend it to students who are okay with the amount of work. It was a fascinating class, and I am glad that I took it, but I also feel that my semester would have been significantly more manageable with a less demanding class.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in the class. Professor Eller is wonderful, and the course content is very interesting, if you can keep up with it. Be aware that this course requires a lot of reading and writing: there are weekly response papers, along with weekly readings and a final paper.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Eller is a wonderful human and an excellent professor. This is my favorite course I have taken at Yale. This is a great introduction to the history department and Latin America in particular. If you are at all considering the course, you definitely should try to get a seat. A few people left early into the year because the reading may seem like a lot, but the workload is really not difficult at all and the discussions and readings are all wonderful. I can not praise this course enough.",
    "This class requires a lot of reading but the majority of it is very interesting and the class discussions are great. I highly recommend this class for motivated freshman.",
    "Absolutely. Regardless of major, this class should be taken by anybody who has the chance. The content and intellectual challenge makes this class worth taking.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Yes. 1-2 page reading response every week and one final paper. The readings were usually interesting, but often very long and dense.",
    "I would recommend it if you want to learn more about the Latin American experience (particularly Cuba) and you have prior interest in the topic. If you're just taking it out of the blue, it might be a bit much work. It was an extremely interesting class, but you have to put in a lot of work to get a good experience out of it.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who are interested in learning the history of a country that has faced many challenges in its struggle to become independent. It expands the way you think about colonized countries and American involvement in Latin America and the Caribbean."
