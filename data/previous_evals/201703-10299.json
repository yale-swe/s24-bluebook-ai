   "comments": [
    "This course introduced me to the practice of reading various works as a way to attend to dissenting or divergent understandings of a historical period. I gained a deeper background in the historical and theoretical underpinnings of modern Afro-diasporic work. The course offered new ways to understand the relationships between Afro-caribbean literature and music, the way music avoids some of the policing that gets attached to speech, and the hope of enjoyment in music. Links between the early 20th century \"New Negro\" movement, and contemporary black poetry also began to emerge for me, through the literature of the Caribbean. The practice of trying to understand various moments as part of a larger continuing one became really important to me this semester.",
    "Afro-Modernisms is invaluable to the student who wishes to read Afro-Caribbean and Afro-American literature, history, and poetry. The reading list is sublime, and the secondary articles are quite good, too.",
    "I got a better grasp of the political climate of the 20th century as it was represented in literary prose and poetry.",
    "I learned how better to craft the stakes of my intellectual interests and arguments.",
    "This class was a remarkable accomplishment -- a broad historical survey of experimental black writing throughout the twentieth-century, a comparative study of different critical theories of the period, and a rigorous training in the formal analysis of poetry and fiction. To those ends, Professor Reed deftly negotiated broad theoretical and historical questions and local, specific, textual concerns particular to each week's readings.",
    "Through taking this course, I learned a great deal about jazz and poetry as well as lots of African American literary and historical history that I simply wasn't aware of. I encountered quite a few texts and writers who I had never read before although I had heard of them. More specifically, the student presentations at the beginning of the class were useful exercises in being able to contextualize, summarize, and evaluate another scholar's argument in a succinct way. I imagine this skill will be useful for later conference presentations as well as writing future essays and articles.",
    "- knowledge of literatures from the Black diaspora that I would not have ordinarily thought of as modernist - sharpened close reading skills",
    "Professor Reed was an incredibly knowledgable and helpful instructor."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I appreciated ALL the texts in this course. Each of them contained moments of revelatory style, content, and relationship to the larger concerns of the course, I loved having all the secondary texts available at the beginning of the semester, and having the choice of which secondaries would be most important to me was a great way to meet all the perspectives in the student body. Sometimes I wished we might occasionally have been given a specific secondary focus to go with the texts in the class. But that was never terribly detrimental. Sometimes the discussions focused more on secondary material and theory at the expense of the concerns in the main text, but they usually informed the main text, provided ways to return to it.",
    "The strengths of the course are in the texts chosen and in Professor Reed's expansive knowledge. He approaches the text from a literary standpoint and from a broader cultural perspective. He ties in, for instance, Alan Lomax and the history of the record or a comparison of jazz LP records. His audio supplements brought new life to literature. The weaknesses, however, are in the discussions; several graduate students with agendas (namely Marxism or theory-on-steroids) tended to derail the discussions of the reading. As a result, some classes involved just two or three graduate students arguing with one another about a secondary source for a majority of the time.",
    "It would have helped sometimes for Professor Reed to specify more clearly in advance which of the recommended secondary readings he planned to focus on, but I otherwise appreciated his approach to them: providing us with ample lists of works to consult, without overwhelming us with additional reading. One strength of the class was the way in which it encouraged us to read theoretical texts literarily, and literary texts theoretically. One possible weakness, however, was that sometimes conversations (more often as a result of student contributions than the instructor's) broached a level of abstraction that could be disorienting when we didn't spend enough time laying the groundwork. This was, however, not always a problem--and indeed sometimes a great strength of the discussions.",
    "The organization of this course seemed considered and intentional. The primary texts as well as the slew of secondary materials available allowed me to peruse a wide discourse for each text and choose whichever secondary sources would be most helpful based on my own perspective and motivations for taking the course. The biggest weakness of the course was that class discussion often favored authorial biography, historical context, and other topics surrounding the text rather than the primary text itself. This was understandable because most of the secondary materials were about those extra-literary issues, but I would have enjoyed grappling with the primary texts more.",
    "Strengths: - the syllabus had good breath - the syllabus was flexible - we were encouraged to speak about what mattered to us - we were encouraged to perform close readings of the primary texts Areas for Improvement: - focus more on how the texts are modernist"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, even if the student was not interested specifically African-American\/Afro-Caribbean literature ,because the texts are all helpful for developing a personal practice of counter-reading, or reading against the grain of accepting prescribed ways of reading not just black lit, but literature in general.",
    "Absolutely, but be mindful that discussions might lean heavily towards theory -- though that depends upon the composition of the class. You should definitely take a class with Professor Reed!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Black literatures and 20th century literary studies.",
    "Yes. It deals with subjects and texts that are hard to neatly define or organize and is interesting and helpful as a result.",
    "Yes, I would, even or especially if the material is not an area of immediate interest for this hypothetical student. I say this because Professor Reed did a very good job modeling a kind of critical, poetically sensitive inquiry that would be relevant for graduate students with interests in any field.",
    "Yes, I thought this class was well organized and well taught. I would recommend this course to any student interested in African-American literature, poetry, jazz, and the political motivations behind writing.",
    "Yes! I read a lot of really important material and felt supported when it didnt make sense to me. The professor did a great job of making it accessible to new people.",
    "Absolutely. This course will certainly go on to shape my research."
