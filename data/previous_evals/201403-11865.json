   "comments": [
    "If you want to be an actor, you first need to learn to use every part of yourself and be as open as possible to receiving guidance form not just your scene partner, but also the audience. This class teaches you that and so much more. You would be an idiot not to take it.",
    "Thst 210 is a class where you find your artistic center. You cut away the years of stereotypical performance crap, you peel away the hardened layers of daily social acting. Once you have come to the center of who you are as a person, you begin to create. At first it is awkward and new, but by the end you find the most precious art comes from an honest heart. I would recommend this class to anyone who wishes to write, act, perform, or become a very self-aware human being.",
    "This is without a doubt the best class I have taken at Yale. It is unlike any other class I have ever taken and built my confidence as an actor, writer, and just overall conscious human being. 210 with Deb makes every theater studies requirement worthwhile! It will change your life, it will change the way you think about yourself and it will be an unforgettable experience with unforgettable friends! TAKE IT.",
    "This class is amazing and I would recommend it to absolutely everyone. It teaches you to be a person. It teaches you to feel and to bring that feeling to life. It's not just an acting class. It's a life class. Through writing exercises, movement exercises, and a bunch of other things, students learn to express themselves in life-changing ways and learn that everyone is an actor.",
    "Take it. It builds community with your fellow actors and teaches you that it's ok to feel and experience your own emotions. It won't teach you classical theater techniques though",
    "It's Theater of Desire, baby.",
    "A class you look forward to going to every week. The most enjoyable class I've ever taken at Yale.",
    "Yes, but only if you are seriously thinking about the Theatre Studies major and are ready to spend a lot of time getting focused around getting in touch with your emotional and creative self.",
    "Absolutely take it!!! I loved this class and everyone in it! It was a great size and all the activities and exercises we did were helpful, insightful, and made me a better actor and writer. I never likes writing before this class and now I find myself wanting to write things down more--you never know when you'll need a snippet of dialogue or an image. Deb Margolin is a fabulous instructor. She is caring, knowledgable, hysterical, and invested in her students so take it with her if at all possible. This class really invites you to explore yourself as an artist and really shape your own work.",
    "TAKE IT WITH DEB. Lie, cheat, steal, do whatever you have to do to get in Deb's section. She's a brilliant and gifted professor and this class will change your life."
