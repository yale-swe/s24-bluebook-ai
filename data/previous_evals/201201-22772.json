    "You learn a ton about Confucianism. If your focus is China, definitely take this class. 2 6 page papers and 1 final long one, and I'm not sure how the grading works, but the class will still greatly deepen your understanding of Chinese culture.",
    "yes, but only if you are interested in Chinese philosophy.",
    "This class was extraordinary. Professor Chin is a wonderful teacher, the reading list is fascinating and thought provoking--what more could you want? One of my friends who took the course two years ago said it was the best class she has taken at Yale. I can certainly understand why; I feel the same way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in understanding themselves better and learning more about the essence of Chinese thought."
