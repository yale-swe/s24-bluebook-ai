    "This class was pretty unconventional in that professor rosenzweig lectures a lot for the first 10 weeks and then we do a paper presentation and a mini stata project. The papers were interesting, a lot of them published earlier than I had seen in other classes and a lot of great ones from professor rosenzweig himself.",
    "Take it for your senior seminar! You learn a lot, gives you a different way to think about the world, and Professor Rosenzweig is amazing. Very relaxed class atmosphere and manageable workload. You will learn to SELL YOU BULLOCKS, SELL YOUR DAUGHTERS."
