    "I would probably only recommend this class if you are a psych major. You get a lot of helpful advice on how to conduct your own experiments and how to write good research papers. This class is however a lot of work and a bit of a time commitment the first 2 months. It gets a lot less towards the end of the semester.",
    "If you are looking at this class you need it for your major. It serves it's purpose. Class quizzes for the first half and your final paper for the second half of the class. Just stay on top of your shit.",
    "This is a class for people who really want to learn how to write scientifically and learn how to do research. It is not an easy class but it is very worth the time you put into it because you can see improvement over the semester. It is very important to take this class if you interested in psychology research because you learn many skills that you will need later on. Also you get to design and write about your own experiment which makes you think in a very different way than other classes do.",
    "Yes, you will really learn to write clearly. You get a lot of very specific feedback.",
    "Do the readings for the quizzes. The second half of the semester is very self-paced, which works well for some students but not others. Ask questions and use the writing tutors to help with your papers."
