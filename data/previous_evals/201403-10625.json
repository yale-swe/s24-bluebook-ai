   "comments": [
    "This is a great but challenging course. I would recommend it to another student if he is really interested in primate behavior and human evolution. This will be a good training.",
    "This is a seminar based mostly on reading and discussing classic and current papers. The class periods are almost entirely discussion (no lecture), which is great for really engaging with the material.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to all fellow students. The class reviews the literature on non-human primate models of human evolution, you learn about chimpanzees and their abilities, similarities and differences to humans, other primates, and extinct hominins.",
    "Yes, definitely take Anth 849. You learn so much about how primate characteristics are relevant to us and our evolution, and this learning is all done in a very fun and enjoyable environment. The reading critiques may seem a bit intimidating at first especially if this is your first time doing them, but Professor Watts will help you every step of the way, and by the end you'll realize just how far you've advanced in critically analyzing primary literature.",
    "This class is great for anthropologists, primatologists, ecologists, and evolutionary biologists. From taking this class you gain a better understanding of human evolution, primate behavior and evolution, and how non-human primates living today can help us better understand the evolution and behavior of hominins. I would definitely recommend this class to other students.",
    "As mentioned above, this course teaches us as much about where we come from as does a biology or history course. I would absolutely recommend this. Having gone through the course myself, I would advocate to install a version of this course in high schools or middle school. I was truly shocked at how much about our own lives I did not know prior. Opposition to our evolution I believe stems from a lack of its understanding, ANTH 849 could greatly help with that."

   "comments": [
    "This course provided me with a lot of information about primate behavior in the field, which is one of my interest for future research. It greatly deepen my knowledge. However, I am not sure whether it will contribute to my dissertation as I haven't decide what to do for the dissertation yet.",
    "It gave me some background in primatology, as well as familiarity with key hypotheses on how knowledge of nonhuman primates can be used to analyze human evolution and ecology, which is a fundamental part of biological anthropology.",
    "This course enhanced my knowledge of my discipline by increasing my overall knowledge, introducing me to new and interesting ideas, and contributed to my research through a term paper topic that was interesting and pertinent.",
    "This course helped me to better understand how we can use primatology to better understand our own species. This was really important for me as someone who studies non-human primates and has more of an ecology and evolutionary biology background, but is now a student in an anthropology department.",
    "This course did not act as a direct parallel to my own research, but it created a groundwork on which I could later base my research on. I was exposed to the type of experiments researchers do in the field, the sort of language experts use, and many of the techniques used in observing primate models, all of which will be useful later when I will be working on my dissertation."
