   "comments": [
    "You will learn either a lot from this course, or very little. Prof. Lamoreaux is an amazing resource -- talk to him often, and you will be glad you did. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you will learn far more about physics than what the course demands. The experiments themselves can be conceptually simple, but executing then well requires good technique, and very careful analysis of the aftermath. On reflection, these are good skillsets to acquire even in theoretical work.",
    "The labs are more time consuming than 205\/206, but also more interesting. You have to do a lab on the Ising model, but other than that you get to choose from a bunch of different ones. Not too much work.",
    "Definitely the best lab. Not stressful at all and there is the opportunity to learn a lot of science.",
    "PHYS 382L is a super fun course that all physics majors should definitely take. Additionally even engineering majors may find this lab fun seeing as it thoroughly teaches the scientific method in three separate experiments spread throughout the semester.",
    "I didn't enjoy the 205 or 206 labs at all, so was surprised by how much I apprecisted this class. You work on three substantial projects, mostly of your choosing, over the course of the semester, and in doing so have a chance to really learn about the topics and gain some useful MATLAB and data analysis skills. Highly recommended, but make sure you have at least some basic coding skills going into the class.",
    "One of the best if not the best physics class I've taken at Yale. I learned so much material. The labs were a lot of fun to do and really well prepared. The support system is fantastic, so it's a great mix of really advanced physics laboratory work and an undergraduate feeling of support from the teaching staff. I never dreaded going to lab like I did for the introductory lab sequence. Reports were a lot less work than expected, and if you stay on track with analysis, it's honestly not a very stressful class. Definitely take this if you're interested in more physics. This is a hard class to take if you haven't taken 420 and 440 so strongly consider waiting to take this until after those classes. It will GREATLY help with understanding the material. Some coding experience is also helpful, though you will learn a huge amount during the course (MATLAB).",
    "You're taking this for the major, so you don't have an option. That being said, the experiments are pretty interesting. Just know that you'll devote a fair amount of time to it. Nothing crazy, but it takes time. Labs vary wildly in difficulty, by the way.",
    "PHYS 382L is a really fun course that allows you to try out some experiments on your own, and the professor and teaching assistants are all very attentive and helpful. I would recommend having one of your friends as your lab partner (you'll be spending a lot of time working on lab with them)! Also, definitely do the Superconducting Tunnel Junction lab if you have a chance!",
    "Probably the best course I've taken at Yale. Great projects, Lamoreaux is great at helping small groups, and the TAs are all phenomenal. Workload isn't very much despite the intimidating appearance of the course. No reservations whatsoever.",
    "A good introduction to experimental methods in various fields of physics. The pace of the work is quite different from problem set based classes: you have several weeks per project, and must be self-motivated to avoid late nights and bad results as the report due dates approach. Overall though, it's very manageable and you will find yourself learning a lot. It's also a great way to get to know some of the grad students and your fellow physics majors."
