    "PERS 180 was much more practically inclined than any other Persian class I've taken at Yale. Whereas the elementary- and intermediate- level classes are focused on rigorously developing the four main language skills (reading, speaking, writing, and listening), PERS 180 focuses more exclusively on reading and translating actual Persian written works. Each week, students must post a translation of a written piece--along with a short analysis written in Persian and a list of new vocabulary they learned--to Canvas. These pieces range from thousand year old travel logs to current news items from popular Iranian news sites to some of the most beloved Iranian short stories. Ostad Shayesteh is very flexible in allowing students to choose pieces to translate that are personal or academic interest. We had one midterm assignment, a longer translation and analysis assigned by Ostad, and a final translation similar to the midterm. By the end of the course, I felt much more comfortable reading both older and more contemporary Persian texts and accurately translating them into English."

   "comments": [
    "The greatest strength of this course is its usefulness for anyone with a personal or academic interest in Iran or the Persian-speaking world. The ability to read and to translate a wide variety of Persian sources is a very useful skill, and Ostad allows students to tailor their translation work to their interests. If students were conducting research on Iran for a thesis or another class, they were allowed to translate sources that they could use for this outside research for their weekly assignments, midterm, and final. At the same time, when Ostad did assign specific stories or news articles to translate instead of having us pick our own, they were always beautiful stories or fascinating news articles. You really get a sense for the range of Persian writing styles (literary vs. news reporting, formal vs. informal) and gain a knowledge of popular Iranian writers and the Iranian newsmedia (which news sources are conservative or reformist)."
