   "comments": [
    "You'll complete your own independent science research project- a great way to fufill the science requirement in a non-gut way. Interesting, but hard work. A large in class time commitment, not too much other work outside of class.",
    "Whether you are interested in science or not, TAKE THIS CLASS!! MCDB 166 is without a doubt the most exciting science class open to freshmen at Yale! This class gives each student the opportunity to conduct his\/her own research project; students begin by collecting soil samples from around campus and later isolate bacteria from the samples, test for antibiotic production and study a section of the isolate's DNA. Class time is divided evenly between research in the lab and lectures from Professor Bascom-Slack. The workload is very reasonable, especially considering it is a 1.5-credit class. This is a once-in-a-lifetime research opportunity, so don't pass it up!",
    "Take it! It's fun! You actually learn some really interesting and relevant things! It's hands-on! It's a credit and a half! Yay!",
    "A lab-based course aimed at finding antibiotic-producing bacteria. Low student to faculty ratio.",
    "This is the best class offered to freshmen at Yale -- humanities, science, or otherwise. You engage with a real scientific crisis (namely, the growing resistance to antibiotics) through real research involving culturing microorganisms from soil samples and screening for antibiotic production. If, like me, you have not taken a Bio course since freshman year of high school and cannot differentiate between a human cell and that of a bacteria, fear not; there were fewer than ten people in my class, over half of whom are not intended science majors, and we received much individual attention and help from the two professors and two TFs who presided over the proceedings. All of the material is highly accessible, especially if you take advantage of the small class size in order to ask questions. I cannot recommend this class highly enough, whether you are really into microbiology or simply looking for an exciting way to fulfill a science credit. How many classes are there for which you can say that taking the course may give you the chance to change the world?",
    "Mixture of lab and lecture that's much better than taking them separate. Would have each 2 hour session be about half and half.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is really unlike any other lab course I've taken in that it is research based, and the students investigate an individual project. It also introduces you to many basic concepts in microbiology as well as different research methods.",
    "I would recommend this class as a great way to get a hands on research experience and an introduction to biology as an alternative to the intro bio sequence. The teaching team was great and the research was really cool. The goal of the class is to discover antibiotic-producing microbes in the soil. Each class period is divided into a lecture and a lab component. The workload was very reasonable for 1.5 credits, although you spend 6 hours in class each week. It was really nice to end the class with a poster symposium, in which you compile all the work you have done over the course of the semester and present to faculty in the lobby of KBT."
