   "comments": [
    "Credit\/D, unless you're a philosophy major. Even then, maybe credit\/d.",
    "Very interesting, yet hard, but worth it because it makes you think differently about the world. Take credit\/d though!",
    "Great class, really interesting, great discussion. Take the class if you can get in, and get yourself on next year's waiting list if you can't. It's definitely worth your time.",
    "Don't take it for a grade because it's not worth the stress, but yeah take it (if you liked intro to ethics and other philosophy classes at yale).",
    "I think it is rare to have your arguments and thoughts scrutinised so critically and it can be a rewarding experience. However, it is very tiring and you have to be prepared to put a lot of time into the class.",
    "Yes. Very satisfying class. Just remember to take it Credit\/D\/Fail (at least until you get your first essay grade) because he will fail you if that's the grade he thinks the paper deserves.",
    "Excellent course. Prof. Kagan has designed a clear and thorough introduction to it. The workload was manageable (three short papers), the discussions were illuminating (and often FUN and funny), and the pacing of the class was neither too fast nor too slow. Professor Kagan clearly enjoys teaching and cares about his students. His comments on papers are detailed and helpful, and he makes himself freely available to talk to students about papers and the material. He guides discussions with a light but skilled hand; most of our discussions were very good. DO NOT be scared away by his reputation as a harsh grader. If meet with him about paper topics beforehand, take the time to polish your paper before submitting it (NB: as he says on the first day, he is very generous with extensions), and read through his paper comments carefully, you will do fine. In short, this class is interesting, challenging, and quite fun. It's well-worth taking.",
    "Great material and serious questions that everyone should be forced to grapple with. I had taken intro ethics, but this class forced me to consider the subject at a deeper level and (for now at least) my views have changed. Shelly is a hard grader, yeah, but things will get better after the first paper once you adapt to his style. Take it Cr\/D if you want, but you really won't get anything out of the class besides a course credit if you don't force yourself to take it seriously.",
    "yes a great course on how to do analytic philosophy the right way",
    "YES! Shelly's seminar is awesome. Be prepared to discuss some tough issues, form opinions, be vocal, and especially write good philosophy papers. But it's very enjoyable and you will learn a lot - about thinking, about philosophy, and about yourself. If you can get into the course, absolutely take it."
