    "A good class that went through a lot of literature, very quickly.",
    "If you need a WR credit, I'd recommend it. It was relatively low stress. We read Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, Moby Dick, Elizabeth Bishop poems, Claude McKay's Harlem Shadows, an autobiography by Bucky Fuller, short stories by Philip K. Dick, and Native Speaker by Chang-Rae Lee. It wasn't quite the selection of literature that I was hoping to read (e.g. Fitzgerald, Steinbeck). There were 4 essays that weren't very stressful (the last and longest one was 10 pages so it's manageable). However, we didn't really discuss the essays in class until the week the essay was due, or the week before the essay was due, so be sure that you understand what the prompt is, well before the deadline. Figuring out 2 days before the deadline that my essay didn't quite answer the prompt was pretty stressful. Professor Williams is a really cool guy though. He's in a band called Faded Paper Figures, and he invited us to his house (he's a Trum Fellow) at the end of the semester! The music he makes is pretty cool - especially if you're into alternative or indie.",
    "Yes, but only because I had Professor Williams! Super chill professor. The discussions were wonderful. Readings can be dry but it doesn't matter because you don't need to know all of them in depth for the papers. Loved the four-paper structure of my class. Got my WR out of the way without having to write an intense amount.",
    "Engl 127 is a heavy-reading class. You must actually do the reading for the course, because Professor Williams gives pop quizzes on the reading almost every class. We read interesting texts and you might even discover a new favorite author in the process. I would recommend this class to anyone who can read pretty quickly and likes to analyze text.",
    "ENGL 127 is a good class! A pretty solid option for a 5th class too -- assuming you don't have too much reading already and can stay on top of it. Doing the reading is a must. There are only 4 assignments, although the third feels very work-heavy and feels a little too close to the 4th assignment (both 10+ page assignments). That said, Williams is a great seminar manager and students control most of the discussion. The readings are interesting -- except for Buckminster Fuller, which I hope to god will be removed from the syllabus. Overall, a fairly work-light and reading-focused class with a good professor -- I'd recommend it.",
    "Amazing. Take this class! Probably going to major in English because of it. Professor Williams is so engaging and great -- he can be slightly hard to contact sometimes because he's so busy, but he's awesome personally and as a teacher. He's hilarious and engaging and ties everything together really well. It can be a little hard to do all the readings, but do them; it's worth it. I think this class has made me a better thinker, writer, and reader. Professor Williams' assignments are particularly nice compared to the other sections of 127 -- four big essays and you get to choose which book you write about for each essay.",
    "If you've never taken a class in the English department but want to, I would definitely recommend ENGL 127 with Professor Williams! You get the chance to read a lot of great literature in a semester, and Prof. Williams creates a great atmosphere in the class so everyone is comfortable sharing their ideas. The workload is reasonable (4 writing assignments, and you get a lot of flexibility with choosing topics) although pretty reading-heavy some weeks. Overall, this is definitely a worthwhile course and probably one of my favorites at Yale.",
    "It is a solid literature course in selected American works. If you're interested in reading a lot and writing a handful of papers (not every week, we had about 4-5), this is a good class.",
    "Engl 127 is an incredible class. There is a lot of reading, but it is completely manageable. Professor Williams seems to favor a mix of lecturing and class discussion, which is especially nice if you don't like to talk much in class. He also assesses participation with short reading quizzes (i.e. one very simple question per class), which, again, is nice if you don't like to talk much and worry about your participation grade in discussion sections. He also doesn't grade very harshly. You will learn so much about a lot, but not all, of the authors you study, given the brief time you spend with each work. Definitely recommended.",
    "ENGL 127 05 is a great class to cover American literature and the attributes of American literature. The amount of reading and writing assigned was very manageable, and the discussion in class were stimulating."
