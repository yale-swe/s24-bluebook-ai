    "Question 4: The course material felt repetitive at times, but also very fast in the pace with which material was covered. I don't think we spent enough time going in depth on certain topics in lecture(such as Life Cycle Costing), but we were required to be able to use\/manipulate financial formulas to complete a problem set (which was pretty challenging). I would have liked more in-class examples\/case studies that served as building-blocks for completing assignments and learning the software.",
    "I though Phil was a great instructor. He was always very responsive and I learned a lot from his officehours. While I appreciated Tom's connections for the final projects and his feedback, I found him to be less approachable and a bit intimidating.",
    "N\/A",
    "Question 10- Professor Nuss was extremely helpful both inside and outside of class in clarifying concepts and helping guide work on client projects. Professor Swarr was sometimes overly abrasive with students in his email exchanges and answers to questions about the homework.",
    "I think that LCA is a very useful tool, and this class is one that can be very beneficial to FES students. I had heard great reviews of Matt Eckleman's class and his teaching, and was disappointed to hear that he had left FES this year. However, LCA was a skill that I really wanted to develop, so I decided to take this class. However, I was very disappointed with the quality of the class, the teaching, the assignments, and the learning. I found it to be an incredibly frustrating class and did not learn very much. After taking it, I still have a very limited understanding of LCAs and how to do them, which is a huge disappointment. There is a lot of work that needs to be done to make this class of the high quality I expect of FES classes.I recognize that this is the first time that Tom and Phil taught this class and that they had limited time to prepare for it, but I feel like they did not adequately make use of the resources that Matt had previously prepared for this class. Instead, it seems like they started everything afresh, with very poor results. It sounds like Matt had good lecture materials, readings, and assignments. Phil and Tom should have used more of Matt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s materials rather than trying to build their own from scratch with limited time available, and with very poor results.The lectures were confusing and the lecture material was not very helpful to learning. Each lecture was essentially several different powerpoint presentations (which should have been amalgamated for less confusion), and these consisted primarily of graphs with no explanations, so as notes, the lecture materials were not helpful as learning resources. Our ability to get anything out of the lectures is based on whether or not we can follow what Phil or Tom said during class, then write some cohesive notes to stand alone, as most of the graphs\/ lecture slides were not helpful as resources.Both Phil and Tom's teaching styles need significant improvement - neither of them seem like they have much teaching experience, and they are not very good at explaining concepts in a way that students can understand. Phil speaks far too quickly and goes through material very rapidly, losing students within the first few minutes. It feels like he is speaking to post-doc students, and that he forgets that we are not experts in this area, so his language is too complex, his pace too quick, and he doesn't provide adequate explanations. Tom seems like he is presenting to corporate executives, and speaks at a very conceptual level, but it is difficult to tie what he is saying to the course content, LCA, as it feels like he is discussing the strengths and weaknesses of LCA amongst corporate practitioners very familiar with it, when as a student, I would be sitting there still struggling to understand what LCA is. When I attended Matt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s guest lecture, I found him to be a terrific instructor who was able to present concepts in a way that could be easily understood, and I had a glimpse of how if I had taken this class under him, I would likely have completed the class with a much better grasp of LCA.",
    "Commenting with my peers, we were all frustrated with the class because we came in with high expectations from reviews of Matt Eckelman's class. Phill barreled through the content in monotone and did not relate the class material very well to it applications in practice. It would have been useful to read more case studies about uses for LCA and to use SimaPro in class more than twice."

    "more lectures",
    "My project was kind of lame. Our client knew exactly what he wanted and didn't give us enough creative freedom or room to fully utilize LCA. I think more open-ended projects, like Chipotle and Hershey Kisses, are conducive to better learning and applications of course material.",
    "The professors are knowledgeable but struggled at effective teaching. Care has to be given to understanding how to present material to be conducive to learning; things were rushed, or explained out of order and not given meaning, and it left it feeling haphazard and confusing.Guest lectures were a nice addition.",

    "lectures need to be more engaging",
    "See 14, re: project timing. Clarity of questions and instructions on homework in advance of when the assignment is due.",
    "There were too many readings that were very long and not very helpful to our learning. The course should focus on fewer, shorter readings thatare more practical and helpful for us to learn about LCA and complete the assignments.The assignments were much too difficult. We were not prepared to complete them based on the material presented in the lectures, and so they took a very long time to complete, even when working on them in groups. Most of us were very unclear whether or not we did them correctly at the point we handed them in, which is atypical when a group of students works on something together. We were never given answer keys for any of the assignments so we were never given the opportunity to see where we went wrong or how LCAs should have been appropriately done. We never discussed the assignments in class afterwards, nor had an opportunity to understand how they should have been answered. The assignments were graded far too harshly, with students frequently getting grades as low as 4\/10, which is unacceptable for a program such as this. If excellent students are getting grades that low, it is a sign that we were unprepared to complete the assignments based on the material presented in class. The instructors did not seem concerned when students got such low grades. They did not seem to recognize that our grades are a serious issue to us.In addition, the assignment answer keys should be generated in advance of the assignments being distributed, so that they can be distributed once all students have turned in the assignment. In at least the case of the first assignment, both instructors and the TA got different answers for the assignment and could thus not agree on what the correct answers for the assignment were. Yet we were still graded on all questions in this assignment. If the instructors and TA don't have a solid answer for an assignment question, this question should never have appeared on the assignment in the first place and we should not have been graded on this question.The assignment due dates should have been scheduled in advance, which they were not. For example, the week before spring break, immediately after handing in one assignment, we were told there would be another one due before spring break. This is a crunch time when many assignments are due, and most of us were at our limits by then, having scheduled every minute of our time up until spring break, with no time to devote to an additional assignment, especially one that routinely takes at least 10 hours to complete. We had been told previously that we would get two weeks to complete each assignment, but we only got one week for this one.There should be fewer assignments, and they should be more directly correlated with the content we are learning in the lectures. If we have not been presented with the knowledge required to complete the assignment in class, then it is an inappropriate assignment. Assignments should test the knowledge we are being presented in class, not require us to go out and search for knowledge we have not been provided with, especially considering this is a very technical class where even when we have been presented with the knowledge, learning how to apply it is challenging.",
    "Client contact was delayed - through no fault of the professors. This will rectify itself next year since they've now made the contacts with all the clients.",

I do not feel confident that I could applythis skill in a future work context. I would need to take another course before I would feel confident that I could use LCA as a tool.This class would have been far more useful if the lecture time was used to walk us through how to do an LCA using different case studies each time. This was never done, at least not in a detailed and comprehensive way. The assignments would have been much more helpful if they focused on similar case studies of how to do different types of LCAs, instead of focusing on conceptual aspects of LCAs and asking us to figure out how to use different tools within SimaPro that we had not been exposed to in the lectures. There should have been a much better introduction to SimaPro as a software tool at the beginning of the year, and we should have had additional opportunities to work through assignments in SimaPro together, in class, in a workshop style format. Success in this class is highly contingent upon being able to use SimaPro proficiently, and this is a very unintuitive software that many of us struggled to use.It would be good to get exposure to other tools for LCA in addition to SimaPro.

Unfortunately, however, the projects weren't lined up far enough in advance. They should have been in place prior to the start of the course. In addition, the instructors should have only selected projects where the clients would be active participants, would supply the data that students needed on time, and where the parameters of the project met the needs of the class. Some of the projects, such as the Hartford greenhouse gas emissions inventory, had nothing to do with LCA and did not provide the students with an opportunity to practice the skills we were learning in class. Other projects, such as the Hershey's project and again the Hartford project, did not provide the students with adequate information to complete their projects in time. Other projects, such as the Better Place project, tried to skew the results of the analysis to suit their needs by limiting the scope of the project in a way that falsified the results generated. The Chipotle project and the Pfizer project seemed to be much more in line with what a good LCA project should be, and the clients seemed like they were good to work with. It is terrific that the instructors took the initiative to go out and seek projects from the private sector and from external clients, as this provides significant opportunity for practical learning. However, better care should be taken that each client and project selected meets the needs of the course and can provide an adequate learning opportunity for the students.",
