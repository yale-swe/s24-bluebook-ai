    "I would recommend this if you're taking 4 classes in addition to this course. Chinese 160 has such an easy workload.",
    "You listen to the professor talk a lot.",
    "It was alright. It definitely was not what I expected. There were two things that I wanted to get out of this course and I didn't feel that I got them.1) Increases in language ability: this course was good for keeping up my listening ability but I didn't improve in other areas. We were forced to learn tons of vocabulary through the short stories but I haven't retained any of them because we never did any language activities that made us use them.2) Techniques for critical analysis of Chinese literature: we did not do very much of this at all. We only looked at \"tone\" which is very hard to identify if you're still a learner of the language.The papers were also unsatisfactory. They did not ask us to do critical analysis of the works we read. They were basically fluff pieces and good for making you practice writing in Chinese but did nothing for development of analytical abilities.After the midterm, you start reading works in traditional characters! Non-native speakers probably haven't mastered simplified so making the switch made doing the readings take hours.",
    "I would recommend if your Chinese is already at a very high level.",
    "This class is a course in literary criticism more than anything, so don't expect to learn much Chinese. I absorbed some characters and grammar patterns and was exposed to some Chinese literary greats, but overall came out of the class not feeling like I had progressed very much. I took this during a semester when I was taking 6 credits, and it was definitely doable. The class assignments are easy - study for a tingxie twice per lesson, write a few 1000-character essays - but reading the stories does take a while."
