    "I learned so much about Ancient India a topic that I would not have been able to learn about otherwise. It was a totally different course than any other history offerings, so I really appreciated the opportunity to take it. It's one of the best Pre-Industrial credits that someone can take if they are looking for a credit for the history major.",
    "I learned a lot about the history of ancient India. I wrote my first humanities paper, so I developed research and historical analysis skills. I also learned a lot about my topic for my final paper.",
    "This course helped me develop a comprehensive understanding of ancient Indian culture.",
    "thinking about indian history in parts of a longer unfinished story",
    "Each student will come away with a clear understanding of many of the foundational pillars of Indian society. While at times confusing and intricate, the history is certainly interesting and engaging.",
    "Using older texts in historical writing",
    "I learned about various characteristics of ancient Indian society, religion, and politics.",
    "I learned a lot about Ancient Indian History! The course was well taught and engaging, and really filled the gaps in my spotty Indian history knowledge.",
    "I gained a deep knowledge of many aspects of life in Ancient India, from everyday life to religious establishments to political development and statecraft.",
    "Prior to taking the course, I barely knew anything about the history of ancient india. I am very pleased that I took the course, as it opened my eyes to civilizations that greatly progressed the course of humanity.",
    "I learned how to examine ancient history in an academic context, and developed research and writing skills in order to complete the final paper.",
    "I learned so much! I really got a good understanding of what ancient India was.",
    "I learned about ancient Indian history, culture, and religion. I got some experience in reading the ancient texts and interpreting their mythologies in a modern context.",
    "After completing this course, I gained an exhaustive understanding of life, beliefs, thinking, writing, and the geography of Ancient India."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that the main weakness is that there is no incentive to go to class after the midterm. I understand that this was because the class was so large this year. But there should perhaps be a final in upcoming years.",
    "I think that overall this was a great course, however, having a different form of lecture or even turning this course into a seminar might be beneficial in encouraging the students to really engage with the material.",
    "Prof. Brick is incredible, and the material is very interesting. However, most of the other students in the class were not taking the class seriously, so if you are really interested in the material like I am, it's difficult. The class is a medium-sized lecture, so there is very little student engagement. Furthermore, there are only two assignments the entire semester - a midterm and a final paper. For one, it is scary when your grade is based upon two assignments. For another, students don't really have an understanding of the material.",
    "The descriptive nature of this course made it not very interesting. It didn't really present any kind of argument about change over time or anything about Indian history in general. The structure of this course (powerpoints being all online) also made me feel like there wasn't much of a point of me going to class",
    "Professor Brick was really passionate about the class and that helped fuel my enthusiasm and curiosity. Moreover, the open-ended final paper allowed me to pick whichever facet of Indian history intrigued me the most and learn about it in great detail!",
    "more engagement",
    "This course covered a wide range of topics and time periods, giving students a holistic understanding of Indian culture, religion, and politics. Perhaps this course could have tied the progressions of religion and culture throughout time more closely together. As in, the development from Vedic religion to Hinduism and Buddhism could have been traced a bit more clearly. However, I think Professor Brick did a phenomenal job covering all the subject matters in great detail.",
    "There's no section so there's not much incentive to do the readings, but the readings themselves were enjoyable",
    "The material is interesting, but I think the lectures could have been more engaging.",
    "The material was fascinating and useful as another area for my History major, and although a midterm and final paper were nice as the only grades, it did lower overall attentiveness, especially in the second half of the semester.",
    "Students have little incentive to go to class after the midterm without a final",
    "I liked the format of classes, with Professor Brick teaching off of well-detailed lecture slides.",
    "The course was great. Interesting material. Lots of material covered. Not sure if there are any weaknesses. Could get a bit dry at times but through no fault of Prof. Brick's. The final paper is worth a large portion of our grade, and we don't really write much before that, so it was hard to know what to do, but Prof. Brick answered any questions we had really well.",
    "Professor Brick is super into the material and really helpful. He always offered to help outside class and was engaged.",
    "I think this class is a good survey of ancient Indian history, and a plus was that it incorporates some original texts. However, as a lecture, I think it did not engage students very much. Since there was only a midterm and a final paper, and no section, there wasn't much incentive to do weekly readings or stay up to date on the material.",
    "The subject is very interesting, but it is not presented in an engaging manner. Instead of being taught with powerpoint slides filled with text, a more minimalistic visual approach with an enthusiastic lecture would work best to transmit the information.",
    "The professor gives a lot of information in each lecture, and I think most of it is really relevant. However, there is a lot of overlap in information between the lecture and the readings. Additionally, I think the course would really benefit from having more accountability for its students, whether that's attendance, pop quizzes, a final exam, or more tests based on lecture materials."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it! Professor Brick is a really great guy and so willing to share what he knows about ancient India.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course; it is a great survey of Ancient Indian History; a fascinating and complex, yet little-studied period.",
    "Take it if you're interested in a broad overview of a large chunk of Ancient India, especially in religion.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Prof. Brick is great and it is incredible how much he knows about the subject. If you are interested in the history of ancient India, definitely take the class!",
    "Don't take this class unless you know you actually have an interest in ancient indian history. It's a pretty dry class that is highly descriptive with no real argument made. It's just a cut and dry \"this is what we think Ancient India was like\"",
    "I would definitely recommend this course as an easy yet intellectually stimulating humanities credit.",
    "yeah!",
    "I would recommend this course to a peer if they are interested in Indian history or just learning about a history that often goes under appreciated. I would caution that this course is about ancient Indian history so do not expect to learn about the country's history after 1500 CE.",
    "A great preindustrial credit. However, since there are only two grades all semester, this might be stressful for people who prefer to have more assignments and weekly section to round out the grade.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have a strong interest in ancient India.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Great 5th or 6th credit and very interesting. Professor Brick is also very helpful with guiding you for your final paper akd extremely resourceful.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in history. Professor Brick is a fantastic lecturer and an absolute joy to learn from.",
    "Yes, good course, really interesting material, Professor Brick knows so much.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Fairly light workload, and you will learn a lot about the (very interesting) history of India from around 2600 BCE - 1000 CE. Professor Brick is a very engaging lecturer, and if you attend lectures, you'll come out of this course with a deep understanding of many aspects of life during this time.",
    "Sure. Dave is awesome",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if the student does not already know about the importance of ancient indian history.",
    "Yes, very fascinating course with low workload. You learn really cool things about Ancient India. Prof. Brick is an interesting and passionate lecturer. Go to class! It's worth it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. It's an fun, interesting, and painless way to complete a pre-industrial credit. If you put in the work you'll learn a lot and the actual material is truly enjoyable. Plus, the professor is wonderfully engaging.",
    "Yes! Take it for a good overview and lectures that Professor Brick makes engaging.",
    "If you are looking for an easier history class, this is a good option. There's a low workload and the material isn't too complex. If you are looking to learn more about ancient Indian history, you may or may not get that out of this course. You can definitely put in the extra effort and get the most out of the class, but as it is currently structured, it's tempting to not engage as much as possible.",
    "I would only recommend this course if you are genuinely interested in the subject matter. Otherwise, stauing motivated throughout the course will be difficult."
