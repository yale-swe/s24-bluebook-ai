    "It's a good class. The work is definitely stepped up from 132, and the pace is increased, but you get used to it.What I don't like is that because the pace is faster, you forget things from earlier in the semester more easily, which is troublesome.",
    "YES. It was so much fun. You meet great people, and Liu Laoshi is sooo nice. It's not a ton of work, definitely manageable. You're at an advantage if you speak Chinese at home, but if you don't you can still keep up with the class.",
    "Yes I definitely would!",
    "Highly recommend it if Liu Laoshi (Fan Liu) is teaching it.",
    "If you are heritage learner, you MUST take this class. I started off barely knowing any Chinese, and now I can speak pretty fluently with people like my grandmother. Professor Liu absolutely the best professor I've had at Yale. The material she goes over is extremely relevant and she makes learning the material incredibly entertaining. She truly cares about her students' education. She spent time every week to give me additional practice, which helped me understand more difficult material, but allowed me to further develop my verbal skills. She's extremely considerate, fair, and dedicated to her students. When I was young I dreaded learning Chinese, but taking her class made me extremely excited about spending time and energy to further improve my Chinese. There's not much she can improve on...she's already so helpful and great!"
