   "comments": [
    "Take it. It's a great survey of modernist literature. Challenging, but not overwhelming.",
    "Technomodernism is a phenomenal introduction to a more rigorous investigation of literature for a freshman, especially as compared to other early English department courses that primarily emphasize writing skills. Part English class, part Art History, part cultural studies, it's a great way to sample some higher-level coursework while still in a freshman-friendly setting. Professor Neuman is so enthusiastic and the materials he brings in are pretty incredible. The readings are extensive but definitely worth it, and there's a lot of opportunity to direct your studies according to your interests.",
    "Are you a fast reader who feels up to the challenge of analyzing byzantine assignments? Great, you'll love this class. Jokes aside, it's great if you know you want to be an English major you'll get to look at Yale's collections, read Modernist works from an interesting new perspective, and really learn how to research in an archive. That said, the course can be very frustrating in its teaching and its structure. Professor Neuman seemed to think he was running a tech startup and not teaching a freshman level course. He used a lot of buzzwords but didn't always explain what he meant or wanted in a way that made meeting his expectations difficult at times. Some of what he brought in was interesting, but sometimes he assumed a false expertise on subjects like architecture that could be a little grating. He is clearly passionate about the subject, but that passion may shine through better in his book than in his teaching. In such a small class, certain students could sometimes divert discussion in an unwelcome direction, and I would have appreciated a more constructive environment.",
    "Professor Neuman loves this material, which is a great reason to come into this class. He has a lot of energy and will challenge students to bring their own to the texts. I found this course highly rewarding and recommend Prof. Neuman!"
