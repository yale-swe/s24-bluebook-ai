    "Italian is a really fabulous language to start learning. You will be amazed at how much you learn in such a short time.",
    "It's a great deal of work. Having class every day is hard, but that's what you're signing up for. Michael's daily quizzes are stressful but keep you accountable for learning the material. You have to keep up.",
    "Really effective daily quizzes. Lots of focus on holding conversations with one another. Absolutely a great first class of the day. Definitely take it with Farina. I highly recommend this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Italian to another student. It's a really fun language and if you take it with Farina, you'll be sure to have a lot of fun and learn a lot. His daily quizzes may seem like a drag but they are actually incredibly helpful. Definitely look into Italian if you're looking for a fun, challenging language to learn.",
    "Yes. If you put in work, you are probably going to do great, although more practices and revisions on your own may be needed.",
    "Take it. This will be your favorite class of the semester and you will emerge with such a higher level of Italian proficiency than your friends in other L1 sections. Michael is really the best!"
