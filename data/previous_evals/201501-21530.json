    "This course REALLY makes you think. Take it if you can. Feimster is AWESOME.",
    "Great overview of both movements.",
    "Take this class! Without a doubt one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. Discussions are fun and helpful. I'm just sad they only met once a week.",
    "In this class you will read several survey works about women in the Civil Rights Movement, the Women's Rights Movement, and a few personal memoirs. There are five reading reflections and two papers. The workload is very manageable, and the class discussion is generally lively, but relaxed!",
    "Yes. If you are interested in the topics listed in the course title, then you should take this course. Feimster is great, and the books are wonderful and easy to read.",
    "guy or girl, black or white, take it.",
    "This is a great overview of the civil rights and women's liberation movements. Definitely take it if you have a chance.",
    "Amazing! This seminar with professor Feimster is absolutely amazing. If you want a small discussion sections talking about issues of race and gender in relation to the civil rights movement and the women's liberation movement you should take this class. The reading are excellent, and not too much with between 100 and 200 pages a week of great books that you will want to read. Professor Feimster is knowledgeable, inspiring, spirited, funny, kind and every other good adjective you can think of. This is the real deal people; this is why you come to Yale. Fight for this seminar!",
    "It was my favorite class that I took at Yale. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I liked Civil Rights and Women's Liberation a lot--these are incredibly relevant histories and the process of learning about them is fun, often uncovering assumptions you have about these movements. Definitely consider taking the class if you get the chance."
