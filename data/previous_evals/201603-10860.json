    "Learned how to speak and write a decent amount of French in a very short period.",

    "I learned how to better understand the french language by listening, speaking and writing. It was a great interactive course, that I enjoyed learning.",
    "I learned a wonderful foundation for the French language, but I also learned about my own study habits and how to prepare for a non-mathematics exam.",

   "comments": [
    "I found myself learning almost entirely through the workbook, and I wished there were more discussions and demonstrations of grammar material in class. The more explicit this is the better, as I found myself constantly getting lost in class since I barely knew any French. It felt like correct grammar was presented and we were supposed to pick up on the underlying rules implicitly. This was frustrating as I was bad at this, and it seemed counterproductive to actually learning the material. Finding out rules later that made previous material make a lot more sense made me wish these rules were presented more explicitly to help understand the material better.",
    "The course is truly and immersive experience so much so that sometimes I have found myself thinking in French! The compositions every week really helped me play with whatever I had learned and served as a way to constantly improve my writing, grammar and sentence construction in French.",
    "More interactive would be better. I felt the actual teaching of the course was more or less based on memorization. During classes, the students hardly talked at all.",
    "The course could be improved by focusing on the culture of France and francophone countries.",
    "Strengths: You learn a lot because of the intense workload and immersion mentality. Weaknesses: Sometimes I wasn't sure how to best prepare for the quizzes.",
    "The course is highly outdated, and seems to be taught in a way consistent with 17th century boy's schools rather than Yale College. There is a NYTimes article from 1990 calling it outdated. It's time to think about updating this with modern technology and technique."

    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it is truly an immersive experience and it is amazing to see our progress in the language in just a semester.",

    "Yes, this course is tough but its worth it if you want to be fluent in french.",
    "Definitely. I am currently reading the libretto from the Opera Thas in French, after only one semester of French class.",
    "It's a requirement, but I would recommend they take a different language."
