   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "There's not that much discussion that actually happens in class - it's more of a lecture. I personally preferred this bc i don't really like conversing with my peers but if you're looking for a really seminary seminar this may not be for you. There's also no feedback on any of your reading responses or participation or anything but I found that to be chill because then it really just feels like you're taking it to learn and not for a grade (even though you obv get a grade at the end lol)",
    "Strengths: - the lecture integrates different themes together well throughout the term -the final project forced us to integrate the themes throughout the course. - enjoyed the comments from blogs and multimedia information that became part of the course's slideshow and primary material Weaknesses: - it seemed that there wasn't as much time for class discussion of the material as students would have liked. Maybe the coverage of the material could be reworked to allow more time for discussion of current events as they relate to themes in the texts.",
    "The readings were incredibly well selected, relevant, and (mostly) exciting. Discussions were also engaging. Understanding more of the racial, class based, and gender facets of the climate discourse would have been enriching. Receiving feedback on reading critiques would also have been helpful."

   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend it if you're into really theoretical discussions\/explanations and don't mind writing a 25-30 page paper! Taking this class really makes you approach finding solutions to environmental problems in a more thoughtful way i think",
    "I think that this course would be a great introduction to the study of Anthropology and a good addition to anyone interested in environmental politics or society. It teaches the critical examination of local and national governments and is reasonable for non-Anthropology majors.",
    "Highly recommend for anyone working on climate change or who identifies as part of the climate movement."
