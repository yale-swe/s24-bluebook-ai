   "comments": [
    "Fast-paced class that provides a broad introduction to music. It moved quickly for me and I had significant musical background. I would say that it's still a great course - the composition assignment really allowed me to explore my creative musical side.",
    "Good intro to music theory, even if you have little or no experience with music. Starts with notes and rhythms, goes to triads and seventh chords. I would recommend if you want a basic understanding of the construction of music, regardless of whether or not it is with the intent of performing or composing (I took it for the sake of expanding my perspectives\/learning about something completely out of my comfort zone).",
    "Chill 5th class",
    "Pretty basic introduction to music fundamentals. John Klaess is an awesome guy, and he wants everyone to do well. If you have a free slot in your schedule, take this class.",
    "MUSI 110 is a good class for students who are interested in learning the basics of reading notes, understanding chords and even composing basic tunes. You DO NOT need musical background to succeed - I came in with no experience other than a little bit of singing in high school (no note reading ability), and I got along just fine. You should expect to do a few hours of work a week, but there is no need to study intensely to keep up.",
    "honestly self study would be a lot faster if you wanted to learn intro music",
    "A good intro course that gives you a background in basic music reading and performance techniques.",
    "not a great course if you can read music already, but you'll need it to progress any further in music theory",
    "If you have an interest in understanding the building blocks of music or are innately musical, but missing some key fundamentals, this course will open the doors to understanding how music works and how to successfully create more melodically and harmonically advanced compositions.",
    "It's a great course to take if you want to know more about the foundations of music. Depending on section, the instructor may have a slightly different area of focus depending on their interest, but the general syllabus is a great introduction.",
    "Yes absolutely.",
    "This is a great course. It is not difficult, and if you have a musical background you will find this very easy and a good way to improve on your skills. The homework is very light, and the grading is also very lenient. I would recommend this, 10\/10.",
    "Music 110 is a great class to take if you want an absolute introduction to Music theory. I've always been interested in music (I played the piano for 11 years and am in an a cappella group) but my music theory knowledge was a bit botched and had a lot of holes in it. This class was pretty good at filling in those holes. However, if you're taking this class with some background in music, it's not the most helpful at making you a music theory aficionado because it's very possible to get by on working knowledge of your instrument to figure out the material, without actually ever learning the material itself. In that respect, I might suggest that you check out a higher level class and maybe just brush up on the basics \/ learn the basics on your own over a break. I took Music 110 as a fifth class, which worked out pretty well. The workload is pretty fair. There is quite a bit of homework that takes longer than expected on some nights, though."
