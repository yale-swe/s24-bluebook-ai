    "If you have any interest in Latin American politics or the politics on oil this is one of the best classes for you",
    "I enjoyed but didn't love the class - great teacher, but a bit heavy on student participation, and people often don't know what they're talking about. I think it'll be a lot better the second time around, and would recommend it.This is a Venezuela class. Oil is much less relevant than the syllabus led me to believe.",
    "YESSS!!!!!!!! Take this class. It was a fantastic experience. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in Latin America, oil, politics, economics, really anything. Chesa Boudin is an amazing professor, and will get you really interested in these topics. Highly recommended.",
    "So awesome. Chesa is great. The material is beyond interesting and very relevant.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Definitely take the course! It's a lot of reading, but the majority of it is very interesting, and you'll learn more about Venezuelan politics and the oil industry in Venezuela than you could ever imagine.",
    "I would recommend it. A lot of reading, great discussion on an interesting and largely misrepresented subject and fantastic guest speakers.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in Latin American politics and in Petro-Politics. This class was excellent in helping me understand Venezuela's role within the region as well as its influence in the world.",
    "This is a great course. Latin American politics are exciting, dynamic and important to understand for anyone from the U.S. This is a rare opportunity to get a balanced perspective on a divisive and controversial subject from someone who's worked in Venezuela. There are also guest speakers with a wide array of viewpoints, an equally rare opportunity. Keeping up with all the reading is a challenge, but the actual written work is really just the final paper (and a small reading response). It's also nice that it's taught by someone who is a relatively recent Yale college graduate; he isn't so divorced from the students' perspective and is realistic about how much work he can expect from us.",
    "CSTC210 is a class that examines the social, political, and economic issues that surround Chavez's administration in Venezuela. I highly recommend the class if you have an interest in latin america or poly sci. Venezuela makes a very interesting case study for examining Latin American politics, and there is the added complication of its oil based economy. Chesa has a very intimate knowledge of the material, and made the seminar highly interesting, as well as fun to attend.",
    "The course addresses Venezuelan politics via the prism of the trappings of an oil-dependent economy and the degree to which a petrostate's economy remains constrained despite the best of policy intentions.I would recommend this course for the econ-lite aspect. I firmly believe that Hugo Chavez is someone who makes things worse than they need be, however the course is helpful in understanding the mechanistics of that.",
    "It's a good class to take if you're interested in the subject. You won't exactly get a great recap or summary of recent developments under Ch\u00e1vez from the readings--rather, readings are focused on more specific aspects of policy or the oil industry. Because of that, if you have no previous knowledge of the situation in Venezuela, this is not a class to guide you through the basics.There is a lot of reading. You will need to be able to skim. And you'll need to have relevant things to say in class, because it's almost entirely discussion-based, and participation matters."
