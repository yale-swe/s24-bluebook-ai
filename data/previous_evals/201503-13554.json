    "The course was very aloof and run by students, therefore not viewed, in general, as seriously as other courses. Having taken the Independent Study which complements this course was an important aspect of making it useful. I think this course alone did not substantially benefit students, being a pilot and not having regular assignments or readings or exams."

    "Honestly, what needs most improvement is getting students to show up to class every day, on time. Oftentimes, I felt embarrassed on behalf of my peers because a guest speaker would be there, ready to talk to the class, and there would only be 5 students in the room, many more of whom would trickle in late. I felt that it reflected poorly on the university. Obviously, though, this is the students' responsibility and has nothing to do with the professor or the teaching of the course.",
    "Finding a logical and integrated way to teach all concepts",
    "The class should be better organized for the coming year.",
    "If the course provided office hours it would be helpful for student who take 3 credits on formulating their SDGs paper\/implementation plan. More lesson learnt how was different goal of MDGs achieved would be beneficial to allow student understand the limitation\/obstacles on implementing the global agenda.",
    "I think there were too many guest speakers at one given time. A short class with more than one speaker prevented deep discussions from occurring. It would have been nice to have had more time with them. I think FES could have benefited from our project presentations. It would have been nice to have presented in burke to the whole school, or who ever came for pizza! A lot of the students, along with myself put a lot of work into our projects and presentations, a larger audience seemed more fitting. It would have been nice to review to worked with an existing action plan throughout the semester: critiquing it, reading it, etc.",
    "Overall course structure and outline",
    "There needs to be a more solid basis established, and there needs to be more leadership of a professor\/s as opposed to the students."

    "The course is very \"do-it-yourself\" and independent rather than monitored. If this suits you, then it's a good course. If you are looking for something more structured and clearly defined then do not take this course. Either way, I would advise taking this course together with an Independent Study with the Professor."
