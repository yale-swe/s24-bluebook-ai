    "Why certain materials are chosen for various tasks, the differences between types of materials, the applications and fabrication techniques for materials, chemical properties and structures of materials, and more.",
    "Not much. The homework sets were informative but the exams were always on the most random irreverent topics. For example \"what is the magnification of this specific microscope\", because that's important for understanding material science concepts?!",
    "How to apply material science concepts into the real world.",
    "I'm not sure I learned anything that couldn't be regurgitated from a textbook - the problems are all relatively simple and straightforward. Feels like a waste of a class credit.",
    "I learned a lot about material science information including crystalline structures, failure and deformation of different materials and other information on metals, polymers, ceramics and composites.",
    "This class provided me with a foundational knowledge of materials that is useful regardless of engineering discipline.",
    "remembering random facts about materials",
    "I felt my understanding of the properties of materials grew a lot during this semester, I found the material accessible and now feel comfortable with the structures and behaviors of various types of materials",
    "Honestly had no idea Materials Science could be so complicated, gave me a good, basic look at the field.",
    "I learned how materials differ from one another and how their properties and characteristics are determined at the atomic level.",
    "Knowledge of how engineering materials are incorporated into daily life. Specific knowledge of important materials and their molecular structures",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. I came in knowing nothing about materials science and now I'm obsessed with it! Udo is such a fun teacher too.",
    "I actually learned a lot in this course. Since I didn't have much knowledge on the subject of material science before, most of what we learned was new.",
    "Knowledge and insight about various materials, material types, and material properties.",
    "I developed skills on how to think about materials science concepts critically, starting with the fundamentals and then deducing to more complex associations.",
    "Introduction to materials and how differences at the microscopic level lead to different macroscopic properties",
    "This is a very useful class for mechanical engineers. I learned a lot of practical knowlede about different materials."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is very interesting in that you will learn a lot of explanations for why things are the way that they are. You will learn to reason your way through different relationships and perform qualitative (as well as quantitative) analysis.",
    "The lectures were extremely dry and impossible to sit through. Hopefully in the future the professor will focus on actual material science",
    "Professor Schwarz clearly cares a lot about making a really REALLY boring subject interesting - he brings in little objects for us to see and touch. Ultimately, though, his reading directly off the slides and the fact that material science at an intro level is basically high school chem + high school physics makes this class not worth taking. I only took this class because it was required for my major, but I didn't learn anything and I didn't enjoy it.",
    "The weaknesses in this class were lack of communication between professor and TAs, and a focus on the overall surface concepts rather than getting deep into the theories and mathematics of the course material. The strengths included entertaining lectures and reasonable workloads and assessments.",
    "The class concepts, examples, and demonstrations were probably the strongest part of the class and did a great job of keeping the students engaged. Professor Schwarz's sense of humor was also particularly engaging. I think this class would benefit from having assigned readings beforehand, so the students don't feel like they're drowning in information during class.",
    "Pros: This course was really interesting in my opinion, and the psets, though often super time consuming, were pretty easy and graded easily. Plus Udo is hilarious and I loved listening to his lectures Cons: There are these weird open ended responses that are graded super arbitrarily, so you can fully answer the question and they'll just be like \"did you consider glue\" and you get a 20% on it. Also the exams were hella hard and also pretty arbitrarily graded. Overall the exams sucked so much it outweighed the psets",
    "Professor Schwarz tried hard to make the class easy and engaging, yet the effect was quite the opposite, as materials were covered way too quickly, neglecting key calculations and were vague with scientific terminologies.",
    "I didn't really like the fact that the problem sets were very calculation based, while the tests were entirely conceptual. I also would have liked to have a little bit better understanding of what was expected of the open ended questions, it seemed like they just wanted us to write a lot and I never really knew how much detail was enough.",
    "The problem set\/open-ended question format for the homework is a refreshing change of pace in engineering classes, but it was often unclear how they were graded and what exactly would be on the exams (often it was material we had never discussed in class)",
    "I thought this course was well organized in that the lectures provided lots of information and were available online to be viewed outside of class. However, the problem sets were at times confusing because they didn't specify which chapters the problems were coming from and, often times, the textbook did not even contain the information required to answer the questions. As a result, I had to do a lot of outside research to answer the questions.",
    "Another instructor and no death by PowerPoint.",
    "The material and Udo were super interesting. However, the testing could have been fairer. Most of the questions were straight forward but some seemed to be about really random or unimportant things we barely touched on.",
    "This class was pretty fun. Prof. Schwarz brought in a lot of models and samples of different materials, which made the class more engaging. I have a few complaints, however. I think the grading was quite strange and harsh. On the open-ended question homeworks, I got a few very low grades for very vague reasons. I found that I couldn't learn from the feedback given, and I actually thought that I included information that the grader said I didn't. Another thing I thought was quite strange was our course was extremely rushed near the end of the semester. We even had two make-up lectures at the beginning of the semester, but I guess we fell behind still. I didn't think I learned very well at the end of the course.",
    "Great class with incredibly interesting and engaging lectures with the only real weakness being inconsistent grading from the TA's.",
    "The weekly problem session was a strength of this course--it helped review some of the concepts from class. In order to improve the course, spending more lecture times on the slide set (and reducing the time spent on demos) would be helpful. Perhaps the demos, which were a lot of fun and very interesting, could be an exercise towards the end of class.",
    "The open ended questions were the most annoying part of this class. They were \"open-ended\", but graded extremely harshly; if your explanation missed the tiniest bit of what they wanted, you could easily lose around half the pointsthere really was a \"right\" answer, and often the way the question was posed, it was difficult to know what that answer should be. Also, the test were highly conceptual, which was good and bad; it really tested how deeply you knew the material, but at the same time the questions would take something you'd learned in class and ask you to apply it to a different situation you'd never been exposed to. While good in principle, this meant you often had to guess blindly. Finally, I have no idea how I did in this class. Not really clear on the curve",
    "The course material was very interesting at the end of the semester, but some areas at the beginning were pretty dry."

   "comments": [
    "Yes I would recommend this course because it teaches you not just to crunch numbers but to truly understand how things work and why they work that way. I believe that I will remember more that I learned in this course than any other that I have taken so far, despite the challenges of the class (particularly the midterms).",
    "If you have to take it, take it. Otherwise stay away, I was excited and hopeful for the course but extremely disappointed with what I was able to gain from the class.",
    "Unless you MUST take this class, don't. It was nice that we had only like 7 psets the entire semester (that were all directly ripped from the textbook) and that we got to bring a note sheet into exams, but it killed any spirit of actual learning. If rote memorization is your game, go for it - otherwise, stay far, far away.",
    "I would recommend this class to another students. Most mechanical engineering classes can be decently painful but this course was extremely manageable.",
    "If you are looking at this class, you likely have to take it for the major. That said, you will enjoy it. It's a light class without much work and covers very useful material for future classes and careers. This was the easiest of my five classes this past semester and I felt that I learned a lot without working too hard.",
    "Unless you have to take this course when Udo teaches it, try to take it with someone else I guess, or you would risk disliking an actually interesting subject.",
    "The lectures were not very necessary, and all of the problem sets were online. If you want to take this class, you can just read the textbook before the tests and you'll be fine, but it's definitely not interesting at all so keep that in mind when considering this class.",
    "Yes, take it if you are MechE or if it otherwise counts for your engineering major. One of the better engineering courses at Yale",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have to take if for your major. While it is interesting, it is still a lot of material to cover and lots of memorization which may not be worth it if you don't actually need to know this stuff for your major or future career.",
    "Not a great course. It's easy, but very dry and not very well taught.",
    "This course has pretty interesting content. That said, anytime I walk into a class and the professor point to equations on the PowerPoint slide and changes the slide right after, I know it isn't going to be great. Udo is a terrible instructor and I plan to avoid any classes taught by him in the future. I was supposed to take dynamics with him next semester but I'm going to push it off to the next year to hopefully avoid him. He is enthusiastic and nice but has zero concept of how to structure a class. It's a pset a week, all the questions are from pulled from online and take about 3-5 hours. Two midterms and the final exam. He allows equation sheets but honestly they just ruin the test. The test material is unnecessarily obscure and so you are using 5 pt font and gambling on getting the right information onto your equation sheet. Moreover, some of the information was more from general chemistry and other classes than the course textbook. People with good background in those did better by a wide margin. I attend classes consistently but I deliberately stopped going to this one because it was just a waste of an hour.",
    "Yes!",
    "This course is very helpful for all types of engineers because it gives a good overview of many different properties of materials. I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to better understand material properties and how to affect them.",
    "Yes I loved this class! It was so interesting and fun. It was one of a very few classes where I honestly learned a ton and will remember for a long time.",
    "I liked the course, but there were many things that could have been improved, such as better feedback on homework and pacing for the lectures. I think the course is worth taking if the student is interested in the subject and willing to put time into studying and working.",
    "I think that Udo is a great lecturer and teacher and he very clearer has much experience in the field of material science so if you are interested in things and specifically the material that makes up these things then this class is great!",
    "This class provides a good introduction to materials science. A good portion of the learning is independent, but the textbook is straightforward and corresponds well with the lectures.",
    "I'd take it! Start the psets and open ended questions early, go to homework sessions, and make sure you deeply understand all the concepts for the tests.",
    "I would not recommend this class to someone who doesnt need to take it for their major."
