   "comments": [
    "The course had good selection of texts and readings. I enjoyed learning about the literature we covered in class, about 70% of which I was unfamiliar with. One thing, however, was that no final exam was listed in the bluebook and OCS, and the instructor created one. Another thing is that an \"optional\" section was created, along with a TA position, though students who took the class with the knowledge that there would be no section could not plan for the extra time needed to go, so very few people went regularly. I would recommend the course for anyone that has not read these texts before, as it is mostly a survey of Latin American literature over 100 years or so, and does not go into too much detail of the texts themselves. The workload is very manageable as long as you read carefully and pay attention in class.",
    "This is a great survey of modern Latin American literature. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to take a Spanish class.",
    "I'm so glad I took this course. The course's obvious strength lies in the fact it's a sweeping introduction to Latin American literature since mostof Latin America won independence in the first half of the nineteenth century, taught by one of the world's leading scholars on the subject. I feel like I can now converse on the subject of Latin American literature to an extent that exceeds my ability to converse on literature of the United States in spite of a pretty solid base in U.S. lit (side note: the course is great for Comp Lit). I also really appreciated the fact readings were largely in chronological order. The weakness of the class depends on what you're looking to get out of the course. If you're looking to largely absorb information and textual analysis strategies from a world expert, and to have your practicing of these techniques evaluated by that same expert in midterm papers, this is your class. If you're looking to sound off on each week's reading in a seminar-format setting, this is not really your class.",
    "a fairly good overview with an authority on the subject teaching it. he is funny yet focuses on biography and is not really receptive to other interpetations",
    "Overall, the class does a good job of surveying the most important Latin American authors of the last 200 years or so. If you are a humanities major, a native Spanish speaker, or both, then I think that you will really enjoy this class. If you are neither, like myself, than this class will feel like a struggle. Some of the readings will be really long and tedious. If you are trying to broaden your interests, then this might be a good class to take CR\/D\/F.",
    "I recommend it (because the readings were great!) but just know that you will be listening to lecture more than discussing and hearing a lot about the authors personal lives.",
    "This class cannot be faulted for giving you an overview of Latin American Literature from around 1800 to the present - it covers a little bit of literally everything you could imagine (and it's fantastic), which is great for comprehensiveness, but could be frustrating if you're looking for more in-depth study of these authors. Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez Echevarr\u00c3\u00ada is wonderful, a great storyteller, and basically the world authority on the subject, and is a reason to take this class alone. It's also not too much work, which is a benefit!",
    "Great survey; really learned a lot of material. Professor Gonzalez-Echevarria is fun, funny, knowledgeable. I was very frustrated by his lack of commentary on my essays, however. In lecture, he focuses more on anecdotes about authors than about works themselves, which some might find frustrating, but which I was find with, after all, just because it's such a survey, and getting too close to the readings without reading more than fragments, might feel kind of inappropriate.",
    "Take only of genuinely interested in Latin American literature.",
    "Basically, you have a not so terrible amount of reading before every lecture and then you listen to Professor Echevarria talk about the author and sometimes the actual text. I'd recommend it in order to have an introduction to latin american literature, but I wouldn't expect any kind of enlightenment from this course. What you get out of it is what you put into the readings yourself.",
    "Comprehensive introduction to Latin American Literature. More reading heavy than LAST 266"
