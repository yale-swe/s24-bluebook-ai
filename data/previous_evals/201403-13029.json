   "comments": [
    "It's not so much about spies (as the title of the course probably suggests to most people) but if one is interested about secrecy and knowledge this course is highly recommended.",
    "This class is not what the name suggests it is. It focuses much more heavily on the subject of secrecy than on spies, and barely touches on science. The subject of secrecy is addressed mostly through the topics f books of secrets and alchemical secrets. Make sure those subjects interest you if you are considering this class. Also make sure you have an interest in reading primary texts; at least 4 classes meet in the Beinecke.",
    "This was a great class that I would really recommend to other students, even if only for the purpose of forcing yourself to explore the resources that we have at Yale like the Beinecke and the Medical Library. I never would've gone otherwise and would have missed on a massive opportunity only available to Yale students. Definitely a class to take.",
    "Yes! You definitely cannot skip the readings, but the experience looking at old manuscripts and alchemical books is truly invaluable. Great writing class and not overwhelming with papers!",
    "I wouldn't recommend it. It kind of rambles all over the place, spending about half the time on alchemy and half on the Cold War. Professor Bertucci is very smart and kind but was not very skilled at keeping the the discussion on course. It has the potential to be good, but the discussions were horrible and felt like pulling teeth.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. I highly recommend it or any other course that Prof. Bertucci teaches because she's an amazing instructor. The material is fascinating and the workload is manageable (honestly, this class didn't feel like work). One of the highlights of this course was frequent visits to Beinecke and the medical library to view alchemical manuscripts, books of secrets, and other documents. At the end of this course, you'll have a deep understanding of the transmission of knowledge and the history of science. The readings are illuminating and the course covers an incredible amount of material from natural magic to trade secrets to Cold War spying. If you have any interest in these aspects of history, you MUST take this course.",
