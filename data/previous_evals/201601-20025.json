    "Lisa, Susan",
    "For the second set of Spiritual Exercises I had Susan Fowler as our group SD. Susan was a fantastic leader, sensitive and gracious to us. Everyone felt at ease opening up and discussing the learnings and the challenges of the prayer exercises. It was very meaningful to share with each other the discoveries and little \"awakenings\" that came to each of us during the work. Susan is a great listener and made everyone feel welcomed and appreciated.",
    "Gordon: I really enjoyed having Gordon as a facilitator of our group: always upbeat, energetic, and engaged. I appreciated the stories he shared of connection between either his own life experience or the clergy with whom he's done spiritual direction over the year (stories were told anonymously, of course). I think asking even more follow up questions of participants before responding would help them to \"unpack\" their experience a little more before making a connection to something in his own experience or in someone's experience who he's directed. Lisa: I also enjoyed working with Lisa. She is very relaxed and easy going, which seemed to help the group to open up. I think she should be more confident in her skills as a director. Sometimes she seemed maybe a little unsure or nervous, but she led our group effectively."

    "Strengths: - great listenener - gentle leader and deeply perceptive - knowledgeable about the course content - humble and experienced I can't think of a weakness that would have become apparent to us. While not a weakness per se there were sessions when a few classmates would choose not to share. I am not savvy enough about SD to know if perhaps they needed more \"prodding\". But overall, I suspect the technique for these sessions is to allow space for silence and reflection and Susan did that very well.",
    "I addressed these points above."
