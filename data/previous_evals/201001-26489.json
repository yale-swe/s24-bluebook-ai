   "comments": [
    "My friend, if you have the option to take a class with Rob and Sarah, you would be a fool to give it up.",
    "TAKE IT! It helps you to fully develop critical thinking strategies and gives you new tools to analyze life, not just on the Iraq War. Very thought provoking. Take this early in your college career because the knowledge you gain from the course is extremely applicable to other areas of study.",
    "If this class is being offered, you should do everything that you can to get into it. And then you should take it. Sarah and Robert are two of the most amazing people I've met at Yale, and the class itself was just spectacular.I have gushed about this class so hard to my friends that they have given me weird looks. It's that good.",
    "Absolutely. A wonderful class. Easy work load. Great professors who have first hand experience. A definite keeper.",
    "Take this class, too bad it won't be taught again.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. It didn't involve a huge amount of work, but I feel like I got more out of it than almost any other course I have taken.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to anyone studying at Yale. It will expand your horizons in thinking about how people behave and how our world works. It is also very relieving to start to get your arms around one of the major events of our age that can be mystifying and troubling.",
    "If this course (or any course with Robert + Sarah) is offered again, TAKE IT! This has been my favorite course at Yale so far. They may be young, but Robert and Sarah are experts on the topic, and they have the real world experience to back up their brilliance. (He served two tours in Iraq, she has been there as a journalist) The course was fascinating--we look at the interplay of media, politics, and the military in Iraq. Part of the course was pretty heavy on theory and deconstructing the media narratives, but much of the course was also learning about Iraq's political climate and rich culture, and learning about the military and political processes behind the war. The profs brought in guest speakers to talk with the class (mostly Q+A of course), ranging from a journalist who served in Iraq to a war photographer to a Fijian woman who worked as a beautician on a U.S. base there. Robert and Sarah are great at facilitating and encouraging discussion, and they're very approachable and friendly people. Best of all, the profs + the students often went to Miya's after class for sushi. This is the kind of course I came to Yale to take, so you'll be lucky if they come back and you get to take it too.",
    "Robert and Sarah are the best. This is a great class, and though they expect a lot out of you, the class is worth taking for many reasons. Perhaps first among them: Miya's after class each week. The real part of the class is awesome too.",
    "Definitely take this class! One of my favorite classes at Yale. If it's offered again don't miss out!",
    "Absolutely... learned a lot and very enjoyable too.",
    "Totally. Definitely take this.",
    "Of course I would recommend it, but as a college seminar it probably won't be offered again. The strengths were the great reading list, knowledgeable professors, and an engaging subject matter. Every class was engaging and exciting, and the projects and papers were both fun and enriching.Some weaknesses were that we occasionally raised a number of questions that we didn't then answer. While it is possible that some of these questions are just unanswerable, it would've been nice to hear some forwarding of thoughtful opinion from the professors.",
    "A workshop in narrative analysis, using the Iraq War as a case study. Theory is presented in the opening weeks, and then used to break down the story of Iraq.This class is unbelievable. Sarah and Robert are super cool and incredibly intelligent. They both have first-hand experience of Iraq (Robert is a veteran and Sarah was embedded for a while), and both understand how narratives work. The techniques we learned are going to serve us forever, and the discussions were a ton of fun. I cannot recommend this class enough."
