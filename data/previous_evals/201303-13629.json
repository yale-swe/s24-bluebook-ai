    "Difficult to assess from my standpoint much of the material was well known to me.",
    "The class was a great overview of the ways of synthesizing the literature. I also learned a lot more about bias and how to critically review studies.",
    "The course was very interesting and covered a broad range of material. I also enjoyed the structure of the course, with one day a week for lecture and one day for discussion.",
    "Important topics and knowledgeable instructor, but the primary assignment is a systematic review, which doesn't mesh well with the lectures. Seems very disjointed.",
    "Really good",
    "This was extremely helpful for learning how to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis. The skills learned will be useful for future practice.",
    "This is a great course and a very interesting and important methodological are.Doing the review is a lot of work, and during the course of the semester, it sometimes seemed like there was not enough time to both keep up with the weekly readings and article evaluation assignments and make progress on your final project.",
    "This is one of the best courses I've taken at YSPH. It is taught in a way that facilitates engagement with the literature in a way that isn't taught in other courses, which I appreciated. It also provides students with practical skills in systematic evaluations of the literature. My only comment on improvement would be to cap enrollment--the course was a bit too large and a smaller size may have facilitated discussion among students.",
    "THIS IS A GREAT COURSE. HIS SLIDES WERE VERY INFORMATIVE. I AM SAVING THOSE TO REFER BACK LATER. I LEARNED A LOT",
    "The readings and class assignments were very relevant. The discussion section was a helpful format to apply knowledge learnt during the course.",
    "Strengths: excellent power point slides and examples",
    "The course had a systematic approach to evaluate evidence. It trains you to think rather than just present the concepts. It was current, relevant and important.I felt there should have been some problems or examples to practice the concepts in meta-analysis.",
    "The Tuesday lectures were very useful as Dr. Bracken empowered us with the skills that enabled us to better understand the functions of RevMan and how to write an effective systematic review. While the Thursday sessions were meant to help us practice critical review of the literature, it was largely useless as the time could have better been spent working on our systematic reviews in RevMan and troubleshooting the quirks of that program with Dr. Bracken.",
    "not enough support throughout the semester"

    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Good lecturer. I think a more staged approach to the main project of the course, the review, would have been better.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0He was exceptionally knowledgable and thorough. It was a great experience to hear his critiques of different studies, very eye-opening!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is very knowledgeable and his lectures were interesting and well-planned. It would have be helpful to have an entire lecture or two that went over the basics of using the RevMan software.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Knowledgeable. Not the most approachable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Warm personality and intelligent",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Comprehensive and very pleasant instructor. Excellent slides and very amenable to providing as much feedback on assessments as needed.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0I really appreciate his personalized feedback throughout the semester. He's an excellent instructor in the classroom and also provides individualized feedback which was immensely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is great. He is clearly an expert in the subject.The teaching is interactive, which is great.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is an excellent instructor. It was a pleasure learning from him over the course of the semester.",

    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Very kind and knowledgeable.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0He is definitely knowledgeable in the content.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0I probably would not have anyone else teach me evidence based medicine other than Professor Bracken. I have lost my equipoise in that statement. I may end up thinking about the evidence based on which I make such a statement and to whom it may be relevant to. The instructor trains and encourages you to ask questions. He has an ocean of interesting experiences to share.",

   "comments": [
    "For those interested in learing how to do a systemativ review it is a worhtwile course. The priciples of evidence based medicine set forth in the course will be well known to those with clincal experience.",
    "Great course if you are interested in doing any type of clinical or epidemiological research in the future. The variety of students in the class also made for a very enjoyable experience due to the diversity of expertise.",
    "I would recommend this course.",
    "You will learn a lot of practical knowledge about assessing the validity of published evidence.",
    "The lectures are good for auditing if you want to learn how to be critical of studies. The systematic review is a lot of work with little guidance. I wouldn't recommend unless you really want to do a systematic review for the fun of it.",
    "Good lecture for learning EBM",
    "Very practical and useful course for learning the process of conducting systematic review.",
    "You learn to write a meta-analysis from start to finish.I would recommend it.",
    "IT IS A GOOD COURSE. SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE VERY IMPORTANT FROM A JOB PERSPECTIVE AS WELL, I THINK",
    "It is a very thorough and in-depth course. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "I would recommend this class. Very good class to learn about evidence-based health.",
    "I would recommend it. The class helps you understand publishing, making sense of the evidence, and how to critically review data.",
    "The course guides you to perform a meta-analysis using the \"Revman\" software. The softwareis convenient to use and it makes writing a systematic review easy. The format of a class and a discussion session every week helps integrate the concepts. I highly recommend taking this course.",
