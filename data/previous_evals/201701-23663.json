    "I feel like I'm leaps and bounds from where I was at the beginning of 110, I learned more than I expected about latin american literature, I almost feel comfortable speaking uninhibited",
    "It's a relatively straightforward introductory language class with good amounts of culture thrown in.",
    "Nothing much, it was hard",
    "I gained a stronger understanding and higher comfort level with the language, speaking and knowledge wise, and also a further knowledge about the culture of Spanish-speaking countries.",
    "I learned a lot more Spanish than I expected to!",
    "I was able to improve the fluidity of my ability to speak the Spanish Language while learning additional tenses and vocabulary like the subjunctive, past, present perfect, past perfect, and future.",
    "I learned to have conversations in Spanish, learn the Spanish language, and learn about different Spanish-speaking cultures.",
    "I learned lots of new vocabulary, verb tenses, and grammar points. My comprehension of written and spoken Spanish improved drastically, and I can now have basic conversations in the language.",
    "Grammar and vocabulary",
    "Really improved my Spanish speaking, reading, and listening skills. Learned a lot of new grammar and vocab in a relatively short space of time."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: full immersion (most of the time), interesting literature, professor was constantly engaged Weaknesses: sometimes frustrating homework (e.g. flash cultura), the style of calling on students in discussion sometimes favored certain areas of the room over others, tests that were much more difficult than other pieces of graded work, some pieces of literature that were over my head",
    "The course is very well organized, the syllabus is planned out well in advance, and the expectations are clear. Additionally there is lots of time to practice the language in class.",
    "Good class, I learned a lot. But the homework was excessive and near impossible to complete it all while taking other classes",
    "It is taught to a class that has varying experience in the language, therefor those exposed to the language for 4 years in high school are with those that just started. The in class engaging activities were good, but the exams and participation were difficult.",
    "strengths: nice culture content weaknesses: too hard grading system",
    "The course at times moves too fast.",
    "The course was great! I can't think of any suggestions off of the top of my head.",
    "This course wastes time on presentations and some hard readings at time that do not promote my language development. The exercises and homework are helpful though.",
    "I like that the class is very interactive and we are able to practice our speaking in the class. It would be nice if the class size was smaller, but overall I really enjoyed the structure of this course.",
    "This class was a pretty average language class. The instructor was very enthusiastic and we did a wide range of activities, which was good. I liked when we did readings, and I wish we had done more of them, as well as writing exercises. Overall, the grammar was presented in a very clear way, and the textbook was a good learning tool. This course's main weakness was its size. 18 students is way too many to get any real class participation. Most students rarely talked in class, and there wasn't much time for conversation. I expected smaller classes and more one-on-one instruction from Yale. The language class sizes were better at my public high school, which is saying something. In addition, the speaking practice we did was almost always with the same person, and my partner hardly ever said anything and often spoke in English, which was very frustrating and made it hard to learn. These shortcomings are not really the instructor's fault and have more to do with the administrative structure of the class.",
    "Not very much personalized time to practice speaking",
    "There is a lot of support for students, but it moves VERY QUICKLY!!!"

   "comments": [
    "Well, anyone that has taken 110 is likely to take 120 anyway but taking it with Juliana is absolutely the way to go. Fair grading, lots of involvement, full immersion, definitely the right choice.",
    "If you are interested in learning Spanish, and putting some time into the process, this is a great, well-structured class.",
    "Take this if you like Spanish or have taken it before. If you don't like the language, have no skill for it, and have had no exposure to it, consider taking a language you are already familiar with. I would say this for all language courses at Yale.",
    "Yes I would, as it was a valuable class to take to become more comfortable with the Spanish language.",
    "Absolutely! Especially if you enjoy learning foreign languages.",
    "This is a great course! In addition to learning grammar and the language, I really appreciate that we learned about different cultures.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. It's a pretty average language class in terms of the activities and readings you do and the material you cover. A lot of grammar and vocab is taught, very fast, but the upside is that you really learn a lot. I wished there had been more practice: it felt like we moved from one tense to another very quickly, without much time to let it sink in. But Juliana is a wonderful teacher. She's very enthusiastic and helpful, always takes questions, and explains things very clearly. She genuinely wants to help you learn. The class is fine, not great, not bad, but Juliana makes it a lot better than it could be.",
    "Would definitely recommend it if you want to improve your Spanish skills."
