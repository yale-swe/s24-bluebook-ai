    "For 1\/2 credit: Three 1.5 hour blocks per week working with the monkeys, plus weekly lab meeting. Manageable and fun to work with the monkeys at the lab. Learned a lot about how research is actually conducted--from start to finish.",
    "definitely, its an easy way to earn credit and fulfill requirements for the major",
    "Yep. Really liked the Topics in Child Development and Social Policy program. Learned some really interesting things and no stress at all.",
    "Great lecture series. Take it if you like the material.",
    "If you pick the right lab, this is a great way to get familiar with the topic. It gives you flexibility with what you want to do and accomplish (participating in lab meetings, helping run the study, etc.) without necessarily having to write a paper (although you can if you want to).",
    "If you are interested in going to psychology grad school or writing a senior thesis, definitely consider taking psych 495- there's no better way to get this kind of experience! But make sure you're interested in the work being done in your lab before signing up. Check out recent journal articles from the lab, visit a lab meeting, and meet with the professor. I would also highly recommend grabbling lunch with a current undergrad RA in the lab you want to join. Basically, shop around to make sure you're interested in the research being done in the lab and that your professor's style meshes with your own.",
    "MUST TAKE THIS. UNFORGETTABLE EXPERIENCE.",
    "Its a great learning experience, whether or not research is the field that you ultimately want to end up in!",
    "yes - you get tons of research experience.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this class if you're unsure of whether you're interested in psychology or not.",
    "Yes - do it. Great half credit - great experience. Not a big time commitment. Win -Win!",
    "Lab Meetings were productive, and I learned a lot about how science papers and science works. I probably learned the most from doing my own presentation and trying to put together ideas from different authors."
