    "This particular section is different from the rest. If you're interested in health\/food\/farming policy, this is a great class for you. It not only sharpens your academic writing skills, but also enables you to explore your particular interest in great detail. The papers are very open-ended and enjoyable to write.",
    "If you're passionate about politics, government policies, sociology, and anthropology, take the class. It'll help you immensely. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. The Farm Bill is extremely boring.",
    "An average English class, I'd say. Not an unbearable amount of work, but the material can be a bit dry at times",
    "Great class! As a poli sci major, I learned a lot about food policy. You will have bursts of work\/stress but overall it's not too bad. Great 114 section to get acclimated to college work.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this course to another student not only because of how much it will improve your writing but also because of how much I learned about food politics and what is behind what we eat everyday.",
    "If you are at all interested in farming, agriculture, food, food production, politics of agriculture, the environment, science and health issues (and need a writing credit) take this class! Seriously, learned so much and just feel like an informed citizen now. This class gets ya thinkin about solutions. Also, I have always considered myself a pretty poor writer and i easily got a B+ in this class."
