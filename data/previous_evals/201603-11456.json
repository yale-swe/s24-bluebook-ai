   "comments": [
    "A lot about how to design an experiment and test for certain things. This was by far the best lab class I have ever taken. I felt like every lab I was learning SOMETHING (even if it was only uncertainties which God Bless.)",
    "In PHYS 165L, I was able to apply physics concepts to practical experiments. It introduced the ideal of experimental uncertainties and how to correct for them.",
    "Pretty few, besides how to use LoggerPro LIKE A BOSS. Except for perhaps one or two experiments (like rotation and terminal velocity), the experiments did not help me understand anything from physics or better illustrate any concepts. It was more like going through the motions, taking banal data, and plotting it to prove an unsurprising relationship.",
    "I learned how to follow lab procedures, and to think about how to design my own procedures.",
    "not really much",
    "I learned many applications of physics in real life situations and learned how to analyze how accurate my experiments were.",
    "Most of the knowledge that I learned in this class were pretty evident via previous Physics background or from lecture. I would say the most important insights I developed were regarding rotation because some of the concepts are more difficult to grasp in theory. Otherwise, the majortiy of the material was just equation manipulation.",
    "I developed the great skill of copying what was written on a computer screen in front of me. And once in a while, I was forced to read something, or memorize one of three equations for the course. I gained little new knowledge or skill, aside from how to calculate errors. These were the three equations.",
    "This course paired really well with the corresponding lecture course (I was in 170) and I feel like it was a nice supplement to the more biological course material. It allowed me to understand more basic physics concepts, which I think filled in some of the gaps that we didn't cover in class.",
    "This class teaches several fundamental physics concepts, such as simple harmonic motion and conservation of angular momentum, by creating experiments that demonstrated the concepts. Its goal is not so much to make you a scientist--these experiments do not nearly approximate what goes on in an actual physics lab--but rather to teach general scientific practices, such as data collection and error propagation. That is the main purpose of the course, since it really does not teach much material-wise.",
    "I was a senior when I took this course. Therefore, I did not really gain any new skills, knowledge, or insights through it... It is an introductory physics lab...",
    "Adequate lab",
    "Independent thinking and experimental design were stressed during his course, which helped me think differently as opposed to my past experience in chemistry lab, which focuses on different skill sets.",
    "I learned that you have to fend for yourself often.",
    "As a pre-med, if I had the chance not to take this course, I would not-that said, it helped me learn how to set up experiments and understand some physics concepts better.",
    "The course highlighted principles in mechanical physics. You also learn how to apply uncertainties to physics lab measurements.",
    "I developed a hands-on understanding of the physics concepts reviewed in the corresponding lecture course. I learned how to use LoggerPro computer software to simulate events and record and analyze data.",
    "This class taught me to collect quantitative data and conduct proper error propagation, which are important in any research endeavor.",
    "A better understanding of physics lab work, and how software and computer programming is an integral part of that work.",
    "This lab taught me a lot about uncertainties, paying attention to detail, and how to document my procedure meticulously.",
    "Learned a bit about designing experiments and using some of the software for physics applications. Besides this, it's mostly just following instructions.",
    "The ability to conduct a physics experiment! In all seriousness, though, this course helped me to further develop my understanding of a number of physics concepts by applying them and analyzing the results. In the analysis process, too, I learned more about drawing conclusions from quantitative evidence, and to what extent certain conclusions can be reached based upon that evidence.",
    "Physics lab was wonderful. I learned a lot more about thinking like a physicist and about carrying out experiments on my own and with fellow lab partners.",
    "I learned how to apply general physics lab procedures to make observations of principles we learned in physics class. The general procedures were applied over and over again but it taught us how to think about problems.",
    "I learned how to take a Yale physics lab course. Some of the concepts were definitely instructive, and would have helped had I taken the lecture concurrently, but ultimately this lab teaches you how to do laboratory work in physics, and that's mostly it.",
    "how to apply physics in a real-world context. some of it was pretty cool",
    "The course was a very good supplement to Physics 180. It allowed you to see and understand the physical relations behind many of the theoretical concepts in Physics.",
    "I do not think I gained any skills or insights from this course. I did not learn any material that I had not already learned in previous classes. If real physics research is anything like this class, then I guess this class reinforced that I do not want to do physics research.",
    "Learning to take measurements, uncertainty, and how to use graphs to derive physical relationships.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of physics from a hands-on perspective. I learned how to use some basic tools and computer programs that could be applied to physics.",
    "I improved my lab technique, data collection, and scientific writing skills. I learned about error propagation and how to measure quantities and determine how accurate they are. The labs were a good complement to the PHYS 180 course and helped me solidify the concepts I learned in that course.",
    "I gained technical skills in learning to collect data e.g. LoggerPro, motion capture. Overall, the focuses of each lab were well-designed and guided students along the right track without giving all the answer up front.",
    "I had to take this course. Lab is always unpleasant, this one was one of the better ones I think. However, I did not learn anything new or anything that will ever help me in any way although I am a Mechanical Engineering major. I think physics labs could be improved.",
    "Practical applications of physics",
    "You learn how to run basic physics experiments and the class often goes well with the Phys 180 course.",
    "My technique and approach as a scientist definitely improved through this course. This course taught a lot about good experimental design, minimizing measurement error, and identifying sources of error. I've found myself thinking more critically about experimental design and more like a scientist in my other classes because of this class.",
    "I gained practice taking thorough lab notes, synthesizing experimental techniques and results.",
    "Error analysis. That's about it.",
    "I learned how to use MATLAB and many other tools.",
    "You learn how to relate physics to real life and are able to explain everyday phenomena. I enjoyed being able to understand why things happen through physics.",
    "I learned some basic physics techniques which paralleled the lecture material in Physics 180 much better than most labs do.",
    "You learn quickly how to adapt techniques to various physics applications.",
    "How to use LoggerPro. What uncertainties in the context of physical measurements mean and how to deal with them.",
    "I learned how to use laboratory equipment to perform basic physics experiments. I also got to practice a lot of error calculations.",
    "PHYS 165L emphasizes both physics and experimental design. Foundational physics concepts were explored in a laboratory setting as well as how to determine sources of error\/calculate the amount of error in experiments.",
    "I learned how to use LoggerPro.",
    "The course developed usnderstanding of general physics principles. It closely followed the syllabus.",
    "I learned about basic physics laboratory procedures.",
    "I learned how to use laboratory equipment and collect\/interpret graphical data. Tracing phenomena and fitting data to mathematical equations was also pretty cool...",
    "Decent introduction to the basics of mechanics in a laboratory setting. Introduced us to scientific writing, error analysis, and allowed us to observe physically what we were learning in the classroom.",
    "I learned a lot about how to calculate uncertainties and take measurements and how to manipulate equations to determine values. the uncertainty stuff seemed pretty arbitrary at times.",
    "General physics lab skills",
    "Application of Physics",
    "Learned about uncertainties, although I do wish they had been taught better.",
    "The class helps you to understand\/see physics in action, which is helpful, but I'd never use these skills in my real world.",
    "Good intro physics lab, developed practical lab skills, very different from gen chem and orgo labs, so worth taking for lab skills.",
    "This lab was very helpful for seeing physics class concepts applied in a lab setting.",
    "How to quantify uncertainty in measurements, how to design physical experiments, review of fundamental laws of physics",
    "I learned how to conduct scientific experiments and write informal lab write-ups. Also, I observed the application of the physics concepts and equations I learned in class.",
    "It was just applying the fundamentals we learn in intro physics lecture courses into some simple machines and observations",
    "This lab is a great introduction to physics lab work! Although very similar to what one may do in AP Physics, I felt that I did learn new material, such has handling uncertainty and experimental errors with much better understanding as compared to high school.",
    "This class helped to illustrate the principles we were learning in class.",
    "I learned to make a proper notebook, to think analytically and properly document all steps in a scientific analysis. Also developed a solid understanding of quantitative uncertainty. Genuinely useful.",
    "I learned how to use LoggerPro and how to do some of the demonstrations we saw in Physics lecture, which helped solidify my understanding of those concepts.",
    "This class was ok. Lab reports took a while to write up. A lot of work for just 0.5 credits. Probably never going to use the information learned in this class in the future. Ever. Prospective relevant topics include: Bernoulli's principle, terminal velocity, and radioactivity.",
    "I learned basic Physics laboratory skills. Tommy how to write a good lab report and keep experimental data organized. Also helped me develop insight.",
    "I learned a bit to think how to apply what I learned in class to lab.",
    "I learned hands-on laboratory skills and essential knowledge such as calculation of uncertainties.",
    "How to think like a physicist",
    "This course helped me to better understand concepts learned in Physics 180 and see how they applied to the real world. It also gave me an introduction in how to write proper lab notebooks and reports. It also helped me get a grip on how labs work and how to calculate uncertainties in measurements, which will be helpful knowledge for the future.",
    "Tough lab but teaches you a lot. Always seemed to be a week ahead of the course material from lecture though which was kind of tough.",
    "reviewed basics physics concepts",
    "I gained valuable quantitative and qualitative skills in this course, through uncertainty calculations and various experiments completed.",
    "I developed hands-on experimental skills and data-taking skills. I became much more competent in uncertainty analysis and also in designing experimental procedures. I enjoyed how the course applied theoretical material into real life.",
    "Uncertainty in measurements + more practical applications in physics semester 1",
    "Creating a coherent lab notebook and working with uncertainties. Good course.",
    "I learned to tackle a lab more independently instead of having step by step instructions on what to do.",
    "I learned how to conduct an investigation using the the tools of LoggerPro and physics.",
    "I learned how to apply an array of physics concepts learned in lecture.",
    "I learned how to conduct physics lab experiments on my own and more importantly, I learned how to apply what was learned in each lab to my daily life.",
    "I learned how to estimate error and summarize concisely!",
    "Taught me a lot about logger pro and uncertainty calculations",
    "This class reinforced many fundamental physics topics and highlighted the importance of significant figures.",
    "I learned to put what I learned in theory into practice.",
    "I learned more about physical applications of concepts learned in PHYS180. This course was also a good review of lab practices and uncertainties in the real world, as well as good practice in being concise in scientific writing.",
    "Basic physics laboratory skills featuring topics in mechanics, and deep error propagation skills.",
    "This class taught me fundamental concepts in physics without me having to have taken physics in the past, which is commendable.",
    "Lot about uncertainty and how to think critically to problem solve.",
    "Great lab course that balances courseload and experimental learning. I definiltelt liked that the labs were both shorter and more informative than most of the lab courses I have taken",
    "I got to practice physics principles in an interactive setting."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: Experimental Design, Ease of Course, Low Anxiety Weakness: There needs to be a standard rubric for the lab reports because I felt it was either hit or miss with the TA's attempting to provide feedback but usually skirting around what was really wanted\/needed.",
    "The labs themselves are very organized and the handouts are excellent. The professors are very engaged and organized. It follows physics 180 relatively well. Weakness was the final exam- I did not feel I had adequate time to show my true lab skills\/ability. It ended up being very messy.",
    "The experiments done in this lab were very tedious; I felt that more could be learned by reading a textbook than coming in and wasting 3 hours a week doing busy work. For example, one experiment included flipping a penny 100 times to prove that a larger sample size produces better results. This should be obvious to everyone taking the course!!! I was very angry when I had to spend 3 hours of my week reiterating things that I already knew, or learning new things in a very inefficient manner. I am not against having laboratories for physics, but I do believe this course and other physics labs have to be seriously reworked. There are better ways to experimentally explore topics covered in lecture that will enhance learning, instead of cause frustration. Another thing to consider when organizing this course is coherence with the lecture course. Some topics were introduced in lab way before they were covered in lecture. For a person like me who has never taken physics before, this was confusing and annoying.",
    "The course was laid out by lab and had a clear path to follow. I would say that the expectations for lab reports and lab writeups were not as clear as they could have been; a lot of the formatting and expectations were learned as I did more lab reports.",
    "There were multiple occasions where my classmates and I were counted off for not including something that the lab handout never mentioned, and our TA said he hadn't even known we were expected to include because he doesn't have access to the rubric until after we turn everything in. Also, my TA at least rarely understood in depth what was going on each day. It would definitely help if the TA's were required to read and complete the labs themselves before trying to guide us, because as it was mine was almost never able to answer our questions. This ruined the class for me, and everyone in the class definitely felt very frustrated. The TAs should either be better prepared, or just don't bother having them.",
    "At times this course can be rather dry. I'd like if some of the labs were more exciting.",
    "TA was bad, no feedback or grading rubric, no explanation of how to actually do it correctly",
    "it's a good class and nothing is wrong with it, but I only took it because it's required for my major",
    "Strengths: The lab is great! It makes learning physics enjoyable, and you get to see its application in real life. TA's are really helpful. Weaknesses: Probably the same for all physics labs but the emphasis on finding uncertainties are really annoying.",
    "There's some definite variability in the grading techniques of the TAs and that leads to differences in grades and also in understanding. In addition, some of the labs (like the coin-flipping lab) seemed almost like busy-work and the concept it demonstrated was pretty elementary.",
    "The class attempts to teach experimental design, and keeps touting that it will make us design something ourselves for the next class. Or the next one. Or, you know, the one after that. It's not even for the final that you have to truly set up an experiment on your own - everything is always going to be told to you directly. What quantities to measure, which graph to make out of it on Logger-Pro. The final makes you remember the last one on your own, but as a whole, the class reads as an attempt by the physics department to assert the relevance of a laboratory experiment long before you have the tools to do anything interesting. All that is available is repetition in the hope of precise answers - it does not matter if they are accurate. Did I use those words correctly? They taught me that much, at least.",
    "I suppose one strength of the course is its structure: the class is very well thought out and put together, and students (for the most part) know what is expected of them, like a weekly quiz, lab write up, etc. However, I think the major weakness of this lab is that at many points it is incredibly tedious and boring. Many of the activities seem pointless (flipping a coin over 100 times to prove a point about uncertainties). Personally, performing experiments feels meaningless when 1 million people before me have performed the same experiments and know the outcome.",
    "Overall I thought the class was great, but it was very work intensive. I would have liked it more if some of the grading was changed in the lab reports to weigh more heavily on concepts rather than formating the report correctly (i.e. writing procedures and organization). I also felt like there was some conflicting information spread by TAs regarding how to do some of the smaller parts in the lab (specifically in terms of some confusing uncertainty calculations).",
    "It's a good class, sort of what I expected. I learned important skills",
    "The grading is rather confusing-- we aren't given a rubric, so we don't know what to include in the lab reports. The practical was also very difficult.",
    "I think that it is a well-organized introductory physics laboratory. It is clear that the faculty works hard in making it engaging and fun, but, then again, it is an introductory physics lab...",
    "I believe this course is better suited to phys 180 than 170. I felt that there was some assumed knowledge, especially with the quizzes that was either new information or stuff I hadn't seen since high school.",
    "There is a lot of guidance, and they dont tell you how to write a lab report leading to a lot of bad grades.",
    "Strengths: Very well organized, handouts were thorough and helped solidify the concepts I was learning in PHYS 180. The set-up of each lab was well-prepared. Weaknesses: Grading of the weekly lab reports was very ambiguous (although a syllabus was provided, I found it to be inconsistent to how I was being graded and had no real guidance in writing the reports) and subjective. I felt that although I was learning from each experiment, what was expected of my lab reports was not very clear.",
    "The strengths of the course is that the lab reports and quizzes are very fair and reasonable. The weaknesses are that the lab assignments they give you do not have nearly enough instruction for the students to succeed without the help of the TAs",
    "This seems like the most unnecessary premed requirement. It's overall not very engaging and does not feel relevant. That said, I took the second half before the first half and this was definitely better organized and more straightforward in many ways. Also, Sean Barrett is great-he is always approachable and very helpful.",
    "The course could be better aligned with the material taught in PHYS 170. Course instructors could be more engaged in weekly lab sessions.",
    "Handouts are very helpful.",
    "The labs are so long!",
    "This course could have been better organized - see CHEM 222L and 223L for reference. The TAs should also tell us what we are expected to do before taking off points for not doing things, per some mystery \"rubric\"",
    "The material covered wasn't particularly interesting and motivated for many of the topics. The two most interesting topics were rotation (angular momentum) and radiation, partly because those are things that often seem counterintuitive and rare in everyday life. If more topics could be given the same pizzazz as those two, the class would be much more interesting.",
    "I thought it was overall a good course that did what it professed to do quite effectively.",
    "The class is already structured well. I can't think of any weaknesses. We get the lab manual every week, we do the lab, and we write up a lab addendum, which is a nice way of summarizing everything from the experiments, ensuring that we understand the concepts.",
    "The work expected was appropriate and the lab reports were useful. I think it could match what we were learning in class at the time better. I always found that we were doing labs on concepts we hadn't learned yet and that made it harder to understand what was going on.",
    "Strengths include solidifying understanding in physical concepts. Weaknesses are emphasis on uncertainty calculations and the fact that during the practical exam if one thing goes wrong it can severely impact total score.",
    "felt pretty neutral about it. it's a standard premed or major req course.",
    "I do not think I got anything out of this class, except on how to do calculations with uncertainties. Otherwise I found the experiments to be boring and the grading and work standards to be unclear and nitpicky. I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of this course, so it's hard for me to say how it can be improved.",
    "I liked that it was only 3 hours compared to some other longer labs. The assignments were also short in length and some other labs have unnecessarily long ones. The final practical exam however did feel much harder than anything else we did in the course.",
    "I enjoyed most of the labs we did in class. They were thoroughly explained in the lab handouts and I felt prepared for each lab session. I thought the length of the labs and the amount of work required for the lab reports quite reasonable. The instructors and TAs were very helpful, and the course was well organized. More time to prepare for the final exam would have been nice. Perhaps we could have started two weeks in advance instead of one.",
    "Sometimes the labs felt forced, as if they were intentionally trying to make them longer than they should be, physics lab should definitely not take 3 hours.",
    "This class was so opaque as to grading. Points get taken off for \"lack of insight\" when there really is never any discussion or help to show us what counts as \"insight.\" This class could have been enjoyable, but I just found it frustrating and annoying.",
    "Strengths: experiments corresponded pretty well with the physics 180 sequence, which helped with understanding that material, experiments usually clear and instructions were easy to follow Weaknesses: quizzes did not reflect preparation (it was very easy to spend hours reviewing the lab manual and do poorly on the quiz)",
    "Actually enjoyed this. I really understood physics better in this context.",
    "Strengths: Well-organized, reasonable workload, lots of people to get help and feedback from, experiments are organized",
    "Thorough and clear course packet and very fair workload. Expectations for the \"insights\" portion of the lab summary were not well-defined. The course could be improved by the teaching fellow announcing components on the lab summary rubric unique to the particular lab.",
    "I think some of the labs were very tedious and didn't add much to my understanding of the material. The grading system was difficult because there was no format.",
    "Compared to PHYS 166L, these labs took way longer. In 166, we were always out at least 15-30 minutes early, but in this lab I was out 30 minutes late for probably 8 of the 11 labs, which is definitely frustrating. I wish the labs didn't go as long considering it is a 3 hour lab, so if they need to take that long it should be a longer lab period, especially if you assume you should be out in 3 hours and have other things you have to do.",
    "Some of the labs could be streamlined a little bit; some of them seem a little bit unnecessarily long just to learn how to measure an approximate value of g, for example, but overall the class is actually designed pretty well and the fact that the lab reports are not too long is a great strength of the course. The students learn what they need to, but don't spend an inordinate amount of time on the busywork of lab reports.",
    "Sean Barrett and Jeremy Gaison were amazing! They knew the lab so thoroughly so were able to really explain any confusion to us very well. The summary write-ups at the end of the labs were quick but required us to fully understand the lab results and why it really mattered, which I thought was a much better use of our time out of class instead of tedious, lengthy lab reports in some other classes.",
    "Overall, I think the course is great. It presents different physical concepts and different ways of measurement in a fun way. I think some of the labs, however, were rather tedious. In particular, the coin flipping lab I think was rather pointless in that the time we spent counting the coin flips could have been substituted with just an online simulator\/number generator.",
    "I appreciated how labs always ended on time. I also liked how topics tracked relatively well with the PHYS 180 curriculum.",
    "This course demonstrates basic physics concepts in a laboratory setting, so it was nice to see concepts learned in class actually put to the test in real life. Rotating partners every week was a bit of a challenge, but it's understandable why.",
    "A strength of the course was the clear course layout and lab instruction formatting. It grew a little repetitive to use LoggerPro almost every week, however. The course might be improved by using a variety of computer software to expose students to various programs.",
    "The course overall is clearly designed and simple to follow. The assignments however, are difficult to understand. There is no clear rubric for the evaluation of any of the assignments.",
    "The course was interesting, but sometimes the labs were not very engaging or time efficient.",
    "The lab did not always match with the PHYS 170 course (a lot of what we learned in the lecture was not covered in lab, and some of the opposite was true as well). It was nice to learn more in the lab, but I wish there had been more overlap.",
    "I often felt this course was overly tedious, and the labs sometimes were long and confusing. However, somehow it all ended up working out into a comprehensive introduction that covered a wide breadth of material.",
    "I think we could have more preparation for how the final exam is set up ahead of the week before the exam. we dont practice much with designing experiments until the last week of class",
    "Very little feedback from TA was not helpful.",
    "Great TA instruction.",
    "This class is pretty chill and doable, but when there are things that are confusing, there isn't much support outside of the classroom to help you understand things.",
    "The class's directions aren't very clear and would benefit from a more scientific method approached procedure than dense paragraphs with information dispersed throughout. It can cause a lot of errors and make it more confusing. The background is helpful. The labs are exciting enough however, and the work is the correct amount for the amount of credit one receives.",
    "I have very few suggested improvements because overall this was a great course. However, I wish there were more standardization among TAs, I wish the TAs were more educated on their instruction, mine was not familiar with the lab techniques taught, and often gave incorrect information then deducted points because of his mistake. Also, the software, LoggerPro, and some of the other programs used in class were very glitchy and difficult to work with. I don't know if there are alternatives to this, but I wish they could be improved.",
    "Strength: I learned a lot about concepts from physics class applied in a lab setting and labs and reports were interesting and not unnecessarily long. Weakness: \"Incite\" was not clearly defined and the final was pretty stressful (we were told we would have a lot of time but we didn't really have a lot of time).",
    "My section leader and TA were both very helpful in providing assistance in understanding concepts and performing experiments. The experiments themselves were pretty well-designed and went in an order that made sense and aligned pretty closely with the introductory physics lecture sequence. I can't think of any real possible improvements.",
    "Using informal write-ups instead of full lab reports makes the workload more manageable.",
    "The experiments are all very well laid out and planned in advance, and there was never really any time I felt the course was lacing in preparation. Each lab made it very clear what the procedure was and I felt like that was extremely helpful for me! I think one weakness may be the lack of experimental setups at times, especially when you need to wait in for your turn in order to collect data. But the course staff were extremely helpful, and probably some of the nicest people I have worked with in any class!",
    "An example notebook is provided online but is not explicitly discussed at length. I would have preferred either the TA or the overall instructor to very explicitly lay out the grading rubric. I found sometimes I was on the mark, but sometimes missed things that I wasn't aware I had been including or didn't know were important.",
    "We went through a lot of different topics (which was good!), and sometimes it would be helpful to get more basic background on the topics since not all of them are taught in the physics lecture courses.",
    "Overall the class was not too hard and not much work compared to other labs. However it's not very rewarding and it's hard to see the point of the time spent in and out of the lab.",
    "The strength was that it covered the basic concepts in physics comma covering a wide range of topics. However sometimes it could be a bit tedious and you don't really explore anything into much detail.",
    "The wording in many of the labs were not clear, which made it hard to understand during lab what I was supposed to do.",
    "The lab material overlapped nicely with that of the lecture course, but the lab themselves could have been more engaging and interesting.",
    "the concept is hard, and if you miss one dayyou are so behind",
    "One of the biggest strengths of this course included how the labs were designed to help us understand physics concepts first and accuracy tests second. I've heard in chemistry lab that if the results do not conform to the expected values, then your grade for the lab was lowered. Thankfully, that wasn't the case in Physics Lab, which is good considering that there were many times that my results did not line up with the expected ones. It was also a good introduction to the basics of a lab class. We didn't have to write extensive lab reports like we would have had to in other practical labs, so this helped me ease into the environment of working in labs, which is nice. The main weakness of this course was that some of the concepts covered in lab didn't line up well with concepts covered in physics, which would result in my understanding of concepts in the lab being somewhat wonky. I remember that we did a lab in terminal velocity and buoyancy that did not correlate with when we covered that subject in Physics 180, so my understanding of that subject was rather foggy when we ended up covering that concept in 165L. I'm not sure that this is something that can easily be fixed, since it would require coordination between the instructors of Phys 180 and Phys 165L, but it is a weakness I noticed. I'd say that one major way that the course could be improved is that some time should be spent near the beginning of the semester detailing what should be in a quality lab notebook and report. We did have that sample lab notebook and report to work off of, which was handy, but it took a while for me to understand the level of depth and thoroughness that should go into a good lab assignment. If the instructors could spend part of the first lesson detailing this out a little bit, I think it would make doing lab notebooks and reports a much more painless experience.",
    "I think the course is overall done well, my one suggestion is it was a bit confusing early on what belonged in a lab report",
    "Tough lab but teaches you a lot. Always seemed to be a week ahead of the course material from lecture though which was kind of tough.",
    "more guidance on expectations for the last report",
    "I enjoyed the experiments and how there are multiple questions that must be answered throughout the laboratory. Also, the exam prep for this course is very helpful.",
    "The strength is the experiments are very interesting and the course emphasizes the learning aspect. The weakness comes from the arbitrary insight\/lab report grading depending on your TA.",
    "The strength of the course is that it is structured and managed well. The weakness is that sometimes the experiments are too long and have repetitive procedure or calculations, to the point that the calculations stop being valuable or educational. I hope that the labs are more homogenized and are better manageable with the given time in the future. Otherwise, it was fun to complete and learn from the experiments.",
    "Strengths are that the experiments that dealt with topics I was covering in the corresponding class further expanded my knowledge of the subject. However some experiments were never addressed.",
    "Some strength include generally easy to understand lab handouts. One improvement would be better clarification on how to gain insight points.",
    "It does a good job of teaching us how to look at things from multiple perspectives in terms of how to approach research.",
    "This course prepares students to think like physicists and engage in the lab experiment in a meaningful way,",
    "I don't think quizzes should only be 4 points and be worth that much; in addition I think one quiz should be dropped",
    "I thought there was a lot of repetition in the class in general, which like i get in the context of learning lab skills, but i thought a lot more could have been covered. I thought the small sections where a huge plus though.",
    "This lab definitely taught me how to carry out an experiment on my own using LoggerPro but many of the experiments were not especially exciting and could be improved. The lab report just felt like a summary of what we did in class but was not graded harshly. However, I constantly got points off for not highlighting the significance of my experiment, and as much as I tried to add this each week, they were not clear on what they wanted and I kept getting points off.",
    "Well organized course. The various TA grading should have been normalized.",
    "The course was a reasonably good introductory lab sequence. The TFs and course instructor were always helpful and happy to add insight into what we were studying or clarify confusion. The first few labs were not very engaging, particularly the coin flip lab. It seems like in a few cases better\/more exciting experiments could have been chosen to investigate the same topics. About half way through the course the labs drastically improved and were much more involved and engaging, making coming to lab more fun than hassle.",
    "This class gave a wonderful and straightforward introduction to the exploration of the laws of physics in the laboratory: experiments explored different facets of these laws, illustrating to students how seemingly small principles can be applied to an innumerable variety of physical phenomena. The workload was reasonable -- while only lab notes and a small write-up were due every week, it was expected that the write-up be succinctly written in the style of a scientific paper.",
    "This course has a pretty good streamlined structure. It is easy to go about one's business as a student. The faculty and staff were also incredibly accommodating, willing to meet outside of regular class time to make sure everyone was caught up and on the same page. However, there was a great amount of technical difficulty to be had with the LoggerPro software that detracted rom the educational experience.",
    "The final was way too difficult and stressful",
    "Strengths include the good organization of content and the professors and TAs were all very helpful. For future classes the current model works well.",
    "Requirements for written lab reports as well as grading policies could me made clearer.",
    "Course is unnecessarily tedious and repetitive. Does teach about uncertainty.",
    "This class did not align well with Physics 170 material which made it a bit harder for those taking that class to use class material to help with lab problem solving."

   "comments": [
    "It was a wonderful course! I highly recommend it as it is completely different from other Labs you may have experience (Looking at you GenChem). It is low stress and focused more on being able to see\/feetitrationsl\/understand physical phenomenon rather than being meticulous with or whatever.",
    "For pre-meds that have to take physics lab or other majors, you have to take it but honestly it is not too bad!",
    "Only take if necessary.",
    "I would not recommend this course to anyone that does not have to take it. However, most people that take this course are required to take it either for their major or premed, so this advice is irrelevant. The department should seriously consider fixing this course before subjecting so many unwilling people to it.",
    "If you are into physics and applying concepts to practical lab setups, take this class!",
    "The best part about this course is that the workload was much closer to what should be reasonable for a half-credit than most lab courses at Yale. The thing that ruined this course for me was my TA, who had no idea what was going on. He couldn't instruct us correctly during the lab so then our lab notebooks wouldn't fulfill requirements and we would all lose points. Maybe I would not have been so frustrated by this class if it were not for that, but, as is, the class felt pretty meaningless because I had to guide myself through experiments where I learned very little.",
    "Easy 1\/2 credit and not that much work. Lab does enhance concepts taught in lecture, so taking this class along with lecture is good.",
    "It's fine but it's required so",
    "Yes. As for all labs, only take it if you need to, but it's really quite enjoyable and the hours always flew by on lab days. It's easy and the lab reports take like half an hour each week.",
    "I mean, you probably have to take it, and I'd recommend it above 201L which I also shopped. Some of the labs are mindless, but it's very relaxed.",
    "This class is set up like a high school lab course. I realize that it's an intro course, and a low-level one at that, but please spare me the attempts to remind us that gravity works. One great insight I developed would have to be that Durfee's sandwiches are not a proper lunch, on their own, and that pairing most things with them that comes in under $8 is still not fully satisfying. Don't take it if you don't have to. But if you have to, don't worry. This class is instantly forgettable, and I don't mean when the semester is over. It takes up about four hours of your week - three in SPL, a half hour walking to and from, and a half hour writing a lab report that is capped at one page.",
    "I would recommend it if you have to learn physics for your major requirement. It was really helpful to pair it with coursework. However, do know that it was a lot of work every week to do the lab reports and prepare for the weekly credits. I definitely spent more time on this than a lot of my classes worth 1 credit.",
    "Not really. It's not a fun lab, take it because you have to, but otherwise, it's not worth the struggling.",
    "I would only recommend the course to someone who needs it for his\/her major or for premed requirements. Otherwise, the class simply does not offer much in terms of learning new material.",
    "I do not think anyone would take this class for fun. You take it because you have to and try to enjoy it. It is not a bad class. It is just an introductory physics lab",
    "I would only recommend this course if it is needed",
    "Unless required by one's major, I feel like this course is for those who want hands-on physics experience in the lab to reinforce concepts learned in an introductory physics class.",
    "If you don't have to take it, I wouldn't. But it really isn't that bad .",
    "Only take it if you have to. Not terribly interesting.",
    "If you're taking this course, it's probably because you have to. It's not that bad, and you get to reinforce a lot of the things you learn in physics lecture.",
    "It is not too painful, so don't dread it going into it, but not the most fun class either.",
    "Good first physics lab.",
    "I would recommend PHYS 165L to another student as a helpful supplement to PHYS 170 or PHYS 180. It is very beneficial to gain a more hands-on understanding of concepts taught in lecture.",
    "PHYS 165L does a good job at reinforcing the class material if you're in 180. Some of the labs were a bit dry, but that's pretty common in all lab classes, and the labs definitely got more interesting as the class went on. PHYS 165L is not at all a stressful class as long as you put in the effort to do well (the workload isn't huge, so the course is definitely manageable).",
    "Only take this class if you have to for a requirement. It's not really a \"fun\" class that you credit\/d.",
    "Go ahead and take it, it's not too bad. You probably won't have a blast, but you probably won't resent it either. The workload is pretty low (especially if you've taken chem labs before), and the professors and TAs do a good job of walking you through each experiment. I won't say I learned a ton, but I did learn some things and almost everyone considering this course is probably required to take it anyways.",
    "I would recommend taking this lab with your physics lecture. It's a wonderful lab, and the teaching fellows are great. You will learn a lot from just hands on experience, and your TA is always there to help.",
    "The lab complements the lecture physics courses well, but the labs are pretty boring. You learn practical things, though.",
    "I would only recommend this course to premedical students or physics majors who have to take this course.",
    "likely you'll have to take it for premed or for your major. nothing special, but it's a lot nicer than chem or bio labs (only 3 hrs, and you often finish early!) - profs also obviously care about the course and really try to streamline it so you're maximizing your learning instead of just doing a bunch of busy work",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, but the only reason to take it is because its required. I personally got nothing out of it, and it took away about three hours of my week that could be put to better use doing almost anything else.",
    "Pretty standard intro physics lab course, the experiments were very well-designed and I really like them. There's a lot of emphasis on learning to graph and deriving relationships from them and it helps reinforce physics principles.",
    "No I would not recommend this class to another student unless they had to take it for major or pre-med requirements.",
    "It's a fine lab--not too arduous but not a breeze. I imagine that students will continue to take this lab because of major\/premed requirements.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it but if you have to take a physics lab take 165-166, DO NOT take 205-206, your life will be a lot easier and enjoyable.",
    "Chances are you have to take this class. It's not bad compared to other lab classes (shorter time, shorter lab reports), but it's still not super fun.",
    "This lab is okay - it's not too challenging, but quiz preparation and writing lab reports will take up a couple of hours a week. The experiments themselves were not difficult, and writing the report was more of a nuisance than a challenge. If you have a good TA, you should be fine. The final was a little challenging but not impossible.",
    "No",
    "It's not a particularly difficult class. I would recommend taking this class over the higher level physics lab if you don't have much time to put into the class.",
    "Not as tedious as I thought it would be. Straight-forward, well-organized, takes some time, gets you thinking about experimental design like a scientist",
    "I would only take this class if it was required. I do not feel like it helped my understanding of physics.",
    "I enjoyed being able to explain everyday occurrences with physics, but I personally would not take the class if you don't have to simply because of the time commitment. It doesn't take a lot of time outside of class, but I had friday lab 12-3 and it definitely ended up taking most of my day with the amount of time it takes to get up science hill and with getting out late from most labs.",
    "If you have to take physics lab, this is a good choice. It's a fairly relaxed lab compared to other labs I've taken, but it does take up more time than it should to do the lab reports every single week. Not too difficult, but the lab final exam (three new experiments in three hours) does require effort\/thought\/intellect.",
    "I assume that students aren't taking physics lab for the pleasure of taking a lab...if it is a necessary evil you need to fulfill a requirement, it's certainly not as bad as many of the labs at Yale, but I would never recommend taking it just to fill a science credit. Even though it's not a ton of work, it's quite boring.",
    "Yes absolutely! Sean Barrett is the best professor and always willing to explain or demonstrate things to you if you get stuck.",
    "Yes. You'll likely be taking this course for a requirement. The workload is pretty low, and if you choose to engage with the material\/labs, you'll see and learn some cool concepts. I think the most important thing to keep in mind with this course is that it will be rewarding if you try to really understand the material -- otherwise it can quickly become just a tedious lab experience.",
    "As far as labs go, this one is alright. It gets out on time and is only around 1.5 hours of work outside of class time. The experiments can be pretty fun at times though it's frustrating when equipment doesn't work properly.",
    "PHYS 165L is an interesting class--I'd recommend this course to anyone who wanted to explore concepts learned in general physics in a laboratory setting.",
    "I would not recommend taking this course unless you need it to fulfill a requirement. It is not incredibly interesting, and you'll spend three hours a week performing rather tedious experiments using LoggerPro. The layout of the course and quality of the professors is good, but, unfortunately, due to the nature of an introductory physics lab, you won't learn much that you didn't learn in high school physics, and it is not very interesting to attend.",
    "The class was required for my major. It was very clear and concise. But it definitely needs clerical improvement.",
    "If you are taking physics, I would strongly recommend the lab, which rounds out the lecture and brings everything together. It's cool to see the mathematical equations play out (ish) in real life.",
    "Only take it if you have to.",
    "This course isn't too bad. the final isn't as hard as people make it out to be. just be confident and make sure you're familiar with all the methods we use over the course of the class and prepare using the practice questions and you'll be fine.",
    "No",
    "Take if in phys 170\/180.",
    "Only take this lab if you have to ( premed, major req, etc.). It's chill but there are much more interesting labs",
    "Yes, wide range of experiments provides exposure to many areas of physics, life sciences related, classical mechanics, and otherwise. Worked very well with both 170 and 180 curricula.",
    "Yes if you want to see physics class concepts applied in a semi-real life setting. Lab reports did not take as long as Chemistry lab and the lab itself was only three hours not four.",
    "This is a pretty good lab course to take for someone studying physics or another natural science, maybe. It followed the concepts from introductory physics lecture pretty well without requiring that you remembered everything from the lecture course itself (most important concepts and formulas were reviewed). A reasonable, manageable amount of work with lots of help from TAs and the section leaders when performing experiments.",
    "No, I would not because although it was interesting, I didn't learn many skills that could be applied to other areas.",
    "This course is probably a prereq for you if you're reading it. It's definitely better\/simpler than either chem or orgo lab but I doubt you'll be roaring to go each week. The practical isn't too bad, but it is hard to prepare for.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student looking to take an introductory lab course! Even if you haven't taken any physics before this course is suitable, as long as you are taking the corresponding physics lecture. You'll learn about the most basic and famous physics experiments that demonstrate the various phenomena you learn about in class, get experience working with Vernier hardware and software, and get better at detecting uncertainties in experiments and explaining error!",
    "I'd recommend the course to a student who is seeking to improve their confidence in independently conducting and documenting scientific experiments.",
    "It is a standard physics laboratory class. Make sure you get familiar with the different apparatus and technology throughout the semester (esp LoggerPro).",
    "If you're taking this, it's probably because you have to. I think that says it all.",
    "I would recommend it to somebody who feels like they don't have too strong of a physics background, or is just trying to get the requirements out of the way. However, if you would like a more challenging class I would recommend looking at a higher level course.",
    "If you need to take it, just take it and get it over with.",
    "It's essential for gaining laboratory skills required for most stem majors.",
    "yas if ur STEM",
    "Very well-organized and well-planned lab - the course organizers and TFs did a great job.",
    "Tough lab but teaches you a lot. Always seemed to be a week ahead of the course material from lecture though which was kind of tough.",
    "if you have to take a physics lab this one is ok",
    "Yes if you need this course for your major or pre-med then take it. I recommend taking it with the lecture course. I took it after the lecture and found that I learned more from the lab course than the lecture.",
    "I would recommend this class but be sure to figure out what your TA wants\/ befriend them so you can get a fair lab report grade.",
    "It is a useful course that should be taken by all students interested in STEM. Some of the labs are fun to complete, whereas some others can become very tedious. You learn something new from each lab and I enjoyed the fact that class maeerial was tested out in real life. You do so many uncertainty calculations that you become good at it; learning how to design experiments is also essential.",
    "Yes, helpfulcourse even though tedious at times.",
    "Only if you have to or just love physics experiments and calculating statistical error.",
    "I wouldn't really recommend this course for any other reason other than fulfilling premed requirements.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they want to learn about interesting ways that physics applies to our daily lives and get hands-on experience with conducting physics lab experiments.",
    "I just used it as a prerequisite towards my major, dont see a ton more merit in it",
    "I would only suggest you take this course if necessary.",
    "This was a good introductory lab sequence. It was fun most of the time and towards the latter half of the semester definitely helped me to grasp PHYS 180 concepts. Not too much work outside of lab, I would recommend this course overall.",
    "165 is a great intro physics lab course--take it!",
    "I'm presuming that few students would take this class for the pleasure of it and not to satisfy a requirement -- even so, the class was extremely rewarding and was a pleasure to be in.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in learning some visualizations of physics concepts, as this offers ample, well-organized opportunities to do so.",
    "Yes this course is a manageble and helpful complement to the lecture course that allows for application of the theoretical concepts and helps teach experiment design.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's the best lab I've taken, but would still recommend other sciences.",
    "Only take if you have to.",
    "Only take it if you have to."
