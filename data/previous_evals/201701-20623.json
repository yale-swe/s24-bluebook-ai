    "German! German culture! German society! German language! German politics!",
    "My German skills improved in all areas in this course: writing, speaking, reading, and listening. The course combined the perfect balance of each of those areas. Additionally, I learned a lot about social and environmental justice in Germany, both throughout history and in current events.",
    "I polished my reading and writing skills in german",
    "This course presented students a convenient platform to learn and discuss contemporary matters in Germany while practicing the German language skills. It helped me in particular to improve my German language skills in using it in professional and academic contexts rather than in plain conversational topics as it is the case for many language classes.",
    "In this course, I learned about advanced German structures such as the konjunctive and extended adjectives. I also learned about German culture such as the \"Sozialstaat\" and the \"Energiewende\"."

   "comments": [
    "The feedback for written work was very helpful.",
    "Lacked a clear focus at times but it was still fun.",
    "The course allows you to significantly improve your German skills over the course of a semester, and I rarely felt like the workload was too demanding. It combined a good mix of readings, movies, and discussions. Sometimes the topics we discussed weren't super interesting to me, so that could be a weakness of the course. This was the first L5 class I took that covered grammar, which was especially useful for me, since I hadn't learned some aspects of advanced German grammar yet.",
    "There were a lot of native speakers in the class and a professor who was eager to speak, which made it really hard and intimidating to participate.",
    "Course helps a lot to make students knowledgeable about topics that are important to German society. On the other hand it is also pretty much loaded, there were two homework assignments besides the required readings before each class. It is, from time to time, difficult to keep up with for a graduate student.",
    "The course was a good intro to German culture. I would have preferred it if the class had a more clear structure. For example, it would have been great if Prof. Gehlker could have spent more time teaching us grammer and syntax rules rather than just guiding class discussions. I would have also liked it if the class had used less creative project types. Projects such as making posters or videos take a long time to complete (since much time is wasted on aesthetics) and I feel like more German could be learned through more conventional project types (presentations, essays,...)"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. I learned a lot and you will too.",
    "This course has a very specific topic, so make sure that you are interested in the subjects outlined in the syllabus before you take the course. If social and environmental justice in Germany is a topic that interests you, and you want to improve your German skills specifically through in-class discussions and essay writing, then I would highly recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend GMAN 151 to another student, but only if you are interested in politics and economics",
    "This course is highly recommended to polish one's German and to stay updated about the headlines in German media, especially for international students who come from Europe with the idea to improve their language skills beside their main study areas.",
    "This is a great class if you want to learn basics about German culture and history; however, I feel like relatively little time is spent improving grammar and essay structure. I would thus not necessarily recommend it if you're looking to make giant improvements in your German speaking\/writing ability."
