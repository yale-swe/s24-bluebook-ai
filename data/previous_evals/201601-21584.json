   "comments": [
    "If you're already in this far in Greek, you might as well take this class. It's Homer! What on earth could be better? Word of warning, though: I was expecting the Iliad, and this is the Odyssey. If you're not into sea voyages, just stick it out for the Pauline LeVen Iliad class (though they read about 5 times as many lines a class as we do, so good luck with your life!)",
    "Take this class! My Greek got better and I got to read one of the greatest works of the ancient world.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in Greek Poetry and who loves Homer. Such a great introductory class!",
    "Absolutely take this course! It is a fantastic introduction to the Homeric world and addresses multiple facets of the Odyssey for a very rich understanding of the text. Besides translation and syntax and vocabulary, you'll learn about modern scholarship being done on the Odyssey, the historical and literary context of the text, and really awesome etymologies. Mike Zimm is one of the most fantastic and engaging instructors I've had in my time at Yale. Don't miss it - this is an incredible course if you want to read the Odyssey, even if you aren't a Classics or Ancient Greek major! This class has something for everyone in it and it's just a pleasure to learn from Mike Zimm.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Homer especially after 131. Definitely take it if you're interested in a survey of some of Homer's best passages.",
    "This is a phenomenal introduction to Homeric Greek. The Odyssey is obviously a masterful text with depth and beauty in its language, and this class is a way to access it. You can come in with relatively little knowledge and still do well, and you have a great chance to get to know Greek deeply through your instructor's guidance. Be sure to study for the regular quizzes and ACTUALLY PREPARE FOR CLASS. Many people just translated the first couple sentences and as a result had relatively little understanding of greek by the time they finished the course. Don't rely too heavily on Perseus. It will be your downfall when the final exam comes."
