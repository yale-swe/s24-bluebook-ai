    "This is a fun class, an you learn a good amount for an L1 course. Homework is sparse and not difficult, and you get to drop the lowest test. Definitely take it if oyu want to learn portuguese",
    "Marta is the best teacher on the planet. You will learn portuguese and not even know how it happened. I highly recommend this class--truly outstanding.",
    "I would recommend any language. Portuguese is the 5th most spoken language in the world and I believe it is important to learn a least one language beyond a native language.",
    "Great class!",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "Yes-it's a great culture, language and department!"
