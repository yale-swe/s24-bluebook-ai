   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students because it is a relatively easy class that is really enjoyable.",
    "Yes. Great freshman seminar and full of surprises.You get a lot of reading but you can pick and choose what you end of reading--so course work is as great or little as you determine.",
    "Yes I would. Very interesting course as long as you come in with an open mind ready to think about these issues. The class as a whole was fun and it's great to be able to nearly see all of Spike's repertoire",
    "If you have any interest in Spike Lee, this seminar is an excellent embodiment of his repertoire in the discussion surrounding him. You'll be an auteur on the auteur by the time you're done with this joint.",
    "I would recommend the course because it was a fun and interesting seminar that all Spike Lee fans would appreciate",
    "The film is very interesting and enjoyable to take and I would recommend it for anyone interested in Film or even any other major.",
    "College is about exploring, so this class is perfect. You explore so many different things- film studies, black political history, the philosophy of race, etc. There's plenty to talk about, and it's very laid back. Don't stress about the reading, because you won't be interrogated about it. But do read it- it can be really fascinating.",
    "This Spike Lee course was a lot of fun. It's a great way to learn more about film without taking an intense course. We got a chance to see all of Spike Lee's films and have great discussions with other freshman. It's a great freshman seminar because the workload is not heavy, and the professor is friendly and eager to help. The papers aren't bad at all and there's no final exam. Watching the movies once a week at night was sometimes time-consuming, but it wasn't too bad.",
    "This class is a lot about discussion and free associating. I recommend it to students who like to tlak their thoughts out and are really interested in Spike Lee's films and the issues he brings up. I would not recommend the class to those who want a really structured class."
