    "This is a twisted puzzle. By far, this is the worst class I've taken at Yale, yet it is necessary for a large part of the majors. Be prepared for disappointment; the tests have questions designed for no one to be able to answer, the teaching is lackluster at best, and the course doesn't really help your understanding of the subject. No course has aggravated me as much as this one has. But, if you haven't had the opportunity to take BC calculus, you will probably have to take this. So good luck, and ask lots of people who have taken the class before about TA's; most of them aren't that great.",
    "Math 115 is your basic Calc II class, covering integration and series. I took it after getting a 5 on Calc AB high school and it was the logical next step for my skill level and major plans. Take it if you need to, but it's not the type of class that makes you grow as a person. I was not satisfied with Warshall as a section leader. Class consisted of his writing 3 problems on the board at the beginning of class and letting us work through them for the next 50 minutes with intermittent checking on our work and answering questions. While this style may be appropriate in a section that complements a lecture, it is not enough when we're counting on section to actually learn the material. Warshall means well and speaks English, so if you've seen this material before or can pick up math just by practice you'll be fine. However, if you're looking for something more I would pick another TA.",
    "Take Math 115 if it's required for your pre-professional program or major. If you want to take it for fun, be sure you have good intuitive math skills, because many professor expect you to learn most things yourself.",
    "Take it if you must. It's useful. But you can well do it on your own during summer."
