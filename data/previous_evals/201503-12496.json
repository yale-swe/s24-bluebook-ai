    "Standard level 2 Spanish. Professor Valle is excellent, take the class with her if you have the chance. She is understanding, supportive, flexible, and dedicated to students success. She will make you work harder, but in the end she'll improve your Spanish greatly.",
    "I would certainly recommend SPAN 120 05 to other students, as it is a required class. It is also quite easy, if you have a background in Spanish. The class focuses heavily on grammar and conversation, which will give you the basis for the rest of the Spanish courses you take at Yale."
