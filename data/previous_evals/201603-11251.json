   "comments": [
    "I developed insight into linear algebra and vector calculus.",
    "I learned some linear algebra!",
    "I learned important theorems and useful techniques for solving real maths problems, not just formulas and plug-and-chug methods.",
    "I grew generally smarter by learning to approach problems, both mathematical and otherwise, in a rigorous step-by-step fashion where every claim must be proven.",
    "This course taught me how to rigorously prove and understand derivatives and closed and open sets (along with some related topics). It will be complemented next semester by Math 231, so we didn't finish with any topic completely.",
    "I learned how to think rigorously about calculus and linear algebra problems and how to write proofs in these areas.",
    "This class has helped me grow tremendously. It is much more rigorous than any previous math experience I've had, and although I was kind of thrown into the deep end of the pool, it was totally worth it. I've now seen mathematics in a totally new, more beautiful, light.",
    "I learned the formal method of proof-based mathematics, as well as a few fundamentals of multivariable differential calculus and linear algebra.",
    "I learned how to construct detailed, rigorous proofs. I've also learned a huge amount about field theory, differentiation, and linear algebra.",
    "A bigg plus of the course is getting into proof writing and the way of thinking that comes with it.",
    "This is a course in multivariable and vector calculus, linear algebra, topology, and basic analysis. Math 230 will give you a deep foundation in carefully reasoned arguments and abstract thought. Most students in the class begin with multivariable calculus experience, many with linear algebra (some with more), but it is definitely possible (though harder) to succeed without either. The content itself is manageable, if you stay on top of it. Be ready to spend a couple hours each week figuring out everything that went down in lecture. If you love math, you will love Math 230. But this is not a class to take on a whim. It is supposed to take up 20 hours of your time\/week, and while I can't say I spent quite that much, it was definitely in the double digits. Plan to allot one (full) night a week to the psets and several hours throughout the week before. They are challenging and all proof-based. This is not high school math. But you will learn a lot from them. Find a good pset group and get ready to bond through shared difficulty and learning. Class is engaging and fast-paced; you will really start to get a sense of how math actually works. Tests are tricky but overall not too bad. If you pay attention in class and study your notes and complete the psets, you should be just fine. You will feel extremely accomplished at the end.",
    "Not very much, but this is because I had already taken both proof based linear algebra and proof based vector calculus before, therefore I wish I would've taken a higher level math course. Either way, I think if I would not have already essentially taken this course I would've learned a good deal about writing proofs, mathematical language, etc.",
    "I learned how to conduct rigorous proofs, think logically about tough math problems, ask interesting questions, and collaborate with others to deepen my understanding of the material.",
    "This is a fantastic course! I'd been reluctant about taking it, but ultimately decided to because of great previous reviews. I've taken a lot of higher level math courses, but never felt comfortable writing proofs and thinking very abstractly until now. The psets are time consuming but don't count for a large portion of your grade, so they serve primarily as a (very valuable) learning tool.",
    "Linear Algebra, Calculus, proofs, pure math",
    "Great knowledge of vector calculus and linear algebra.",
    "A stronger understanding of vector calculus and linear algebra, on the basis of a more theoretical development of the subjects.",
    "Basics of linear algebra and real analysis: functions, derivatives, subspaces, matrices, vectors,, and properties thereof.",
    "I learned about a variety of new topics in mathematics that I did not previously know, and I learned how to approach various problems that required proofs.",
    "I formally learned how to write proofs, and I stretched my general problem-solving abilities.",
    "I learned the true depth of the field of mathematics, and just how much more to it there was than I thought. I look at mathematics in a different light now, since the course is proof-based, and it has completely changed my approach.",
    "I learned so so much about linear algebra, differentiation, proofs, and the general structure of mathematics.",
    "Learned about topology, linear algebra, basic analysis topics.",
    "Math thinking and multivariable calculus",
    "How to write and think mathematically, introduction to formal logic and argumentation, important foundational concepts in linear algebra.",
    "I learned a lot of linear algebraic topics. I also began to develop a good understanding of how to do a proof, but this will definitely take time to master. Many of the multivariable topics I had known from taking multivariable calculus last semester.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of vectors, sets, topology, linear transformations, and matrices, and principles of differentiation, optimization, and continuity. I also learned practical techniques for doing proofs, and got used to working on difficult problems for long periods of time.",
    "I definitely learnt to think more logically, and to write more rigorous proofs. It was a really inspiring class.",
    "I learned a lot about writing proofs. This was something that I had done relatively little of before this year, and I found it really helpful.",
    "A general familiarity with the material and a more in-depth understanding of calculus. Also I got a feel for the pace of math courses at Yale as well as the quality of assessments.",
    "I improved my proof-based thinking a lot, and we learned some basic real analysis, vector calculus, and linear algebra in this class.",
    "We developed proof skills and covered topics in linear algebra, vector calculus, and some basic topology.",
    "Mathematical reasoning. Writing more rigorous proofs.",
    "Critical thinking and knowledge of how to write proofs.",
    "Previously, I had no experience with proofs whatsoever. I had no clue how to think in a proof-based mindset because I had only done application-based problems before. This course completely shifted the way I view mathematics: I no longer view mathematics as a collection of equations used to find some goal, but rather the reasons why such equations exist. This course radically improved my perception of mathematics.",
    "I think the principal skill I attained was to become better at mathematical proof (in terms of both proof-reading and proof-writing). The first week or two introduces these skills very rapidly (I think it would have been helpful to have spent a little more time here) and then builds on the material, alternating between linear algebra and vector calculus. Material-wise, we covered most of the first 5 chapters of Shifrin (although it's not an exact mapping as we did sometimes deviate significantly from the textbook in terms of the content we covered). I had studied both vector calculus and linear algebra before, and, while some of the content did overlap, I would say that this class differed significantly in the level of rigor with which it treated the topics.",
    "Even though this course is called \"Vector Calculus and Linear Algebra\", I'd say the main knowledge I've taken away from this course is how to approach proofs and mathematical rigor.",
    "The course taught me to write proofs, and to reason with mathematical rigor. It also served as a useful sampling of what more higher-level mathematics classes might be like.",
    "Initially, it had felt that I grasped very little during this course. The homework assignments always seemed to be irrelevant to the topics discussed in class, and way beyond the level of difficulty of problems discussed in class. However, after completing the whole semester, I can comfortably say that we learned a lot of math. In addition to the class being extremely challenging, the added bonus is that it gives personal insights into your own penchant for mathematics. After taking this course, I have learned I no longer want to pursue pure math.",
    "This class helped me become a much, much better mathematician. It forced me to look at math in a way I have never before through proofs."

  {
   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "While this class presents itself as a rigorous introduction to higher level math, the class itself is often disorganized. We jumped from subspaces to topology to linear algebra to vector calculus, and rarely were the connections between topics elucidated. There were some concepts that we just touched on in some lectures, but in following lectures, the concepts were treated as if we extensively studied them. I liked the rigor of the class and the community I developed with other students, but we often rarely consulted our notes, instead favoring online sources and videos.",
    "Stefan presented the material well, and the problem sets, while challenging, definitely improved my understanding. It was demoralizing that the problem sets were worth so little, though I understand that this is to combat cheating. Still, the incredible weight of the midterms, combined with how short they are and the percentage of multiple choice, made it feel like much of my grade was up to chance, and that even if I understood all of the material perfectly I could still get a poor grade on a midterm and in the class based on a 5-minute lapse in focus on a test. Additionally, there were many substitute instructors, and while it's fine to have a substitute every once in a while, it's hard when we have a new teacher every day because our lessons didn't always flow smoothly from each other, since the new teacher didn't know what exactly the previous teacher did.",
    "The tests were difficult to study for and there was little clarity about how to prepare for them. This could be improved by giving students a carefully mapped syllabus that would enable them to study by topic, problem type, and method. The strengths were the peer tutoring, which was very helpful for learning this material and completing p-sets.",
    "Good class, but 9:25 classes are really awful.",
    "This course is very time intensive in terms of the problem sets, but the problem sets barely have any affect on your grade which can be irritating given the time input. A stronger sense of direction in terms of providing a stronger sense of why we are learning different things when would also help.",
    "The lectures are interesting, the problem sets are both interesting and challenging, and the test are reasonable. This is one of the best math classes I've ever taken. It has no outstanding weaknesses.",
    "Stefan is absolutely amazing. I just wish he didn't have to miss so many of the lectures (especially towards the end). The tutoring sessions are also amazing.",
    "I think the problem sets should be worth more of the grade. They are incredibly time consuming and are a much better reflection of a student's mastery of the material than the tests, just because they are more frequent and intensive.",
    "The course covers interesting topics and does so in a great way. The professor, the TA and the peer tutors were all always ready to answer any question both on the course material and any other topic.",
    "Strengths: well-conceived curriculum, challenging psets, the intellectual capacities of fellow students and a brilliant teacher. Weaknesses: not many. Sometimes it is easy to get lost in the fast-paced lectures, but this could be by design and encourages deeper study. A few couple-minute breaks where we can check in with a neighbor and trace the logic of a particularly tough proof would be helpful. Stefan was very receptive to questions, though, and this was helpful. Additionally, the psets are extremely useful in deepening reasoning abilities, but they presume a mastery of the content already. I would find it helpful to be given optional assignments which are more \"high-school\" - calculate this partial derivative, row-reduce this matrix, etc. - to complete before I attempted the much higher-level problem set.",
    "It is a lot of work. Maybe a little more structure might be nice.",
    "Good course overall: Strengths: p-sets were interesting and of an appropriate level; peer tutoring sessions were helpful; overall atmosphere made collaborating useful and I got to know and befriend other freshman in the course; Stefan is very funny and engaging; weaknesses: stefan was absent a lot of the time, I know this is not a fault of the course and he was at job interviews, however, it was very frustrating as the subs were of varying quality and did not always teach relevant material. Also, sometimes concepts were taught in a weird order: I had already taken linear algebra so I had no problem with it, but for example determinants were never defined.",
    "Very intense course, but that is how it's labelled. Support institutions are numerous, such as office hours, study groups, peer tutors, and TAs.",
    "The tests don't seem to be the best assessment tool (silly mistakes can be very costly). I'm not sure how that could be improved, though. The lectures and creative problems sets are definitely a strength.",
    "Classes are hard to understand, material is hard. Material is very interesting, psets are challenging in a very good way. There is a lot of support.",
    "It was very difficult; more clarity in lectures.",
    "I think a greater number of lower level examples could have been presented, so as to give us a stronger grasp of the subjects before working with them at a more theoretical level. It also could have been emphasized early on to read the textbook, as I discovered later that that was immensely helpful.",
    "The strengths are that it is a great class for prospective mathematics majors and is a good class to determine if one should major in the field. Sometimes, however, I think the material could have been presented more clearly and accurately.",
    "I think the problem sets are phenomenal and really helped me learn how to think more creatively. However, I don't think the course gives a comprehensive overview of multi variable calculus.",
    "I don't feel like the exams test what we learn in class very well; no matter how well we understand the concepts, there are always questions that text math intuition, or being lucky, or having outside knowledge. However, I learned more in this class than I ever have in any other class. Stefan is also an excellent and engaging classroom teacher.",
    "The professor was very engaging and fun. Unfortunately, sometimes the lectures were confusing, the professor would jump to a topic, spend 3 minutes on a different topic, and then come back to the original topic, making it hard to take organized notes. Prior knowledge of linear algebra was super useful since sometimes the topics assumed some linear algebra knowledge. Psets are time-consuming and challenging but not overly too too difficult most of the time.",
    "Additive energy was the most confusing thing we learned all semester, and I still have no idea why it's important or relevant. It would also be great if the course were taught with the textbook in mind and if tests had less multiple choice.",
    "Lots of work but it is great",
    "This course was very demanding and as a result very engaging; it challenged us to think critically and formulate rigorous arguments. The amount of time or lack of thorough explanations (or \"hand-holding\") may be a weakness, but it was somewhat necessary for us to learn at this level of fluency.",
    "The class jumps right into proofs which are very difficult. I wish we spent more time proving easier concepts. The advanced math concepts are relatively ok to understand, but proving them can be very difficult. There is also a high amount of work associated with the class.",
    "Strengths: The class is very proof-based, and so very helpful for mathematics majors and for developing proof-making skills. The class is also rigorous and one learns a lot. Weaknesses: I can find nothing that could be improved.",
    "The strength is that Stefan is a really funny professor and his class is very engaging. Peer tutors are very helpful. The weakness is that PSETs are sometimes too long.",
    "A big weakness is that this course did not follow a textbook\/the professor didn't tell us where in the textbook we were, so we couldn't really follow along with the lectures. Additionally, the professor went very fast while teaching and did not stop to explain much.",
    "It was really interesting, but it was also by far the most work that I had for any of my classes this semester, especially at the beginning. I also thought that although it was really cool, it was unclear at the beginning of the year the extent to which it really depended on being taken as a full year sequence, rather than as being easily droppable after the first term. It seems like stopping now would be difficult as it would not have fully covered any portion of the class, eg. we have yet to talk about integrals at all yet. The teaching was fantastic though, and I was a huge fan of stefan, whenever we had subs, there was a noticable drop in the engagement level of the class, just because stefan was so fantastic.",
    "For strengths, there was a lot of support for reviewing material if need be. Although it was a large class, however, it felt fairly seminar-esque and allowed us all to ask questions freely. And it was taught from a point of view that did not require a lot of background knowledge. Weaknesses: it had to cater to all sorts of levels making the difficulty of the exam not at all representative of the material taught in class. Material was a little bit disorganized as there were different substitutes with different styles of teaching when the professor was busy.",
    "This class is very good. Difficult psets, but there is a lot of support available through peer tutors, the TF, and office hours.",
    "Stefan is amazing! He is a very dynamic lecturer, and his explanations are usually clear. The material is also fairly interesting. One weakness of the class is that there isn't a clear trajectory for the course--it often feels like what we do one day has no bearing on what we do the next.",
    "Materials are covered too fast, without suitable supplementary lecture notes. Explanations are sometimes unclear.",
    "Stefan is the best teacher I have had - seriously. That said, the few substitute professors we had were particularly unengaging and difficult to follow. At times, even Stefan can move too quickly or gloss over important information he believes to be obvious (but for us mortals simply isn't). This course could be improved with a better textbook (one that we follow directly) and a clearer curriculum.",
    "In terms of the strengths, I think the basic content of the class was intriguing, and it did expand my knowledge of vector calculus and linear algebra. Some of the problems on the problem sets did push me to think about math in a new way and yielded very interesting results. I also did like the collaborative aspect with the peer- review\/tutoring sessions although I think at times it was difficult with the peer-tutors not wanting to give too much away while trying to help you (i.e. sometimes, they would just stop giving hints which made solving the problems very difficult\/frustrating at that point). However, I saw many weaknesses in the class and the way it was taught: 1) The class felt very disorganized in terms of its content. I felt like I missed many of the beautiful interconnections between multivariable calculus and linear algebra simply as the class jumped around a lot. For instance, we only partially addressed change of basis\/eigenvalues\/determinants, we covered Newton's method despite its lack of relevance to a lot of other material we were learning, etc. This ended up making the course feel like a miscellaneous hodgepodge of topics rather than unifying them in my mind. 2) The professor was often very absent in the class. I estimate that all in all, he probably missed 4-5 weeks of class. This was very disappointing as we had miscellaneous substitute graduate students and post-docs in his place with various levels of teaching ability (some read directly out of the book or really struggled with conveying the content). Again, this also led to the disconnected feeling of the class as each substitute assumed different levels of background knowledge (ie some pitched the class too high) and covered material in a different way (ie some dealt with material we weren't yet meant to know; whereas, others readdressed material we'd already done). 3) When the professor was there, I felt like he often went too quickly for me to truly understand the course material. More time just introducing the idea of proofs at the beginning of the course would have been helpful. And, then, during the course itself, I really wish he would have just slowed down, given more motivating examples, and spent some more time showing how each topic connects to the next (rather than just throwing in more miscellaneous material). While some of the tangents were interesting, I would have preferred that we had not covered them and had stuck more directly to the book as it would have been so much easier to follow. I often understood the first portion of what he was doing but left the class feeling very confused\/lost and having to teach myself from the book. 4) The workload is astronomically high unless you have already seen the material in a rigorous, proof-based format before. I worked on my problem sets throughout the entire week and still often found I had to stay up all (or almost all) Thursday night in order to get them finished. I think this course made me realize that theoretical, proof-based math really isn't for me, so I would advise absolutely making sure that this is what you want to commit yourself to before taking the course as it will be a huge time investment (unless of course you've already done a lot of proofs before in which case it may be easier for you). Also, workload isn't really spread out evenly, so some problem sets were significantly longer or more difficult than others (although I wouldn't say any were easy). 5) Problem set grading I would say was relatively fair\/reasonable (although sometimes felt a little arbitrary). However, I personally really didn't like the exam format. The final felt more fair, but the two midterms featured 5 multiple choice and three short-form proofs. The multiple choice counted so much (8 points each) that making even one mistake there would signifcantly drop your grade. I would rather have had a longer exam which featured fewer multiple choice or have had that section count for less.",
    "I really enjoyed the course and got a lot out of it. The content was obviously stellar as was the instructor, the problem sets and the peer tutoring system. I can't think of how I'd improve the course. I feel like this is the way calculus should be taught to a wider audience. I wonder if continuing to make the class slightly easier (as I think has been the trend?) will make it accessible to more people.",
    "Strengths: All of the challenge a freshman could want in a math class; interesting and broad scope of material. Weaknesses: Harder than it needs to be; a lot of work; the p-sets don't necessarily reinforce the concepts discussed in class making them feel like excessive work.",
    "This course contains a lot of new information, and the tasks it teaches are somewhat abstract and difficult to teach, but even so, I think that it did the best it could to instill in us the kind of intuition needed for a mathematical proof.",
    "This class needs to be improved. Steps are being taken in the right direction, so I'll highlight those first. I applaud the vast amount of resources available to students for this class: office hours and the TF are very valuable. But the most indispensable thing about this class is the Peer Tutor program: this NEEDS to be kept. First of all, the homework. It is unreasonable to ask for 30+ hours per assignment per week for an introductory math course. Furthermore, the topics covered on the homework need to be directly relevant to the title of the course \"Introduction to Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus.\" Overall, we only received a handful of homework problems relating to these concepts, the majority of problems covered advanced topics that the professor found interesting. The textbook. The textbook that has been used for this historically is garbage. It is poorly written, admitted by the professor himself. Lectures also need to be more focused on the topic at hand, sometimes it feels we jump randomly and freely about multiple topics, seemingly starting one thing and then never finishing it. In additions most topics covered in this semester rarely related to the topics in the course. WE talked about linear algebra for all of about 3 lectures while topology and real analysis, topics not covered in the class description, took up about 3 times as long to discuss.",
    "Strengths: Stefan is an absolute legend! I really appreciated his dedication and wealth of knowledge used to teach the course. Similarly, the abundance of extra help was of massive help; I have visited Alex, the peer tutors, and Stefan's office hours, and I can confirm that every visit helped me discover some useful tip for a specific pset or some overarching advice for my approach and philosophy to math in general. I truly feel like I've learned much from this class and am gracious for such a fantastic semester of mathematical inquiry. Weaknesses: Some aspects of the material I comprehend with a little more confusion that others. I would have appreciated more in-class examples - oftentimes, students in the class aren't willing to ask questions, since comprehension of material (especially mathematics learned so quickly in a 50 minute class time) is generally done that night with textbook reading and reviewing notes. Stefan did often mention this strategy in class (in accompaniment with candelight and soft music haha), so some confusion in class was to be expected. However, sometimes small calculations such as finding the span and range of a matrix for example could be a little misunderstood. Perhaps a useful addition to the psets would be a section on simple calculations such as these that would only add a little to the workload but offer a clearer fundamental understanding.",
    "This course could've been improved with a more reliable textbook and better lectures. Stefan is a great teacher and incredibly smart, but when he teaches he sometimes leaves the class behind, making it hard to keep up."

    "I would recommend this course if you are planning on being a math or STEM major, because the rigor is difficult yes, but this class is a must to accessing higher-level math classes.",
    "This is a great introduction to linear algebra and proof based math in general, but it's extremely hard and probably isn't a good idea to take unless you really like math and have the time for it.",
    "I would recommend this course if the student had a lot of time to study the specifics of each topic and complete the p-sets alone. Doing the p-sets alone is the only way to pass this class with the current lack of clarity in curriculum. If this were to be changed, this may not be as necessary, and I would recommend the class to most STEM students.",
    "Absolutely. Learning proof-based mathematics is, I believe, a valuable endeavor for anyone.",
    "If you want to challenge yourself, and don't necessarily care about your grade, I recommend this course for you. If you just want to be able to DO Linear and Multi, and care about your grade, you will be better served by a different course.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who loves math and is willing to spend a lot of time on it.",
    "Take this class if you are serious about math. There is a lot of work to do with the class, but it's absolutely amazing if you are interested in it. The problem sets are difficult and very time-consuming, but the exams are very fair and not too difficult.",
    "If you really enjoy math or logic (and have free time to do the long, long problem sets), consider taking this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in theoretical mathematics and who want a more rigorous understanding of vector calculus\/linear algebra.",
    "Absolutely! Excellent first year course for anyone who is really interested in mathematics. Covers topics in calculus and linear algebra, which even if familiar, are seen in a new light after the course. Another huge part of the course are proofs, which give you a new insight into mathematics. The homework takes a lot of time, however if you are well organized and find a routine that works for you it is a great part of the course and a perfect way to stay on track with the material taught in class. Also there are many great resources to help you with the course material: office hours, TA sessions and great peer tutors.",
    "Yes! If you love math, take this course.",
    "If one is a math major.",
    "Yes! If you liked math in high school and want an introduction to \"real mathematics,\" take this course!! I knew many people who took it despite not being potential math majors (comp sci, sciences, even a couple people in DS) and they all did fine. I didn't find it overly difficult, although I acknowledge if you've never seen proofs or this side of math it might be hard. In that case, there is a lot of camaraderie and people to complain to! Peer tutors are also helpful and you will definitely learn a lot! You will be fine",
    "I absolutely would, provided they understand this is a tough math class with long problem sets and high expectations. That said, Stefan is very fair and understanding, and the learning really is incredible.",
    "Yes! Definitely! I also recommend taking it credit\/D\/fail if your potential major allows it. This class would've been more enjoyable for me if I wasn't worrying about my grade.",
    "This course definitely is not for everybody but I think it really challenged me and helped me grow as a student.",
    "Definitely recommend, Stefan was a really funny Professor, the material is very interesting. It can be scary at first, but things is doable!",
    "Yes; great professor with a rigorous curriculum.",
    "Yes - if you're looking for a challenge, and a course around which there is a fairly strong support network (peer tutors) and community (other students interested in math), this course is quite good. The PSETs will certainly challenge you, and are definitely worth spending a fair bit of time to slowly work through and synthesize the topics. Would recommend reading the textbook and referencing external resources (such as the Shifrin online lectures), as sometimes the topics are presented in a way that seems to assume some prior knowledge.",
    "I definitely think this is the best first year math course to take at Yale for someone with a background in multivariable calculus.",
    "If a student is a math major, they should absolutely consider taking this course. I do warn, however, that if the student does not have mathematical background outside of the regular high school experience, especially with proofs, this class may be too difficult. They say that a knowledge of multivariable calculus is strongly recommended for this class, but I did not find this to be true. Instead, I think a student that has completed Calculus BC and thoroughly understands the concept of a mathematical proof. If so, I would definitely recommend this course because it would be highly rewarding and interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to any students who lack formal experience with writing proofs and want a math class where they can learn these skills.",
    "I would, if the student is prepared to work a lot and learn a lot and not necessarily have it reflected by their grades. If you like math, take this class, probably.",
    "If you have experience with multi\/linear, I would take this instead of retaking the standard multivariable class.",
    "Math 230 is challenging. You will struggle a lot; you will learn a lot. Take it if you want to experience a huge learning curve your first semester at Yale and have a proper foundation in proof-based math. I found the textbook to be unnecessary given Stefan's style of teaching; Giulio Tiozzo's past lecture notes (you can find them online) were a great resource, as were the student tutors.",
    "Yes",
    "If you're interested in learning about math at a much deeper level than just formulas, take this class! It's difficult and takes a lot of time, but the course teaches a lot of material at a very rigorous level.",
    "Yes, if the student is legitimately interested in majoring in a STEM field. However, the class is by no means orientated towards students who want to lightly explore advanced math.",
    "Yes, it is a very good course for learning linear algebra and multivariable calculus, and is very beneficial especially for math majors.",
    "Yes, I will. Very good introduction to mathematics analysis, but only suitable for students who actually love math.",
    "My recommendation would depend upon who is teaching the course and whether or not the student feels as though textbooks are necessary tools in learning material",
    "Yes definitely, but they would have to be really prepared to put in the sheer number of hours that it takes to get everything that there is out of the class. Beyond that it was fantastic and everyone should take it.",
    "Yes! It's a great intro math course that really goes deep into simples concepts. It may seem random, but it is very interesting and allows one to find which parts of math are most interesting to them. Also because of the difficulty it facilitates student bonding and although it can be stressful it teaches you the importance of understanding and learning over that of grades.",
    "Yes; especially if you are looking to be a math major, I would highly recommend this class. It's very challenging, but at the same time very rewarding.",
    "Yes, take this course if Stefan is teaching it!",
    "Intellectually challenging and ultimately rewarding. Try it, especially with Directed Studies. You will learn a lot.",
    "Yes, but only if they are very serious about pursuing mathematics. This course is intense (as it was designed) and should not be underestimated. I had that mindset going in and it helped me through the course.",
    "As it stands now, I can't say I would recommend this course to another student. If you're just starting to engage in rigorous, proof-based math, it will literally dominate your entire life. And, even if you have a passion for math, I'm still not sure I could recommend it as due to its disorganization and speed, your grasp of the material may well end up somewhat shaky even at the end of the course (I felt as though I had to learn concepts well enough to pass the exams\/problem sets but still don't feel completely confident in the material due to its teaching). My best recommendation would be to take something like Math 225 (the slightly more rigorously-based linear algebra) or Math 250 (which covers some of the material from this class and Math 231 in one semester). If you've seen many proofs before\/these topics at a proof-based level, then there's a chance you could skip this class and go straight to something like Math 350 (I had some friends who did this and were fine in 350). I think that there probably is a target audience for this class but think I'd hesitate to recommend it right now due to the course's flaws. I think 230 will get a new instructor next year though, so, hopefully, many of these problems will be resolved.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to anyone who has any interest in math. With a topics so fundamental it seems worthwhile to learn them with a bit of depth. I think having learnt some calculus in this way I've gotten a much better intuitive grasp of it, and will probably retain the material for much longer than if I had taken a class focused more on methods and application. Maybe the difficulty of the class depends on the instructor--so I'd shop it and an alternative before committing. Stefan is obviously a stellar instructor. His lectures are a trip.",
    "If a student wants to skip MATH 120 as a freshman, I'd honestly point them to MATH 222 or 225 instead of 230. I think 230 is a bit overkill and is harder than it needs to be.",
    "Yes, I would, because although it is difficult it is still a rewarding experience.",
    "You only get as much from this course as the time you put into it, i.e. working on the psets, which are designed to be time-consuming. I would only recommend the course to students that are serious about majoring in math or derive significant satisfaction from it because the opportunity cost is definitely nontrivial.",
    "Take this course ONLY if you are very seriously intending to pursue a math major. If you are on the fence about majoring in math, don't take this course. If you're like me and taking 230 as the co-req for PHYS 260, take MATH 222 and then 250 instead.",
    "I would only recommend this course to math majors, and to a smaller extent, physics and math\/econ majors. The course work is rather difficult (as to be expected from an accelerated course), and the class should be expected to be challenging even for students who were top-notch mathematicians in their high schools.",
    "Yes only if you really love math and want to become a math major. Then yes definitely. If not, then this class isn't probably the one for you. I'm a prospective economics and math major, and even though this course isn't required by the major, it has made me a much greater mathematician, which has made me a much greater economist."
