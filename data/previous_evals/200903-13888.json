    "A decent intro to stats with a nice teacher. It will teach you the tools to go use stats in your own research and areas of interest. If you need to learn stats at Yale this is the way to go.",
    "see question 1.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. The material was provided in an easily digestable way with a variety of practical and occasionally entertaining examples. JDRS was warm and funny and available, TAs were helpful, problem sets were straightforward. I was always impressed by the speed and thoroughness of email responses from JDRS and the TAs.",
    "This is definitely the most painless way to get through a statistics requirement, whether you are a grad student or an undergrad. JDRS' enthusiasm for his subject is contagious and he emphasizes understanding rather than memorization of formulas.",
    "Good way to get rid of a stat requirement. Easy."

    "I will use the statistical basics that I learned in this course for my own research (and have already started to use them). Stats is absolutely necessary for an understanding of ecology so even though it didn't come that easily I know that it is important to learn and I will keep taking it next semester as well.",
    "Definitely makes more sense within the context of more specific disclipines, but a good intro course and makes me feel like I could conduct experiments appropriately"
