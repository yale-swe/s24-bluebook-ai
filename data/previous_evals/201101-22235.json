   "comments": [
    "Fun, light-hearted, interesting. Not a lot of work, take from it what you put into it.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wishes to explore how certain censored ideas can be expressed through film and to anyone who is interested in the development and effects of communism in Eastern Europe. The one thing to keep in mind is to not underestimate the amount of time you need to spend actually watching these movies - especially as they are foreign and you will need to visit the film studies center a bit.",
    "I would totally recommend this class to another student because the films are really great and even more importantly, Professor Illakowicz is AMAZING.",
    "The political and historical effects of communism in poland on the creation, distribution, and material of films.",
    "Interesting class. Prof is awesome. Lots of film viewing outside of class but take it anyway.",
    "Definitely. This class is very relaxed but educational. There are a lot of films that are a little wacky but it's something you would otherwise not be exposed to. There are two papers (~8pages and 10 pages) and several film responses but the professor is extremely nice and the atmosphere is very chill.",
    "Overall, I thought this was a great course. It provided an interesting and insightful look into the history and culture of Poland during the post WWII era. Krystyna is a great teacher, very knowledgeable, and made the class enjoyable. The workload is definitely manageable.",
    "Definitely take this. Professor is wonderful, material is interesting, not a huge time commitment.",
    "Yes. I would strongly recommend the class to my fellow students. It gives a wonderful opportunity to learn more about Poland in communism that lasted in Europe almost half a century.",
    "Definitely take this class. Not a lot of work, but you will learn a lot."
