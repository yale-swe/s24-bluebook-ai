   "comments": [
    "Through taking this course, I learned how to analyze philosophical texts for the first time. I also further developed my writing skills by learning how to write philosophy papers. They were completely different from any genre that I had ever written, so it was definitely an experience for me. I am also a relatively introverted person, so partaking in section discussions helped me to develop my public speaking skills.",
    "- How to parse through very detailed and nonlinear arguments and make them simple and linear - How to be okay with not understanding the first (few) times - The importance of listening to your classmates - How I want to evaluate whether a philosophical question is important to me",
    "This course thought me to do detailed analysis of extremely dense materials. The process of working to understand an initially confusing philosopher is a rewarding one.",
    "This course was fantastic, and I learned a lot about how to think as well as write. Through connecting different philosophical texts, my critical thinking skills definitely improved.",
    "I had no experience with philosophy before taking this course. I gained a solid basic understanding of the project and process of philosophical thought. More importantly, I learned how to write philosophical analysis. It turns out that skill is a useful one in other fields, too, because it requires you to communicate clearly and simply rather than vaguely and impressionistically; for that reason it gave me a good bridge between high school bullshitting and college actual-writing.",
    "I'm not too sure about how much I learned from this course. I just don't think philosophy is suited for me. Throughout the class, I found the majority of the readings to be unnecessarily verbose. We spent more time deciphering the author was trying to say than breaking down his argumentation, which I found to be problematic. Consequently, it was difficult to maintain interest. With that being said, there are still some things I was able to take away from this course. This course does a good job in making you think about your own life. Even if you don't agree with the arguments of the philosophers, you will still reflect upon your own life, and whether being a \"skeptic\" would make you happier, or if there are other means of attaining the good life, being that there is one in the first place. The study of philosophy has not really convinced me of anything and the texts themselves have not changed my life a meaningful way, but the introspection brought about by the texts has been valuable.",
    "This course was a fantastic history of Western Philosophy survey. Over the course of the semester, I developed an appreciation for Philosophy, having known very little about what Philosophy actually was before taking this course. Though hard to define, it is a field engaged with the presentation and argumentation of thoughts; I learned how to break complicated ideas down and discover underlying assumptions present in complex arguments. This course also gave me ample opportunity to develop my writing skills, with 3 essays over the course of the term and helpful, constructive feedback on each paper.",
    "Being able to discuss with critical and charitable anlayses, the ideas of philosophers of the past. I was also better able to integrate the use of metaphors or analogies effectively into an academic analysis and examination of philosophical ideas.",
    "I learned how to carefully analyze philosophers' arguments, present them in writing in my own words, and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments and the way in which they were argued. I learned to write a philosophy paper and present my ideas in a more clear, coherent way.",
    "How to think about and write about philosophy, a broad understanding of early philosophical modes of thinking et cetera, plus improving my writing.",
    "Critical thinking and problem solving skills, including counterpoint."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think a major strength of this course is that you are given the opportunity to read so many texts and engage in meaningful discussion. The writing practice was also extremely valuable. I would say that the biggest weakness of the class was having to move through the texts so quickly. Everything was very rushed, and it was hard to take in everything from the text.",
    "Strengths: - Francey is an inspiration as an individual, she is thoughtful and so engaged. She is also accessible. Weaknesses: Discussion was not well lead, or really lead at all for that matter. Some voices dominated too much and others got far too sidetracked without any type of regulation. We also simply didn't cover a lot of the material that was assigned largely due to inefficiency. Time could have been kept track of better.",
    "This applies to DS in general: while there is tons of reading, the program couldn't really be structured in any other way. We discuss all of the works, but I would have liked to talk about them in much more detail.",
    "This curriculum is well-structured and its trajectory makes good sense. I wouldn't change the way the course is structured.",
    "I found that the most difficult hurdle to reading philosophy, which I never quite was able to get over, is the ability to read the text itself. Because the language is so difficult to read, and because we are required to read significant portions of texts throughout the week, I found myself overwhelmed by the DS texts, philosophy in particular, because the more time I spent reading thoroughly, the more likely I would not finish all the texts. Because of this, I ended up skimming philosophy texts that already made no sense to me, and by the time I came into class, I would have already forgotten the large majority of the text. This class can be made better by either spending a couple weeks initially teaching the students how to break down the passages so that they can read quicker and more thoroughly later on or go through less course material so the students can spend more time reading a small amount of text instead of skimming a large amount of text. This way, we develop skills to read philosophy, instead of leaving the course with only a surface level understanding. Moreover, I'd like to focus more on breaking down the arguments into steps within this course, instead of arguing over the definition of Socrates' \"virtue.\" Like, if we can't even agree on the definition of the most backbone element of the text, \"virtue\", then how can this text be valuable? It'd be nice if we spent less time on definitions and more on arguments.",
    "This course has a very audacious syllabus, including readings from 13 authors over 14 weeks. It can feel like a race at times, and it's often frustrating to not dig as deeply into the text as one would like, or to run out of time in a discussion when there are still major unresolved issues on the table. Despite this problem, which is perhaps the biggest downside of any DS course, it is not entirely a bad thing; moving so quickly teaches the active student how to more swiftly pinpoint important information and leads to faster and clearer thinking and communication.",
    "Strengths: We covered a large number of readers and philosophers in a short period of time, which is impressive. Weaknesses: I do not know a single classmate who completed the entirety of each reading. I have heard that the purpose of college readings isn't to finish every single assignment, but I feel like that takes away from my understanding if I'm just struggling to make it through without having a chance to really reflect on what I'm reading, especially if we're spending only one class or half a class on a lengthy reading."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to a student who likes philosophy, loves to read, and is willing to take on an intense work load.",
    "Yes.",
    "If a student wanted to overcome an intellectual challenge in every night's reading, I would highly recommend this course. The assignments, discusssions, and papers all home critical thinking skills.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone interested in improving her writing or critical thinking skills.",
    "It's good to have philosophical weapons in your arsenal when you want to analyze any kind of writing in the humanities. This is a really useful course to have taken.",
    "DS is interesting in the sense that I don't think you'll get a very thorough understanding of the texts you read, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. DS is more focused on the evolution of the canon, and by essentially skimming through the entire canon, you start seeing patterns and development that evolve from prior authors and their ideas. As these ideas become more fleshed out, you gain greater interest in these ideas and understanding of how these ideas came to be. For philosophy, if you're looking to get really in depth with the field of study, this probably isn't for you. Take some other course that focuses exclusively on one author or one text throughout the semester, and you'll probably learn more. Instead, this course will foster a life-long love of philosophy, and will probably inspire you to want to learn more. Long-term, you'll be learning the most, as you will have a strong understanding of the history of the field that will contribute to your understanding of philosophy.",
    "This course is fantastic! Plain and simple. Although of the three DS courses, the Philosophy curriculum is probably the most unfamiliar the average high school student, I would not let this dissuade you from taking DS. I found the authors of this course to be the most interesting, and the writing to be both the most interesting and the most enjoyable. Even if you, as I did, knew nothing about Philosophy, don't fear! These instructors are incredible, and the lectures are amazing.",
    "The philosophy course was a great introduction to modern thought today, to analyze how our world has been shaped by the thinkers of the past. Be it for the content or the skills learnt throughout the course, DS philosophy would prove useful for any first year student embarking on their college studies.",
    "Yes. As my introduction to philosophy this course was pretty difficult. I had never read ancient texts like these or been asked to think in the logical step-wise way to approach philosophical arguments before. Given that the texts seemed so far removed from the present day in both language and subject matter, I would recommend this philosophy course to people who have engaged with a similar subject before and want to expand their horizons. Starting off with this as my first philosophy course was a little bit challenging.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, although it could be overwhelming at times given the difficulty of some readings."
