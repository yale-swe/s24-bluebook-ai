    "An okay class. While it covered a lot of interesting material, Prof Klein's very obvious political bias almost always got in the way of the actual issues we were learning about. It made me wonder what she was leaving out so that American history would fit her portrayal of the underdogs exploited by the elites. It was alos annoying that there were no visual aids given how lacking in structure the lectures were.",
    "Great course on the last 70 years of US history. Really makes you think about how this country was created, the way public opinion forms, the effect of foreign policy on domestic policy and vice versa, and who was left out or suffered because of the progress made during this time. This course really corrects the glorified narrative of US history taught in grade school\/high school US history course.",
    "An average American hist class. I personally wouldn't take it again...",
    "This is a great class. The time period and focus of the class could not be more important for putting contemporary issues in context and looking for possible solutions. Find out why the US is what it is today.",
    "A slightly polemical perspective of recent American history. I'm glad I took it, it definitely has given me some things to think about.",
    "I really struggled to rate this course, because I feel so different about each of its aspects. The highlight was definitely the document-driven coursework: from 1950s McCarthy hearings to 1960s secret cables about Vietnam to 1980s writings by key founders of the New Right, the coursework covered the post-WWII era with a level of vividness and detail that I could never have gotten out of a textbook.Lecture, on the other hand, was - in a word - horrific. \"Many are the crimes,\" so I will list only the most salient:1. Tone. Professor Klein seems to be reading from a 200-page overview of post-WWII American history, written in a stilted, quasi-academic style. (Example: the phrase \"He offers a jeremiad against...\" definitely cropped up two or three times throughout the course of the semester.) She also stops lecture at random points for questions that are either painfully open-ended (\"What sorts of jobs provide services to those who work in the financial sector?\") or excruciatingly rhetorical (\"Who was excluded from this program\/new prosperity\/etc?\" Answer: anyone who wasn't a white male).2. Cohesion. Now imagine that the 200-page overview, unbound, fell to the ground and there were no page numbers. It's not quite as bad as that, but there's a definite problem with chronology, and even when she is explaining a theme (e.g., the development of the women's movement), Professor Klein will go from 1964 to 1966to 1962 as if this were natural narrative style. This is even more of a problem given that anyone who hasn't already brushed up on their recent American history really needs the lectures to provide a broad overview\/framework for a given era to anchor the document-driven (and thus very specific) reading.3. Bias. I have no problem with professors teaching what they believe to be the truth, and Professor Klein did provide us with some documents written by conservatives. That said, everything outside the documents - the \"overview\/framework\" with which she wanted us to view them - came from a liberal, labor-oriented, even radical perspective. This was especially confusing and difficult to deal with given the problem of lecture cohesion; I often found myself wondering whether the professor was avoiding a chronological narrative because it might bring up questions about the validity of her lecture's thesis.4. Luddism. Prof Klein thinks that instead of \"high-tech,\" we should go \"no-tech.\" Any inclusion of media, which would otherwise be a welcome relief - jazz songs on iTunes, student speeches on YouTube - turns into an unmitigated fiasco, starting with the login screen. On one memorable occasion, she managed to shut the computer down accidentally, thereupon exclaiming, \"But I had four unsaved documents!\"To summarize: If she posts lecture notes (or a transcript; that would probably be fine) and attendance isn't part of the grading rubric, take this class and just skip lecture. If not, and you really like the documents (as I did), take it Credit-D (which I failed to do, to my everlasting regret). If not... take something else.",
    "Very interesting in depth look at American Politics and Society from 1945 to the present. With a focus on individual stories to illustrate larger occurrences and personal testaments. Good overview with especial attention to specific smaller stories. I would recommend taking the class but make sure the lecture style suits you.",
    "It's a great course packed with a lot of information. One learns the most about labor history so that should be a key interest for any possible student. I would recommend.",
    "Definitely",
    "It is a history class about post-world war America. There is a lot of focuson the labor movement but other subjects are covered pretty well. Professor Klein is a great lecturer and the TA were amazing. There is a lot of reading, but they are interesting. Professor Klein makes an argument throughout the whole class that helps to answer how we got to this point politically.",
    "I recommend this course."
