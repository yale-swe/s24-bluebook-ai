    "You read humor essays, analyze them in class, and incorporate some of those elements into your own writing. The flow of work is fairly constant -- reading, one essay per week, humor challenges etc.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It is getting more and more popular each semester though so make sure you attend every class during shopping week!",
    "Writing Humor is a great writing class. More than any other writing class I've taken, Prof Wepler's class has taught me concrete ways to improve my writing overall and make it funnier (ex. to end sentences with the punchline; not to bury it in the middle of the sentence). There's a ton of writing but it's all fun. You'll meet some fun, talented people in the class and spend the semester reading funny things! What is not to like?",
    "You will have something to write every single week for this class, of varying length. Manageably well paced. The first few mini essays were a bumble to the finish but necessary for gaining momentum for the meat of the coursework, in the last three longer essays.",
    "Great class to take anytime. Its a decent amount of work but it doesnt feel like it and you'll come out the other end more aware of your own sense of humor and how to make people laugh.",
    "There is no reason for someone not to take this class. Everyone who took it became a better, funnier, more succinct writer, and there's nothing that beats a class discussion about the benefits of profanity in a piece or different ways to describe a bowel movement in order to generate humor.",
    "Only take this class if you really enjoy writing. Humor writing is actually a really difficult skill to learn and, while it can be fun at times, it can be very frustrating at others. Given the fact that we had an essay due pretty much every week of the semester, you always had to make sure you were in the right mood to write humor at least once a week. The essays were short, but they took a lot of time and having one essay a week, plus a humor challenge, was too much writing for me."
