   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Please be realistic in assigning readings, it was a struggle to read all of them. During he debate, do not address the people as much one on one and allow them to debate each other more??",
    "Its a very interesting subject. I enjoyed it a lot.",
    "Although \"economics\" is the second word in the title of this course, I'm not sure I learned much beyond the basics of a few theories that were hardly ever brought into the context of addiction. Strengths of the course include that looking at addiction through the lenses of economics and public policy can provide valuable insight on issues, but the weaknesses in the mechanics of the course FAR outweighed that strength. Instead of creating units within the class focusing on different addictions (tobacco, alcohol, food, etc.), it would have been far more educational to structure the course based on different principles of economics or public policy, incorporating different addictions along the way. Not sure if it was done the way it was because this is cross-listed as an undergraduate course--if so, then a separate course should be offered, because public health students do not need to have the basic epidemiology of these issues re-hashed at such great detail. Finally, the final project for this course was the most vague assignment I've ever been given. The idea makes sense (to do a project incorporating the three title disciplines of the class), but little instruction was given until after the paper topics had been proposed and presentations were over. More guidance should be given further in advance (not just saying \"some people have shown why Facebook is an addiction or why tanning is an addiction\").",
    "Strengths: This is the only course that focuses on the economics of addictive behaviors. Weaknesses: It is taught poorly. The materials are interesting and engaging so there was so much potential for the class to be fun and exciting. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the opposite. The unprofessional teaching style, lack of preparation, and little assignments that do not enhance the learning experience are all examples of factors that made this course disappointingly unenjoyable. Surprisingly for a course that has been taught in previous years, the structure and organization of in-class debates were messy and time-consuming that they lost their purpose by the end. The assignments, again, were so small and petty in way that made me feel like I was back in high school just trying to get the right answers and move on without fully understanding the purpose or the takeaways from them. Perhaps it was because the course was cross-listed as an undergraduate course, which if that were the case, it is unfair for graduate students who are taking the time out of their professional lives to enhance their education. Moving forward, I strongly recommend upgrading this course to match the level at which graduate students are expected to and do perform, or just making this an undergraduate course and keep everything the same.",
    "For the 'debates' we should have been assigned or chosen our position ahead of time in order to prepare. The learning in this course is very self-directed. It would benefit from additional readings --especially regarding economics. Besides readings there was no economics taught whatsoever nor was there any examples of 'policy analysis' and those were two things I was hoping to learn more about in this class."

    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Interesting, and collaborative",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0This was my favorite class this semester. The topic is really interesting and I think the teacher does a good job at fostering discussion and making lectures interactive.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Drastically oversimplified the issues being discussed, sometimes presented false information, and forced discussion in ways that did not promote learning at all. Her teaching felt disorganized and really forced. To be fair, she tried to present discussion questions to the class. To improve, maybe she should talk to other faculty (or Kiersten, who did a great job leading an obesity discussion) about how to phrase questions to really prompt debate. Exercises that require students to debate a viewpoint that they do not hold (such as the legal drinking age debate) are not helpful to learning and probably should be dropped.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Strengths: Professor seems to care about the topics covered in class. Weaknesses: She is grossly unprepared for lectures. Every lecture she would repeat \"I should know this but I don't\" multiple times and flips through pages of notes looking for different things she wants to cover. I don't expect her to know everything by memory, but some things that she doesn't know are factoids that I would expect any expert in tobacco and alcohol abuse to know, such as prevalence of smoking in the US. These actions do not convince me that professor remotely cares about the class. Again, I understand that she could have been busy with her research and other appointments outside of the classroom, but teaching is still part of her responsibility and unfortunately, she didn't fulfill that role. Moreover, I would caution the professor to be more sensitive and discreet about what she says during class. I personally was not offended by anything but some of her comments could be interpreted in an unintended way, particularly given that we discuss about sensitive issues, such as drinking, using drugs, overeating, etc. For example, when we were talking about alcohol policies, she mentioned that she doesn't drink and so does not fully understand why people in Russia prefer to drink vodka instead of less alcoholic beer. The crucial point that she seemed to have missed is that vodka is a cultural drink, not necessarily chosen by rational choice. Similarly, when we were talking about obesity, she made a comment along the same line about the behaviors of obese individuals and how she does or does not act the same way. As an expert in addictive behaviors, she should be more careful about how she words her ideas and opinions.",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Great professor!!! An expert of the topic and very passionate about it",
    "Instructor: Jody Sindelar \u00a0Great professor, very considerate and made material interesting through class discussions."
