    "A bit surreal, sometimes. Classes meet in Professor Bloom's living room. Still reads poetry with both skill and deep passion -- he had memorized most poems we discussed. Don't expect to do a lot of talking, though, and be ready to be called on without warning on occasion. Really wants to get to know his students, enjoys visits on weekends. Virtually no homework. Take it for the experience, if, like me, you were always curious."
