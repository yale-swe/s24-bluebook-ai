   "comments": [
    "I would be hesitant to recommend BIOL 101 for students who have not had prior biology experience and to those who do not need it as a prereq since it can be rather stressful to learn all the material.However, I don't think any professor can teach it as well as Koleske.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it, it is your run-of-the-mill intro bio course.",
    "If you don't really have a love for science, don't take the course. It feels like a weed out course and honestly felt a little like a waste of 75 minutes twice a week when I could be doing work for some other class or studying something that might be a little more engaging. Not a great subject to have a lecture class, but I realize that it has to be a lecture.",
    "BIOL 101 is a very general summary of the basic concepts of biochemistry and biophysics. I would recommend it to those wishing to gain a basic understanding of how chemical and physical processes work in life.",
    "Biology 101 is pretty fast-paced, especially if you did take AP Bio in high school. The lectures can feel pretty long at times. The homework assignments are pretty easy, but the quizzes get progressively harder. I recommend signing up for enrichment in order to do well in the course. The curve for 101 is not that hard, but there is a lot of information that you're expected to know.",
    "If you're premed, BIOL 101 is a must-take, anyway. It will not be a detriment in your life, although I would be prepared for keeping up with the weekly assignments\/quizzes. This class is very handleable. As for non pre-meds, the material and lectures are interesting enough to be worth it, if you like biology. :)",
    "Definitely. If you took AP Bio in high school this class is relatively easy and interesting.",
    "Bio 101 is quite a bit of work. Remember that the lecture is most important to understand. Then comes the textbook reading. If you have a PDF copy of the textbook, use it and PRINT OUT THE TEXTBOOK PAGES! That way, you can annotate the Sadava readings and really get the most out of the material. Later on in the course, the readings will be scattered all over the place, so if you also know how to split\/merge pdfs together, you'll be able to create a separate packet of sadava readings per lecture.",
    "I would only recommend the class if required. There's nothing bad about it, but it's not good enough to take for no reason.",
    "This is not an easy science course if that's what you're looking for. That said, if you want to go into further bio this is a great introduction.",
    "Yes i would.",
    "Yes I would recommend because this is a pre-requisite for many majors.",
    "BIO 101 is essentially a very fast and perhaps too specific version of AP biology. It's challenging because so much material is taught in so little time, but I don't really see any other way to modify the curriculum to make it easier to learn. Introductory courses are never very exciting.",
    "BIOL 101 is a very standard overview of biochem and biophysics (honestly I don't know what biophysics is I feel like this is barely touched on) and if you excel in chemistry or took AP Bio in high school its a very easy and rewarding class. 100% take this with Koleske, he was great and made this a must take class. Especially because he connected it to immunology and epidemiology which are extremely interesting and important topics. Particularly if your pre med this class is not only required but interesting, as it does have a lot of real applications.",
    "It was a decent class, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to take it-- for prerequisites or premed. Weekly quizzes and HW are kind of a hassle, but manageable. If you're a non-STEM major looking for a Sc credit, I wouldn't pick the bio modules.",
    "A decent intro module. I took AP Bio around 3 years ago, and barely learned anything new in this course.",
    "It's a good introduction to biology and makes you want to delve further into the subject.",
    "A good introduction to biology, although a class that necessitates having already taken AP Biology. I would recommend to another student.",
    "It is a very informative and great class that is a good review\/follow up to Biology AP.",
    "I didn't expect it to be difficult, but it was. Be careful on quizzes and always ask questions to your peers or professors or TAs. I would only recommend this course if you need it for your major.",
    "Biol 101 is a solid intro course if somebody needs background in Biology for further coursework. However, I would only recommend it if it is required as a stepping stone for further courses they plan to take.",
    "BIOL 101 is a standard intro bio course. If you plan on majoring in a life sciences field, you'll need to take the bio sequence, and I'd recommend starting it as soon as possible. If you took advanced bio in high school, the material is pretty easy, but it's a good refresher before any upper level bio class. Even if you aren't looking into any STEM fields at all, it'd be an interesting intro-level science course if you're looking to try something new or earn an Sc credit. Weekly quizzes are weighted higher than the final exam, so that makes it a lot less stressful when you have other midterm exams to study for. You'll already have been tested on all the content prior to to the final, so it ends up being the least stressful final ever. Prof Koleske tries to keep lectures entertaining and interactive, so you won't be too bored during lecture, but everything you need to know is technically on the online lecture notes.",
    "BIOL 101 is a lot of work, but worth taking. I really enjoyed the class.",
    "It's a fantastic intro course. Whether or not you think you can opt out of the first sequence because of having taken AP\/IB Biology in high school, you shouldn't. This class is an essential taste of real world biology in terms of learning about research, scientific papers, and how to learn biology, in general.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would recommend BOL 101 to another student. I really enjoyed the course but I would emphasize the importance of understanding concepts, not merely memorizing.",
    "BIOL 101 is a great introductory course that covers the basics of biology in terms of the chemistry and physics used to study biology. I definitely recommend BIOL 101. Both the professor and teaching fellows were incredible, and it was a very enjoyable class.",
    "Bio 101 is a good introduction to the science and in general the sciences at Yale. It is not a hard class, but certain aspects are challenging.",
    "It's a standard biology class. It's not a fun class, but it's usually required for pre-meds and other majors.",
    "Koleske is fantastic, and the workload is very very manageable. The grading is a bit pedantic on the quizzes , but overall you know exactly what to expect. My biggest beef with the class would be that I think it should be easier to skip out of. There's a huge variety in experience, because people who have years of bio under their belt are in the same class as someone who's never touched the stuff. The class has enrichment to account for that difference, and is very conscious of what they've done and do their best to accommodate everyone, and it makes it an easy class if you've had AP Bio. It just felt a bit like a waste of time. But by all means, take it with Koleske if you have a choice--he really cares about the students and loves teaching the class. Also it's not a class you really have to stress over, because weekly quizzes (with one quiz and one homework dropped) means that you stay on top of the material but have space to mess up. A gentle introduction to biology.",
    "Must take -- but only because you literally must take it. Low workload, fair grading (one dropped homework and quiz out of five). Prepare to be relatively bored but not particularly stressed.",
    "tbh: i saw this course and i thought i'd hit it up. we saw each other mondays and wednesdays, you never let me do any talking but you sometimes had interesting stuff to say. u never check to see if i was keeping up except by quizzing me and asking me for hw. you had some cool stuff to say but i wouldn't see u again unless it was a requirement. u seemed like u had potential and when i see potential i just gotta see it thru. rate: 6\/10",
    "BIOL 101 is an interesting entry level course. Homework and lectures are easy, but timing on quizzes and the final exam make the course more challenging. In addition, assessments get harder as the course progresses, so be sure to do well on the first few. Definitely not a gut class, but not the most time consuming. Even with a strong biology background the course might not be super easy though, as they tend to emphasize very different topics than high school level biology.",
    "BIOL 101 01 is a great class but not easy. It is a class you will have work and have to study on your weekends for Monday quizzes. It is not a hard class and the quizzes\/final is fair.",
    "A solid intro biology course. Engaging material and great teacher. If recommend it even as a standalone class for students who don't need it as a prerequisite.",
    "This course is dangerous. The course is not designed for you to succeed. The administration does not care.",
    "BIOL 101 is the perfect introductory course to biophysics and biochemistry. There are weekly quizzes which help you keep up with the material and one final at the end of the course.",
    "I think the class if very good overall. I definitely learned a lot. The weekly quizzes were hard but fair and they helped me stay on top of studying and managing my learning for the course. It helped me both learn about biochemistry \/ biophysics and think critically about how the topics we are learning could and have been applied in biology. I would definitely recommend this course to someone interested in biology, and, especially if you haven't taken AP biology, you will learn a lot about the field.",
    "I would definitely recommend Biol 101 to a fellow student. I would summarize it as a great introduction to college biology. This class is mainly lecture, with a weekly discussion section, weekly problem sets due and weekly quizzes on the material learned the prior week. There is one main final exam at the end of the course.",
    "I recommend you take this class in conjunction with chemistry. The class is interesting for all science majors. The workload is not too heavy, with weekly quizzes and homeworks that are very manageable. You will have a lot of resources under classes V2, make sure to use them!",
    "BIOL 101 is an excellent class and provides you with a strong foundation in college-level biology. The professors and TAs are all absolutely incredible and are always there to answer your questions and to help you learn to the best of your abilities. The lectures are usually very interesting, as are the discussion sections; however, the assigned readings do get a bit tedious at times. The workload and weekly quizzes are usually very fair and well-explained. Overall, a great course that I thoroughly enjoyed!",
    "A great course for science and non-science majors alike! If you've taken organic chemistry like I have, the first few lectures are definitely a review but the course quickly gets interesting! I never took AP Bio in high school and still found this course very doable. Also taught are the skills required to read a scientific paper, which are crucial to those who want to major in the natural sciences! Prof. Koleske is an engaging lecturer who likes to challenge his students to think outside of the box. The workload is quite manageable. My only advice would be to keep on top of the homework assignments and to not procrastinate on studying for the quizzes. As a prospective MB&B major who also enjoyed chemistry much more than biology, I found that this course had me appreciating biology much more. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "If you took IB Biology, the graph-based interpretation style of learning will take you far in this class. A very interesting course on the basics of Biology, while still challenging in its own ways.",
    "Biol 101 was essentially glorified AP Bio. I would recommend it if you have taken AP or not. It was a good course where you knew what was expected of you.",
    "It's interesting but it's hard. If you don't like bio or need it for the major, I'd probably avoid it if you aren't taking it Credit\/D.",
    "Only if you have to take it. I would not say that the biology sequence is a good introductory course for the non STEM major, considering somewhat stressful fast-paced arrangement. Since the workload and the speed is great, there is a great chance that the student might just end up with an unreasonable hatred toward the subject unless that student has a strong motivation for the subject.",
    "Yes decent basics class.",
    "You need it for pre-med and also it is good to have a basic understanding of biology.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a foundational familiarity with biology. The class reviews over material learned in high school biology and builds upon it well. The pace is not too easy but also not too challenging for someone with some familiarity, but would definitely pose a challenge to anyone new to biology.",
    "Honestly, a painless and often quite interesting class--at least for me. Koleske is a good lecturer and the problem sets were fairly straightforward--quizzes tended to be a bit too long, but served the nice purpose of continuously preparing us for the final.",
    "Koleske can make the material interesting, but you will be around a lot of tunnel-vision pre-meds.",
    "A course designed to give an overview of the fundamental aspects of biochemistry and biology. The course doesn't require too much work outside of class, but be wary of the quizzes. They will ask you to write a lot in a short period of time. I would recommend this course; I learned a lot from just a half semester.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Even if you need a random half science credit, it is a very enjoyable class.",
    "If you're going to take a BIOL course, you're going to need to take this. It's not very difficult, but it's very interesting. I would definitely recommend it, even to non-science majors, as it introduces core concepts that every educated person should know, in a non-threatening and relatively easy way.",
    "Highly enjoyable BIO module. Professor Koleske is a great lecturer and makes material engaging. The study guides posted every night provide an excellent summary of material covered that day, but don't skip lecture - you'll hear great anecdotes that help explain the material better.",
    "Chances are you don't have much choice about whether to take BIOL 101, but I'd definitely recommend Koleske. He's a good lecturer. I really enjoyed this class. There was almost none of the material that was new for me, but it was still interesting and engaging. The assignments were all reasonable, and the class was generally pretty fun. Koleske says the point is to get people excited about biology, and I think he succeeds.",
    "BIOl 101 is a great biology module that reviews AP bio very well.",
    "Yes it is a good into course to other bio classes though I'm not sure it justifies taking the course as a standalone endeavor.",
    "Bio 101 is a required class for many majors, but it is certainly worth taking even if you are considering or vaguely interested in biology. The course is fair, readily accessible, and well taught; I personally would recommend taking this course with Professor Koleske, as he is both engaging and entertaining. I had rather high expectations of this course, and I was pleasantly surprised when they were exceeded.",
    "Obviously, if you're majoring in any biology-related field, you can't really get around taking bio 101. But with that in mind, I think it's a really fun, enjoyable course.",
    "It is a challenging course and you have to stay on top of things to do well (eg summarise what you have learnt in the week every weekend). The content is very interesting",
    "A good review of AP bio that elaborates and enhances on what was taught. Enough of former knowledge tht it wasn't overwhelming, but enough knew information that it wasn't boring. Would recommend.",
    "Bio 101 is a great course with a great professor. It is well-organized and you should definitely take it!",
    "I thought it was a really good course that covered the basics in a fairly engaging and accessible way. It was accessible to me even as a non-bio major who is more humanities-oriented.",
    "For a bio fan, I WAS UNIMPRESSED!.",
    "Introduction to biophysics and biochemistry. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it does require any preparation in biology and includes many interesting topics that help you to understand the fundamental processes and mechanisms of life.",
    "It's alright. Pretty standard introductory biology course. If you took AP, it's almost all review. Not a ton of work either.",
    "It is a fairly interesting class that is useful for getting someone back into the biology frame of mind if they haven't taken a class in it for a couple years. I'd recommend seeing if it possible to place out of it first.",
    "This is a good class to take for an introduction to biology. I would recommend it whether or not it's required of the student.",
    "Total gut. Take it if you need an easy science credit.",
    "Don't unless you have to. Don't unless you want to be surrounded by pesky premeds who freak out at a 99. Don't even go to class, reading the slides is enough.",
    "This course is great for an introductory biochemistry class. It is not too rigorous and moves at a good pace. Most students have already had experience in this subject, but there are opportunities for those that haven't to receive extra instruction. Overall, I would recommend the class even to those who do not plan on pursuing biology.",
    "Hard but good course - take it if you need it for a major or if you're actually interested in the material.",
    "BIOL 101 01 is an introduction to biology and the life sciences here at Yale. I would recommend it to any student interested in biology, medicine, scientific research, or psychology. Grading is fair, organized, and transparent. If you put in the time, you will come out with a respectable grade.",
    "Not too bad. I didn't take AP bio but it was till doable.",
    "Great course, particularly if you get Professor Koleske. Though lectures can be long, he is very good at keeping the material engaging. Try not to let your mind wander; it can be difficult, given the length and size of the class, but staying focused and understanding the information as its presented will make homework and quizzes much easier.",
    "I would recommend this course for sure. For people who are into the sciences or need a science credit. The material is not hard and the curve is generous. Plus you really learn new things and solidify the bio already learned.",
    "I would recommend BIOL 101 if you have to take it as a requirement. However, it can be quiet stressful with the weekly quiz system and such. The material can be interesting but it can also be a bit overwhelming at times.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone unless their major requires biology. This is a bio class for bio majors and the material is pretty dry.",
    "I mean, as far as prereqs go, it's fine, you'll get through it",
    "Take it only if you're premed but it's a very good class",
    "If BIOL 101 is taught by Prof. Koleske, TAKE THE CLASS. He is amazing. Otherwise, I would still recommend the class, especially if you are Pre-Med.",
    "It's a good class, take it with Koleske! The weekly quizzes may get a bit annoying at times, but overall it gives you a very good overview of biochemistry and biophysics.",
    "A good course, I am glad I took it in the spring with Koeleske instead of in the fall. They have it well organized, and most of the questions are well thought out. Except for that one bad quiz with poor, ambiguous questions... Koeleske explains concepts clearly and seems to genuinely care about the course and his students. Even though they push taking the intro sequence, go ahead and try to test out if you can, because the material is not especially new in regards to high school bio.",
    "Take it. It is kinda like AP Biology in high school but harder",
    "Surprisingly fun. Reasonable workload. I would take it even if it weren't a prereq!",
    "I would recommend BIO 101 to any student interesting in pre-med or in the sciences. It's very similar to AP BIO, but with a greater emphasis on concepts over factual memorization. Reading scientific papers is also a key component of the class. Professor Koleske is great. I would definitely recommend taking the course with him.",
    "Basic intro bio class",
    "Yes, recommended, as you will get a good foundation of bio. If you have done bio before, you may find this class slow and repetitive.",
    "Basic coverage of things taught in AP Bio. Would recommend if you've never taken any bio before. Might be kind of boring otherwise. Quizzes are a bit nit picky and get kind of annoying since they are every week. But it keeps you up to date on material. Very fair that you don't have to read the book, just keep up in lecture. Not too bad if you're just trying to get a science credit.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants a solid introduction to \/ foundation in biology. BIOL 101 was an incredibly well-organized course. The class was demanding in that it was fast-paced, but in hindsight this was helpful, as the weekly quizzes ensured that we stayed on top of the material. If you need extra help, be sure to take advantage of all the resources! Piazza and Enrichment were especially helpful. The homework assignments and scientific papers also really allowed us to apply what we learned in class to new situations, and it was great seeing how everything came together when we studied HIV at the end of the course. Professor Koleske is also a wonderful lecturer -- clear, thorough, and entertaining.",
    "Only take it for major",
    "It is a good course that gives a solid backgrounding biology. Not having taken AP and only taking a basic bio class my freshman year of high school, the concepts were mostly new, but nothing too challenging. You have to study a lot because there are weekly quizzes, but it is not unreasonable.",
    "Yea it was helpful because my AP Bio class wasn't that great so this really helped to fill in all the blanks. I would definitely recommend it to someone else.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to!",
    "It is a good prereq and an interesting class. Do not take this is you are not interested in science at all, its detailed and not difficult.",
    "I would definitely recommend BIOL 101. Even if the student has a perfect memory of concepts from AP Bio, BIOL 101 introduces you to valuable scientific paper-reading skills and a real life applications such as AIDS mechanisms.",
    "Great introduction to biology. Not too difficult to understand.",
    "BIOL 101 is very helpful if you want to go into BIOL 102.",
    "you need a biology background to do well",
    "Most definately! Even to a non-bio major this is a great and interesting class which is a wonderful way to learn a solid foundation in bio! The course is very standardized which is good.",
    "Biol 101 is similar to other prerequisite classes for science majors, they are not necessarily the most exciting classes, but they are very useful. I would recommend Biol 101.",
    "It's a decent course and one you need to take for a lot of science related majors. Be sure to take advantage of all the help that is available to you, it'll make things easier.",
    "The class is a good introductory to biochemistry and biophysics and really touches on important historical and contemporary research topics in this subject.",
    "Take it second semester, strong professors and they make it interesting and engaging",
    "I would recommend it if you're going to need it for professional school of some sort. It is a good overview for those interested, but I think that it's probably not quite the course for those simply needing a science credit.",
    "Good course, but entirely different experience depending on your background in biology.",
    "This class isn't terrible by any means, but it is certainly difficult, especially if you don't have a strong background in biology. I came into this class with practically no background in biology, and found that there were some topics that were glossed over more and treated as if they should be review for everyone and others where the basics were skipped over in favor of a more in depth approach. For me, the outside enrichment classes ended up being a necessity for the course. Without them, I don't know that I would have understood much at all. One of the issues that I had with this course was the somewhat overwhelming amount of information presented in each lecture. Because there was so much detail packed into each lecture, it was hard to know what was important, and there was never any kind of reviewing during subsequent lectures. This made it hard to prepare for both the weekly quizzes and the final. Questions on the quizzes seemed to sometimes be asking for small details that were glossed over during class or otherwise didn't seem to matter, while subjects that seemed like they would be very important weren't tested at all. This was further complicated by a reluctance from the instructors to answer questions relating to the quiz. While obviously no student should be given an advantage on the quizzes based on questions asked after class, it would have been very helpful if there was any kind of preparation at all in the lecture preceding the day of the quiz. Similarly, there were sometimes questions that seemed far more in depth into a subject than we had gone during class, giving the impression that you would either have to assume quite a bit to get the question right, or would have to already be familiar with the subject from a previous class. Overall, for the amount of information being covered in the class, it seemed like the class was structured to heavily favor those who had very strong biology backgrounds who could then use the lectures as more of a topical guide, rather than actually learning the information for the first time. There isn't too much work, just one homework assignment per week, but you will have to read and review on your own quite a bit to keep up with everything.",
    "Since 101 is required for a number of majors, many students will have to take it regardless of whether it's enjoyable or not. But the teachers try seriously to make it more than just a requirement, and at times (especially later on in the class) the material is interesting. On the whole a well-run course.",
    "Very good introduction to Biology, the course does become progressively harder but overall it gives you the opportunities to succeed.",
    "A good standard biochem class, not particularly exciting. Koleske is a great lecturer -- funny, relatable and clear. As someone who took bio twice in high school including AP bio and focused on research, it was definitely a review (which didn't further my interest in\/knowledge of bio). The placement exam was way too hard for the difficulty of the class. If I hadn't taken AP bio, I think it would've been difficult to absorb the material during lecture, as everything is mentioned but not detailed. Things like DNA replication would require a lot of additional study\/textbook reading. Weekly quizzes and homeworks, one final exam. Not too much work overall.",
    "Bio 101 with Koleske was a very good way to take the first Bio module. While required for most people taking it, his approach made the course manageable and the TFs for the module were very good at relating the lecture material to sections. Take with Koleske!",
    "Creative and active.",
    "Not going to lie, I really disliked this course, which was disappointing because biology has always been one of my favorite subjects. I just felt like I was wasting my time in lecture since it is mostly just a review of AP biology.",
    "I would recommend it. Many students need it to move on to higher courses. Unlike other intro courses, i did not find the course to be a chore that i dreaded going to class for.",
    "I would summarize BIOL 101 as a standard intro biology course that covers relatively basic concepts of molecular biology. In addition to concepts, the course has a focus on research papers and succinct writing. As an intro level biology class, I think the class was enjoyable enough, but not enough to recommend to someone who does not need to take it."
