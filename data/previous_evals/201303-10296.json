    "HIS MIDDLE NAME IS DALE?! Didn't know that. Thanks, course evals.Oh man. Lloyd Dale Grieger is the absolute best. Patient, kind, hilarious, designs his lectures in a student-friendly way...just all-around an excellent instructor. Such an intelligent, devilishly handsome, Stata-minded, Minnesotan Pinoy is a statistically improbable at the 99% level of confidence...Professor Grieger can be YOUR 1%. Yes.The course: a solid background in Calculus for all, plus Stata explained in an intuitive way. Lloyd Grieger is basically a unicorn--the lone statistical sociology scholar who still has a soul.In short, if you are a human being, take this class. If you are not a human being...do you even go here?",
    "This course is one of my absolute favorite I have taken at Yale. I'm not a global affairs major and I HATE math, but Professor Greiger is the absolute best. The first half of the class is simple calculus--if you took AB Calc in high school, you'll be absolutely fine. The second half uses Stata, and is actually really interesting. I took it to get an easy QR (which it definitely is) but ended up loving it.",
    "weekly psets, one midterm, one final - manageable work, and the pace of the class is slow. that said, if you don't pay attention in the second half of the course (post-midterm) and you don't know stata, it'll be tough to learn the program by yourself.",
    "This class is simple math that is applied to real life situations and easy to understand and learn. I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't want to do hard, theoretical math.",
    "The first half is an easier version of math 115. the second half is stata. The class is not challenging but the midterm was so beware.",
    "Applied Quantitative Analysis is a digestible, interesting introduction to statistical analysis. While it says \"applied\" - and for the most part, is, the fact that class spends the first half of the semester learning derivatives (which we only circle back to in the last week) takes away from its practicality. That said, Professor Greiger is engaging, always eager to help, and good at explaining things. I would recommend this class to people who haven't taken calculus before, are interested in developing a cursory understanding of what the heck a regression line is, and don't mind being surrounded by Global Affairs majors (who by and large are a lovely bunch).",
    "Great class, you review a lot of math you might have thought you would never revisit. The midterm is super easy, and the psets are pretty straightforward. Once Stata is introduced, it's more of a puzzle trying to figure out how to interpret outputs. You don't really have to go to class (I didn't after Stata was introduced), but the less time you spend in class and section, the more time you have to spend on the problem set. I just figured I'd rather spend my time doing the p-set and figuring it out on my own than sitting in lecture.Professor's a boss, super interesting, super helpful, and very clear.",
    "The first half covers basic math through single-variable calculus. The second half is basic statistics and how to do a basic regression on Stata. The material itself is pretty straight-forward but what makes this class great is a) Lloyd Grieger, and b) the class notes. Professor Grieger does a great job of making the stats we look at in class relevant and interesting, and his notes are the most beautiful, organized and detailed pdfs ever. Overall, an enjoyable class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class because it is not just your average statistics class. The statistical analysis is applied to real world studies, which I loved.",
    "It is an okay QR credit but there are definitely probably easier ones to take. It starts easy and gets much more complicated - especially when you start using Stata. This is a class that you really need to attend. However, the section is actually helpful for the homework. The pests are fairly long - a good sunday afternoon each week.",
    "I am not a math person, and I would still take this course all over again even if I didn't need it for a QR. Prof. Grieger is AMAZING and his excitement at solving calc problems or interpreting stata outputs is contagious. His posting of lecture slides and practice exams really helped us prepare for exams - you can tell he wants the class to do well and to genuinely appreciate the power of Stata. Everyone at Yale should take this class, but especially people who need a QR... this is WAY more worthwhile than planets and stars types of classes. TAKE IT!!!",
    "Pretty good class. The professor is great and its not too hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. I took GLBL 121 as a required course, but I found it extremely useful and hope to continue on with the material.",
    "If you're a GA major you don't really have much of a choice.As for everybody else, pretty manageable QR. First half of the class is super easy, especially if you've taken calculus. Calc was my worst class in high school and I found this class to be real simple. Second half of the class\/Stata...kinda a pain in the neck. But overall you could do a lot worse with a QR.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to do statistics on the computer (Stata program) with a social sciences perspective. The first third of the class is review of calculus, and the final 2\/3 is learning how to use the Stata program to analyze data sets and conduct statistical tests on collected data. The midterm was very fair, and problem sets were not too much work. Professor Grieger is extremely engaging and his lectures were interesting. Overall a great class.",
    "Global Affairs is a good QR class for someone who was good but not amazing at math in high school and is looking for a class in which they'll learn something but won't be crushed.",
    "Yep, take it. This was everything you'd want in a QR course: well-organized, well-structured, AMAZING teacher, tons of office hours and accessibility, real-world applicability, and it's easy. Good intro to stats if you don't want to take the actual Intro Stat class.On another note, for Global Affairs Development majors: I would recommend taking this class before Intermediate Micro. I spent a full semester struggling through that class and its abysmal teaching trying to figure out how to do the Lagrange multiplier, optimization under constraints., etc. It took Lloyd two days to effectively clarify marginal analysis and make it totally easy.",
    "I would recommend it to get a basic idea about regression and how to interpret it, and how to work with state.",
    "GLBL 121 is a great, chill review of calculus 1, introduction to statistical concepts, and introduction to Stata.Strengths: Professor Grieger is a great teacher, very engaging and fun. Slow-paced course so it's not overwhelming, and the problem sets \/ tests are meant to teach you what you know \/ don't know as opposed to docking off points.Weaknesses: Probably could be more challenging.",
    "definitely recommend it, good math credit, interesting, definitely useful for analyzing data in the real world",
    "Absolutely!!! Wanna learn how to use statistics program? This is the class...",
    "Good fifth class for a quantitative person. intro to stats and overview of calculus. Good course to take before Econometrics. Lloyd was phenomenal. Really helped you out a lot if you needed it. Not too much work and the tests are fair.",
    "If you need a QR course that's not too hard, and you want to understand the quant sections of academic articles, this course is a great great option.",
    "A great course for anyone in the social sciences! Not too hard, and pretty interesting. Professor Grieger really makes the class.",
    "Wonderful. Professor is one of the best at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you consider yourself to have less experience in calculus and statistics. Lloyd is everything you need out of an introductory teacher--organized, clear, funny, and fair. If you are a GA major, you will be required to take it. And now for the bad: if your preparation in mathematics exceeds the level of MATH 112, prepare to be bored for two-thirds of the semester and lobby for a change in the requirements of the major. I feel frustrated by the fact that I spent a semester at Yale taking a condescendingly easy class that I thought would be more about STATA rather than introductory mathematics.",
    "I am not doing global affairs, but I took this because I needed a QR and wanted one that would be pretty useful and not too hard. That's exactly what I got, and I would definitely recommend it. Lloyd was excellent \u00e2\u0080\u0093 so committed to the class. You could tell he really cared and wanted us to learn. He also made the class fun (as fun as a calculus\/statistics class can be) with his jokes and antics.",
    "BEST QR AT YALE. Lloyd is amazing. I'm no math person but this is a GREAT class. Lloyd is very focused on making this relevant for students, so everything you learn will have practical implications. I HIGHLY recommend this class.",
    "There are weekly psets and a midterm and final. Go to section, especially when we start doing STATA. The PSETS become a lot easier, if you attend section because they are explained there. Professor Grieger is a really good lecturer, comprehensive and interesting at the same time. I thought the class was pretty good and not impossible to do well in.",
    "Without a doubt take this course with Prof. Grieger. The class is very well structured, it is easy to follow, and Prof. Grieger is an amazing teacher. GLBL 121 is one of those rare classes at Yale that actually covers introductory material. For students whose math background is weak, this class is a big help (I speak from experience). Even though some of the people in the class will have covered a lot of the content before Prof. Grieger makes the whole thing worthwhile. This class is perfect for a QR credit and for anyone who is interested in basic statistical analysis.",
    "If you're a (potential) global major or otherwise interested in social science, AQA is a straightforward introduction to statistical analysis. This is \"applied\" analysis, so you're essentially learning Stata and how to interpret its results, not advanced statistical theory per se. As someone with no background in stats, I never felt lost--Lloyd does a great job of explaining the harder concepts in easily understood terms. First half of the class is basic calc review and dragged on a bit; second half was Stata and analysis. One pset a week, with a straightforward midterm and final. Overall, a very manageable workload and an excellent intro to Stata and stats in a social science context (plus a good QR for anyone with calc experience).",
    "Yes if you're majoring in the social sciences and need a QR or would like to understand how quantitative research in your field works.",
    "Its a good QR credit and Professor Grieger is amazing. Be wary of the exams.",
    "AQA is a good way to brush up on your basic calc and to get a working understanding of Stata. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a very well taught QR course and anyone interested in quantitative analysis skills including statistics and the use of Stata.",
    "great class, using calculus to explain statistical regressions in STATA statistical analysis program. very useful information",
    "Applied Quantitative Analysis is a great course to talk. Professor Grieger is an engaging lecturer, and the second half of the semester is relevant to Global Affairs ( and social sciences in general ). The first half of the class does a good job with going over the basic principles of math (up to Multi).Notes are posted online, and section can be a complete waste of time. You can easily teach yourself the material as you work on problem sets. It's not a hard QR, as long as you put in the time.",
    "I took this class because it is a requirement for Global Affairs, BUT, if you are looking for a QR - TAKE THIS CLASS. No one would expect it, but it has gut written all over it. The workload is tiny, the courses super easy to understand, grading is easy and professor is terrific. Also, learning how to do basic statistics (which you do the second half of the semester) is an incredibly useful skill that anyone in the social sciences must have (even though strangely enough it's not required for Poli Sci....)",
    "AQA is a well-taught and entertaining introduction to calculus and statistics. I took econometrics and Math 120 at Yale, so there was practically no new material.",
    "Well it is definitely a requirement for most Global Affairs students. But for those that are not Global Affairs, it is an awesome class if you are interested in gaining a baseline knowledge about statistics. Relatively straightforward QR credit which is nice as well.",
    "Obviously, a required course for those in or interested in the Global Affairs major. Manageable course load, material in the second half of the course is generally more interesting than stuff from the first half of the course. Lloyd is a great, and overall, I would recommend the course.",
    "Great class but its nit as easy as it seems",
    "I would recommend this course to any student wishing to gain knowledge in statistics and calculus and their application to the real world",
    "Yes, definitely take it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you want to learn valuable skills using Stats but go into it knowing it won't be that interesting. Unless you just really love that stuff. It's not much work tho, one pset per week, which will be long but not too hard, then a midterm and final.",
    "Take it!",
    "It is a quick run through both calc and STATA. I think after taking the course I could have benefitted from taking a course in either just calc or stata. However, I think that is a personal choice though because I have never taken either calc or stats.",
    "If you need a qr and you are not good at math this class is greats the prof is wonderful and it is not too difficultly. Also gives a lot of practical knowledge.",
    "Good class. Professor Grieger walks you by the hand from basic algebra concepts all the way to multivariable concepts, and he does it effectively and interestingly. This \"math bootcamp\" portion of the class is also a breeze if you've ever had Math 112-120 at Yale, or took calculus in high school. The second half is about working with data sets in Stata. This portion is more complicated so you have to start paying more attention. It's interesting, though, and the data analysis is not crazy tedious or boring. I enjoyed learning how to work with Stata. This is apparently the only course at Yale that specifically teaches you how to use Stata, assuming you don't already know how to do it (versus econometrics, which assumes you can use it and doesn't teach you how, which is awful). I enjoyed it. A pleasure of a requirement for Global. A fine QR class for everyone else.",
    "Take it for an easy qr",
    "Um, maybe. It's a pretty easy course, and Greiger's fun, but you probably won't learn much more then you would in a Statistics class, or Econometrics. Maybe take those classes if you're more serious about the subject.",
    "Yes - very important information to know.",
    "Yes, it's a good QR for people who need one. And at the same time, I think that what you're learning is useful for other areas of academia.",
    "Highly recommend. Professor Grieger is great and the materials were accessible. Grading was fair and the pests were not terribly difficult.",
    "Straightforward QR - If you show up and do the work it is an easy class. This is mostly because the professor is the nicest and most helpful man on the planet. And the material is actually interesting and applicable. Take it.",
    "It was essentially Calc 1, 2, and 3 mixed in with the important parts of Statistics. It was a great class and I'd recommend it to anyone needing some quantitative backing for their major but not looking to take boring or stretched out math classes.",
    "I would recommend it. It is very helpful for employers and possible research.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. I am using it towards my major but I also think it's a good general QR credit because it's very interesting and not too difficult. I thought the format of the class was very helpful because we spent the first half of the course learning calculus which gave us a strong background to prepare us for using the computer program in the second half of the course. Professor Grieger is GREAT! He kept the class interesting at all times and he explained things very clearly. I think the grading was fair and the tests were a good measure of what we learned. The pace of the class was very good as well.",
    "Review Calc 2 concepts, learn basics of statistics, gain a beginnger\/intermediate grasp of Stata programming, useful for social science statistical analysis.",
    "Take this class it is fantastic. The beginning calculus part is boring at times. But the analysis in the second half more than makes up for it. Professor Grieger is amazing.",
    "This course had some positive elements - Lloyd was very energetic, and his lectures were useful; his manner of presentation clear. With that being said, class moved at an incredibly slow pace - as someone who'd taken intro stats beforehand, I'd hoped that my analytical skills would improve significantly, but I don't think that ended up being the case - although the syllabus talks about 'learning Stata' we were reallyonly offered an elementary overview. (I happened to have friends at other universities taking comparable classes, and their work was far more advanced.) The TAs were well meaning but didn't seem to be any more advanced than many of the students.There are better ways to use a Yale credit, though if you need a quick QR this isn't a terrible call.",
    "A great course, especially if you're trying to get rid of a QR. It walks you through the calculus so you can understand the computer probability work in a way that is never intimidating and gives non-mathy people a good understanding of how statistics on world issues like poverty are made.",
    "Good if you're a social science student with very little math knowledge. It is less theoretical than other statistics classes, but much more applicable. Not very challenging, although I found myself being punished by the curve in midterms because of how it was so easy that careless mistakes made a huge difference. Professor Grieger is very enthusiastic and caring, and definitely one of the best professors to take this class under.",
    "This is a really great way to get a QR credit. It was an interesting, fun class even for non-math people. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "In a heartbeat. Whether or not you need a QR credit, it's a useful class that introduces you to a useful and fascinating program (Stata) in addition to applicable quantitative procedures. Prof Grieger always wants to help you. Ask questions! Go to office hours! He's there to help and delightful about it. A strong course that serves as a calculus refresher and a statistics intro. I'd say statistically significantly better than intro stats. And truly, Professor Grieger is reason enough to take it.",
    "good",
    "TAKE IT!!! I would recommend this class for everyone. It is basically a class that teaches you how to analyze data sets and produce something note-worthy. You can apply it to anything, and it wasn't too hard either!",
    "One of my favorite classes this year - not because of the material, but because of how the material was handled.This class was very direct, very organized, and always had a clear sense of direction. Equal parts engaging, challenging, and interesting, the way the syllabus was divided into learning math skills and applying them to real data was not only helpful, but encouraging, promoting a sense of progress.Professor Grieger was always on top of his game, with every lecture having a clear and much appreciated roadmap - to see what we would be learning, how it can be applied to the real world, and where it will lead us into future concepts.Every lecture was equipped with very clear examples and applications of the material, as well as an in-depth exploration of the implication of these concepts.The syllabus felt very confidently guided, highly structured, and yet always flexible.The down-side to this course is that sadly, it is probably not for everybody because of the specific nature of the material. Learning STATA and applying quantitative analysis to underlying sociological theories can be rather specific, and may not necessarily provide the depth to appeal to somebody interested in just Statistics, or interested in just Sociology. The class represents a very unique and unfortunately precise hybrid of Economics and Sociology, and thus it only really makes sense in the Global Affairs department - a major which has a tight application process, and thus students taking Applied Quantitative Analysis might not even know if this course will be applied towards their major.Nevertheless, this class was extremely well executed.If you have any doubts about this course, they are vey quickly dispelled by Professor Grieger's command over the course material, and his engagement with his students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class, especially because Professor Grieger is a wonderful teacher. He teaches the material really well and you will definitely come away with knowledge of calculus and how to use and interpret stata. The lecture can get a bit dry because the material is rather dry, but Professor Grieger definitely makes up for most of it.",
    "Global 121 was really intense. If you've never had calculus make sure you take it with a friend who has, and if you've never had statistics make sure you take it with a friend who's taken stats. The problem sets will drive you insane, so get started on those very soon once they're assigned. Greiger is incredible, but it's the material that will make you go nuts. It's not necessarily difficult, it's just that the problem sets will make you cringe.",
    "Not a spectacular class, but it isn't too difficult and Lloyd Grieger is a great teacher. Especially helpful if you are planning on Global Affairs or if you aren't too advanced in calculus cause most of September and early October is essentially an expedited review of Calc 1. The statistics work is generally pretty interesting once you get to it. I wouldn't recommend it for everyone but if you need a fairly easy QR it is one of the better choices out there.",
    "Amazing professor, so incredibly thoughtful and nice. Really cares about his students.Final is quite challenging.",
    "Take this course! Professor Grieger is amazing and Stata is such an interesting program. For those who have taken Calculus before, the beginning can get tedious, but it's a good refresher and the second half of classes is TOTALLY worth it!",
    "It is mind-numbing if you already like Math.",
    "As far as required quantitative classes go, this is one of the better ones. Professor Grieger is both engaging and entertaining in lecture. The course gets off to a slow start with a rehashing of very basic algebra\/calculus concepts, but this means that you don't have to go to the (non-mandatory for the first half of the course) section. And the lecture notes and slides are posted online. But, the second of the course is great, and you'll learn how to use Stata and how to conduct statistical analysis on a basic level. I'd recommend it as a not particularly taxing QR, and if you're Global Affairs you have to take it. I will say though that the problem sets can get a little tedious and can take up to 4 hours or so.",
    "This is a good course if you have been looking for a well-taught QR credit. It is so rare to find a professor like Prof. Grieger that can explain everything from basic algebra to multivariable calculus in a way that is accessible to all students, and seem to enjoy teaching the material! He is very helpful, so definitely drop by his office hours. Although there are a few points along the way were some of the material gets a bit messy, this definitely not an overwhelming course. The problem sets are fine if you work in a group (although plan to budget some more time once you have to make the trek to a computer cluster for the Stata problem sets). The practice midterm wasn't like what we were given as the exam, so make sure to prepare for that. Overall, a great class for anyone looking for an intro stats class with a good prof. and an accessible teaching style.",
    "Yes, i highly recommend the class if you have a strong base in Calculus and would be open to learning a bit of statistics with the Stata program. Stata problem sets required a bit of playing around and figuring out how to use the program but you get the hang of it fairly easily especially if you're good about attending lectures and sections and paying close attention in both! But, if you need it for the global affairs prerequisite then definitely take the class too.",
    "AQA is the Math in Global Affairs. I wish I had taken this class before taking Intro Microeconomics. I understood all the Econ topics after the connection was made to me in Global Affairs. I am not Mathy\/do not like Math but I did understand Math concepts in this class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "A really good QR: it's not that hard if you do the problem sets ahead of time and study for the exams, and you learn super essential statistical analysis skills. This class taught me a whole lot. Linear regression and a bunch of other statistical things make sense to me now! Definitely, definitely take it if you need a QR. It's one of the best introductory QR courses at Yale.",
    "Pretty easy course if you know multivariable from before, but a bit boring. You have to take it if you're doing Global Affairs, but you might be able to take something else instead, though it's pretty hard. I liked the stats part a lot though because it was new and Lloyd explains everything really well.",
    "This is a good course with a fair workload. It's a nice introduction to stata and really develops data analysis skills. I would recommend the course to someone else. Lloyd is also a great instructor who keeps the class interesting. He's easy to follow and makes the class better.",
    "I would only take this class if 1) you're looking for a decently easy QR, or 2) you have already been accepted to the Global Affairs major and have committed to the major, after which it's required of you anyways. If you've already taken single-variable calculus and basic statistics, either at Yale or in high school, this course won't teach you anything you can't learn in a few hours on the Internet (namely, partial derivatives and a brief introduction to STATA, a statistical analysis software), so a lot of the problem sets will seem dull, repetitive, and without much instructional purpose. That being said, Lloyd is a hilarious, amazing professor and really stands out in his knowledge and passion for teaching. Lectures were never dull thanks to him."
