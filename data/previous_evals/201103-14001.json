    "I really enjoyed the speakers this fall. I thought they provided a range of career perspectives.",
    "great lecture and guest speakers",
    "Since this is just related to career options, I think it should be optional. I like that it is only every other week though. It would be helpful to be able to provide more input on the types of careers we are interested in. Also, the speakers seem very young and inexperienced. It might be helpful to have someone who has a bit more experience who can really provide some advice.",
    "This one is great! I like all the speakers.",
    "This was not an assigned course for me, but if it was, I would be looking for opportunities to discuss pre-post reactions to the speakers. The speakers I saw provided superficial reflections on their work that one might expect (e.g. government worker speaks on institutional hurdles to innovation). It might be more meaningful for the speakers to walk through one project they completed start to finish.",
    "Really glad that HPA added this seminar. Great speakers, good insight. Appreciated the additional meeting times provided before or after the seminar.",
    "Great speakers! Would be nice if they can give a general overview of what they currently do and how that fits into the structure of their organization, but I enjoyed listening to the speakers and the questions that students ask.",
    "Great course - interesting to get lots of exposure to people working in diverse settings of health policy.",
    "Although I only went to a few seminars this semester that were relevant to my interests (since I am a second-year), I really enjoyed the opportunity to hear from people working in very different positions. I wish this existed when I was a first-year.",
    "The seminar was great. They brought in a great selection of speakers, all with amazing experience and good information to share.",
    "The teacher was great, the class was irrelevant for most management folks",
    "Some very good speakers- difficult for those of us in Health Management to have two separate seminars, especially during lunch on Mondays (normally we have class from 8:30am to 2:30pm with almost no break).",
    "Good to have an opportunity for some extra-curricular discussion about policy.",
    "This course provided good exposure to a variety of health policy and management careers as presented by program alumni currently in the various fields.",
    "The HPA seminar was very helpful and provided opportunities to listen to various healthcare professionals and interact with them."

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy really brought everyone together and make a huge effort to bring outside speakers and made a different for this class.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0It is very clear that Dr. Bradley is invested in her students and wants people to succeed. However, she is with the management program and there doesn't seem to be anyone who is as enthusiastic or as interested in her in the policy division.",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0She is amazing and great!",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsey stepped into this role when HPA students demanded it. She really did a wonderful job of keeping everyone up to date with her initial efforts setting this up.",

    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0N\/A",
    "Instructor: Elizabeth Howe Bradley \u00a0Betsy is instrumental in providing the students exposure with Yale Alumni. She is very approachable but can be busy at times to schedule appointments. However, she is very open to meeting with students and sharing her wisdom. Overall, a wonderful person who genuinely cares about the concerns of the students!",

   "comments": [
    "As a second year, this seminar was not mandatory. However I would recommend attending the seminars, especially for students looking to learn more about different career opportunities.",
    "a must take!",
    "It is required.",
    "This is great, you can learn the real world health policy and management stories from all levels of first line healthcare managers, practitioners, and experts.",
    "I'm sorry, but i would seek SOM, Med, LAW or Forestry seminars above this one. The other schools seem to bring in high profile names with dynamicspeakers. If we are only able to get one or two star players, which we did, then I would focus PR\/marketing\/advertising to these sessions only, with some sort of incentive for HPA collegiality: Like reserved time for Q&A for second years, second year resume submission pre-speaker, have the advisors reach out to stellar HPA students who would benefit most in going, offer to sit with and introduce the student to the speaker based on common interest.",
    "Definitely recommend, unique way to meet alumni and hear about career paths.",
    "Yes, the seminar is a great opportunity to gain exposure to people working in different fields of public health in HP and HM.",
    "Great exposure to practitioners in the field of HPA.",
    "Definitely helps first-years figure different opportunities in the world of health policy\/management",
    "I would highly recommend it as an opportunity to see what work in health policy can look like.",
    "I think this class is reality for Health Policy Students for the most part. In addition, the value of mid level experienced graduates seem more like an exercises in hearing the their day to day tasks or the \"koolaid\" that they drank in their work. I don't know exactly where these seminars are supposed to take us. Am I supposed to be impressed by them or feel a bit disenfranchised by the level of work they are doing? I I don't know what's the appropriate \"point\" of this seminar is except that I feel my options are more limited hearing the impaired level of responsibility or people talk about the same thing over and over again. I think the professor is great, but I get very little about of hearing a person defend a government job or a person talking about the many menial hospital tasks one must do.",
    "Due to the structure of this course, above fields are left blank.The course is extremely valuable. It introduces real life examples into the MPH. The speakers have been on the whole quite interesting personalities and the topics were very informative.This course is a good addition!",
    "Some very good speakers for health policy students.",
    "A chance to discuss policy outside of the classroom, and get to hear what people are doing out in the world.",
    "This course provided good exposure to a variety of health policy and management careers as presented by program alumni currently in the various fields.",
    "This HPA seminar was very helpful, and I highly recommend this seminar to other students. There should be more opportunities for students to interact with various healthcare professionals in the field."
