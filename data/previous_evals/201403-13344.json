    "yes take it! it's a good survey course of south asian history from the mughals up to partition. incorporates a lot of primary materials, including paintings\/popular imagery and literature, so it's not a \"dry\" lecture course. professor stephens is wonderful and encourages engagement in lecture. the assignments are pretty light, just 5 response papers, a midterm and final. there were a couple of roleplays but that did not take too much preparation. readings can be dense at times, but interesting.",
    "A very painless way to get a ROW credit for the History major. Julie Stephens is super sweet and a solid lecturer; I particularly enjoyed her focus on historiography. Readings were short but usually pretty dense since they were academic articles. They probably weren't necessary, but I found them very useful and I learned a lot from them. Exams and reading responses were very fair."
