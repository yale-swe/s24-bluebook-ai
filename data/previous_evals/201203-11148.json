    "The course provided me with a much deeper understanding of corruption and the literature surrounding it. Already, work I have done for her course has engaged heavily with my intended dissertation project and the reading material has been extremely helpful in generating ideas for theoretical extensions and empirical projects.",
    "I would say it deepened my knowledge somewhat, but not a ton. It helped develop knowledge related to a specific topic and area, but I'm not sure how much it developed knowledge of broader issues related to my discipline."
