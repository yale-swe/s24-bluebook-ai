    "My singing and dictation skills really improved in this class. It was really helpful that we sang in class and got used to using solfege. We also learned about different chords and progressions, which was helpful in dictation. In addition, my keyboard skills developed through keyboard lab.",
    "Developed basic piano skills and improved aural recognition of music and theory",
    "I developed singing and keyboard skills (not complete fluency, but a pretty good bearing) and learned how solfege and keyboard skills can help me \"see\" and \"feel\" the function of chords and notes in a scale. I also learned, through dictation exercises, how to perceive four-voiced music as a whole structure with horizontal and vertical groupings, instead of just trying to pick out individual notes.",
    "I learned quite a bit from this course: I feel much more comfortable with melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic dictation, sight singing, basic chord progressions, and the ability to complete a wide variety of vocal exercises.",
    "I became comfortable with singing patterns in the major and minor scales, learned to hear chord qualities and intervals, improved my skills in dictation, and learned the functions of common chords. The keyboard lab also taught me figured bass and score reading."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed this class because we practiced singing in listening in class and actively participated musically. Just singing and immediately receiving feedback was very helpful. In addition, there wasn't much pressure when singing since it was a small class. I also really enjoyed talking about different chords and their progressions especially in the context of actual songs. I wish we could have done this a little more.",
    "It was very unstructured, but as much as it was unpredictable it kept the environment very fluid and natural. Very weak communication\/connection to piano lab. There was no posted syllabus and I had no idea there was a piano lab until after I'd committed to the course.",
    "Strengths: The amount of practice (singing, keyboard, and listening) we did in class was substantial and allowed me to improve my skills without too much extra effort outside the classroom. Weakness: The only one that comes to mind is that students who did not take this class concurrently or after Musi210 sometimes were at a disadvantage, because they were not familiar with certain terms to describe chords and cadences. These terms were used in class without enough explanation.",
    "I think this course is very strong in that the material is very applicable to outside musical pursuits. I also really appreciated how engaging the course was, and I always looked forward to it because the class always approached the vocal exercises we did with positivity and excitement! The course could be improved by perhaps spending a little more time on chord recognition-- I feel like I am behind where I should be in this area. I think this will be remedied by 219, though.",
    "Strengths: Steady progression of material and good in-class exercises, fair exams. The course might maybe be improved by giving us more materials to practice individually outside of class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend this course. Coming into the class, I already had some experience doing dictation and playing the piano, and I found it to be pretty easy. There isn't much homework except to practice singing and playing the piano. If you are an experienced singer or instrumentalist, this class will be a breeze. However, I still learned a lot and found this class worthwhile.",
    "Very pleasant, low commitment class. Piano lab was very stressful though, especially as a beginner.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The amount of work is relatively little but the amount of practice you get and the familiarity you gain with chords\/scales is substantial.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I found it highly enjoyable and productive, and I loved how Prof. Adam was very flexible and easily accommodated students' questions.",
    "Yes, it helps greatly with aural skills and skills in general musicianship.",
    "You will learn great musicianship skills in this course! Take it if you can."
