    "It depends what you want out of a seminar. A chance to read great, current books. It's not a class where you come out with expertise on a specific subject - you're learning more how to connect different themes and current events.",
    "An awesome class for anybody that likes to think about and debate a diverse variety of issues; almost like a more-informed talk show. If you don't like to talk, or if you don't like to be challenged, then this class is not for you. You can make what you will of the weekly memo assignments \u0096 book review, op-ed, academic treatise, whatever you wish.",
    "Reading a book a week about relevant issues in today's global politics. Kalyvas is pompous and controlling, but as long as you're aware of that& fine with it, you should take it, because he's also very brilliant and I learned a lot in this course.",
    "Prof Kalyvas is an outstanding instructor - one of the best I have been taught by at Yale, and he made this course for me. We read a bunch of fascinating books and I came away with a lot of food for thought. Prof. Kalyvas makes this very much a discussion oriented class, so we were all constantly bouncing ideas off of one another. He picked books that seemed completely unrelated and far too specific to give us any sense about global politics, but when writing the final paper and trying to link everything, you realize that he's done a terrific job of selecting books that actually illuminate many broad themes about the world. If you have any interest in the things that happen in the outside world, you want to take this class.",
    "This was just an awesome and mindblowing experience. Professor Kalyvas knows his stuff and every single class session, you're exposed to paradigm shifting views of the world. Try to pre-register and pray that you get in.",
    "No, I wouldn't really recommend this course. You learn very little and the discussions are not engaging.",
    "Yes! The books chosen by Professor Kalyvas are great. It's a lot of work - after all, you're reading a whole book per week - but it is a very rewarding class. The discussions led by Professor Kalyvas are really good, and he tries to pick an interesting group of people for the class.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. It will change the way you think, you will learn a ton from the books you read each week, and you will develop a great bond with your classmates. This is probably one of the best two or three seminars in the major and it is definitely worth your time (and it is a LOT of time, though you will be rewarded for it at the end in what you've learned and in your grade).",
    "I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in global politics, whether you already have a broad knowledge base or none at all of global political issues. This course is designed to take you on a tour of important contemporary issues, and Professor Kalyvas runs an excellent discussion. He can be a forceful section leader, but you will definitely learn a lot. He also chooses great books, and the syllabus is different each year. There is, obviously, a lot of reading, but it's so worth it. Highly recommended.",
    "This class is like a political science book club led by a great professor. The class had a lot of big personalities, which could occasionally make discussion difficult. Prof. Kalyvas best quality as a class leader is his ability to push people until they say something concrete. Definitely have a point before you open your mouth. He also likes putting people on the spot. Don't take it personally, as he'll do it to everyone throughout the course of the class.Memos don't take too much time as long as you stay on top of your reading. Keep your style short and to the point and try to look at the readings in new and interesting ways. You can't go wrong then!",
    "This class, especially when it is paired with spending some time reading the newspaper every week, is a great way to feel more informed about the world. Professor Kalyvas is very knowledgeable and really gets you thinking about the world. Don't be afraid to challenge him oryour classmates, you'll get a lot more out of the course! Beware though, reading a book a week is tough! Make sure you give yourself enough time to do each book justice.",
    "Great class. Only take it if you are willing to do all of the reading (and it's a lot of reading). The books are fantastic-- interesting, fun to read, informative. Taking this course has shaped the way I see all current events and made me feel informed about the major events in the news. While I don't know tons about any one issue, I feel that I can now chat articulately about a broad array of issues and have an opinion about most of them-- the Israel-Palestine conflict, US-China relations, the economic crisis, the EU, development assistance, etc."
