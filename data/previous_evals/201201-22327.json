   "comments": [
    "I probably would not have taken this course had it not been a prerequisite for the English major because I am not a huge fan of English poetry. That being said, I think it is important to undertand these works as part of the Western canon and I have a greater appreciation of poetry coming out of this course. The class is a lot of writing - be prepared to write 5 papers of moderate length. I also think, like all English seminars, the quality of the course is highly dependent on the class dynamic and the professor. I would recommend taking the course with Professor Peterson.",
    "Reading wonderful, important works under the able leadership of a great professor",
    "Yes, anyone interested in learning about english poetry or any english majors should definitely take this class.",
    "I think this course is useful for any Yale student because, through studying these \u0093canonical\u0094 poets, you get a great sense of how language works. Word patterns, meter, tenses, and punctuation assume a huge importance in this class and once you see how important these elements of language are and how they are used, you develop a new approach to the English language in your own life. Or at least, you can develop a new approach, if you choose to. English 126 gives you a semester long subscription to better reading and riding, you decide whether to renew it.",
    "A good introduction to some major poets (well, i guess that's the class title). You read some really great stuff. Peterson is a harmless instructor, good class discussions, typical introductory english course.",
    "English 126 is, of course, a pre-requisite for the English major, but it's worth taking even if you're studying something else. The readings are great, and you'll learn a lot about the British poetic tradition. As long as you keep up with the readings, you'll be able to stay on top of the discussion -- and you can't go wrong reading Paradise Lost!",
    "I highly recommend this course for anyone who wants to improve their close reading skills and develop an appreciation for poetry.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class with Peterson if you have the chance. If you are interested in the poets covered in this class or are simply working on the English major requirements, I wouldn't hesitate to take this class. I was not really looking forward to taking this class at the beginning of the semester, but I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself enjoying all the material.",
    "Professor Peterson is the perfect instructor for English 126. She's familiar with the material, but more importantly a teacher who knows how to guide students from poet to poet. The workload is manageable, and Professor Peterson provides helpful feedback on papers.",
    "If you are interested at all in poetry but are unfamiliar with the poets covered by the course, you should take it!",
    "You'll have to take it for the major -- I never would have taken it otherwise, not liking poetry much. That being said, don't let it be the reason why you don't pursue the English major -- you read important works."
