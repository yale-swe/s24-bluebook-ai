    "My first impression of this class was that it was for those who enjoyed the Science section of the ACT but it's really a more focused version of Perspectives in Science and Engineering. You will read jargon-filled, scientific papers every week that at first seem impossible to get through but eventually, you'll find yourself analyzing them with ease. One of the goals of the seminar that I feel is fulfilled is having students learn how accessible scientific primary source material is and feel empowered to go beyond listening to CNN, Fox, and other secondary news sources. The topics are intriguing and range from broad to specific. Not only will you learn a lot about the subject matter but you will also learn about some of the different STEM departments, research, and researchers at Yale which was a valuable experience. The workload is light and discussions are thought-provoking. There's also such a feeling of equality of opinions when it comes to discussions, even though we were just freshman learning some of these issues exist in the first place. Evans was even open to allowing some of the freshman in the seminar join his 200 level class on a New England geology trip. Evans and Timmermans are terrific and I plan on keeping in contact with them\/taking more of their classes in the future.",
    "Overall, the course has been a great experience, and it served as a very interesting introduction to some of the major issues surrounding the the earth and the environment. The class consisted of guest lectures by Yale faculty researchers on Tuesdays and discussions of the lecture and related issues on Thursdays. Each week, students paired up to write a short summary of a research paper written by the guest lecturer. Students wrote two research papers on a topic from the course, serving as the midterm and final. I would highly recommend the course to another student. It has provided an amazing setting to get to know two incredibly kind and knowledgeable professors, as well as bringing together many students who have similar interests. I really enjoyed being in a class taught by two professors, as it allowed us to get to know each of them and brought each of their areas of expertise to the table. Personally, the class has also helped me make some of my new best friends, facilitated by the pizza dinner and movie night that we attended as a group. Additionally, the research papers have provided a way for us to familiarize ourselves with research at Yale. Before the first paper, a librarian even spoke to the class about the many different databases and resources Yale has for research, which has helped me outside of the course as well. I really enjoyed the course material, and I thought it was very interesting to explore a variety of topics within the same general field. Our discussions were always interesting, and they went beyond simply the scientific realm into the difficulties of real-world implementation of scientific findings as well as their moral implications. Overall, a great course, amazing professors, fun group of people, and an incredible experience!",
    "This is an awesome class. The workload isn't insane, and most of the topics are accessible enough to talk about but complex enough that you learn, during each week's lecture, that there's so much more to almost every earth\/environment issue than you ever even knew. Discussions can veer in unexpected directions, and the weekly writeup basically depends on who your partner is, but overall I would highly recommend.",
    "This course made the best use of the two-day format. Over the weekend, the professors send you an email with a paper written by someone either in the Yale community or by someone they know. On Tuesday, the paper's author comes in and talks to the class about their area of expertise - we had a woman who worked on arsenic levels in wells in India, a BP oil consultant, a wind turbine designer, and both professors as well. Before Thursday's class, you meet up with another student and write a one-page summary of the paper, and on Thursday, the class discusses the paper, the discussion, and really anything related to the subject. Easily the best class I took this semester. It was incredibly engaging, interesting, and fun ! Our class got together for pizza dinners, film viewings, and meet-ups outside of class. The material is topically relevant and engaging, and I just can't rave enough about this course. Take this Freshman Seminar, especially if you are a non-science major looking for an introduction into current science topics and want to relate STEM to humanities. Basically, take this class. You won't regret it.",
    "MUST TAKE freshman seminar for anyone remotely interested in geology, environmental studies, and their political and societal implications. Dave and Mary-Louise are a dream team; fun, friendly, approachable, and extremely knowledgeable. The structure of the class is designed to teach you how to read primary scientific literature. On weekends you get a paper (topics ranging from wind energy, to supercontinents, to human evolution, to geo-engineering, to Arctic sea ice), on Tuesday the person that wrote the paper will come in and lecture (it's super cool meeting the authors of papers and asking them questions), between Tuesday and Thursday you write an easy 1-page summary with a partner, and on Thursday you have a seminar class discussions. As someone interested in Political Science and EP&E, the political implications of what we read were fascinatingranging from how to combat climate change denial-ism, to the role of international bodies in climate change mitigation and geo-engineering, to the role of journalism and scientific media. The science aspect of the class is difficult at times, but having two professors, TAs with office hours, and the original authors of scientific papers provides more than enough resources to ensure your understanding. Last word to anyone shopping the class: Dave and Mary-Louise will make the first paper and summary difficult and particularly jargon-filled so as to ward off some people (this year we read the interesting, but insanely complicated: \"Assembly and breakup of the core of PaleoproterozoicMesoproterozoic supercontinent Nuna\"). If you're more interested in the political implications of geology and environmental studies: STICK WITH THE CLASS. The papers will only get easier (content-wise and with reading experience), and the discussions will only get more societally relevant.",
    "In this class, we read scientific papers, learned from guest lecturers, and discussed environmental topics that were arranged chronologically by the earths history. I would definitely recommend this class to another student because the professors were great, the topics were fascinating, and the discussions were fun. Also, this class was a unique experience in that every week a guest lecturer, either professor or academic at Yale presented for the class about a topic they specialized in.",
    "The class was a great overview of many important scientific issues. Every week, students were assigned a reading from a scientific journal. An author of that paper gave a guest lecture to the class, then the students had an opportunity to discuss it. I would definitely recommend the class to another student. It allows you to learn a lot, as well as interact with experts in their fields.",
    "Earth, Energy, Resources, and Environment is a great introduction to many topics in geology and environmental studies. A good class to take if you want to discover interests in those areas while learning to read and analyze scientific papers and begin to debate the policy surrounding environmental issues. Classes alternate between guest lectures and open class discussion, with the two professors providing guidance. A fairly light weekly class load, with the big work of the class being two research papers. Would highly recommend!"
