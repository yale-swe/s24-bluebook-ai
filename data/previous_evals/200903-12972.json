    "Tommaso was excellent all semester. He was always really understanding and helped us to learn the material. Latin in his class was really a no pressure environment which helped everyone to learn even better. Find any class he is TA-ing and take it.",
    "Latin is worth learning.",
    "Hopefully with a revision in the syllabus, the content of the class will be alot more engaging. I do highly recommend taking a class with Tomasso although next semester will be his last :(",
    "Only take it if you are a classics major. If not, take a different language for your language credit.",
    "Only take Latin if you like Latin or need it for your major. I took the class to fulfill my language requirement. I was miserable. However, this semester was much better because I got a great teacher. The class itself is really boring\u0097 you focus on a single work (Apuleius) for the entire semester. Apuleius is so bad. How much you enjoy this class and how much you get out of it depends entirely on your teacher. So, make sure you get a good one.Basically, you spend every period translating. It's pretty low stress and you know what to expect each class.",
    "Yes, if Tommaso is teaching it.",
    "Intro Latin Prose is a wonderful experience, especially with Tommaso teaching. After getting a handle on grammar, this class is the enjoyable next step for increasing vocabulary and general comfort with the language. I can't believe how much I improved over the course of the term. Homework assignments were regular and substantial without being overwhelming, so long as you bring along some enthusiasm for the material and for improving your Latin. Class discussions were very fruitful; going over grammar and just talking about the sentences really drilled the vocabulary in without being painful. Overall, an excellent course!"
