   "comments": [
    "This course was absolutely incredible, mostly because it was taught by incredible professor (Eric Mandelbaum), who in addition to being one the most awesome people alive, knows how to put together a great course. You basically read through one article each week for 13 weeks, delving into particular topics in cognitive science. The articles are from BBS, so they were long, and typically very convoluted, but the class discussion and presentations that resulted were very, very meaningful. I learned so much about cognitive science from this course, I can't say enough. It's a very small course with only 10 students are so, all bringing their backgrounds together to have fantastic discussions about this discipline that we all love. I would take this every semester if I could.",
    "We read a current paper and the accompanying commentaries every week and basically just hash it out. if you like cogsci, this class will be so. much. fun.",
    "If you are a junior in the cog sci major, chances are Brian Scholl has promised that you'd eventually meet the other majors, but unless you went to the cogsci pizza dinner (hosted by one of the more enthusiastic 2013 majors), you probably haven't. So come on down, learn a lot, and meet everyone!",
    "Take this class, and don't consider dropping it.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course, but any prospective student should keep in mind that there is a fair amount of technical reading (depending on the instructor). However, you will definitely gain a lot from the classes and the readings."
