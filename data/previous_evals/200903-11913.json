   "comments": [
    "Readings are great, and the professor (although only a substitute) was wonderfully nice. Gives a lot of insight about pre-modern, medieval, and early Japan through the literature and in the backgrounds we read before the actual pieces. Shows the variety of Japanese literature and what each different type presents. Wonderful class.",
    "What you see is what you get. I know that this course is taught by different professors from year to year, but regardless, it's very solid material and there's not much you can do to mess that up. I think it's more dependent on what each specific professor brings to the table. I would highly recommend this course for anyone with an interest in Japanese language \/ literature or culture. As a literature major with an emphasis on Chinese literature, I also found it very rewarding overall, and I think it's a good course for lit majors in general.",
    "As a WR course, it's not too overwhelming- three open-ended papers discussing the literature, of 5 pages, 7 pages, and a final 10 pager. If you like the material, it's a very interesting course. There are some parts of the material I found less interesting (I doubt many of us have the aesthetic sensibilities to appreciate hundreds of haiku in a row) there are also some really incredible ones- Tale of Genji, Yotuya Kaidan, Hakkenden, and others.",
    "If you are interested in Japan and its early literature, this is obviously the class for you. The readings are not too long, and often interesting; the instructor is great and very approachable; and the essays, while challenging, are well-spaced and the opportunity of speaking with either the professor or the TA before the paper is due is always there. All in all, a great class.",
    "Literature 175 is an extremely quick scan of Japanese Classical Literature. I would recommend it to any student interested in Literature or Japanese culture.",
    "This class is a very good survey of classical Japanese literature. If you enjoy studying classical literature of any background, then you will certainly enjoy this class as well. The span of the material is a bit large, but I learned a lot and feel as though I understand Japanese literature and culture a lot more after taking this class."
