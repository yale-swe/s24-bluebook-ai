    "Yes! It does not matter how much art experience you have -- you cna be a complete amateur or incredibly skilled already. Take this class.",
    "This was a fantastic course. Professor Van Doren was incredibly prepared. Each class we'd start with a short lecture about a style or painter. Then we'd usually paint at a beautiful location on campus and try in particular to mimic that style. It was a great way to learn how to paint for those who hadn't before or learn how to grow as an artist by pushing yourself to try other styles. Also the museums we went to were very informative.This is the perfect course for someone who wants to do watercolor, wants a nice change up for a 5th class or for a class senior year. The professor is great, and it's nice to really get to know the other students in the class as well.",
    "if you want an easy class where you paint watercolors, whether or not you have any artistic skill, take this class. Van Doren's critiques are a",
    "This is a great class. It is pretty relaxed. We use the beginning of class to discuss the work of famous watercolor painters and in the second half of class we go to different locations around campus and paint. If you are looking for comprehensive instruction in basic painting technique, maybe look for a different class, but if you are looking for a relaxed atmosphere and an excuse to explore watercolor, learn about some famous painters and learn to appreciate the architecture of Yale's campus, this is for you!",
    "Mastering the Art of Watercolor was a great course for students who are not necessarily artists to take an art course. Watercolor is difficult, but this class makes it accessible and fun, and Professor Van Doren is an able teacher and artist. Each week there is a painting project during class and painting outside of class is also encouraged. The class is very generous with materials. There is also a final paper due toward the end of classes. Overall, I would recommend this course, especially if you want to improve your watercolor technique.",
    "This is an amazing course!! It was very difficult to get in to, but if you get in you should definitely take it!",
    "I joined this class to learn to paint in watercolor and throughout the semester I had the chance to practice during every class which I enjoyed. The discussions of famous watercolorists and their techniques was also interesting and the tours of the British Art Gallery and YUAG that we got were fantastic!However, I don't feel that I learned as much painting technique as I would have liked. I think perhaps focusing one or two lectures on pure painting technique and theory would have been helpful.If you have no art experience, this is a welcoming class, and if you do, you'll have a great time as well. Take this class if you've always wanted to try watercolor.",
    "Mastering the art of watercolor is simply put, one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale. In class the professor (who is himself an accomplished watercolorist and you can see his paintings of Yale in the Davenport Common Room) walks you through the great masters of watercolor in the past century, and leaves enough time so that you can go out and paint en plein air. The class combines wonderfully the training of the aesthetics and that of the hand. Whether you're beginner or a trained artist, as long as you're interested in the medium, the class gives you room to grow. Professor Van Doren tailors his advice so that even someone who's never picked up a pencil in his life wouldn't get left out, which the person's painted for 10 years would also feel that she's improved her technique.Take this class if you're interested at all in watercolor. It will be epic.",
    "Delightful! Such a good 5th or 6th class. I loved every moment of it! You don't need any background, but you'll learn a lot regardless of your initial skill level."
