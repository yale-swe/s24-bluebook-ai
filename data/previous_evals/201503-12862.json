   "comments": [
    "A great way to finish the EEB major.",
    "You're almost certainly taking this as a required course, and the nature of it depends on your research but it can be very enjoyable if you pick a good lab!",
    "If you want to get the B.S. for E&EB, you should totally take this class - Independent project in any field of biology of your choice and just ten hours of lab commitment per week. Since students typically enjoy their lab work, or are committed to producing fruitful results, many spend more than the required time in the lab. In that sense you have to choose between spending 20 hours on research per week, in which case you should be taking the 495 class.",
    "The class is very self-driven and lab dependent. I love my lab, which is why I enjoyed the course; however I can see how not liking your lab could make for an unpleasant experience. Additionally, I would recommend taking two semesters to work on your thesis. Things can go wrong and will go wrong with your experiments.",
    "Work is largely self-motivated and it's useful to be proactive about what needs to get done.",
    "If you are thinking about doing a thesis (and you need to for the BS), you probably are going to want to do a year-long project. It gives you a helpful buffer in the face of whatever technical issues and re-evaluations you need to undertake - and rest assured that this will happen. Plus, it gives you a lot more time to plan and to figure out what your thesis will look like, so that you are sure you are doing something that you want to do. Work on a project that interests you. Unfortunately the department doesn't provide too much formal help during the process, with essentially no deadlines to hit, but otherwise its pretty low-stress for the first semester and good overall as an experience, particularly if you find a good advisor.",
    "It's hard to evaluate this class, as obviously every student's research project will differ. It's an excellent chance to get some lab experience, though, which is valuable for anyone intending to pursue a career in science.",
    "E&EB 475 is incredibly useful for planning a Senior Thesis topic and designing an experiment. You will learn a great deal by going through the process of creating your own experiment and will receive unlimited guidance, as needed, from your advisor. If you need to fulfill your Senior Requirement for E&EB B.S., this is a great course to choose.",
    "Obviously if you want the B.S. you have to take it. Experiences will vary depending on your lab-- I happen to really like my lab.",
    "Senior research. If you're looking at this, you're probably taking it anyway."
