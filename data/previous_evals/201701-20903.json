    "I learned basic lab techniques, bolstered by understanding of material in my other science courses, and gained crucial lab experience before i embark on longer term projects in a research lab at Yale.",
    "I learned some very helpful lab procedures like DNA and protein techniques.",
    "Valuable laboratory skills",
    "I gained a basic familiarity with biochemistry lab protocols.",
    "I learned how to purify proteins, how to clone, and a little bit about how to perform experiments to measure enzyme kinetics.",
    "I felt that I really developed a sense of experimental design and how to write detailed reports in this class as well as understadning some of the leading concepts behind many importnat laboratory techniques.",
    "This course allowed me to learn about protein folding, and enzyme functionality more in depth. But most importantly, it helped me gains skills such as basic wet-lab techniques, scientific writing\/ formatting,and 3D imaging using PDB viewer."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great course set up. Loved the TAs. Great class size.",
    "Lectures could be clearer, structure of quizzes more transparent",
    "The experiments themselves were interesting, but the lecture portion of this class was painful. Everything you needed to know was included at the right level of detail in the lab manual, but every lecture went over all the material you already knew in excruciatingly painful levels of detail. It was way more detailed than required and did not in any way add to the course. There should be absolutely no lecture component to this course that takes longer than 20-30 minutes. It really ruined the experience and I dreaded having to come to this class.",
    "Strengths: better organized than MB&B 460L (not saying much). Good teaching fellows. Weaknesses: Long, repetitive lectures that were almost inaudible due to the loud exhaust-type noises in the room. Lectures were delivered by a professor who wasn't around during the laboratory work, so he didn't do a great job linking what we were talking about in the lecture to what was going on in the lab. Frequently a bit disorganized--for example, we were expected to include information in our lab report from structural software that didn't work well on everyone's computer. No one on the teaching staff anticipated or found a workaround for those problems; instead, we wasted a lot of class time discovering how poorly the software worked and waiting for everyone to find fixes. Expectations not always clear: for example, the lab manual said we could cite its protocols in the \"Methods\" section of our lab report, but I got docked a point for doing that.",
    "The course could vastly improve on guidance for quizzes some of the procedures. For someone who has not taken a biochemistry lecture course it was often hard to follow some of the laboratory procedures we were doing without doing a lot of backgorund research beforehand.",
    "I think the strengths of the course is that the quizzes keep you very goal-oriented during the lab, and helps you keep up with the material. Each week's labs builds on the previous lab so it is easy to follow along and retain a lot of what was learned. A few weaknesses include long lectures before lab, these didn't really help mainly because I could not really hear the professors."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to another student. It is a great way to learn lab techniques and enrich your science learning at Yale even if you haven't had experience prior to this class.",
    "The course in a half-semester format (2x a week, 1\/2 a semester) is a little intense. Since most of the lab days necessitate staying the full four hours or so, it's definitely time intensive. However, the skills are really helpful to know, so take if necessary.",
    "You'll get really good at pipetting and little else.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to; learn these biochemical techniques by working in a lab if you can. Much too much work and time for half a credit, and lectures are long and difficult to stay awake during. One big (12 pp.) lab report, one medium (8 pp.) lab report, two problem sets, and a quiz every week all crammed into half the semester, plus 6 or so hours of actual lab time a week. Sometimes poorly organized, and expectations for the lab reports were not always clear (or, rather, expectations *looked* clear in the lab manual, but reports were graded according to slightly different criteria.)",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have to take it.",
    "Yes, it is a good reinforcement for information learned in other intro - bio courses and it is not that bad of workload relative to other full year labs."
