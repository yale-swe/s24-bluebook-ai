    "It's a great class and I would definitely recommend it to another student. Really interesting course material and seminar always flew by.",
    "Yes!! Senior spring",
    "Fantastic class, so glad I got the opportunity. The strength is Adam and his genuine pleasure in teaching and supporting us. I also like his method of showing us great works and methods then having us try them. The general premise is you sketch here and there, and do a large work once a week. In reality you don't have to, but it'd be awesome if you did because you can really see results and it's a pleasure, especially during senior spring. Hopefully you get nice weather though.",
    "YES! I would HIGHLY recommend this course. Professor Ford is so awesome, and he vividly tells a story of an important trial in history in each class. You watch movies for homework and there is very little work!",
    "Solid course; it wasn't my favorite ever, but the cases are interesting and Prof Ford tells some great stories.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "An epic seminar. The perfect class to learn about America's most sensational trials and examine their consequence culturally and in the media. Lots of great philosophical debates regarding criminality, justice, and media coverage. Could not recommend this more. Jack Ford is a silver fox and a caring professor.",
    "Trials is a delightful course and I would definitely recommend it to another student. The material is very interesting - Professor Ford has put together a very interesting list of the some of the most important and influential trials of the last century - and Professor Ford is extremely engaging and cares a lot about his students. Take it!",
    "YES!!!! One of the best classes that I have"
