    "HSAR 380 provided me with a deep understanding of the major developments in contemporary art from 1945-2000. The class helped me to understand the intersections of art and issues of gender, race, ability, and other identities. I learned how to engage with high-level theory and apply these frameworks to my study of art. I also was able to improve my art historical writing immensely thanks to the feedback I received from my TF.",
    "This course taught me a lot about different periods and artists in contemporary art. I gained a lot of knowledge about the contribution of specific artists to fields in contemporary art, and gained extensive knowledge about the few I chose to write my papers on.",
    "A critical vocabulary with which to evaluate art since 1945 and understand its context.",
    "I gained a thorough understanding of certain art historical and critical theories from 1945 onward. I also improved my writing abilities.",
    "A decent background on different trends of art since 1945. Also some insight into various branches of theory after WWII.",
    "Great understanding of various philosophical movements of art during the contemporary period. Familiarity with the trends around depicting\/using bodies in art, just as advertised. It was especially helpful to parse through art theory texts properly and thoroughly. The essay assignments also push you to engage with theory and help in that respect as well."

   "comments": [
    "the lecture slides were kind of hard to follow. maybe it would be good to have more slides with text. if i misheard a word it would often be hard to find my place after",
    "Great course overall. My only issue with this course were some of the assignments. The first quiz we had (on lecture, not image IDs) was ridiculous. I understand it was a tool to see who had been attending lecture, but the minute details that it focused on made it impossible to study for. HSAR classes should be bringing people in rather than weeding them out. While the other assignments were great, I wish we got feedback just a little bit more quickly. It would have been helpful to have old papers before we completed our new ones.",
    "Lectures should not be delivered as reading off a well written analysis:paper of a piece its nkt engaging and it was very very difficult to understand Mercer is a legend but his material was honeslty impenetrable for people who dont have a background which isnt fair",
    "Strength: I found the content really interesting. I liked how each lecture was based on a completely different topic to last. Weakness: I sometimes found the presentation style hard to follow. Also, each assignment was only based on one lecture, so it would be good if the course linked more.",
    "It was pretty dry",
    "The course was extremely strong; very engaging material, excellent lecturer, great TAs. Only improvement could be on more specific rubric\/expectations for written assignments.",
    "The course itself had very interesting lectures which made the class enjoyable. However, the sections for class did not coincide with what was happening in the lectures. This made the material more difficult to understand because it would not be discussed until a few weeks after.",
    "I understand it is a lecture - but it would be great to have slightly more interaction with Professor Mercer.",
    "More of an overall structure: it was hard to draw a line between the different lectures and topics.",
    "Great readings which my TF helped us parse through properly. Assignments and grade breakdowns could be listed ahead of time (particularly the final paper--we received the prompt quite late). Lectures were quite fast paced and information dense, making them sometimes hard to follow. TF did a great job pulling out themes and theories that recurred, so the arc of the course was clarified."

    "yes, if they want to take it",
    "HSAR 380 is a great class for anybody in the WGSS\/AFAM\/HSAR department. It's a difficult course to take if you're new to art history, but it can be rewarding if you keep up with the readings and meet with your TF. It is graded very realistically--a good class to take credit\/d. It's a class that will challenge your preconceptions of what art can be; every class period I left impressed by the creative approaches taken by both the artists and Professor Mercer's interpretations.",
    "I would. I think this class is interesting. I defitnely found some lectures a lot more engaging than others, but I am glad I took the course.",
    "I would, but it was pretty dry and hard to follow sometimes",
    "Absolutely. The instructor was amazing and the material was fascinating and important.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is interesting to learn about modern art and the lectures are very interesting.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the subject matter.",
    "Not the most engaging class, but not bad either. The lectures are pretty interesting, but the readings are just too much. It would seem a strong candidate to Credit\/D: interesting topic, but not one that you should necessarily spend a huge amount of time worrying about your grade for.",
    "Yes. Great for art history students wanting a more thorough and deeper understanding of 1945-present. Great readings and lectures (though very fast paced and formally written). Assignments push you to engage with art theory more deeply, and that was quite helpful."
