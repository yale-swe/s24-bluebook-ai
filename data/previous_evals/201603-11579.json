    "how to read religious texts, how to critically analyze a religion, understanding buddhism in the modern context and how it differs from older traditions, buddhist thought and practice",
    "This class was a great introduction into the theory, history, and literature of the Buddhist world. I have studied Buddhism in informal ways at monasteries, etc but this class was different because I got an incredible foundation in the texts and theories of the religion. Professor Quintman made sure to always prioritize pedagogical questions as we got through the content - we had discussions about how to read primary source literature, how to think about history and the influence of Western thought on how we approach Asian religions, etc. This class was also a good intro into the frameworks and questions of religious studies, using Buddhism as a case study.",
    "This course was very interesting throughout and allowed me to get a deeper understanding of the Buddhist tradition. This topic was not one that I was familiar with beforehand, but due to the excellent instruction, I was able to grasp a lot of information.",
    "It was a comprehensive overview of Buddhism.",
    "Analysis",
    "This course helped me think more broadly not only about Buddhism, but also about religion at large.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about a field that I never thought that I would encounter.I have a new, detailed understanding and appreciation for Buddhism.",
    "I was able to interact with primary religious texts and place them into existing discourses about the religion. I also feel that the scope of the course was very comprehensive, but did not generalize, creating a broad picture of Buddhist thought and practice while acknowledging the vast complexities. All told, an excellent introduction that made me want to learn more.",
    "Learned a lot about Buddhist meditation, the history of Buddhism and its various schools, the diversity of practices, and much, much more.",
    "A basic introduction to the Buddhist religion. Key terms, ideas, and applications of the religion.",
    "A comprehensive view of Buddhism in relation to its history as well as practice. I learned about how religions are all very similar and about modern manifestations of buddhism as well."

   "comments": [
    "It would have been cool to have more demonstrations and hands-on ways of understanding the material. Especially when we were talking about no-self\/emptiness, it was sometimes hard to grasp by just reading the texts",
    "Many of the readings for this course are dense. This is the nature of ancient religious texts, but it was definitely hard to get through many of the readings. The development of the course followed the passage of time, which made the presentation of content clear and logical. Professor Quintman is an expert on every single topic we covered, able to field any question and able to present the information in a clear and accessible way. The assignments were cool in that they incorporated ancient ideas and texts with modern technology or modern applications, making the content seem relevant.",
    "I very much enjoyed the reading and paper assignments. Most papers can be not only time-consuming but also tedious. These assignments, and in particular the Encyclopedia entry, were more fun and unique.",
    "Amazing Professor",
    "The greatest weakness of the course was that many of the students seemed to be taking the class Cr\/D\/F. Professor made an effort to engage students with discussion time built into the lectures, but the performance of students was disappointing. Professor's lectures were interesting, though, so the course could be improved if more class time was spent on lecture instead of discussion.",
    "Overall, the course was great! The lectures were always engaging and often left me wanting more even after the class was over. Difficult and abstract concepts were presented in an accessible way. By far, the greatest strength of this class is the professor. Professor Quintman's passion and enthusiasm for the study of Buddhism was built into every lecture. The only potential weakness of the course was the provisional \"discussion sections.\" Mark was a great TF who is incredibly knowledgeable, cares deeply that his students understand the material, and is able to facilitate meaningful discussions. The time constraints, however, really hindered discussion. Often, after leaving the shortened lecture, we would be left with less than twenty minutes to talk about readings that require more time to better understand the topics it covers.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. It was a relaxing but interesting lecture and atmosphere throughout the semester.",
    "A strength of this course was the variety of the reading materials and types of assignments. I wish, however, that there was more space for discussion. We had a lot less time for student engagement within the classroom than I would have liked - I'm so interested in what the other students had to say!",
    "Strengths are definitely Prof. Quintman--fantastic and engaging prof. A weakness, though, may be seen in the structuring of the course--it gave a sense sometimes of temporal progression when we moved to new material, when in fact there was much more continuity and synchronicity. Maybe just some reminders as new material is introduced that these are not necessarily historical progressions of the tradition, just the necessary limitations of engaging with this material in a course format. Very few weaknesses overall, though--and clearly even this one listed here is somewhat intrinsic to the medium.",
    "It was a great course--few weaknesses. Strengths wise--i learned a lot in lecture but also got to engage with canonical texts during homework. When we had discussions they were lively and engaging."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a student if youre interested in religious studies or Buddhism. Professor Quintman is a great lecturer and you learn a lot about Buddhism. Coursework is interesting and not that heavy. The last few weeks of class are very interesting because you get to talk about Buddhism in the modern world",
    "For anyone interested in religious studies, this is a great introductory course. The questions presented and the frameworks for thinking about the material reveal what religious studies is supposed to examine. For anyone interested in Buddhism, this course is good for learning about the theories behind the practices in different traditions in different countries throughout time.",
    "Yes, you should absolutely take this class. It was remarkably well-taught and the material was interesting and often unexpected. If you really engage with the material, this class can be incredibly valuable. You have the opportunity to learn about Buddhism (and challenge your prior assumptions about what Buddhism is), and also learn about the world from the Buddhist point of view. This class is certainly worth taking.",
    "Yes I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Quintman is an excellent professor. He is very eloquent and knowledgeable about the subject material. He makes the process fun and enjoyable.",
    "it allows you to think critically about religion",
    "Incredible class! If you have any interest in Buddhism, take this course! You'll gain a broad understanding of Buddhism and the ideas and practices that surround it. And Professor Quintman is an amazing professor who deeply cares for his students.",
    "I would very much recommend this course to another student. It was an absolutely amazing experience, it's content helping facilitate very useful and helpful development in my worldview as well as my approach to my time at Yale. More importantly, however, the course is very helpful in developing the tools one has to critically introduce ideas into one's own life. The balance between philosophical exploration and rigorous academic critique of Buddhist ideas was core to the class. Thus, if one were to read a philosophical text with the intent of introducing new philosophy into one's life, this course could be instrumental in developing",
    "This class was definitely worth taking. It was easy to learn and I feel that I know more about the world as Buddhism is a popular religion.",
    "I would indeed. As I mentioned, it's a great introduction to the field.",
    "Yes! Very much. This is the kind of class that makes Yale great. For the first time being here I felt \"THIS is the kind of class a top university offers.\" I haven't always felt that at Yale, but Prof. Quintman is as good as teachers come.",
    "If they are interested in religion and spirituality, absolutely. It could be dry if you werent fascinated by the content but I think it was awesome!"
