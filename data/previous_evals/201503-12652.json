   "comments": [
    "This course was a comprehensive overview of the liberal-democratic public sphere model, from its inception to the present day. It covered civic republicanism, nationalism, and the various historical transformations of the American media landscape, including capitalization and digitalization. I would recommend the seminar - the readings were intriguing, and I liked Professor Sleeper's style and take on things - with the caveat that occasionally discussions seemed to lack fire because people largely agreed on the main issues and the ways that we should resolve them. Occasionally, units also felt somewhat \"from 30,000 feet\" - it's hard to cover any one topic in depth, especially when those topics are as multifaceted as capitalism, nationalism, globalization, and the erosion of America's civil fabric.",
    "I would recommend Journalism, Liberalism, Democracy to every humanities student. Actually, I really think it should be its own distributional requirement. So many courses here, especially engineering courses, shroud students in a vocational future. This course helps you realize Yale's stake in the world. This is an influential place and the graduates have the capacity to make an immense impact in their post-college careers. For that reason, Sleeper's course takes a stepback from all the fuss about the future and evaluates the modern world as a whole.",
    "I'm not quite sure if I'd recommend this class. The material is very interesting and relevant. It will make you think a lot about the quality of political discourse in this country and about technology and where we're heading. The readings are great. Professor Sleeper is a little overbearing at times, sending out multiple emails in a week about the readings telling you exactly what to think (instead of just letting you do the readings and then bring your own ideas to discussion). Not too much work.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially to another EP&E major. Taking this seminar has significantly changed my worldview: learning about models of the public sphere gives you a new and different way to conceptualize both journalism and democracy. This seminar is a great way to start thinking about the greater themes of EP&E, and I found that using journalism as a case study really helped me understand some of the ways ethics, politics, and economics are increasingly connected in today's world. Don't be afraid to take this class even if you are not a \"journalist.\" Coming into the seminar, I often worried that because I'd never written a YDN column or interned at a major newspaper, I wouldn't be able to participate as fully in the discussion. That was certainly not the case! There's a place in Professor Sleeper's classroom for anyone who loves politics, public opinion, or the news. One major caveat: This seminar involves a significant amount of reading that you really do need to do each week in order to be fully prepared for the long and intense discussions. If you feel like you might need to skimp on more than a couple weeks' readings, you might want to think about taking a different class.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in discussing what a democratic public sphere looks like, what challenges public-interested oriented journalism faces, how capitalism and digitalisation pose threats to democracy etc. Sometimes the discussions are not very concrete but they help you reflect on some phenomena you probably already feel in your life, e.g. the less-than-satisfactory quality of news and political debates in today's media, the populist discourse in today's public sphere, the oftentimes horrible way debates work on the Internet etc. The course strengthens your sense of civic-republican duty and gives you a better sense of the challenges you will face in a somewhat chaotic public sphere. Prof. Sleeper cares a lot about the course materials and the class. Beware, this is not a political philosophy class, the discussions are often not very rigorous. It's more about discussing social phenomena and see how viable the liberal democratic model public-sphere is in today's capitalistic digitalised society. You will read some Habermas and Benhabib but won't get into the theoretical details. You might be disappointed if you are looking for theory and philosophy. You won't do journalism in the class but the kind of civic-republican spirit and the commitment to liberal-democratic public sphere that this course cultivates is important for future journalists.",
    "This class has interesting readings, but you do well only if Professor Sleeper likes you. I have never been in a class where a professor so overtly picks favorites. He calls more on people he likes and personally emails them for long meetings. For people that are not his favorites, he is often unavailable for meetings, and does not call on them as much. Its pretty overt favoritism, and he recruits for the class among people who have similar opinions i.e., condemning Yale NUS. This is a citizenship class be a mensch, and heres how but he has a fixed perspective of citizenship, which allows for almost no room for disagreement. The readings themselves were interesting (although not at all academic) a lot of think pieces about digital journalism and civic republicanism. For all you Harry Potter lovers out there, think Professor Slughorn and the Slug Club. If youre in the club, congratulations. If youre not, youre in for a semester of frustration and simmering outrage an overwhelming sense of I have something to actually say about this, but either am too embarrassed to speak or do not get called upon anyways, so its irrelevant. There are right answers in this class, and they are Professor Sleepers opinions. Id recommend taking it if only to do the readings, and only if you want a real-world experience with favoritism. I think he also condemned those students who wished to go to the March of Resilience, which baffled me because this class was supposed to be an exercise in citizenship. And whether or not he agreed with the proceedings or the message, this was a moment in Yales history that tested the active citizenship of Yales community. Much more of a preach rather than a practice. One of the most infuriating academic experiences of my career.",
    "This course gives you a good understanding of how we as students and as people can make the world a better place, simply by being more aware of what it means to uphold one's civic duty. Readings each weak are dense (some weeks more than others) so come prepared to seminar having a good understanding of the readings. If you are willing to put in the work each week (and that does not include just doing the reading the night before), then you have the opportunity to make a very meaningful experience out of the class. If you do not foresee that you will be able to carve out time for it, then do not bother - you will fall behind and it will become more of a task\/chore than a learning\/growing experience",
    "I would say don't take it. Too brainwashy, not really academically rigorous. Just basically liberal good-guys and -girls sitting in a room and talking about decline of kindness\/print-journalism in america.",
    "This is a great course that I would recommend to anyone interested in learning about what makes a democracy work. The readings are, for the most part, incredibly interesting. I bore of philosophy, and though some of these readings were philosophy-heavy, I still loved them. Be prepared to invest a good amount of time and thought into the class. There are often a good number of readings, but more than that, Professor Sleeper sends emails constantly. It's obvious from the emails that he cares deeply about his students, but waking up to two full-length novellas every morning can make it feel as if the class is omnipresent in your life. All of this said, this class taught me how to think about democracy, society, and what type of world I want to live in. It also taught me how to be a better, more engaged, and thoughtful person. I would highly recommend it.",
    "It was a great class. Professor Sleeper asks a lot from students, but it's worth it. The class is more of a \"civics class\" in that it covers a wide swath of theory about American citizenship and its relationship to journalism and the public sphere. I recommend it! It's not too much work and not very difficult.",
    "The course material is interesting and easy to engage withthe class is honestly like a civics class. Professor Sleeper is an inspiring man and capable seminar leader. He is so engaged with the course material and the pursuit of civic republican values that it can't help but be infectious. The workload is extremely manageable. Also, be prepared not to know what your grade is or literally anything about how you're graded until the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students if they want to know how America came to be this way, as per the opinion of some odd number of American thinkers and journalists. Smart class for smart people. Captures the spirit of Yale, and liberal arts education, always stressing the importance of self-criticality."
