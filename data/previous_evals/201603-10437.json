    "How instruments observe astronomical objects and how people reduce the obtained data",
    "This course was my first ever astro course. It was also my first ever data science \/ stats course. I had taken Phys 200 and 201, as well as a year of university CS and math. It is hard to overstate my satisfaction with how much I learned through this course. In terms of data science, programming, and statistics: I learned, in Python, things like plotting data; creating color images from RGB data; reducing noise in images and signals; measuring errors via Monte Carlo simulations; fitting Gauss, sine, polynomial, etc. functions to data via chi^2 fitting and other techniques; determining local optima; plotting histograms and understanding uses of mode, mean, median; deriving star locations in an image; determining the shift between two images. I became familiar with these Python libraries (among others): Numpy, SciPy, AstroPy, Matplotlib. In terms of astrophysics, I learned about research instruments: optical and radio telescopes and spectrographs. I learned about Astro topics and recent discoveries: planets, asteroids and comets; red shifting and Einstein's laws; dark matter; star clusters (color magnitude diagrams); galaxies (H1, W50, gas fraction); star temperature and mass (black body curves, Planck's law, Wein's law); stellar mass black holes. For each of these topics, we had a mixed theory \/ programming problem set, which caused us to learn the topics at a very deep level. The last day of class was devoted to graduate school, which was hugely helpful.",
    "I learned so much in this course! I feel like I have a real understanding of the processes used by astrophysics researchers to reduce and analyze data.",
    "This class was very helpful in developing my coding skills as well as preparing me for graduate school in Astronomy. I learned much more about how to approach research in Astronomy and become better at it!",
    "Astro 255 was excellent in learning ways to manipulate and interpret data through the use of computational tools. It was a great way to put a lot of astronomy knowledge from previous courses into context and helps develop a useful skillset for research in many areas, not just astronomy. Professor Geha is really amazing-- highly recommended for science majors!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Geha was very kind and energetic. She frequently changed the class schedule so that the students can learn the most from the classes. However, I think the professor was a little too kind. I could have learnt more if she had been more strict about pset dues.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Geha is and excellent teacher whose enthusiasm for Astrophysics is infectious. She has deep knowledge of many different branches of Astro and yet knows how to explain them to beginners, like me. Mila, the TA, is incredibly smart and a good explainer of things. Both were very approachable. The course threw a huge amount of content at us, but the material and particularly the research techniques (i.e. techniques in Python) built on themselves in a logical way. Weaknesses: Occasionally, the end of class would function as a hands-on programming session. This was helpful, but notifying students who otherwise like taking notes by hand to bring their laptops would be nice (sometimes they did notify us). Also, the problem sets could be worded a bit more procedurally -- it was sometimes a guessing game as to how a certain English sentence was to be interpreted statistically\/programmatically. However, after they took student feedback on the matter, I did notice an improvement along these lines.",
    "There has to be more of a notification at the beginning that you will be in some deep yogurt if you have never coded before, preferably in python.",
    "The strength in this course lies in how dedicated Professor Geha and Mila were to making sure we actually understood what we were doing. The emphasis was placed more on learning than it was necessarily on grades. I appreciated that very much. The class, particularly in the beginning, was quite weak in the coding help it provided to students. If someone came in without knowing how to code at all, they would struggle immensely.",
    "This course was great at teaching how to deal with data sets, how to perform different forms of reduction and manipulation, and provided necessary astronomy background for non-majors, as well as instrumentation knowledge for everyone. The only setback of this course is that it says no computer programming background necessary in the description-- although it is possible to struggle through and learn a huge amount without computing background, it is certainly very helpful to have it. No computing background will make this course significantly harder and more time-consuming than it needs to be."

   "comments": [
    "I highly recommend this course if you are interested in astronomy. Psets may be sometimes hard, but what this course teaches will surely excite you.",
    "YES, yes, yes. Yes. Take this course with Professor Marla Geha. Not knowing astro is not an excuse. Not knowing CS is not an excuse. Not knowing stats is not an excuse. You will learn all these things and more. You will feel like a real researcher by the middle, let alone the end. Do you want to search for black holes in the Milky Way? Do you want to prove the existence of dark matter, accounting for error bars? Do you want to, from raw telescope data, create the type of beautiful color images that appear on Astronomy Picture of the Day? Do you want to simulate the solar system? Do you want to learn skills and make connections that can carry you to graduate school, summer research, finance or tech jobs, you name it? Yes, you do. A note: this course is not for the faint of heart. If you're doing it right, this course will become the center of your attention, as it deserves.",
    "If you are astro or cs, yes. Astro, obviously, you need to take it. CS, you can code, so thats like 60% of the course. Otherwise, don't.",
    "Take this course! Professor Geha is absolutely amazing and one of the best, if not the best, teacher I've had at Yale. She is passionate about her work and even more passionate about getting others to understand. The workload is difficult, but help is provided so it's not impossible. I learned a lot from taking this class, and even though it was hard, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",
    "This is a great course for learning how to deal with science data using python and gives you a useful skillset for a research context. Professor Geha is really patient and really cares about her students. The only setback of this course is that it says no computer programming background necessary in the description-- although it is possible to struggle through and learn a huge amount without computing background, it is certainly very helpful to have it. No computing background will make this course significantly harder and more time-consuming than it needs to be. If you are looking for an easy science credit, this is definitely not it, but if you are a science major looking a for a substantive elective, this is great. If you are an astro major, you have no choice, but don't worry it's really good, just have some computing background-- not impossible without it, just a lot harder."
