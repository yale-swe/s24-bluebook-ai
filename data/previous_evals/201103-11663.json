    "is the best econ seminar at yale.",
    "YES. YES. YES I recommend this class to everyone. Material is very well taught and very understandable.",
    "ECON 108 is great! If you have the opportunity to take micro in this format, versus in the lecture, please do. You get so much attention from the professor and really start to invest yourself in the material. I wouldn't have changed anything about this class.",
    "Econ 108 is a great introductory course in Economics for students who have not taken calculus- it is really manageable even if a student does not have a strong background in math because Professor Koker is really helpful and makes sure that students understand the material. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because you can learn a lot in the course and Professor Koker makes the class really interesting and fun because he doesn't just teach the principles of economics, he also applies it to current events.",
    "I would recommend this class to any student who wishes to get an intro grasp on economics. You really don't need to know ay math besides basic algebra which is AMAZING. You will come away having learnt a lot if Econ is totally foreign to you like it was for me.",
    "If you're lucky enough to get it. take it.",
    "TAKE THIS IF TOLGA TEACHES!",
    "Economics 108 is an amazing course. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you want to take Microeconomics, but are not so sure about your math, this class is designed to you. Tolga will always help you if you need and want to."
