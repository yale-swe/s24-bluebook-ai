   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Though it meets everyday, it is not at all unmanageable, and the classes fly by. By the end, you really feel like you have improved greatly in the language.",
    "Spanish 140 is a class designed for an advanced speaker who still needs to work on mastering grammar concepts so as to reach full confidence with the language. It is a great class to take that doesn't just drill grammar concepts and vocabulary, but is more based around small group discussions. Highly recommended.",
    "If you have to take this class, take it with Ame. She's probably the best teacher I've ever had. I started taking Spanish in 7th grade and placed into L2 (read: I'm horrible at Spanish), and hated L2 and L3, but she made me actually enjoy Spanish for the first time ever. If you've always hated Spanish and you want to take a semester of it in which you learn a LOT, have a lot of fun, and get a good grade, take it with Ame.",
    "SPAN140 is an awesome class to improve your speaking and grammar skills while introducing you to more of the literature in the Spanish culture. I would take it if you are considering a spanish major or if you need to fulfill a language requirement. If possible, definitely take it with Ame Cividanes. Although it might sound intimidating that she is the head of the Spanish department, she is THE nicest teacher on campus and is extremely kind and fair with her grading. She is also an awesome lecturer.",
    "Great L4 class. Moves quickly but keeping up isn't too bad. Definitely more involved than L3.",
    "I would definitely recommend. It's basically the same as all the other levels but you have already learned most of the grammar, vocab and conjugations. This class is mainly application of the language.",
    "Spanish 140 does a great job of broadening your vocabulary and grammar knowledge. It exposes you to a wide range of topics and diverse literature. I would highly recommend the course.",
    "This is a solid course I'm sure with any professor. However, Professor Cividanes makes this a fantastic course. She will challenge you, and you will have to improve, but she will encourage you every step of the way. If you are debating whether or not to take L4, you won't regret taking this course.",
    "Take it if you need it for a language credit or just want to continue to improve your proficiency in spanish. I recommend taking it with Cividanes. The grammar is more difficult, but you finally start to feel like you can legitimately speak spanish. The second half of the class exposes you to a film and novel which help begin the transition to a more natural\/native manner of speaking spanish."
