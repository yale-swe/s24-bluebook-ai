   "comments": [
    "Information-heavy class, but Professor Brown is such a wonderful professor and really cares about this subject matter. If the topic (drugs) seems interesting to you, I would definitely recommend taking this course. And there are cookies freshly baked by his wife each week which is awesome.",
    "I would definitely recommend PSYCH 321 if you are interested in the field, it covers basically everything there is to know about psychopharmacology.",
    "This is a great course. Definitely take it if you are interested in therapeutic or recreational drugs. Very similar curriculum to Drugs Brain and Behavior but probably more interesting if you already have some background in psych or bio. Coursework is not overwhelming at all.",
    "A fascinating collection of details. Don't take the class if you're not good at memorizing things.",
    "You will definitely learn applicable and useful information about drugs and substances in this course. the exam set up is very nice: there are four exams focuses on about 5 lectures each, which is way less stressful than a midterm and final.",
    "Definitely recommend for people with science or non-science backgrounds.",
    "It's a dry class but the material will get you thinking about all the different drugs out there.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you're at all interested in the medical aspects of drugs. That is, not just what neurotransmitters are involved, but the effects drugs have on the body and in pharmaceutical situations. I REALLY recommend that you should only take this class if you have a strong background in biology or chemistry - the class goes into quite a bit of detail about what the underlying mechanisms of drug interactions are, and if you don't have any prior knowledge of neuroscience (much like me), you will struggle. That being said, I got a lot out of the class and really did enjoy it.",
    "!!!!! Psychopharmacology is a fantastic class, perhaps the best class I have taken at Yale. The material covers all sorts of drugs from dietary supplements to antipsychotics to heroin. Each chapter is packed full of interesting tidbits, and you really leave the class with a better understanding of psychotropic drugs and pharmacology in general. Professor Brown is not only knowledgable and engaging but also a genuinely sweet person, and the course material was excellent. Additionally, as other reviews may state, his wife bakes cookies weekly that he brings for the class (and they're damn good too). There is a lot of information packed into four non-cumulative midterms (and no final), but as long as you're okay with cramming a bit four times over the course of the semester, I recommend this class to anyone with a decent biology background and an interest in the topic matter. This class is small and run by application at the beginning of the year, with preference given to upperclassmen, but I as a (fairly well-qualified) sophomore was able to beg my way in after being initially rejected from the first-day list. Unfortunately, Professor Brown is going on sabbatical all next year, but when he comes back for the Spring 2017 iteration of this class, take it take it take it.",
    "It's a very interesting course, but you really have to commit to spending time reviewing the material because the tests can be a little specific.",
    "This is a great class. It was a very doable credit\/d as the reading isn't important and a basic review of the lectures before class was sufficient to pass. I kind of wish I had taken the class for credit and worked harder in it as it was really interesting, but no regrets (and there were cookies every week!) If you want to take this class, fill out the application on classesV2 ASAP. It's capped and picks by seniority, background, and when the application was filled out.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was interesting, informative, and fun to learn all the material. The first chunk of the class is on recreational drugs, and then we start talking about drugs used to treat various illnesses. I thought I would find the second half significantly more boring than the first half but both were informative and interesting."
