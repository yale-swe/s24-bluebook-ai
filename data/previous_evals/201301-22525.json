    "The lectures are a bit disorganized and don't really help with the mini-papers, yet the big ideas instilled through out the semester will aid writing the final paper.",
    "Gelernter rants which can sometimes be good and can sometimes be bad. Shop it if you're interested in the topic and then see how you like him. He is a smart guy, and I like the topic so I was mostly happy. Not much work and writing 300 word essays is actually a very useful exercise.",
    "A strange class. If you're expecting to look at GUIs, the slow pace and emphasis on art history will frustrate you. Really, we talk about designs and elegance. You're not here to learn facts. Prof. Gelernter will challenge you, and he's not afraid to call you stupid. Your grades aren't based on how smart you are or how well you thinkyou can write, but if you can adapt to his writing style and clearly express original, critical thinking, you'll do okay. The class will make you a better editor, even if you don't agree with all of his rules.",
    "It was a great class",
    "A history class on the birth of computers and user interfaces, definitely not a technical or CS class. Interesting at times. You'll come out knowing random facts about how computers came to be. Really low workload. Four 300-word assignments, and one 1500-word final paper. Can be stressful if Professor Gelernter doesn't like your writing.",
    "This is an interesting seminar that deals with the aspects of great design and the evolution of the graphical user interface (that sounds technical, but no CS background is necessary at all). Professor Gelernter is an interesting speaker and is knowledgeable both about technology and culture\/design. Because of this the course covers quite a diverse range of topics which I found interesting. The writing assignments are short (four 300 word responses and 5 page paper) but Professor Gelernter is a tough editor - though he is open and dedicated to helping students improve their writing. I learned a lot and I do recommend this course!",
    "This class has its pros and cons. The workload is extremely minimal: four short (300 word) assignments throughout the semester followed by a longer (1500 word) final paper. All in all, that's about 9 double-spaced pages for a WR, easily the best ratio I've seen at Yale (I really don't like writing). Since the assignments are so short, you don't really have to know that much of the material. He gives you printouts of the chapters that he assigns for reading, and the pace at which he covers these readings is not fast at all. His lectures (discussions?) are pretty interesting if you care about the material, but can get boring sometimes when he goes on long tangents. The professor himself isn't boring, so that makes class better than if he were a really quiet and monotone speaker. One thing I noticed is that his grading is ridiculously tough. I hope the final grades are curved, but if not, this class has the lowest\/hardest grading scheme of any class I've seen here so far. Basically, if you don't care about your grade and want a WR for barely any work, take it. Alternately, if you're really interested in the material (and don't care about your grade), take it.",
    "I would highly recommend the course to anyone, regardless of discipline. His writing tips are invaluable, and the sheer volume and variety of various subjects covered in the pursuit of the knowledge of design is inspiring.",
    "A+",
    "This class is very light on work and doesn't cover that much material, but the subject is interesting and not covered by any other classes currently. The assignments are brief but graded carefully."
