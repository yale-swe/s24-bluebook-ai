It definitely was a breadth over depth situation, so I was left wishing we had gone in a little more depth on some of the topics; in the end, a good deal of what we learned felt like vocabulary. Nonetheless, it was an interesting survey of a field that combines many interesting topics in math, CS, statistics and linguistics.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the homeworks, especially towards the end of the course, could have done a better job teaching the material. The work towards the end was just fill in then blank as opposed to actually learning or thinking about it. Other than that the course was pretty good and interesting.",
    "This class has ended up being a disappointment for me. It is by no means a bad class, but I think it either a) didn't do a good job of covering basic concepts, or b) didn't do a good job of warning off students that they need certain basic concepts that will not be taught in class to get the most out of the class. The basic concepts I refer to mostly concern the mathematical foundation\/basics behind a lot of the algorithms, IN PARTICULAR NEURAL NETWORKS. We never did a thorough mathematical explanation of how neural networks, getting into how backpropagation works and why etc. Without this kind of understanding, jumping into convoluted, complex cutting-edge architectures like the latest RNNs, CNNs, GAN, LSTM etc. was pretty useless because none of the students could precisely explain what any of these things were\/how they worked and why. Which left us using a lot of high-level Theano code, which is fine in practice, but without the basic understanding of how all this works I think many students will be leaving with only the very shallow\/superficial knowledge of how a couple of functions in a library that will obsolete in 2 years work. Again, not a bad class, but I think I'm really disappointed because the professor and teaching assistants are so talented and wonderful that I feel like this could have been a great class.",
    "Drago is cool and he knows his stuff. Lectures are very fast and students are not sure what the important concepts are. It is also difficult to pay attention in lecture. Homeworks are a little bit confusing, doesn't require a lot of coding, but you will definitely need to go to office hours to get it done. Exams are not very well designed. The questions on the exam sometimes contain many details that you might gloss over while revising, and does not test conceptual understanding of the subject.",
    "Very interesting field, boring lectures. Problem sets sometimes poorly specified but not too hard. Drago is a very knowledgeable professor.",
    "Bless me lord Drago",
    "Strengths: lectures (engaging, interesting) Weaknesses: some psets (3rd one took forever, 4th very poorly designed)",
    "I thought that most of the homework honestly wasn't that helpful for understanding NLP topics. Since we were usually implementing one small part of a larger system, it was easy to just implement the algorithms given in the spec without actually understanding what the system was doing as a whole. For example on HW3, we're implementing a small part of a neural network, but even though I followed the instructions I don't understand why doing what we did should enable the system to learn to answer questions - i.e. it was too easy to just follow instructions and get full points without actually understanding anything about the problem. The only HW that really helped me understand anything was the Viterbi one.",
    "The problem sets were often disappointing, and consisted of filling in a small chunk of code within a framework of code set up by Drago. Really, the student's role in implementing the concept that the pset focused on was super trivial and the majority of the work was done by the teaching staff beforehand. That is the challenge with learning about advanced concepts in a survey course, because it's impossible to actually learn the skills necessary to implement things on your own. Coming up with psets that gave students a little bit more control over the implementation would be effective in fostering more thorough understanding of the concepts.",
    "We covered a lot of different topics, which was great, but sometimes it was hard to know what the main takeaways were supposed to be. Perhaps each slide deck could also come with a list of key concepts or takeaways.",
    "Sometimes the pset specifications were a little vague, but Piazza really came through. The TAs and other students were responding to Piazza questions super quickly (thanks participation points) so it was pretty good. I think there was SOO much material that we could have known it was a little overwhelming, but honestly it was a good survey class. Prof. Radev is a good lecturer who knows his stuff. Midterm and final were very fair, although I think they are more algorithm focused than the practice he gave us.",
    "Strength: Cutting edge tech. Weakness: You don't really learn anything well enough to implement them from scratch.",
    "Course syllabus changed very much to accommodate the large class size. Course skims over many topics and fails to delve into any one. Left the class knowing that certain techniques existed but not having a clue how they worked and how to implement them.",
    "This course was a great introduction to the field of NLP. It covered a variety of topics that were all interesting and touched on the problems people try to solve in the field of NLP. I would have enjoyed the time to go more in depth on various topics but this course is definitely a good survey of the field and motivates students for further investigation into specific NLP topics if they choose.",
    "Drago taught an amazingly well organized organized class, well taught, and engaging. Drago is the man!!",
    "More of the material that's on the tests could also be on the psets, but honestly, this is among the least serious problems a class could have.",
    "A lot of material. Material is very interesting and relevant, but sometimes not that well structured\/seems all over the place.",
    "The course covered a lot of interesting material, but sometimes I felt like we were going over the material too quickly. Moreover, Radev is really cool but he speaks super fast.",
    "NLP is a comprehensive survey of the relevant concepts you need, from probability to neural networks. As such, it's pretty fast paced and lectures can go by quickly. The problem sets go deeper and are engaging. Make sure to start them way in advance though. Exams are fair and require knowing the material.",
    "Strengths- Drago is a great lecturer, very knowledgeable Weaknesses- Problem sets still in old Theano, would prefer to learn new tensorflow",
    "Very well structured course, but psets could have involved a little more fundamental understanding of the content",
    "It gives a very big picture look into some interesting NLP techniques but the assignments are very poorly designed and can be completed without ever really learning anything.",
    "Radev is a great lecturer. He's really excited about the material and definitely knows what he's talking about.",
    "The course is well-organized, relevant, and very up-to-date with the latest advances in NLP. Professor Radev is also very invested and responsive to questions, and the material is interesting. There are also tons of external resources provided, if you're interested in learning more at any point. However, I did find it lacking in depth, and much more memory-based (or implementation-based) than intellectually stimulating. The homework assignments were a combination of implementation of pseudocode, figuring out instructions, and answering often-vague readme questions -- the actual coding parts were not very challenging, so deciphering instructions or making tweaks to get better scores ended up being the bulk of the assignments. Also, there were very few assignments; I would prefer having more (perhaps weekly), but smaller, more manageable chunks, possibly including short answer or multiple choice questions (like were on the exams). The exams often tested memorization of tiny details rather than critical thinking; I would have preferred if they were longer, and focused less on the small topics we only very briefly touched on in class.",
    "It was very strong in that it went through a lot of content and was taught well; I thought it was a bit poorly structured and the problem sets were interesting but were not terribly parallel to in-class material",
    "Professor Radev mentions a lot of recent papers in the field, but never goes over any of them in detail. Rather than mention MANY papers, it would be nice if he could pick one paper for each broad topic, and discuss the details in depth.",
    "The psets are interesting and not too frustrating. The material is objectively interesting. However, lecture wasn't always the most substantive.",
    "Too much material in a small amount of time, the PSETs were done often without much understanding of what was actually going on. But it was a great overview to what NLP is",
    "This course is disorganized in the sense that there are over a 100 powerpoints. There is so much material and it is never clear what is expected from us or what we are expected to know. I feel as if the lectures are incredibly fast. I feel like the problem sets didn't appropriately test understanding of the material and this class should have more problem sets. I was excited that I had learned a lot from NLP but could have learned so much more had we been required to be more engaged in the material.",
    "The information could have been clearer on the slides",
    "The course material is generally quite interesting. Drago is a very helpful and friendly professor. The course does cater to students with little exposure to linguistic concepts. We only had 4 psets which, in my opinion, did not really help with getting a better understanding of the course. Since I think the best way to understand a new concept is to practice using it, I think the course would benefit from psets that are more directly related to the material covered in lecture.",
    "Much of the class was descriptive and the psets were somewhat specific to a specific task. Lectures were somewhat dull but the instructor definitely knew the material well.",
    "We covered many topics and as a result never had the opportunity to explore each one in depth, so we come out not feeling like we have learnt much about any one thing. Regardless it is a good survey\/overview of the field but definitely not sufficient on its own.",
    "The class was a general survey of NLP, which meant we learned a lot of things in little detail. That's not necessarily bad, but it made it difficult to distinguish what was important from the lectures. Professor Radev's PPTs could be more clear, especially for visual learners like myself. Though I felt like I understood and learned from assignments 1 and 4, assignments 2 and 3 could be completed without really understanding the material, and mostly tested our ability to learn the syntax of Python NLP libraries, which we were never going to use again.",
    "The highlights: The Psets; very interesting and challenging. They really throw you right into the world of NLP, although there is plenty of support available; the code is interesting and the psets are great ways to solidify some of the ideas you learn in class. The professor: Drago is great. A _very_ smart and engaging guy with a good sense of humor. Drago is a great resource for anyone interested in NLP\/ML\/etc. fields. The weaknesses: Overall course structure: the course felt fairly disorganized. I felt like we jumped around topics a lot and it was hard to follow how different topics fit into the overall narrative of NLP. Content: although this is a CPSC course, there was a lot of emphasis placed on topics purely related to linguistics; this is understandable because that sort of knowledge is requisite for developing NLP systems, but in that case the course should simply have intro linguistics as a prereq. Because of all the time spent learning what felt like linguistic trivia, we had to glaze over important computational topics like deep learning with relatively little depth or explanation.",
    "As much as I liked the workload, I feel like we would have learned more if the homework were more challenging. Most of the time, we had skeleton code provided and we only had to implement a small part. This meant that it was easy not to really understand what was going on. The lecture slides varied a lot in quality, but were all covered in the same amount of time. This meant some slides felt tedious since they were simple or not useful, while others felt rushed because they were very complicated ideas but covered quickly.",
    "Kind of like daily ted talks! Should be more in depth",
    "I enjoyed this course overall. The class covered a lot of content, which I really appreciated. However, the problem sets felt a bit tangential to the material at times, and I sometimes felt like I was struggling to understand what a pset was asking me to do more than I was struggling to do the pset.",
    "The tests had really weird multiple choice questions in that they asked super specific things that didn't matter much in the grand scheme of NLP (such as \"this is a definition of a word. What framework would you expect to see this definition format in?\" where two of the choices were frameworks we'd actually worked with and the other two had only been mentioned on one slide of one class) or asked about very specific terminology. In addition, the psets were rather self-contained and didn't give us much practical knowledge for how the individual pieces of NLP projects fit together--only how to implement small specific parts.",
    "This was really a good survey class. We covered a ton of material and got to implement some really cool code on psets. However, these psets represented the main weakness of the class: lecture was very theoretical and mathematical with little discussion of implementation. The psets were the exact opposite: it was rare that we had to solve complex algorithmic problems to finish the psets. Instead, we often just had to implement provided pseudocode in python (or pseudocode in a paper) -- surprisingly difficult at times. This in turn meant that most of the roadblocks we ran into were things like \"how do I write this thing\" or \"where is my typo.\" Such questions are usually fine, but a huge pain when programs can take upwards of six hours to run, for example. Another strength: we had a very active piazza site. I went to office hours only once or twice because most of the time the dozens upon dozens of simultaneous piazza conversations were enough to help me through the pset.",
    "Strengths: - Interesting course material, engaging lectures Weaknesses: - I wish this course's problem sets had clearer specifications - instructions were confusing for hw3 for example. - I wished we had more help with Theano - maybe hold one or two TA sessions on 'how to use Theano' for example - I really wish we had more personalized feedback for our code. I understand that's difficult for a class with 100 people, but I really would have loved to know what was bad about my code and how to improve it. - I wish we had more avenues to test\/find out to test whether our code was working well for all the problem sets before we submitted it.",
    "The course was incredibly interesting and a great introduction to machine learning. It did pre-supppose a lot of familiarity with linguistics, which a lot of students don't have. The psets could relate a little more closely to the course material. The last couple of psets, especially, mostly involved familiarising oneself with Python libraries.",
    "A lot of information was presented in the course. However, at times it was difficult to figure out what was \"survey\" material and what was \"essential\" material.",
    "It was a good overview of a lot of different topics and I thought the problem sets were good. On the other hand I don't like learning from slides, and in fact when a professor teaches from slides I find it very difficult to pay attention.",
    "I don't think the problem sets were as engaging as they could have been. I think I learned the most tangible amount from the first problem set, and from there, the problem sets were very short and less conceptual.",
    "This course really needs worksheets as a part of homework to reinforce the conceptual knowledge. Even though examples are covered in lecture, its so hard to grasp them without doing examples on your own. The course could be improved so much if we just had to run through examples of IBM Model 1 or Viterbi or CKY parsing on paper by hand before just directly implementing in python or getting tested on it. The psets were really interesting but so much was abstracted that it was hard to cram all the conceptual information in time for the tests. If we had practice questions similar to the actual midterm\/final, I would have learned so much more. Overall the lectures are fairly engaging though its really easy to zone out because the psets pretty much stand alone."

    "I suspect if students hold off for a semester or two there is a good chance it will have become a much better class.",
    "If you are interested in the field it's a good class. Better than most CS electives.",
    "Bless me lord Drago",
    "Yes, if you're interested in the material, take the class. Drago is a good lecturer. If you haven't studied ML\/Neural Networks before, some parts of this class will feel a little shaky I think. It's more of a \"we're skipping the interesting parts!\" feeling than an \"I'm very lost\" type of feeling though. Overall, this is a quality, somewhat chill CS lecture.",
    "One of the better electives in the CS department even though it was new this semester. Lectures are pretty good, although sometimes moved too quickly and brushed over details. The topic of NLP is really interesting and this course does a good job giving a survey of many different methods and goals in NLP. It's especially useful if you want to learn the basics of popular fields like neural networks and deep learning. Homework wasn't too difficult but didn't always help with my understanding as it often felt like we were just following the instructions in the spec without understanding why those instructions would solve the problem. Still, this was one of the top CS electives that I've taken and I'd definitely recommend it over many of the other electives in the department.",
    "While not perfect, this course is far better than most of the CS electives. And Drago is amazing and so kind, so I would recommend this course.",
    "Yeah, do it, one of the better CS electives I think. Drago is basically an NLP god and I think you'll learn a lot from this class, in terms of linguistics and NLP. Granted, there is a lot out there and the field changes really fast, so it's hard to keep up to date, but Drago does a good job of providing relevant material that's interesting. The psets are chill (there are 4, in Python, and you can get some good help from Piazza). This class was really well run for its first time, so I'm excited to see how later iterations end up going.",
    "I'd recommend it if you want to learn a bit about linguistics and NLP. However, you will not come out of this course knowing how to create your own machine learning\/NLP applications.",
    "Would recommend. Course material itself is interesting and I anticipate the course will be modified to suit larger class sizes in the future.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who want to learn what NLP is and what the current problems\/techniques used to solve NLP are. It covers a wide range of topics so you do not go in depth into many topics in class, but Professor Radev provides many opportunities and resources to delve deeper into topics you personally find interesting.",
    "Yes.",
    "Definitely take it! Amazing class!",
    "Absolutely - Dr. Radev is great, the material is taught well, the class uses a good textbook, the problem sets give you ample time to think and are written well. This is the best CS elective at Yale right now.",
    "Yes, NLP is a great and hot subject. Anyone who is interested in CS or linguistics should take this course.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Take it if you are even a little interested in NLP! It covers everything you need and Lord Drago knows his stuff.",
    "Drago is a fantastic lecturer, and I loved the psets. They're all super interesting applications of NLP algorithms! Very few CS classes at Yale offer such a demonstration of the applications of the theory learned in class.",
    "Absolutely; this class is a great introduction to linguistics, statistics, and machine learning all wrapped into one course. Very well organized and not very time-intensive",
    "Not in its current form.",
    "This was an interesting survey class that explored a combination of linguistics, machine learning and how to do the specifics of natural language processing. There four programming assignments all in python with varying difficulty. Some assignments like the first homework (not homework 0) were significantly harder than some of the other homeworks. Regardless, the teaching staff was incredibly helpful and piazza was immensely useful. Questions were answered usually in 10 minutes if not faster. A great CS elective.",
    "Take it if you want to learn about machine learning and linguistics from a really talented professor.",
    "This would probably be a good class to take if you have never taken a linguistics class (or seen hidden markov models, etc.) and want to get a broad survey of an interesting field, or even prepare to work in that field. If you want to really learn the content in-depth, I think you'd be better off taking a dedicated class in the particular field that interests you -- eg a linguistics class, a stochastic processes class, algorithms, etc. As another classmate described, it often felt like a series of TED talks -- so definitely interesting, but also kind of unfulfilling in the long run. Nevertheless, the topics were still really cool; just know what you're getting into.",
    "Yes, I learned a lot about the field; it's a very valuable and exciting field in computer science right now, and if you're majoring in computer science it's definitely to have at least a general understanding of NLP under your belt.",
    "This is a solid CS elective, with great class logistics. Professor Radev is an excellent instructor, so I would definitely recommend this class to anybody with interests in NLP\/ Machine Learning.",
    "Drago is a pretty good professor. He has a very clearly structured course, which is something missing from a lot of electives, but his lectures aren't the most substantive. He has lots of interesting example so they aren't boring but I was often not sure what the point was. Still, NLP is super interesting and this is one of the best electives just based on the fact that the topic is good and it isn't terrible.",
    "This is a great course if you want a gentle introduction to machine learning, linguistics and NLP. Once they have more TAs for support I think this will be a great class. Tests are difficult though. Although you can get through this class by doing minimal effort, if you actually make the effort to understand what you're doing in PSETs you'll get a lot out of it!",
    "This class was a little poorly organized and the professor went very fast. I'm someone who learns best in structured classes, and this class only had 4 psets, a midterm, and a final and a TON OF MATERIAL. The class covered many interesting topics. But I can't say that I came away with a very strong knowledge of any of the material that we covered. The class overall did not take that much time, maybe 10 to 15 hours per pset and there were only 4 psets. Overall interesting material, but if you want to get a lot from it, you need to spend them time yourself.",
    "Yes",
    "This course falls somewhere inbetween. I would recommend it to someone who already has interest in the area, but not to everybody. The course covers many topics in NLP but doesn't go very deep. This year, the workload was pretty chill. We only had 4 psets for the whole semester, a midterm and a final. The psets weren't as intense as those in 223 or 323, but can be puzzling sometimes. The exams are generally quite straightforward.",
    "Good overview of NLP but only take if interested in linguistics and NLP specifically.",
    "Take this class if you want a general overview of machine learning as it is applied to NLP. Lectures move quite fast and are somewhat dry so you'll have to learn a lot on your own.",
    "Given that many of the CS electives here suck, I would recommend this class as compared to most of the others. It's a pretty low workload and you do learn quite a bit, though the skills aren't very transferable to other areas of Computer Science. You'll learn a lot about NLP, which is a pretty niche area that you may never use again. Know that the class involves learning a lot about linguistics and probability theory.",
    "NLP is both challenging and rewarding for a few reasons. The main challenge of the course lies in the sheer volume of information you need to know. Since the course has no prereqs in linguistics, essentially it feels more like linguistics 101 in lecture with some CS-based psets thrown in on the side. Most of the content in lecture which is both difficult to learn and integral to NLP, e.g. deep learning, various algorithms, etc. is left to outside reading, whereas we spend most of lecture learning about more basic linguistic (non-CS-related) topics, e.g. different ways to parse ambiguous sentences, the difference between homophones and homographs, etc. That being said, the psets are really interesting and challenging: I enjoyed them a lot. The exams are heavily based on the linguistic aspect of the class and are mostly multiple choice, so you really have to pay close attention to lecture\/slides. Overall, it was a cool and interesting course, although I don't think it really felt enough like a CS course at the end of the day. If you have some linguistics background, you'd probably get a lot more out of it, otherwise, it's hard to say.",
    "Drago is a great teacher, and this is probably one of the best CS electives available. TAKE IT!",
    "NLP is a solid class; I'd recommend it if you're interested in learning more about the subject or looking for an interesting CS elective that's not terribly much work. It's a great starting point for deeper study into NLP, and gives you a good overview of the recent developments in the subject.",
    "It's a great survey class for anyone who is interested in natural language processing or machine learning. Good CS elective with a low workload.",
    "I would recommend it, but you definitely have to do the reading because you won't learn most of what you have to know in class for the level of detail you're expected to know.",
    "Definitely. Drago is great and NLP is amazing. Be aware of what you are getting yourself into, and don't dawdle on psets. I think it's more important in this class to get a very good general understanding than to understand the algorithmic minutia of any given algorithm. If you want to work with the minutia, then you can always join Drago's lab!",
    "The content is very interesting, and Professor Radev is very caring. If I could take this course again, I definitely would. Don't underestimate the course work though! You definitely need to put in effort in the problem sets.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone in the major, especially people beginning in the major who don't have many prereq classes",
    "NLP is one of the better electives in the major. 4 psets (plus one short intro pset) each take 10-15 hours at most and allow you to go in depth into a particular topic in NLP such as deep learning, machine translation, part of speech tagging, etc. Exams are comprehensive but doable if you learn the material well. Reasonable workload, great professor, take it!",
    "I would recommend this to students who are really interested int he subject or who want to take a CS elective that is not an overwhelming amount of work.",
    "It's an interesting subject and Drago is great. There are four fairly easy problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Drago teaches almost entirely from slides. That makes it hard to pay attention, but also you don't have to go to class. I don't think I learned all that much from the class, but it was a fairly interesting CS elective.",
    "Drago is a very caring and organized professor. While the class size was large and the lectures could get tedious, I think you could have gotten a lot out of this class if you put in the effort.",
    "Definitely take this course! This is a great intro course to NLP, you learn so much. Professor Radev is incredible and so passionate about the material! The TF's are also super helpful and know so much about the material. One of the better electives in the CS department.",
    "Definitely a great course if you have any interest in linguistic or computational linguistics. But a background in linguistics would be really helpful since a lot of the course relates to grammatical concepts that you'd likely be unfamiliar with from just elementary school grammar. The course is also a good intro to some ideas of ML, though, again, some background to begin with is very helpful since so many concepts are covered quickly. The psets are really well documented and the spec (+piazza) are really clear and helpful, unlike many other cs courses where understanding the spec is part of the challenge. Overall a great course, but if you really want to learn anything, it'll be from cramming concepts before the midterm and final."
