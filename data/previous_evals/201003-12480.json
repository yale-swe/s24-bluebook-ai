   "comments": [
    "AVOID. Unless you are not taking many other classes and can afford to devote a lot of time to reading the book and going over reaction mechanisms yourself--you're not going to get much help here.",
    "I would recommend this class because the information covered is really fascinating but my advice would be avoid this professor.",
    "I would only take this course if you have to and if you feel that your first semester course has sufficiently prepared you. Professor Saunders won't spend any time reviewing first semester material, and expects that you are familiar enough with reaction mechanisms to generate them on your own. That said, I felt this class was better than a lot of the reviews made it out to be. It's definitely manageable if you invest enough time (although I will say the tests were frustrating in that they were all 3 questions long and seemed quite random).",
    "The class is great if you loved the second half of orgo I but you might want to see which professors are teaching the class. Professor Saunders teaches off of powerpoints so if you prefer to see things written out, be prepared to write them out on your own. He does post the powerpoints however and his exams are always based on lecture.",
    "I am not surprised that only ~20 students decided to stick with the course. The material is interesting but poorly taught.",
    "Obviously you only take this class if you have to. Beware that the pace and ease of this class is very inconsistent. Our class went from having 90+ averages on midterms to 50 in just weeks. Why? Because we spent 3 weeks covering 1.5 chapters (NMR and IR), then zoomed through 5 chapters (ketones\/aldehydes, amines, acids, acid derivatives, etc), each with around 20 reactions to know and understand, in like 2 weeks. Prof. Saunders is very distant with students and disconnected with the material in the sense that sometimes he'll repeat lecture content three days in a row and at other times, he will skip over key details and expect us to intuitively guess at them. This skipped material includes pretty much any and all relevant mechanisms, which we were nonetheless, tested on. He also refused to use the newer edition of the book that we had been forced to pay extra money for last semester by Prof. Herzon.",
    "This is a very difficult course, and I did not think it was taught very well. I found the professor to be very difficult to talk to and ask questions. He seemed to not understand what I was asking each time I asked a question. I found that we spent long periods of time on easy topics and rushed large amounts of the hardest material. The professor rarely drew mechanisms on the board. Much of what was said was not written on the powerpoints or was rushed through making it very difficult to retain everything. I wish that there would have been more directionas far as what to study for the exams such as via practice exams or problem sets that we were actually held accountable for. I also wish the professor would have talked about grading even one time with us. It was impossible to have any idea what my grade was throughout the semester.",
    "I would not recommend Chem 221 with Professor Saunders to another student. It is very unfortunate that such a fundamental course is so poorly taught at Yale. Professor Saunders is a nice person, but his teaching style is very disorganized. The pacing of the course if very poor; for example, our first midterm covered 1.5 chapters while our third midterm covered five (very dense) chapters. It can be very difficult to follow the lectures and what Professor Saunders writes on the board, as he does not use traditional arrow notation when writing reaction schemes and mechanisms. The problem sets consist of randomly selected problems from the textbook and in no way serve as an indication of the sort of material tested on exams. Tests were very variable in difficulty because Professor Saunders claims he has \u0093no way to judge how hard\u0094 his exams will be; while the averages on the first two midterms were in the 90s, the average on the third midterm was inthe 60s. Overall, my experience in Chem 221 was very frustrating and unenjoyable.",
    "Try taking it in the spring instead",
    "Overall, this course is a manageable second half of organic chemistry. It's pacing isn't terribly great, however, so you'll have to do a lot of independent work to make sure you're on track. Keeping up with the course by making sure you've read and done as many problems as possible should make it doable.",
    "Take it if you have to, but try not to take it with Professor Saunders. He's been teaching the material for so long that it's second nature to him, and the way he teaches it, he expects the same to be true for his students.",
    "I would highly recommend you take this course in the Spring, even if you are on the CHEM 118 track. Saunders is an absolute bore and you'll be better off not making the trek up science hill. Only take this if you feel confident in your ability to learn from the book.",
    "Chemistry 221 is a continual of the first-half of organic chemistry in which you get to apply the mechanism you learned in the first half to more specific reactions and functional groups. It also helps a lot to understand reactions in biochemistry.",
    "Although the material is doable, the organization is terrible.",
    "Chemistry 221 is a continuation of Chem 220. I would recommend it if it is a requirement.",
    "If you're considering this class you're either a chemistry major or pre-med. I enjoyed Professor Saunder's teaching style, which consisted of his lectures and straightforward tests. You'll have towork hard, but Professor Saunders is fairer than other professors you might have. Good luck!",
    "You don't really have a choice whether to take this class or not, but it is surprisingly better than Orgo I. Saunders' tests were not that hard, and things seem to come together in Orgo II. It is a lot of outside work, especially when Saunders goes through about 4 chapters on amines and carboxylic acids derivatives in about a week and a half. There are problem sets which basically consist of book problems, but they aren't graded, but it's to your advantage to do them. Overall it's a fair course, and maybe a more even pace could be the only improvement.",
    "Professor Saunders is an embarrassment to the teaching mission of Yale College. Before I continue, I want to stress that although his teaching may leave much to be desired, Professor Saunders is an incredibly nice man who clearly cares about the field of organic chemistry. However, a good heart and kind personality do not, unfortunately, confer any specific teaching skills, and Professor Saunders has few of them. The problems begin with the way Saunders lectures: he uses a PowerPoint, and then he draws structures, reactions, and mechanisms on the chalkboard. It\u0092s a great idea, but with absolutely terrible execution. The PowerPoint slides are simply there so that Saunders remembers what to say out loud next, and they\u0092re literally nothing more than blank white slides, each displaying one or two complete sentences in large black font in a text box. As soon as Saunders finishes reading it out loud, he moves on to the next slide, before you can copy down what was on it or listen to what he said. The text is not formatted or organized in any way, the PowerPoint presentation has little or no organization at all, and the slides contain no useful information: no chemical structures, no reaction schemes, no graphs, no diagrams, nothing. This makes the slides of no pedagogical value whatsoever during lecture, and makes them worthless as a study tool later on when they\u0092re posted online, since they make no sense on their own. When Saunders feels the need to draw a structure or reaction, he moves to the chalkboard, and here things get worse. When he draws a reaction, there is no arrow from reactant to product, and because he reuses any given structure on the board multiples times instead of redrawing it, you have no idea if what you\u0092re looking at is the reactant, intermediate, product, or all three at once: the product is sometimes on the left, sometimes above or below, and sometimes on the right. When he runs out of space on the board, instead of erasing the oldest content onthe board, he erases the most recent thing he\u0092s just drawn. Saunders never shows reaction mechanisms and never draws arrow pushing; to break a bond, he draws a squiggly line through it. Meanwhile, the problem sets have a ridiculous degree of variation in length, difficulty, and due date: it took him nearly three weeks to assign the first problem set, which had only a handful of questions; near the end of the semester, he suddenly assigned a problem set with something like 75 questions from the book the week of an exam. The exams themselves are a joke and have nothing to do with what you learned; each hour exam has exactly 3 questions on it. He assured us on the first day of class that Gaussian wouldn\u0092t be on the exam, then he made Gaussian one of the 3 questions on the first exam. He assured us he would only test us on what he presented in lecture, and he never presented mechanisms in lecture, yet one of the 3 questions on the third exam was purely about mechanisms, some of which weren\u0092t even in the textbook. The final exam was 9 questions, and at least half of them could have been easily answered after taking first-semester organic chemistry. The syllabus is poorly planned; we spent the first 3 weeks on one and a half chapters in the book, but later were forced to cover 300 pages in a little over a week. The \u0093life processes\u0094 in the title of the course was an afterthought. Saunders can\u0092t spell many of the amino acids correctly even in the PowerPoint slides, and he tried to teach us that methionine forms disulfide bridges until someone else in the class corrected him. If you have to take CHEM 221, take it with anyone except Saunders; how it is possible that he continues to be allowed to teach is utterly incomprehensible."
