    "Fundamentals of organometallic chemistry, typical reactions and research methods, history and current research of the field.",
    "This course teaches students the fundamentals of organometallic chemistry, and applications of organometallic chemistry. Fundamentals include electron counting, oxidation states, metal alkyls, metal hydrides, tunable ligands, metal carbenes, oxidative addition and reductive elimination, nucleophilic and electrophilic addition and abstraction, 1,1 and 1,2 addition and alpha and beta elimination, and pi complexes. Applications include hydrogenation, industrial processes, olefin polymerization, olefin metathesis, C-H activation, and carbon-carbon cross-coupling reactions.",
    "I learned basic inorganic and organometallic transformations, the historically significant experiments that led to discovery of these transformations, and basic applications of these transformations.",
    "Part 1: Fundamentals of organometallics including bonding, structure, and behavior of various classes of ligands. Part 2: Organometallic principles as applied in classic organometallic reactions, including both academic and industrial reactions.",
    "Lots of inorganic principles and mechanisms",
    "I gained a fundamental intuition for transition metal-based chemistry. This is a great class for establishing a foundation for understanding catalysis in both synthetic and industrial processes."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Prof Crabtree's section mostly covered material we had dealt with in inorganic (same slides). Seeing this material again reinforced concepts, but was a little frustrating to not get diversity in concepts. Both Prof Crabtree and Nilay's sections had problem sets that were relevant to material learned in class and to the exams. Overall, not a lot of work but required a great deal of understanding and memorization to do well on the material.",
    "Strengths: The course is split into two halves, the first of which focuses on fundamentals, the second on applications. The Bob and Nilay are very enthusiastic about the topics they present in class. Their lectures are clear. Bob posts his slides to Canvas after lecture, so if you cannot keep up with him during class, you can easily review the material later. Nilay has some interactive parts of the class where he tries to lead students to think critically to decipher how and why certain applications were developed. The workload is completely reasonable, as are the exams. A lot of material is covered. You finish this class prepared to think critically about organometallic or synthetic organic research. Bob's textbook is the course textbook, and it is incredibly detailed and informative. Weaknesses: At times, Bob and Nilay go through parts of the material very quickly, so quickly that one may block out what they are saying while attempting to copy down notes from the slides or board.",
    "This year, it was taught in two halves by Crabtree and Hazari. The Crabtree have was functionally identical to CHEM252, and Crabtree still didn't teach it very well as you might expect. However, his half isn't the most difficult, so this is tolerable. Hazari's half was much better- much clearer, much more thorough, and much more relevant to actual modern day OM research and use in industry. It is worth mentioning that the two essentially function as two separate courses, and how you do in one half likely doesn't correlate with how you did in the other. The workload is trivial for the Crabtree portion as the PSETs are from his book and often fairly brief. The PSETs for Hazari's portion were much more insightful and educational, but were also a lot more work. In addition, a full paper (traditionally given to coordination chem, CHEM457, which wasn't offered) in Hazari's portion allows an in-depth look at a topic. This paper was a lot of work but manageable. Overall, if Hazari could teach the whole thing, that would be optimal.",
    "First half of the course the lectures were quite boring but the second half was very engaging. The first half was essentially the same as inorganic chemistry",
    "I liked the class as is."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - especially with the split class (one professor for first half, one for second half). For students interested in inorganic chemistry, catalysis, and any aspect of organometallic, this class is very interesting and has taught me a lot about how to think about chemistry and my research projects.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in chemistry. The course covers a lot of material in a short amount of time. However, the workload is completely manageable. Bob's problem sets can be done very quickly if you study the material well. Nilay's problem sets require more critical thinking, but should be intuitive if you study the material. Also, Nilay's problem sets are designed to teach students more about organometallic applications than he covers in lecture. Bob and Nilay are always willing to help students who have questions on the problem sets, and they do a great job of answering students' questions. The tests are completely fair. Bob and Nilay are very enthusiastic about the topics they present, and they make the class enjoyable. Both Bob and Nilay have some interesting anecdotes about events relating to their previous scientific work.",
    "This is a good elective for any organic or inorganic student. Hazari is a great professor. It is relatively low workload (barring the paper) course, a lot of the material has been seen indirectly before, and it improves your understanding of this field both from a theoretical and a practical perspective. Also, undergrads and graduate students are graded separately, so don't fear if a lot of other people in the class seem to know more than you. Coupling this course with another class like coordination chemistry or synthetic methods can create a really enriching experience as you see the same topics through multiple lenses.",
    "Yes - it provides one with a solid grounding of mechanistic knowledge that will enable one to explore and deeper understand current literature.",
    "For an upper level chem elective, it really wasnt bad. Nilay is really helpful in office hours and will sit with you for however long you need to understand the problem sets.",
    "For sure! If youre at all interested in inorganic chemistry or catalysis, this class is a must."
