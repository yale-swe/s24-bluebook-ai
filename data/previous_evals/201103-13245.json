   "comments": [
    "The lectures were all very good and interesting.",
    "I enjoyed the Seminar series for EMD, especially Dr. Michael Woroby and Dr. Gerald Friedland. I would have, however, enjoyed a wider breath of topics covered in the lecture series.",
    "Interesting speakers brought to talk about their research.Wish that speakers would end a little earlier so that there is more time to ask questions.Wish that speakers had more diversity; perhaps not just researchers, but people who are doing EMD related stuff in the health care world, or who are involved with business, biotech, government, pharmaceuticals etc...It would be beneficial to learn about the implications\/bridge between EMD research and these other disciplines.For instance, more speakers like the one who came to talk about surveillance.Would be nice to have speakers on biodefense\/nutrition\/foodborne illnesses\/someone who has been doing outbreak investigation etc.(As a side note, having healthier\/more diverse lunch options would be a plus).",
    "It's good. The pizza is an awesome incentive.",
    "helps to broaden the horizon in infectious disease's research and have a deeper understanding of how the diseases are studied in actual life.it could be even better if the powerpoint can be provided on class v2.",
    "I wish they had been able to get people from different fields of public health come in. It seemed that it was PhDs presenting hard science stuff every week, which is fine, but it would have been nice to get exposed to different areas of work and research. For people who don't want to get a PhD, it would have been really helpful to hear presentations from people working in others fields.",
    "Great to hear about YSPH research and other topics of research. I enjoyed the collaboration with SIRA also. The fact that EMD has such a strong turn out for these weekly seminars indicates how strong of a department it is.Very generous to provide lunch! Thank you!",
    "Though some lectures, primarily in the beginning, went over our heads due to the advanced topics, most of the lectures were very interesting. Once the semester progressed and we had a little more knowledge of epi and immunology, the lectures were more understandable and applicable.",
    "I enjoyed the wide array of speakers that came through and the fact that most of the speakers were researchers outside of Yale.I believe that this is important because it exposes us students to the vast topics an epidemiology education can cover.Of course some of the speakers were more interesting than others, but I believe that it is more due to personal interests rather than the speakers themselves.During the beginning of the semester, I looked at this class as just one more hour during I had to be in lecture. But I can honestly say that not only did I look forward to these seminars, but I look forward to going to these for my second year as well.",
    "The seminar gives EMD students a break from the stress of tests and assignments due for classes. It's nice to just seat and listen to interesting and innovative research without worrying about being tested on the material. The seminar provides the time for us to enjoy the topic that we chose to study about! The food served at lunch during each seminar was also a plus!!",
    "A lot of lab-based research is presented; please remember that for most of us the MPH is a terminal degree and that it is not a degree one seeks if the lab is the ultimate goal.Also, we are public health students and professionals. Please stop serving greasy pizza and sugary soda and offer juice and fruit salad instead. The required SBS class was taught just before this, and after sitting through 2 hours of hearing about how Americans are dying of obesity, this is the last thing we want to consume. Let's try to practice what we preach.",
    "The seminar had guest speakers that really focused on neglected tropical diseases and HIV\/AIDs that were all interesting and important research. There is never enough time to ask questions especially since there was class right afterwards.",
    "Interesting lectures!",
    "I really enjoyed the EMD seminar. It has helped me understand the diversity of the applications of studying infectious disease.",
    "The seminars seemed to be more about the biology and laboratory details of infectious diseases than the epidemiology of them.",
    "The EMD seminar was very helpful and provided opportunities for students to learn about various projects in the field and interact with professors for future research.",
    "Overall, it has an excellent format as a seminar. A suggestion may be that at the end of each term, to provide speaker recommendation forms so students and faculty can recommend speakers they may be particularly interested in hearing."

    "Learn a little bit about a varied array of infectious diseases.",
    "highly recommend",
    "Definitely a great way to learn about areas outside your area of interest. A way to learn more about EMD related topics.",
    "It's good, and the pizza is tasty. Try the all meat pizza- it's the best!",
    "good to take and can help you understand epidemiology of microbial disease in a larger perspective. It is also beneficial to help you found out your interest.",
    "Nice addition to EMD course work. Covers a variety of topics and is good to hear about infectious disease, study design, and analysis in a professional setting.",
    "sit back and relax, enjoy your pizza and soft drinks, you are in for a treat.",
    "No, but there's no getting around it.",
    "If the student chose Yale based on the type of research being performed as I did, they will enjoy hearing the majority of speakers discuss the work done by professionals in the field of science and public health.",
    "very interesting guest speakers!",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar. It was interesting and effective in providing a broader perspective of epidemiology of microbial disease.",
    "Seminars about microbial diseases.",
    "I highly recommend the EMD seminar to other students. The course certainly helped the students to find the area of interest for future research and interact with various professors.",
    "This course is a weekly seminar that presents current topics and analyses of microbial diseases. I would recommend this course to another student."
