   "comments": [
    "A course that provides a history of archaeological thought up until processualism, with a focus on how social, political and economic factors have influenced the development of the discipline. I would recommend it to anyone interested in developing a background in archaeological theory or for those interested in learning how historical events in society affect the development of academic fields.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student of archaeology. It provides a key understanding of the core concepts that continue to constitute important topics of disciplinary debate. With the knowledge from this course, students will realize that they can scour previous scholarship for many insights and approaches rather than waste too much time \"re-inventing the wheel\" so to speak.",
    "I would recommend the course to other students, because it is really a good chance to know the development of archaeological theory and how to study archaeological history."

   "comments": [
    "This course allowed me to reflect on the various theories and thought processes behind archaeology, as well as how these methods have changed overtime. It also allowed me to understand how nuanced the discipline is, with archaeological developments being quite different in countries around the world, often shaped by their own historical events. Regarding my research, this course has allowed me to consider how early archaeologists may have approached their research within a particular theoretical framework. Essentially, if I use a source from the early 19th century, I may proceed with caution and consider the possible cultural evolutionary ideas this scholar may have shared.",
    "This course has proven essential for my academic formation in archaeology thus far. I am very happy to have taken this course so early in my graduate career as it has alerted me to a whole range of relevant materials and theoretical approaches that I can explore as I begin to craft my dissertation topic.",
    "It is very helpful to my dissertation\/research. Only understand the history can one fully understand different archaeological theories."
