   "comments": [
    "You will learn a lot about Turkey and Turkish culture. The class is very open to any discussion that students are interested in, so students help shape the class. The weaknesses are that it was at times a bit disorganized, and there aren't quite themes threading the class together in ways that other seminars seem to have. Less conversation in the class and more Q&A.",
    "A more detailed\/accurate syllabus",
    "The class is great, and covers many fascinating topics. I would consider running it a bit more in a classic seminar style, with emphasis on discussions questions although its grest to devote a large portion of the time to the professors fascinating and often firsthand insights. I liked the essay topics for the final essay more than those for the first two response papers. I think those can also have an argumentative component, in addition to a synthetic one. Or maybe students could chose to write this kind of paper, if theyd like to.",
    "The readings were great, and I enjoyed that the professor summarized the topics in seminar. I do, however, wish there had been a bit more discussion in the class and that the assignments were a little more clear."

   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in learning more about Turkey, then yes. The class is interesting as it discusses Turkey's history as well as its current events.",
    "If you are interested in learning about Turkey this is the right course!",
    "Yes, but only if you are self-motivated to do the work and really pay attention.",
    "There is little work each week, but you do have to write ~30 pages over the course of the semester. The readings are short and it's not the end of the world if you don't do them all. The class is more like a mini lecture because Aysen tends to talk a lot and contextualize readings and add in her own experiences. She's a really interesting person and makes the class very fun. I'm surprised by how much I learned this semester, since it didn't feel like I was learning a lot, but then when I sat down to write papers I realized that I'd actually absorbed a ton and and think Turkey is an awesome country to study. I think the class could benefit from a bit more of a focus\/discussion of current events at the start of class each week, especially since there is a ton happening in Turkey every day."
