    "I would recommend US Congress to another student but be prepared to take a lot of notes off of power points and to learn kind of the same material over and over again.",
    "Yes! Take this!",
    "Standard overview of Congress with a midterm and a final.",
    "A historical and theoretical look at Congress. I would recommend this course to students who have no basic understanding of Congress. If they did, I would advise them to take a different course.",
    "I really liked this class - I knew a fair amount about Congress going in, but this class focuses on theoretical arguments and studies that anyone who likes Congress will find interesting. Professor Powell is a good lecturer and funto talk to - don't be fooled by the class's \"gut\" feel.",
    "Not difficult. You learn about the US Congress. Straightforward. The section was awful.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not particularly difficult and you learn a lot.",
    "Good foundational course if you're not familiar with American politics -- if that's the case absolutely take it.If you do know the foundations but need an easy fifth class, take it.",
    "Pretty straightforward. Interesting and relevant. Professor Powell is lovely.",
    "good class and not too much work",
    "I guess if you want a really easy course. This was one of the easiest classes with the least amount of work I have taken at Yale."
