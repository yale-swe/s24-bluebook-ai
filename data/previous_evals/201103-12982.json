   "comments": [
    "Spanish 110 is a great way to start learning Spanish. It is a fairly easy course, but you definitely need to keep up with all of the work in order to succeed in the course.",
    "A solid introductory language class taught by an instructor who cares about her students.",
    "would absolutely recommend as an intro spanish course",
    "Yes, I would recommend Spanish 110 11 for any fellow student interested in taking a foreign language. Spanish is a language that can be understood if hard work is put in. If you're just learning the language for the first time, the class does move quickly.",
    "Spanish 110 gives you a great Spanish foundation. It moves somewhat quickly, but as long as you keep up with the homework it is pretty easy to understand. There is homework every night, but it is definitely manageable.I would recommend this class. It depends on which professor you get, I think, but my section was great. I looked forward to going every day.",
    "I would definitely recommend Spanish 110 to another student, especially if you can get Alessia.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The work is very evenly paced. You will learn a lot of useful Spanish grammar and vocabulary. I had never taken Spanish before, and I thought this class was very manageable."
