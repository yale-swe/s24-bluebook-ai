    "In taking this course, I bettered my analytical thinking skills as well as my reading, writing, and speaking abilities in Spanish. Through taking this course, I developed a more thorough understanding of the Spanish Civil War and its effect on contemporary Spain, which I found to be extremely rewarding.",
    "I learned so much about, obviously, the civil war but also American literature and poetry.",
    "I certainly learned a lot about the Spanish Civil War with a particular emphasis on related literature. Also this class was great for improving my Spanish as the entire course was conducted in Spanish.",
    "I loved the combination of historical and literary\/cultural studies. This course improves your Spanish and allows deeper understanding of a foreign history.",
    "Before this course I knew little to nothing about the Spanish civil war, so the chief knowledge I gained was about the conflict and how it literally took place; second to that was how those events affected Spanish culture during the war and after it. I also gained experience with academic writing in Spanish, which I also had not done before and which was a challenging aspect of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I thorough enjoyed the course! I think Professor Valis has a strong understanding of the Spanish Civil War and on each piece of literature \/ film \/ song \/ etc. that we touch and it was really rewarding to hear her speak about all of these things. Although the course was a lecture, she tried to engage the students as often as possible, which I found very interesting and engaging.",
    "Strengths- professor Valis, reading list, small class size Weakness-- too many papers AND an exam is way too much to reasonably complete while also finishing all the books.",
    "Personally, I really enjoyed it. The only recommendation I would make is to put a little more emphasis on history\/historical documents and a little less on literature. That being said, I think the selection of works was good.",
    "I felt as though the materials chosen for the course were appropriate in their relevance and diversity. The writing assignments were somewhat vague and graded very strictly, so I think that could have lightened up a bit (as well as the heavy reading), but the course was very informative and well thought out if rigorous."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in the Spanish Civil War. However, you must have a comprehensive understanding of the Spanish language otherwise this course would be very difficult for you.",
    "I would highly recommend this class if you are at all interested in the Spanish Civil War and 20th century Spanish history and culture! Prof. Valis is so sweet, dedicated and engaging and the material covered throughout the semester is very interesting and relevant to understanding so much of mid-century Europe. The workload is also not bad at all. 10\/10 take this class!!",
    "Yes-- be prepared to work hard though. Especially if your Spanish isn't fine tuned, because you'll have to devote a long time to do the readings",
    "Yes! This is a great class to improve your Spanish and to learn about Spanish history and culture in the early 20th Century.",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in Spain, Spanish language, and history.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who either (a) is new to taking L5 Spanish at Yale and has a free semester such that they can focus on this course completely and devote the large amount of time and brainpower required to fully engage with it as a person new to that level of Spanish, or (b) someone experienced with L5 Spanish at Yale (fluent in the language, comfortable with extensive reading in Spanish, skilled at academic writing in Spanish, etc.). Those who do not fall into these categories can still take the course but probably will not get as much out of it."
