   "comments": [
    "An incredible workload. Nine problem sets! Don't plan on getting research completed. Very useful material and will sharpen your math abilities. I would very cautiously recommend the course.",
    "A semi-formal treatment of many branches of mathematics relevant to physics. I would recommend it since I did learn quite a bit and I suspect over time it will pay off.",
    "The topics taught in this course should be known and mastered by any physics student.",
    "It's a good class; just do the homework and you'll do well. Don't worry yourself, though. The material he goes over is interesting, learn it in a book. Don't take notes because what he says is interesting and not \"note-like material\" and taking notes would get in the way. Listen to him in lectures, because he has valuable stuff to say. But you HAVE to go into more depth by yourself outside of class.",
    "This course is excellent. Linear algebra and how it applies, a little real analysis, and especially the asymptotic analysis feel great to know :) I definitely recommend the course to every physics students",
    "Helpful course. Starts off really easily and slowly, but does cover interesting\/new materials such as asymptotic expansion, PDE techniques, and infinite Hilbert space. Useful to take to summarize your knowledge, and because of the usefulness of the math techniques. Might be too rigorous \/ not rigorous enough depending on your background.",
    "Strongly recommend",
    "PHYS 506 is very useful to those who haven't seen the common mathematical tools seen in physics. To those who have seen the material before, PHYS 506 is a good review and introduces some extra material that might not have been covered in a typical math course."

   "comments": [
    "Some topics I haven't seen before, like boundary conditions of differential equations or asymptotic expansion of integrals. They are very helpful and I'm sure I will use this knowledge in the future.",
    "I studied Bose-Einstein condensation for my master thesis. Back in those times, I did not know asymptotic analysis. I wish I've done my thesis work after I took PHYS506 :)",
    "Mathematics is fundamental to physics, regardless of the field. A deep understanding of mathematics allows one to gain more insight to the structure of the physics they are dealing with. Also, it is important to learn various mathematical techniques to solve physical problems.",
    "Very much",
    "As I had seen most of the material before, the course help me review and strengthen my knowledge of mathematical physics. I also learned new tools that I didn't see before in my undergraduate mathematics courses.",
    "Probably the best takeaway from this class should be the mathematical underpinnings of quantum mechanics, but connections could be made in a more deliberate way."
