    "The class is a great way to investigate the ways in which gender and race are displayed and expressed in East Asia. The class teaches critical thinking skills when it comes to the diversity of Asia.",
    "I learned about the performance of race and gender in East Asian context by popular and artisan groups \/ performers.",
    "I learned a lot about the theory and culture of East Asian performance in this class. I also thought that the conversations about race and gender in East Asian countries were really interesting. I enjoyed our performance workshops; they were fun and unique.",
    "I really developed a better understanding of how to apply theory to case studies in doing the readings for this course. Also, I have gained a better sense of how performers use their medium to express themselves in ways that I never would have thought before taking this course.",
    "critical reading, discussing issues of gender & race"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Provides interdisciplinary understanding of race, gender, identity, history and politics in East Asian context. Readings spread across different disciplines to enrich students'understanding.",
    "Most of the readings were really cool! I wish though that there were short supplemental readings (like maybe 1 page?) that gave us relevant histories that articles were influenced by, or readings that relate some articles to events that are currently happening in East Asia. Loved the performance review element of the class! Also, for those who were chose the research paper option, I think it would have been nice for the prof to have asked us to submit a draft sometime between the time when we got back our proposals and the final deadline. Honestly though, that's just personal preference because it helps me to have more external deadlines before the main one.",
    "I guess the only weakness of this course is that it didn't have more time to cover more countries or material. I thought it was a great course and the readings were all very interesting. I also enjoyed that we used different types of media, such as movies and live performances.",
    "The course had a lot of interactive moments, including the final project, that I really feel elevated the level of learning that I achieved. It had a good level of discussion while also engaging in real-life moments that involved course themes.",
    "Professor Yoon's incorporation of actual physical performances in the class was a major strength. It forced students to see what they were capable of while also being very fun.",
    "Great course with interesting reading! Perhaps a little more time needs to be spent on the reading, or in order to have a deep understanding of the place, it's important to make sure to put in the time yourself."

   "comments": [
    "Yes the class was excellent, and there is even Kpop and anime",
    "Recommend to anyone interested in race and gender, and anyone interested in East Asia performance.",
    "Depends on the student's interests. It should include East Asia, performing arts, or race\/ gender.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think it would be great for anyone regardless of performance experience or prior knowledge about East Asia.",
    "Definitely take the course if you are interested in East Asian performances at any level. You will gain a good understanding of race and gender and how performance is a means of tying many relevant themes together. This course will also give you a level of engagement that is rare.",
    "yes--gives a good understanding of the topic, pretty challenging at times.",
    "Absolutely -- especially if you have not taken a course focused on race or gender yet. It is supremely interesting and Professor Yoon is a wonderful seminar leader and teacher. Performance is a unique lens with which to view race and gender, but it is extremely valuable. 10\/10!",
    "Yes! FANTASTIC COURSE!"
