   "comments": [
    "Take this class!! It's not an \"easy\" class and there's a lot of writing, but it's worth it - you'll learn so much.",
    "Take this class if you can get in! It's amazing. Epstein is a lot of fun and she's an amazing writer. Trip to the path lab was definitely the highlight--we saw a whole leg, a uterus, kidneys, and other cool body parts. The final paper is a lot of fun--you choose a topic you are interested in and you really get to delve in. You will undoubtedly become a better writer.",
    "Definitely recommend this. We had students from all different types of majors. Both premeds and nonpremeds. Take this if you actually do want to learn more about how to write in medicine. We practice writing patient profiles, feature articles, translating from scientific to lay audience, etc. Prof Epstein is super nice and understanding, and cares about her students a lot. Not a bad workload. Usually had 1-3 articles (I.e. New Yorker or NYT) per class, sometimes just per week.",
    "Engl 121 07 is an excellent class for any student regardless of interest on medicine and public health. Overall, the class helps you become a stronger professional writer. I would definitely recommend this class to any student.",
    "Great writing class for those interested in science or medicine. Teaches useful writing techniques for science magazine writing, emails, and newspaper articles.",
    "this class was such an enriching enjoyment! A must-take for anyone premed who wants to improve writing skills in fiction, interview skills, writing a personal medical narrative, etc. She brought cookies and treats every workshop session! She had fun contests and prizes every now and then! I actually looked forward to doing the readings! Take this class absolutely! It helped me improve upon my confidence as a writer as well as my abilities to craft medically-related papers and stories.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. The writing assignments are diverse and fun",
    "This class covers all types of medical writing, from technical to humorous. Most of the people in the class are probably pre-meds looking for a writing credit, but It's definitely an interesting and unique topic that anyone a writer or a scientist can benefit from. There are really cool guest speakers and trips. Prof. Epstein has medical and journalistic experience, so she has a lot of good contacts in both fields. However, in class exercises can be too basic and feel purposeless. The assignments cover a wide range of writing styles, but can be very contrived. I didn't feel like my writing improved very much, but I did gain exposure to many types of scientific writing.",
    "Yeah it was a pretty good course. Not my favorite ever, but really solid.",
    "Yes!!",
    "I can't recommend this course enough. Throughout the class, you read work by phenomenal medical writers, piece apart their writing in lively class discussions, and work on writing medical news articles, patient profiles, and a final long feature. I learned so much not only about writing, but also about the human aspect of medicine - I especially loved when patients came to share their story with our class and we wrote profiles of them. Professor Epstein is fantastic - she is energetic and passionate about medical writing, and puts her all into this class. She is also a great mentor and really cares about students - she gives lots of thoughtful feedback on our papers, and is always willing to meet outside of class. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale - definitely take it!",
    "Take this course."
