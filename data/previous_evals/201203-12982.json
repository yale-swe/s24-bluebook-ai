    "This class sits at the fascinating junction between philosophy and psych, the readings cover most everything that's interesting. Tamar tailored the second half of the class to fit the students' interests!",
    "If you can be committed to engaging with the content inside and outside of class, it's the best class.",
    "Absolutely try and get into this seminar. It is the best class i've taken at Yale. Professor Gendler is fantastic, she is so brilliant, yet so kind and approachable. This year's class dynamic was great and discussions were always lively and engaging. The readings are often long and time consuming, but if you are at all interested in the subject matter they will be rewarding for you.",
    "This class is an absolute delight - definitely take it if you have the chance. The intersection of philosophy and psychology it places itself at generates an incredibly rich array of problems that this class allows you to parse through while having fun. Prof. Gendler manages to create a collaborative, open atmosphere that I wouldn't miss for anything in the world.",
    "If you can get in, take it. 250-500 word reading response every week to the 150-200 pages of reading. One presentation. 15-20 page paper (which she later said could be shorter). Tamar is amazing, you should definitely take it if you're interested in people or philosophy.",
    "I think I have nothing to add to what I already wrote. This class is excellent. But only do it if you're prepared for a fairly substantial amount of reading, and more work throughout that is required of most seminar courses at Yale.Here is what I previously wrote:This was a spectacular course. I hope for the sake of future Yalies that Tamar Gendler will continue to teach this course, especially since it is such a lively area of interdisciplinary research. I will admit, at the beginning, I knew that Tamar Gendler was an excellent professor, philosopher, and delightful person, but I was skeptical as to just how \"forced\" the interdisciplinary aspect of the course would feel. I am a Philosophy major, and I enjoyed the Phil Sci Human Nature course but had felt that it wasn't quite allowing me to really see how these two fields can compliment and inform each other. This class changed that. I cannot think of a weakness to this course. Tamar Gendler judiciously selected people for the course in order to get a mix of perspectives (philosophy, cog sci, bio, econ, undergrad, grad, and more) which made discussion lively, challenging, and enjoyable. The work load was ideal, but probably more than many are used to for seminars.",
    "If you can get in, TAKE IT. Gendler is wonderful, the topics you cover over the course of the semester are fascinating. The class discussions are always interesting and often mind-blowing.",
    "If you are one of few people fortunate enough to take any class by Professor Gendler, you must take up this opportunity. Professors of her caliber are a growing rarity in this world and this chance should not be overlooked.",
    "Philosophical Implications of Social Psychology is a phenomenal course. Tamar Gendler is fantastic. Her dedication to the class is truly impressive, and should be a model for the way professors approach seminar teaching. Seriously. The group of students she assembles is also key--we had a diverse and knowledgeable group that made discussions fun. I also found the material (at the intersection of psychology and philosophy) to be very interesting, and lent itself well to the make-up of the class. One particularly effective aspect of the class were the weekly reading responses which used the classesV2 forum tool. Everyone could read each other's posts, and the kind of amazing thing is that people actually did, and would often comment back and forth on each other's responses. This meant people got a lot of interesting ideas out on the table before seminar, often already starting a substantive dialogue, and made discussions during seminar that much more interesting. Once again, I can't help but feel that ALL seminars at Yale could learn a lot from the way Professor Gendler ran this class. Overall, this was one of the best taught and most intellectually satisfying courses I've taken at Yale, and I give it my highest recommendation.",
    "Yes! I would definitely recommend this course (if you can get in). It's similar to \"The Philosophy and Science of Human Nature\" except it's a seminar and is taught at a much higher level. She gave the class a great deal of power to choose what we would study, so all of the topics were really interesting.Tamar does a great job of explaining the main philosophical ideas without using jargon, so the class is accessible for those with more of a psych\/cog sci bent. The reading were all well-chosen, and Tamar goes to quite a bit of trouble to choose selections so you don't have hundreds and hundreds of pages to wade through. We read both philosophy and psychology papers, which always complemented one another well.",
    "Imagine a room filled with 20 laughing people from all backgrounds- psychology, philosophy, biology, computer science, cognitive science, and more- crowded around a table. The smell of home-made food fills the room; you inhale and recognize brownies, fresh rolls, chips and dip, and more*. Better yet- you tune in to the discussion and realize that everyone is discussing human nature, whether \"disability\" is a social construction, linguistic biases and their effects, banjo playing, how to eliminate racism and stereotyping, flaws in Aristotle's reasoning, the dire Milgram experiments (\"...which took place in the basement below this room,\" one polite student remarks), and why a man would choose to walk around whistling Vivaldi**. The conversation takes twists and turns, but never falters. Every once in a while, one smiling woman leaps to the board to explain philosophical methodology or an interesting and related psychological experiment; sometimes, she speaks up to guide the discussion with a few well-chosen words (inevitably revealing keen insight). Finally, her iphone dings; she picks it up, switches off the alarm, and says \"Well, class time is officially over!\" ('WHAT? that was CLASS?' you think to yourself.) She continues, \"You are all welcome to come over to the Philosophy lounge- a 30 second walk- for pizza*** and continued discussion!\" The class, as one, leaps up eagerly to process to CT Hall.'I have to take this class,' you murmur aloud. And you are correct; TAKE THIS CLASS. Each week, you read 3 or 4 very interesting papers (or sections of excellent books, such asObedience to Authority, the Imperative of Integration, or Whistling Vivaldi) and write a 250-500 words reading response to post on the forums of classesv2. You will find yourself writing far more, reading your peers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 responses, and RESPONDING ON THE FORUMS (I know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 I know\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it seems impossible, but it is true). Each week, she puts the names of those who write the best reading responses on the assignment sheet for the following week; this is just one of Professor Gendler\u00e2\u0080\u0099s amazing tricks to make you learn and work hard in the course****. You ultimately write a long final paper on a topic of your choice- this is not an impassible hurdle, as you will have infinite available interesting topics and some built-in class-time help refining your theses. Professor Gendler is incomparable- she is energetic, hilarious, enthusiastic, and always has time to talk. At the end of the year, she had a fun class party for all of us; we all played charades and had a wonderful time.TAKETHISCLASS*And don't forget, there's always a vegan option.**http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Whistling-Vivaldi-Stereotypes-Affect-Issues\/dp\/0393339726***and falafel, pita, hummus, and mango juice-- all from Aladdins, a gem of New Haven****Another is the game show quiz which takes place at the start of most classes- great fun, particularly choosing team names.",
    "Short version: Incredible. We all agreed that Professor Gendler deserves a teaching prize. A wonderful and rare opportunity to study the intersection of these two disciplines, and a great privilege to work with the class and such a great professor. Normal to heavy reading, for a seminar, but all readings were very engaging. A large seminar but there was a real sense of community, and of collective inquiry. Challenging, for sure, but totally worth it. It was always a joy to come to class, even though it was on Monday evenings\u00e2\u0080\u0094that's saying something!Long version (essentially my writeup for the prize nomination):Professor Gendler is passionate, knowledgeable, innovative, and invested in her students. Her unique interest in the intersection of philosophy and psychology not only makes her highly accessible to students from a range of academic backgrounds, but also has trained her to constantly consider the implications of one discipline\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body of work on those of various other disciplines. Gendler is one of the only scholars in the world specifically tackling that intersection, and it is really fun to learn from her about how to engage questions from multiple disciplines, realizing that one will not suffice to answer those questions.From the very beginning of the seminar, Professor Gendler exercised wisdom as an academic, a mother, and a teacher. Her knowledge is incredible, and she often referred us to related literature about which we knew little. She selected wonderful readings that were both informative and engaging; they ranged in difficulty, accessibility, and primary focus (on psychology, cognitive science, or philosophy). Because of her well thought-out selections, most of us not only did all the reading but also chose to read some of her recommended and supplementary readings as well. Her experience as a Jewish woman who married a Hungarian and has a gender-nonconforming child has influenced the way she views the world (her value of diversity, the concepts of bias and identity, and more), resulting in captivating readings on race and gender as well as a group of students partially selected because they would represent differing life experiences and interests. Being a mother and a psychologist who just wants her \u00e2\u0080\u009ckids\u00e2\u0080\u009d to thrive, she also structured her class and her methods of communication to make it easiest for us to stay on top of things.I trust that Yale seminars have great groups of students, outstanding professors, interesting topics, and well-chosen readings, but I think that what made this recipe for success actually result in an exceptional seminar is the way Professor Gendler created a learning community out of our class. We all had different interests, some of which overlapped, and vastly different backgrounds, but Professor Gendler focused half of the first session on introductions, began each class session with a reading recap in which we broke into teams to discuss answers, and worked throughout the semester to connect students with similar passions. It seems small, but we coordinated a rotation for someone to bring snacks each class session, and that created community. After nearly every class, Professor Gendler hung out with students in Connecticut Hall over late-night food to discuss wide-ranging topics. We had long discussions on our Classes*v2 forums, even though replying to others\u00e2\u0080\u0099 posts wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t required, because we felt comfortable critically engaging one another\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ideas.Because Professor Gendler set a tone of intellectual rigor, cooperative dialogue, and intensity in following our passions, expecting us to work hard and deeply engage because we wanted to strive for excellence and not justa good grade, this seminar was phenomenal. It was a rich learning experience and a true privilege to work with Professor Gendler and this group of students."
