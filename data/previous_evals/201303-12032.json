    "really important stuff. a tad disorganized at times, but overall very glad i took it",
    "Take it! Even if you are not a WGSS or Anthropology major, but are interested in issues of labor and globalization, this is the perfect class for you. The material is very accessible and the professor is great. This class is what you make of it and the class discussions are always great!",
    "YES.Amazing class. Makes you view the world differently.",
    "I was a solid class with a lot of great discussion. \"lecture style\" schedule but very small class. Not enough writing or writing instruction for a writing class.",
    "I would highly recommend the class. Professor Judd chooses some really interested, anthropological readings on feminism, women in the working class, and gender relations abroad. She also gives lots of freedom in the final project which was great! I was able to study my specific area of interest.",
    "I love seminars with great readings, and I would not recommend this class to someone who always wants the discussions to follow from the readings, because the readings are not the greatest. That said, this class is an introduction to lots of interesting ideas that you won't understand unless you do the sometimes-less-than-fun readings. And the discussions are great! also, workload is not too bad for a writing credit.",
    "yes",
    "This year's professor (fall '13), Professor Judd, was very good! However, this was her only year here teaching, and this class seems like it would be highly dependent on the professor."
