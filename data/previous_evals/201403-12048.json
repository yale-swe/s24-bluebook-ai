   "comments": [
    "Only take this class if you are legitimately interested in the material. It's really cool to me, as a BME major, but I can see how someone would not understand a lot of wha tis going on without background.",
    "The labs themselves can be interesting, although sometimes very draining. Lab reports take a long time. However, I thought it complemented well with the course. It's also kind of fun, since you get to experiment on yourselves.",
    "BENG 355L is fine. Its not much work, and the finals not too hard. You essentially only have lab once every other week, and the lab reports arent too bad. That being said, while the labs are interesting conceptually, the machinery very often would malfunction, leading to a frustrating amount of time trying to debug issues (mainly in the dialysis lab). tl;dr, Its a decent lab with not a lot of work, but its sometimes frustrating. Take it if its required and itll be fine.",
    "There is no reason to take this lab unless you are BME major. It is a ok lab, workload not that bad, and the final is not that hard. However, you will not learn that much over the course of the semester and there will be a general feeling of confusion as you work on the labs.",
    "You need to take it as BME, but its better than the previous physics labs you'll have to take as well. Lab only meets every other week so it's pretty relaxed. Lab reports are generally 7-9 pages so not too bad, and the requirements are clearly laid out. Labs are not that hard to do themselves. Final was reasonable if you prepared.",
    "This course wasn't so bad as far as lab classes go. You only have to come every other week. The experiments are pretty cool and they help you better understand all the stuff you learned in physio.",
    "My guess is mostly biomedical engineering juniors will take this because it's required, but this lab actually is pretty cool. Try to get a good partner. It was pretty fun measuring biosignals from an actual person.",
    "Do not take this lab if you don't have to. The lack of clarity in the lab reports makes this class more trouble than it is worth. Still, if you do have to take it, there is not too much work and some of the labs are interesting.",
    "This is a requirement for BENG but it was actually enjoyable and the labs I ended up taking were all very interesting in themselves. It was also not an overwhelming amount of work or lab time per week which is unique for labs.",
    "Yeah, it's pretty good -- I'd recommend it if you need it for BME or a bio lab for premed. It's a fair amount of work for a half-credit class: lab quizzes (which were multiple choice and really picky and annoying, I hope they get rid of them next year), lab reports (which are short answer format which is really nice), and a final that's very straightforward. You get two weeks for most of the labs but finish them in at most 3 hours, so you only have to go to class like half the time.",
    "The labs were cool and relatable to the Physiological Systems course. The teaching could be better - I felt like I had to teach myself the material and the lab manuals were hard to understand. I don't think the preparation and procedure were sufficient background to write the lab reports.",
    "It's a pretty low-key lab course. You can end up going in just once every two weeks. The lab reports aren't too bad. The questions can be a bit vague, so start earlier on them and email the professor and TAs if you have questions.",
    "This lab took up a lot of time, but I feel like I learned enough. Overall not an excellent course, but not unbearable either. The TAs are super helpful and Professor Fan is a good guy. Some of the labs are impossible (dialysis in particular) or just downright painful (neuromuscular).",
    "If you take this lab, it's probably because you have to. Not too bad, lab reports aren't terrible, and it's pretty laid back.",
    "Enjoyable lab and relatively light workload. Only meets once every other week, and Professor Fan is great.",
    "BENG 355L is a pretty easy class. It meets once every two weeks, and you really only have to put in work the night before your lab report is due. But that requires about 7-10 hours on that day...",
    "Actually not so difficult. Besides some of the finicky equipment and tricky pre-lab quizzes, the labs aren't that hard or long. Some are pretty fun, like mechanical testing of chicken bones and measuring lung volume. The workload is on the lighter side because you get two weeks to work on each lab, and they usually only take one week to complete.",
    "Overall, the lab reports have pretty clear expectations, though the grading was sometimes unclear. You have plenty of time to do everything, and the labs were not too long.",
    "I'm assuming most people taking this have to take it, but You do get to learn about a diverse set of things and it is cool to go through a bunch of different body systems and learn about them and see different stimuli affect them in different ways! This class isn't that much work - the lab reports are answering specific questions so You know what they expect to see and You get two weeks to do the labs (excpet the beginning two), but it never took my partner and I more than 1 week to complete them, so essentially You only have lab every other week (and consequently a lab report due every other week).",
    "Somewhat painful lab class, professor and TAs were extremely nice",
    "Labs are every other week, so you have two weeks to complete the reports. Don't wait until the last minute because they are a pain. It's ridiculous how much stupid Excel or Matlab busywork is required just to put them together.",
    "BENG 355L is less of a direct study of physiological systems and more of a study of methods of measuring physiological systems, such as via ECG or pneumotachometer. The lab reports can be long but the lab manuals are pretty clear and the teaching team is always willing to answer questions. Be sure to look at the write-ups to see what data you are expected to collect ahead of time. Sometimes, it is difficult to tell if you just incorrectly gathered data or if the equipment is noisy, and knowing what patterns are expected will save you a lot of time. Technological problems aside, the labs can be interesting and pretty fun if you have a fun lab partner, but not too useful if you are not a BME major or pre-med."
