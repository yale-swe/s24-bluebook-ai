    "YES! This is a class every one interested in Russia and\/or Eastern Europe should take.",
    "It's frequently an \"awkwardly sized lecture\" that functions, in certain respects, more like a seminar. The format turns out to be highly conducive to allowing students to engage with the material without requiring the high level of reading a junior seminar might. As a result, it's a fun course that gets younger History students to pay attention to historiography. That's an unusual concept, and it's one more professors should pay attention to. Take it!",
    "A detailed overview of the Russian empire between its beginnings in Kiev to Catherine the Great's time.",
    "I would receommend it to anyone interested in Russian history, even if it feels obscure at times"
