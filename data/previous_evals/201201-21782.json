   "comments": [
    "This was a class that was supposed to be about the Tea Party, but it turns out that there was not enough on the Tea Party for a full semester. I would not recommend it.",
    "You learn about the Tea Party, then the last week or so is a lot of surprise political theory and psychology. But it's actually the best class. Ever.",
    "DEFINITELY. Great class, great teacher, great TA, not a killer workload.",
    "Take it if you're at all interested in the Tea Party or populism. It seems like it would beweird to take a semester long class on this topic but you'll be suprised to see just how much you'll get into with libertarianism, ideology, and populist movements. The papers are easy to complete 2 (5-7 pages) and a final (8-12) as long as you stay ontop of the reading and stay interested in the class. Conservatives don't be wary--your voices will be welcomed and heard.",
    "Great overview of the Tea Party movement and its origins in American populism and conservatism. I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a topical course that is not too labor intensive, but very interesting.",
    "This class takes a balanced, human approach towards analyzing and understanding the sentiments behind the Tea Party and other American populist movements. March is a dynamic lecturer, assigning interesting yet sometimes dense and unrigorous readings (which themselves take some time to properly analyze, but are worth it in the end). Three papers and discussion make up the grade, with not too much writing, and the assigned paper topics are quite interesting. I highly recommend this class, if only because the Political Science Department offers so little classes analyzing contemporary political happenings.",
    "Overall, it was an interesting course, although I do think that it could have been significantly improved in a number of ways. Looking at the Tea Party very critically, I think it was very hard to stay balanced.",
    "This is a fine course. You will almost certainly learn something about American conservatism, and how what I found a mystifying doctrine at first actually makes some sense. March is an excellent lecturer, and the readings are intriguing - though you will probably find some a little dry.",
    "An interesting class if you are an American politics junkie. You learn to appreciate the complexity behind the Tea Party - which really is a bit more difficult than just Palin. That said, I am not sure I would take it again.",
    "I would take it again, but only if it is revamped as a seminar.",
    "I would recommend the first half of this class. I would recommend the wholething under the condition that the syllabus is a little more finalized and Professor March has time to find some more concrete or related readings for the class to do.",
    "This class was a great assessment on the Tea Party, populist movements, and populist philosophy in general. It wasn't a whole lot of work, and it seemed a lot like tuning into an interesting documentary a few times a week.",
    "This class is sort of fun (every lecture starts with a youtube video!), but ultimately I didn't think people got much out of it. The material is redundant and presented in a completely unfocused manner. The class just didn't quite come together."
