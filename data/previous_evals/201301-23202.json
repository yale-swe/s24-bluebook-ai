    "I would recommend it for those interested in learning about what it's like to be a politician, to be involved in the political world, and what it takes to be a politician. Also those interested in ethnography.",
    "If you want to think more about political selfhood and the accumulation of political power, this is a pretty solid class. If that's not your cup of tea, you're going to be pretty bummed out.",
    "It was a small class so good discussion and lots of personal attention.",
    "Take it! If you're interested about political science outside of dry statistical data, you will love this course and come out having learned more than you realize.",
    "I would recommend this class. It is a good mix of learning the background of politics and studying more generally how people interact with one another."
