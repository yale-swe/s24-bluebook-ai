    "Take it. Favorite, most important photo class I have taken as a photo concentration in the major. Ben takes full advantage of the class size and really teaches the students the fundamentals of the view camera. His teaching incorporates practicing photographic techniques in a slower and more direct way than I've had in the past and this was definitely a plus. He is also one of the most personable teachers I know and really understands and appreciates the medium. Our graduate TA was great too which furthered the enjoyability of the course.",
    "This class is for people who love photography and want to learn about it in a more hands-on environment, rather than sit through long lectures about how to use a camera, etc. etc. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is really committed to photography and wants to learn a lot of advanced techniques before leaving Yale. If you are casual about it then it's not worth it, take a different class.",
    "definitely.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Take it!",
    "This is a photography class for students who have already taken a lot of photography. It's not quite as conceptually based as other classes - like, lessons focus on technical approaches to photography as well as photography history and consideration of concept... There are crits just like in any art class, and the lectures alternate between the aforementioned subjects..."
