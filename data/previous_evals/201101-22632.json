   "comments": [
    "Amazing seminar: interesting material, but, more importantly, the absolute best, most knowledgeable, friendliest professor. Weekly writing exercises focusing on different historical\/research approaches allow for the development of an applicable, practical skill set for any history major.",
    "Yes! If you find yourself likely to become entranced by the topic. It's a VERY narrowly focused course; but the monastic writings are very beautiful, and all the careful, detail-oriented close readings really pay off. You learn about the complexities\/impossibilities of archaeology, as well - not an oft-covered topic and VERY interesting. Note: you do NOT learn much about ancient Christianity or any sort of recognizable theology; the Coptic Church doesn't have much to do with Western Christianity.",
    "Without hesitation. great material, great class, great professor",
    "Absolutely recommended, especially for interest in Christian history (ca. 3d-5th cent. AD), anthropology, Coptic history. I would define the course in terms of two foci: the monastery as a developing social institution, and the historical method for studying late antiquity.",
    "YES.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in monasticism, or even historical research methods. That said, if you're intending to take this class to grow as a Christian, you may be better served by other classes, as the theology of many of these monks is rather unorthodox by contemporary standards. Also, the workload looks terrifying at first, but it becomes considerably easier after the second week.",
    "Professor Layton is a true scholar and an outstanding teacher. I fully recommend this course to anyone with an interest in early Christian monasticism and who wants to read early monastic texts (which is exclusively what this class is about) or, like me, you pick your classes based on the professors. The reading and workload is highly manageable for a junior history seminar.",
    "I would definitely recommend RLST 420 to just about any student with an interest in religious studies or the history of late antiquity. Professor Layton is amazing, the readings are splendid, and the course provides excellent training in documentary analysis."
