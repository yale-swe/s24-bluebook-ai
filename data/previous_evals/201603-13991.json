    "An understanding of independence from the individual to the nation-state to the social group\/collective. I also received extensive feedback on all of my essays, which were graded fairly and were critiqued in-depth and very helpfully.",
    "In reading a myriad of texts from different genres, I have a better understanding of independence as a theme, but also my analytical writing became more nuanced from reading primary and secondary sources.",
    "This course intelligently and coherently synthesizes a wide variety of readings, navigating between primary accounts and secondary critiques in order to reach the ultimate theme of independence. This class sharpened my close-reading abilities and honed my ability to express them, since this course also emphasized clear articulation, both in the classroom and in one's essays.",
    "So many. My goodness. In this class I learned about cultures, histories, a bit of sociology and psychology, and of course got a ton of practice in reading analytically and writing literarily.",
    "This course helped me develop skills on critical analysis of texts and works. It was a challenging and thought provoking course that provided me with an opportunity to delve deep into subject matter that I have not experienced before."

   "comments": [
    "Fantastic professors individually, though I'm not sure what a good team they are. They are certainly complementary, but don't seem to mesh their separate curricula particularly well. That said, they are both wonderful people, very involved in students' work, and exceptionally knowledgeable and willing to share extra information if prompted. They took all of the texts to a new level. The syllabus is eclectic in the best way.",
    "I wish we had more students in the class so more people could take this fabulous course.",
    "I appreciated the emphasis on intertextuality the class seemed to naturally demand, considering that throughout the entire semester, we were reading for a particular theme. The trips to the art gallery and the Beinecke added to this wonderful intertextuality, seeing as even the medium of that which we studied had a direct impact on what it could add to the dialogue. All the writing workshops were extremely helpful, and the back-and-forth between the two professors was truly seamless.",
    "This course was just about perfect. Instructors were really good teachers, and were helpful and patient and kind. The seminar style worked out brilliantly, the discussion was almost always really lively and meaningful.",
    "The course content was extremely diverse and relevant. All of the readings, materials, and discussion points created a close environment that fostered development, analysis, and critical discussion. A key strength was the small class size as it ensured that all learners engaged with the material and that each was able to express their views and opinions. Having two faculty members was also a strength as they were able to guide different views and thought processes."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. A must-take.",
    "Absolutely, yes.",
    "This course is a must! The readings are fascinating and all work in harmony with each other and the themes that class discussion itself is able to put up for consideration. Each class was engaging, and I feel it was structured so that all would leave more articulate and more understanding of the issues at hand.",
    "Definitely. 100%. Best class I've taken here.",
    "I would recommend this course to others, especially if they have an interest in literature and the arts. Although it was a particularly challenging course for me based on the fact that I have never engaged in the subjects offered, both of the faculty members assisted me at all times and made sure that I was able to get the most out of the course. I will be able to use the skills that I have learnt in other courses and found it relevant to my interests."
