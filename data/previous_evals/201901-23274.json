    "Even though the course is structured to provide us an insight into biochemical and biophysical methods that we can apply to our research, it seemed to have been lost in translation. I felt that the course structure was more towards fitting these biological methods into a specific science and did not allow the flexibility to think of science in different terms aside from what the instructor's expertise is on. I felt that I have not taken away any useful information that I could apply top my research or academic curriculum.",

    "I did not gain much knowledge or insight from this course. I learned a little bit about microscopy and the techniques available to me but I would not say I have a strong understanding of the material of the lectures. The most I learned from this course was kinetics but that was primarily because it was taught to me by somebody outside of the course so that I could complete the homework.",
    "I learned various biochem\/biophysics methods that I can potentially apply to my research.",
    "I gained few skills or insights in this course. I learned the most in the mass spec lectures. All other topics were review from undergraduate courses. I agree that molecular biologists should approach experiments more quantitatively. However, it would have been more helpful to dive into cutting edge techniques that we could bring to our lab. Instead, we skimmed over numerous topics not always applicable to our research. We greatly need to increase our understanding of how to use proper statistics. One stats lecture was not enough. Half the course couldve been dedicated to choosing the proper statistical test.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This might be due to the fact we had multiple instructors, but there was very little continuity with the course. It felt like we were constantly jumping from one topic to another without having much time to digest the previous topic. In addition, many instructors went in to the physics and chemistry aspect of their subject and failed to cover the biological application which is more suited for the students taking the class.",
    "Strengths: most of the lectures are very good and the corresponding assignments are matched well. The instructors are very responsible, making sure that we can learn from the lectures and use that knowledge to daily experiments. Weaknesses: some discussion papers are obscure, we may need more illustrations about the experimental details. The character limit for the final paper is wired to me. And I think the guideline for the final paper can be more detailed. For example, how to write a good specific aim, the tips for writing background and citation.",
    "Weakness: The topics are limited, especially in the last part of the course, NMR and MS are not well taught; on the other hand, microscopy is too much. Lack of hand-on experience",
    "Major weaknesses of the course include the lecturer's engagement to the audience, the topic being presented and how well it is explained (as not everyone comes from a heavy biochemical and biophysical background). Another is the grading system and expectations of the course directors for the final paper and what is \"proper science\".",
    "I appreciate all of the biochemical and biophysical knowledge students are given as a result of this class (kinetics, statistics, microscopy, MS, NMR, etc). I think more clear organization would be helpful. Specifically, some assignments did not have formal guidelines (a document) but were communicated verbally, or through an announcement (Some students, like myself, may miss these. Is there a way to turn on updates?), or through a handout (no digital copy in case something happens to the original!). I think just a unified digital location to check for these things in an ordered fashion would be helpful to keep students oriented correctly throughout class. Announcements\/emails are not structured to support this. The Canvas file system is much better.",
    "Tom Pollard is obviously very knowledgeable. This course proved that. In fact, that was the only thing we learned in this course. This entire course felt like a semester long ego trip with the objective to show us how much he knew, without regard to whether we were actually learning things.",
    "Strengths: The idea of this class is good - It's a great idea to provide an overview of how biochemistry can be applied to cell biology research. Weakness: The class was not actually carried out well. In some portions (for example NMR), there was too much emphasis on how the method worked and not enough on how you can apply it to biology. In others, there were difficult concepts that were brushed over too quickly (for example Kinetics). Additionally, students working in genetics weren't taught tools that they could use in their actual work. Finally, students with a biochemistry degree should not have to take the class. As someone with a biochemistry degree, it felt like a massive waste of time and I would have much rather spent that time in a class that covered a topic that I didn't study for four years. In my opinion, this class needs to be fundamentally re-worked. For this class to be effective, each class should be structured as follows: What is the method? How does it work (briefly)? What questions can you answer with this method {This should be the most important \/ emphasized part}? How do you prepare your sample for this method? Examples of this method being implicated in MCDB, cell biology, or genetics. Advantages \/ disadvantages of the method. Practical tips. The sections of the class that did this the best were the microscopy lectures taught by Joerg Brewersdorf and the entire mass spec section. They covered the relevant background then explained when you would, for example, use one method of ionization over the other or one method of super res imaging over another. I understood what types of questions I could ask using this method and the basics of how I would go about carrying out the method. It was not too complicated and interesting \/ easy to follow. Additionally, the homework for this class was at such a basic level it was a little offensive. Many assignments felt like they were written for high schoolers. I'm guessing that this class isn't actually going to be changed. But, if by some miracle those in charge decide to change it, they should ask graduate students who took the course (who come from biochem and don't come from biochem) for their input on the course so that it can actually be designed in a way that will be useful.",
    "strength: guest speakers weakness: not Tommy P fault but some guest speakers overcomplicated the methods how it could be improved: when introducing a technique describe what it is, what it is used for, examples or describe how it can be applied for biological questions, limitations and then all the complex technical components",
    "Strengths: Most lectures were good. I definitely appreciated the stats review and handout. Hearing about what instruments\/techniques are available here at Yale could prove useful. Weaknesss: I, and probably many others, learn lab techniques by doing them; not necessarily by just hearing about it. I do not think the course material translates well into a traditional seminar style class.",
    "One major weakness of this course is a lack of organization. Very frequently, homework or papers to read were assigned only a few days before they were due, which can be hard to plan for when you are working full time in lab and already have experiments planned. Sometimes papers to read were posted in the morning on the day of the paper discussion. I think it's unreasonable to expect everyone to be able to read the paper with such short notice when courses are not our only obligation. Additionally, our homework was graded pass\/fail and we received little to no feedback on them. Sometimes assignments received a fail grade for seemingly arbitrary reasons even if the majority of the assignment was correct. Furthermore, there was very little guidance for the final paper, which made up a large percentage of the overall course grade. There were a lot of unspoken rules for how the final paper could be written and what types of topics could be written about, even though the official instructions made it seem like there was a lot of freedom about the types of things you could write about. Overall I did not find the lectures very helpful or informative, and when it came time to write the final paper I did not feel like I was well equipped to write it because I did not have a good understanding of the techniques we were supposed to understand. Furthermore, we did not have much time to write the paper (only 1 week) after receiving feedback from our peers.",
    "I am going to focus on the weaknesses here because I feel they are most applicable to improving the course. First, I think it should be made clear to lecturers that while going deep into detail about the physics or mechanics behind the experimental methods is interesting, the primary goal of each lecture should be to (1) describe a technique at a simple level, (2) explain how that technique can be utilized with examples, and (3) go a little more into the detail of how it can be used. I was hoping to learn about techniques available to me in this course, but unfortunately the focus of most lectures was not on application but on things I will never need to know to perform or troubleshoot a technique. So, I would first recommend increasing the clarity of lectures and making sure the time spent is actually useful. The second thing I would change is the grading system. I find it absurd that there was only one grader for the course, given there were way too many students for him to be able to provide feedback or put in effort with grading (no fault of his own). Having a pass\/fail homework system in graduate school is comical. Many of the homework were riddled with errors or vague questions and really need to be written better or at least proofread before being posted. Getting a \"0\" on a homework because you missed one component of one question is absolutely ridiculous. Either be willing to have enough people put in effort to grade the homework, or don't assign it. The organizers knew the number of students that would be in the course far before the beginning of the semester, as the incoming MCGD class was large. The room should have been changed to a better (larger) room that actually has enough tables and chairs for each student, and there should have been more graders. The next (and perhaps most the most fundamental) issue is that this course completely lacks organization or any type of cohesive schedule as far as student involvement. Homework assignment? Find out at the last second, and receive a terribly written problem set. Read a paper and answer questions? We'll post it on the website the day before class. It's horrendous. I don't understand how we can be expected to perform well on homework if we have no idea when it will be assigned OR if we are only given 1-2 days to complete it. How is this the standard that Yale faculty are being held to? Organize and plan ahead. This is a vital component of being good at lab work, I don't understand how it could not be applied to the class. It makes it seem like little to no effort was put forth in the organization of this course. Perhaps it has been taught for too many years and only minimally changed, but it seems as if the organizers have become complacent. It's also worth noting that many homeworks bore absolutely no resemblance to the lecture content. I also found it a little awkward at times in class when one of the course organizers would call out and question the lecturers. There were times that the lecturers became visibly flustered and uncomfortable because they were being constantly questioned or rudely corrected by one of the organizing professors. This felt, at times, inappropriate. I also found it inappropriate how one of the course organizers was defending the character of James Watson. The same organizer also snapped to get people's attention, which I found rude and a little degrading. Overall, I would recommend a complete overhaul of this course and its lecturers. While some lectures stood out as being useful and well structured (Joerg is a wonderful lecturer), many, many more stood out as remarkably bad. The organization was poor and\/or not well communicated with students, the content was not widely accessible or beneficial to a majority of the students, and there were many times that in-class sessions became awkward, rude, and overall were not worth attending. I got very little out of this course and it needs major work for improvement.",
    "This course covers various topics, with separate lecturers for each session. I felt that the quality and focus of the sessions varied a lot depending on the lecturer. It might be better if the main focus\/goal of the course was clearly set up beforehand.",
    "Lectures were too cursory to actually gain a deep understanding of any of the topics. Molecular biologists are not afraid of math; however, the lectures assumed we do not have a solid background in chemistry or mathematics and compensated by being overly simplistic. Most of us have taken organic chemistry, biochemistry, physics, or even have undergraduate degrees in these disciplines. Homework assignments felt like busy work because they did not go beyond what we learned in introductory freshman courses in college. The course must be redesigned, perhaps as a seminar class, to be improved. I learned more from the paper discussions than any lectures or homework assignments.",
    "it wasn't well-structured to foster engagement or understanding of the applications of the techniques (for example, when to use which technique), although this was something we were routinely asked in the homeworks. often, homework questions were very difficult because not only were they not remotely addressed in class, but they were difficult to ascertain from the literature or poorly worded. additionally, it did not feel at all relevant to my work (for example, i will never be doing microscopy...) personally, i thought the final paper really helped me better understand the techniques\/biochemistry more, though--designing experiments is the best way to learn, i think, and is especially useful as a grad student",
    "The final paper was centered only around what the teacher believed to be important tools, and wasn't representative for all subsets of BBS.",
    "Great",
    "The strength of this course is that we got to learn lots of biochemistry techniques. It also helps us develop as a scientist as the course teaches us to think more carefully about controls when performing experiments.",
    "There are a lot of approaches introduced in this course. But there are some that are less likely to be applied for most of us, like MS and kinetic analysis."

There was no syllabus with dates each homework would be due, and we were often given only a few days notice for each assignment.
