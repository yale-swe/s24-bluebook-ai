    "Awesome!! Take this course!!!! If you want to improve your writing, your editing, your research skills, or anything related to digging up information and turning it into a compelling narrative, then this class is for you. It is a unique blend of History and English majors in a very small seminar, so there are lots of different perspectives and ideas broached in this class. Also, you should just take this class to get to work on your writing with Mr. Ball. He's incredible, and everyone can always be a better writer.",
    "Take this class! If you're lucky enough to get in, absolutely do it! Prof. Ball is amazing -- he's a National Book Award-winning author (though he's adorably modest about it), so you're truly learning about the craft from one of the best. The small seminar style means that you really get to know the other students well. And the fact that we workshopped every student's papers, for each of the different writing assignments, was absolutely crucial. Never before have I gotten that level of attention and feedback on my writing, and it made such an incredible difference. Plus, it's fun to watch your classmates' writing styles evolve along with your own! The readings were all excellent, pieces of literature that I would have happily read for pleasure anyways. The only element that I didn't enjoy as much were the mandatory documentary screenings, but I'm not really a movie person so that may be just me. Overall, it was incredible to have the chance to explore so many different subjects and really devote myself to improving my writing so thoroughly, with such an excellent instructor and set of classmates. The class was a significant amount of work -- but that's just because I chose to devote a lot of time to my papers, and it was so great to be able to have the chance to do so, and so rewarding to see the final product of all of my hard work. I absolutely cannot recommend this course highly enough!!",
    "I would recommend it if you're interested in writing pretty standard historical journalism. It's an entirely different genre of essay, and it's probably one that people would benefit from studying. The teaching isn't great, but I'm sure people could get a lot out of it simply from putting the work in themselves.",
    "If you can get in, take it. Its so cool to get to find an interesting story--any story--and tell it how you want it. I feel so lucky that you can get history credit for it. All my essays now are just a touch more narrative, in a great way. All graders like essays that they enjoy reading more than those that are so hard to get through. It is basically an English class though, so keep that in mind if youre expecting something different.",
    "You will be challenged to push the boundaries of truthful storytelling and explore a diverse collection of approaches to narrative nonfiction writing. If your experience is anything like mine, this class will permanently alter the way you write, both creatively and academically.",
    "AMAZING workshop experience! You will read some really kick-ass work from the genre of narrative nonfiction, and you will read some really kick-ass (maybe even more so) work from your peers. I had a lot of fun finding and writing stories for this class. You have a lot of reading, but I usually blamed right through it because it was so much fun to read. If you are interested in a really hot genre of writing right now, TAKE IT! You will learn a lot about craft, and have the chance to have your work critiqued by your peers for every single paper-- which seems scary, but is an absolute blessing in the end. I feel that my writing improved so much because of this course.",
    "The class is cross-listed under history as a seminar, so it's good for fulfilling the seminar requirement under the history major. Ball does a good job integrating aspects of historical research and writing into the class, but it is first and foremost a writing course. If you want to write and improve your writing ability, this class is perfect.",
    "Absolutely apply for this seminar. If you get in you'll become a better storyteller, hands down. If you want to do long form journalism, or just be able to tell a compelling story in general, this class will give you techniques that will hook your reader in for whatever narrative you're telling. It's a decent amount of work, so take it if you like writing. But a lot of people didn't have formal YDN\/journalism training, so don't be intimidated if you don't.",
    "This is the most valuable class I've taken at Yale, hands down. If you have any interest in writing, even a secret, uncertain interest, then go for it. The instructor, Mr. Ball, knows his stuff inside and out. You will not only benefit from his mastery of the subject, you will also benefit from the thoughtful, well-structured critique sessions with your fellow students. I loved this class. If I could, I would take it again.",
    "This is a great writing class. You learn to tell a historical narrative by stealing the techniques of fictional storytelling. This class is ideal for a history major who is interested in writing and literature. I definitely recommend taking it, if you get in!"
