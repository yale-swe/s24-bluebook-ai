   "comments": [
    "I really liked the content in the course, and the professor, but I think the assignments could be improved. The homework was okay in terms of content again but I felt like they took all of us far longer than we anticipated each time. Also the fact that we got NO feedback during the entire course was a struggle. I understand that it was partially just how the semester went this time but it was still frustrating. We got our first homework back in the second to last week of class and since we still have not received back any others, it's hard to say how I am doing overall. I feel like it would be unfair to give us lower grades on homeworks simply because we never got the feedback to know how we could have improved. I will say though, I am really glad that the final paper was made shorter because it felt super aggressive before! I feel that the presentation and a 5-6 page single space paper is quite fair.",
    "I enjoyed the course a lot. Learned a lot about malaria, HIV, and TB.",
    "AMAZING COURSE. Definitely take it. Prof. Parikh is amazingly eloquent and knowledgeable. Must take at YSPH.",
    "It was hard to get a sense of how I was doing in the class since we didn't get any graded assignments back until the last week of class. I liked the content a lot, but it was frustrating to keep getting assigned homework assignments with no idea of how I had done on anything up to that point.",
    "STRENGTHS: Interesting topics covered, professor is very current in his knowledge of the Big 3 WEAKNESSES: Assignments are mostly just regurgitation and sometimes feel like you are just doing work for the sake of doing work",
    "I got the most out of the final project, and I found it really interesting to learn about the organizations. I wasn't as interested in the presentations that were not about the organizations. I didn't get much out of anything else in the course. Much of what I learned was information I had learned in previous courses, and there was not much new. Also, at least for EMD students, we have heard that same lecture from Gerry Freidland way too many times. It was super interesting the first time, and I am really glad I heard it. If he comes again, please make him present on something other than Tugela Ferry and how this is just getting at the ears of the hippo. Perhaps doing group discussions might help although with the size of the class, it might be difficult.",
    "The class was really engaging and informative, and I enjoyed Sunil as a lecturer. Workload was appropriate for the class and tied into the readings and lecture material well. Unfortunately, we rarely received feedback, as the homework assignments were returned at the tail end of the semester, after all but one assignment had already been turned in. The final project was also rough - 4 hours during the reading period for presentations was a large time commitment, especially given the myriad of other projects scheduled during reading week instead of finals period. Overall, I did like the class and would recommend it. The lectures covered \"the big 3\" from a variety of perspectives - medical, historical, social, etc...and I feel I have a stronger background in infectious disease because of it.",
    "I was disappointed with the course and I wasn't sure what exactly I was supposed to be learning. Strengths -The videos were nice and were a good break in lecture. - Focusing on Africa was a good idea, but I feel like themes could be better highlighted throughout the lectures to link the Big 3 together. Weaknesses - Learning objectives at the beginning of each lecture would be helpful to help us know what we should be taking away from the 2 hr lecture. The homework could be drawn from these learning objectives. - Time management--> the clock is slow in the classroom - The final presentations should be done during class time, and only have one extra class during reading week. - If you want us to read the articles beforehand, they need to be posted before the weekend prior to class. - The final presentations and paper seemed kind of redundant especially since we did the presentations in groups and the paper individually.",
    "Very interesting topics, good broad overview. Some of the lectures were quite dense and a little difficult for someone without an EMD background to follow. The individual assignment and group assignment both had aspects that felt like they were a little repetitive\/redundant. For example, with the individual journal presentation we had to give an in class presentation and a write up. The write-up for the individual presentation and the group presentation felt redundant and unnecessary. There didn't appear to be a value add.",
    "This class covered a lot of interesting material. Some of it though was repetitive to what weve gotten in other classes, particularly in the realm of HIV and TB. I think that the strength of this class was the historical and structural contexts that the diseases were put into, and I wish there was more of that. Something that might be useful would be to revamp the final projects to go along with each of the units, since I thought that could more proximately strengthen that material. A lot of us have talked about things like vector control, TB transmission and treatment (though in less detail), and some history of the HIV epidemic, so I think better contextualizing the framework in which theyre studied and treated now would be helpful. One other thing that was a repeat was Dr. Friedlands lecture. While he is really fascinating, we have seen almost an identical lecture by him in both EMD seminar and Principles of Infectious diseases.",
    "Strengths: Provides an in-depth view about the three diseases Weakness: There is no feedback on work that is provided or on presentations that are given. If there is no feedback, how can there be improvement?",
    "Strengths-- cool material. Interesting if one of the big three is of interest to you. This course is taught by someone who knows a TON of material Weaknesses: Disorganized; little to NO feedback on how you are doing. Completed four homework assignments before getting one returned to us. Basically did tons of work all semester not knowing how you were doing. Prof had high standards but provided almost no instruction, leaving all of us students frustrated",
    "I think that although the material in this course was interesting, I am unsure of how much of the info was actually new to me and how much of this new info I actually retained. I sort of would have preferred having some exams as opposed to in-class presentations to reinforce the material. However, I do think the homework assignments did help to reinforce material and I learned a lot just by doing the homework. The structure of the class really needs to change. Cramming a group project, individual papers and two homework assignments into the last few weeks of class, when we have so much other stuff going on, was brutal on us. I don't think having us do individual papers in addition to the large group presentations was necessary. The last 2 homework assignments could probably have been combined into one.",
    "Great course. I learned a lot in the relaxed atmosphere and really appreciated the homework questions that did not just ask us to regurgitate information covered in class. The obvious weakness was that we didn't get homework back until our last one was due so we couldn't improve our work because we hadn't received any feedback.",
    "The required readings were highly relevant despite being plentiful. The PowerPoint slides provided great detail about the topics, yet occasionally failed to clarify the larger picture.",
    "This course was fine as an EMD elective. These are definitely three major global infectious diseases and I did learn some things about them. It was a relatively easy course and lectures were interesting. I didn't feel like I got a lot out of the homework assignments, they felt a little like busy work, but maybe it is just because I am less interested personally in these diseases. I did really enjoy the final project learning about major global organizations that work on these diseases - I felt that as a future public health professional these organizations are important to learn about.",
    "The material presented in this course has essentially already been covered in previous EMD seminars and classes. The homework assignments were arduous, overdrawn, and basically never returned. The course could be improved if homework assignments were returned in a timely manner.",
    "I wanted to learn more about the human geography and sociology relating to the big three. How they impact populations as well as individuals.",
    "The format of the course never varied. It was always a PowerPoint lecture (occasionally given by students or guest lecturers) for the entirety of the course. I think the class content is such that the course could have been much more engaging if different activities or discussions were planned.",
    "It was a good class- very interesting material and the lectures were engaging. However, there was very little feedback throughout the course, so it was difficult to know how you were doing and whether there was anything that needed to be changed for future assignments."

    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Amazing, amazing professor. Funny, soft-spoken, extremely intelligent, excited about these three diseases. He's very understanding and welcoming. You'll learn so much.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Assignments were really delayed in getting back to us. I think we didn't get a single homework assignment back until it was time to submit the last assignment. This makes it difficult to improve our work. To date, I have only gotten back two homework assignments, and we did 5 plus a journal presentation and paper that I still have no idea what I got on. Better feedback is important. It seems like you didn't care about the work we were doing, which makes us care a lot less about the course.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is very passionate about this subject. Only recommendation I would make is to return our assignments quicker.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Strengths - Sunil's awesome Weaknesses - No homework feedback or presentation feedback - It didn't really seem like Sunil cared too much about the course because we never received homework back and we just did it for the sake of doing homework and presentations.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Receptive to student concerns, shortened the length of the paper and extended the deadlines for homework as needed. The course could use a little more organization in general. Appreciate the mix of lectures and student presentations. But signing up for these projects etc all felt a little disorganized. Homework assignments were not returned until the very end of the semester which made it difficult to know how you were doing in the course.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil was engaging and brought interesting background and personal perspectives to the class. I understand that there was some sort of issue with the homeworks being graded, but I think its really necessary to provide feedback. It would be helpful to maybe set a 2-3 week time frame in which the homeworks would be returnedwe started to get the sense that they werent being looked at and it was kind of frustrating to continue to do the homeworks with no feedback. One other thing that I think could be worked on is respect for our timethere were several instances where Sunil was a few minutes late for class, and when class went over as well. I understand that things come up and that we are all busy, but it would be much appreciated if we felt like our time was a bit better respected by both starting and ending on time! I dont think we minded the latter as much as the former though.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Strength: Very knowledgeable in the field. Weakness: Needs to provide feedback in a timely and appropriate manner.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Nice guy, funny. He is very interested in the material and very smart. However he does not communicate very well. His instructions for papers are vague. He did not return graded HWs to us for almost 13 weeks into the semester.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is a great professor and is very knowledgeable in the material we are learning. I enjoyed his lectures as well. My big complaint is that we got very little feedback on materials that we turned in. We submitted several homework assignments before getting any grades back, so even if there were things we could improve upon for future assignments, it was too late to change anything. I never got feedback on my individual presentation that I gave fairly early on in the semester, nor on the writeup that I had to submit for that. I understand that the professor is very busy, but if it's too much work to get all of the assignments graded in a timely fashion, the amount assigned should be reduced accordingly or he should seek help from a TF.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Awesome professor with a great sense of humor, is engaging, and able to answer questions about the material. Only improvement: grade us faster! ;)",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Sunil is funny and charismatic and gets the material across. However I have two big criticisms: 1) he always went over time. This wasn't so bad if only a few minutes over class time but sometimes he would go over so much that student presenters for that day couldn't give their presentation. And 2) he only got us feedback on our two of our 5 homeworks and only got them back to us in the last weeks of class. This was really what was frustrating because you were basically flying blind on how he interpreted your homeworks. There was no time to revise and improve. Very irritating.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Dr. Parikh is highly knowledgeable and an engaging lecturer. His expertise in the various topics covered in this class led to poignant homework questions and topics discussed in class. However, we did not receive feedback for our work. He mentioned in one class that we would generally receive high pass if we did the assignment and honors if we went above and beyond. Without feedback until the final weeks of the semester on only 2 out of 5 homework assignments, it was difficult to know if my perception of doing additional work aligned with Dr. Parikh's.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0This class would be better without many PowerPoint slides. PPT is passive learning. I would have preferred more of a seminar type class to discuss the readings and listen to the instructor rather than trying to read a power point while he's talking. Also a more inspiring, enthusiastic attitude is much needed from this (and honestly all Yale) instructor(s) in order to engage and teach better.",
    "Instructor: Sunil Parikh \u00a0Professor Parikh is a good lecturer- his lectures are interesting, engaging and informative. He was understanding and reasonable in terms of adjusting work loads and other situations. His weakness was punctuality, both in terms of keeping class on schedule and moreover, getting homework back in a reasonable time."

    "For someone who has not learned much about the Big 3, this course is a good introductory course on TB, HIV and malaria. Otherwise, you may not learn too many new things. A lot of the same topics are covered in other EMD lectures and we have heard Dr. Friedland speak with the same presentation multiple times.",

    "I would not recommend this class to another student. If he\/she has already taken seminar and principles of infectious diseases, nothing new will be learned.",
    "Overall it's a good class. A lot of information about drugs. Not much information on sociological or specifically public health concerns. And a shit ton of homework. You have to do a final presentation and a final paper based on the presentation! Redundant.",
    "If you are interested in TB, HIV and Malaria, this course is a great way to learn more. You'll get a lot of information. Professor Parikh knows a lot about these subjects and is a really good lecturer. But don't expect quick feedback on your assignments."
