   "comments": [
    "We learned various matrix properties and applications and how to apply them to various mathematical problems. I would recommend the class to someone who wants an application-based approach to linear algebra.",
    "great class to take for anyone interested in math, econ, or sciences, even if you dont necessarily need it",
    "This class is excellent. If you go to lecture and take notes, you'll have absolutely no problem doing any of the problems sets of examinations. Professor Schultheiss is very organized and fair about workload and grading. There are 3 short problem sets a week, so you never fall behind, but he lets you turn them in up to a week late, in case something comes up. I couldn't recommend this class more.",
    "The HW is ok with a mix of theory and application as are the tests. I think it is a cool subject (really the basis of computer math) but it could be made more dynamic and interesting if given greater meaning by the professor. He really just runs through his notes without much elaboration making MIT open course lectures a decent idea.",
    "A little bit dull, but it is a math class, so as far as those go, this was pretty good. Not too difficult, but the second midterm is much harder than the first so don't get lulled too deeply into a false sense of security (although the second midterm, though worse, still isn't that bad).",
    "The second midterm was hard!!! I think the class is doable, but you need to make sure that you stay on top of the material and understand the concepts (so that you can get any tricky questions put on the exam). Don't take this class if you don't need it, but if you do need it, it won't be bad enough to make you change majors.",
    "It's an important class to take if you want to do any kind of engineering\/science. Linear algebra is used in all kinds of statistical analyses and programming languages and is very useful. This class is pretty well based in applications, so if you want a super proof-based pure math class then take 225.",
    "I feel like this class is pretty typical of a normal math class.",
    "I would recommend this class. Linear algebra is very useful to know. Also, if you're looking to take this class, then it's probably a prerequisite or a requirement for a major, in which case I definitely recommend taking it with Schultheiss.",
    "Kind of hard, you should really go to all\/most classes if you want to do well. Using class time for review sessions before tests and the final was a big plus.",
    "Take this class with Professor Schultheiss. He is a solid teacher, and as long as you do the reading you should understand everything. Do the reading BEFORE class, otherwise you might get lost in lecture. Although there is definitely an age gap between you and Prof. S, he truly loves what he does, and wants his class to love it too. His style of administering shorter p-sets every class is also a good method of keeping you on top of your work. Rather than having everything built up to the end of the week, the learning is more of a gradual, linear process.",
    "A good course in linear algebra. Make sure that if you take this class, you take it with professor Schultheiss.",
    "I would recommend this class just because of the sheer usefulness of the material. It's a great subject and it's a shame that it has to be taught by two really bad teachers here (Schultheiss and Algom-Kfir)",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to another student unless it was relevant to their major.",
    "Super easy. Definitely take it with Schultheiss. Administrative side of the course is a bit disorganized (in terms of getting psets back, finding solutions, etc.), but material is all presented very clearly (and follows the book well for most of the semester).",
    "Take it with Yael.",
    "Yeah, if you're considering it, you probably should take it. Not too difficult.",
    "It's a really straightforward class, and it's really easy to control how well you do in it (for all you premeds out there). The lectures are actually pretty interesting, and I feel like I've learned a fair amount of math. It's not the most exciting class ever, but it was relatively stress-free which counts for something.",
    "Yes I would recommend it if they like problem solving.",
    "Be prepared to be set a problem set during every class. Oh, and there's no classes v2 so you either have to go to class to get the homework or have a friend tell you what it is.",
    "Good class--take it. The material is not only useful, but very interesting (at least after the first couple weeks).",
    "MATH222 is a good class to take if you want to learn the fundamental concepts of Linear Algebra and understand some of its basic applications. There are no rigorous proofs in this course, so any deep understanding that you want to have of proofs of formulas must be done on your own. I would recommend this class to another student in that it teaches linear algebra thoroughly, but I think it could be taught better.",
    "This is not a thrilling class but it is not bad. Professor Schultheiss is very kind. He is sometimes difficult to follow in lecture. There are three short problem sets a week which break up the work. The exams are not difficult if you do the practice exams he provides. Overall a good class.",
    "Take it if you have to. Show up to lecture even though it sucks. I didn't and it bit me in the ass. He tests you on particular problems from lecture, while not always assigning these on problem sets.",
    "Good class, if you like math.",
    "Yes, I would. Math 222 can be kind of boring, but there are some really interesting things about it. I think I was one of the few people who didn't have to take it for their major. Professor Schultheiss can be a little slow in doing computation on the board, but he definitely knows everything well, and gets through it well. I really enjoyed having him as a teacher.",
    "I would take this class if you are interested in linear algebra or you need this class. It isn't especially exciting or anything out of the ordinary so I wouldn't take it unless you are really interested. The workload is manageable and the material isn't too difficult.",
    "Take it if you are an autodidact.",
    "The material taught in this course was quite interesting, and Professor Schultheiss is a very sweet and friendly professor. If you are looking to take linear algebra, take this section.",
    "I would recommend taking Math 222 if you have to or want to take an easier math course. If you are going to take the course, make sure you take it with Schulteiss.",
    "Lots of material. Sometimes complicated. Kind, passionate teacher, though not the best at helping a beginner at linear algebra understand topics. I spent a lot of time outside of class trying to understand concepts. Schultheiss is very helpful when approached, though.",
    "Yes, it isn't too difficult or stressful.",
    "Depends. If you are interested in math and science and laying a foundation for alot of math and science to come later, this is the class for you. If you don't want that, I'm not sure I would recommend taking it for fun.",
    "I like linear algebra. I think I am in a minority, but there are a lot of people in engineering, comp sci etc for whom it will be useful and I have found Prof Schultheiss to be a good person to take it with.I really like Prof Schultheiss and he really likes Math. If you have problems, try going to his office hours. He is very patient with explaining things. If office hour times don't work for you, try the Math+Science Drop-in Tutors. (Search for it on google, there are linear algebra options available most evenings.)He gives explanations\/proofs for most things. If you don't want explanations and just want rules, check out the other section. Most of the exercises though are application-based not proof-based, maybe one proof per ten questions. If you want more proof exercises take Math 225.",
    "Better than the other section.",
    "If you have to take this class, I would recommend taking it with Schultheiss.",
    "Take it if you have to. You will fare better in this class if you do a lot of learning on your own by reading the textbook and watching the MIT lectures.",
    "Chances are you have to take this class, like I did for the Econ and Math major. Schultheiss is a decent professor but so old and can get really boring, but I hear he's much better than the other professor. The problem sets are short and due every class (with a week grace period) so don't get behind, they're not too hard. The textbook is absolutely dreadful, near impossible to learn from. This sucks because Linear Algebra is a completely different way of thinking-the first month of the course was the hardest for me, but once you capture the methodology behind it it gets much easier. The MIT lectures were helpful for the first half of the course, but afterwards they became less necessary because the material became more straightforward.",
    "Linear algebra is like algebra with many dimensions. You use matrices to manipulate numbers.",
    "I would recommend Math 222 to anyone interested in linear algebra from the perspective of a scientist, engineer, or economist. Though the presentation of the material i not always mathematically satisfying, and you don't really get a sense of algebra as a mathematical discipline, Schultheiss' course teaches the material with clarity and strong organization, without every being too challenging. I should note that the textbook (Strang) is completely useless (and actually pretty funny in an absurdist way...check out the preface!), but Strang's lectures on MIT Open Courseware are supposed to be quite helpful. I thought Schultheiss' own lectures sufficed, but there is that support available, since there are no TA's!",
    "Very cool material. If the teaching is not in your style, watch the MIT online videos -- they are comprehensive and efficient.",
    "This is not at all an applications course. You won't ever work with matrices that are large enough to have physical reality. You do learn the theoretical underpinning of what it is a computer is doing when you ask it to do linear algebra but never how to actually get a computer to do it. It may prove useful if you are going on to do higher math, but it won't teach you enough linear algebra for it to stand on its own. The professor is well intentioned and very good in office hours, but somewhat hard to follow in the classroom. He usually only goes through one example of any given idea, so it is hard to determine what about that example is unique and what is general. The weekly problem sets are actually quite helpful in keeping on top of the material but require actual reading of the text or consulting the internet to figure out sometimes.",
    "In Applied Mathematics 222, students learn the basics of linear algebra. There are problem sets assigned every class and two midterm exams. The midterm exams are relatively easy, but the final was more difficult as the material gets progressively harder. I found it helpful to watch the lectures on MIT Open Courses as the textbook was often very confusing. I would recommend this class to a fellow student. However, I would caution that there is not much organization to the course.",
    "Yes, good follow up to math 118.",
    "If you have to take linear, definitely take it with Prof. Schultheiss. He's fair, the psets and tests are manageable, and he always has office hours. A vast improvement over my experience with Yael Kfir earlier in the year, who I would avoid at all costs.",
    "Just take it. You can't really be an educated science\/engineering\/math student without it.",
    "If you have to take applied Linear Algebra here at Yale, and don't want to take 225, I recommend Schultheiss over Kfir any day. 222 with Schultheiss (only offered in Spring I believe) has an energetic pace, covers a wide range of topics, is not pedantic in detail. The exams are very straightforward. Be ready to take the learning into your own hands if you really want to nail the topics. Schultheiss is open, and very helpful. 3 problem sets a week keep you primed. If you are looking for a deep understanding, take 225; if you are looking for a broad useful skill set for LinAlg, take 222 with Schultheiss.",
    "Take this class with Schultheiss. Though there are fewer \"applications\" than hoped, the exams are straight forward and he allows you to have review sheets for all of them. Homework is assigned each class but he accepts the problem set up to a week after it was assigned. This can be cumbersome if you get behind, or a nice alternative to large, weekly psets if you stay on top of the work. Given reviews of the other linear algebra courses, I would definitely recommend taking it with Schultheiss.",
    "I recommend this class because it isn't too hard but you learn useful math techniques that you can use in other classes to solve problems.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course with Professor Schultheiss. You get to learn different aspects of linear algebra that are used in all sorts of disciplines. It was especially interesting to take this class along with other disciplines that use linear algebra, such as quantum and statistics. Professor Schultheiss is still very passionate about the subject, having taught the course for so many years. One drawback of the course was that there is a pset due every class period, but I found this useful, as it helps keep on top of the material. Again, I definitely recommend the course!",
    "This is a good course - not difficult at all, but a lot of interesting conceptual material. Professor Schultheiss is sometimes confusing in class... Often, it was better to learn the material on your own through online lectures and the textbook, but this was a fine way to learn it. Problem sets were due for every class period, though they were generally pretty short. Tests were easy, no tricks - just know the material from the problem sets well, and you're good.",
    "Take it if you need it, or if you want to explore the majors\/tracks that require it. The material's pretty easy, and while it doesn't go into a lot of conceptual depth, it teaches you what you need to know to use linear algebra (and, obviously, some specific ways you can use it). The grading, since it's not curved, is therefore also pretty easy, assuming that you don't make too many stupid mistakes. Schultheiss is, again from what I've heard, the best option of the linear algebra teachers, so there's that. Basically, good class as far as it goes; just don't expect it to life-changing, and don't go out of your way to take it.",
    "Highly recommended course",
    "I've heard that Linear Algebra \/ Matrix Theory is usually only for CS majors or the like, and although I appreciate that it is useful for many applications, I think I would have been better off taking Differential Equations or a different math class. It's really not bad at all if you pay attention, keep up, and catch all of the lecture tricks. Office hours and TA sessions (which are usually empty -- great for one-to-one help) are really good, too.",
    "You're probably taking this because it's required for your major. Sometimes it's hard to keep up with the homework (one pset is due every class, and there are 3 classes a week). The material is pretty formulaic, though, and if you can do the problem sets you should be fine. The book sucks, sometimes lectures aren't too helpful, but there's a lot of good material online. Work with friends.",
    "Awesome class with a cool professor, not too hard, but you still learn a lot. I would recommend it with Schultheiss to anybody.",
    "Take if you need it for a major.",
    "In short, you\u0092re going to need Linear Algebra, so you might as well take it with someone who likes the subject and someone who grades fairly. The material can be tough, but the bottom line is you\u0092re going to learn it, by rote if by no other means. He\u0092s passionate and he gets the job done\u0085there\u0092s not much more you can really look for in a Yale professor.",
    "Take it! If you have to take it, it won't be too painful. If you don't, and you really like math, this class is a good one.",
    "I recommend this course.",
    "Definitely take it with Professor Schultheiss, and take advantage of the office hours! A quick note about the psets: There will be one pset due after each class, but you'll have 1 week to turn in each of them. For ex, the hw given on monday will be due next monday. I personally preferred having 3-4 questions after each class, to having 15 questions on 1 day, so I really liked Prof Schultheiss' PSET policy.",
    "Math 222 is a course that will teach you the fundamentals of linear algebra. I would recommend this course to any student that has a genuine interest in math. For most people the class in not too difficult, so one should not have any apprehension taking the course simply for pleasures sake."
