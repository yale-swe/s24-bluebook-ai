    "I would certainly recommend this class, although I am not sure it will continue to be taught after this semester, as Professor Hayden is retiring.",
    "I would summarize the course as a strong research seminar invaluable for students interested in the built environment and public space. Even if student interests fall outside those areas, the course offers a great opportunity to consider aspects of space and place across various fields and to strengthen general research and writing skills. The course also provides a d opportunity to work with an amazing, encouraging professor! For these reasons, I would definitely recommend the course."

   "comments": [
    "This class allowed me to pursue something that I was interested in a very in-depth way. Although I am not sure what my dissertation will ultimately be on, this course allowed me to explore some issues that I hope to continue studying and perhaps focus on in my dissertation.",
    "This was my first experience doing research as a graduate student and I feel that it has created a great foundation for future research, including my dissertation.",
    "It gave me the tools to broaden my knowledge on a topic that I am researching, and in a way that allowed me to bring my own perspective to the field. In other words, it was not restrictive, which allows students to execute their most original research. The course provided concise review of the discipline."
