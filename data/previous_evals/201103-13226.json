   "comments": [
    "This course should be a requirement for all public health students. I liked the seminar format of the class, as it provided an opportunity to engage in debates and discussions. The student led classes were a weakness, as the quality of the presentations varied significantly. It would have been better had the professor led all of the classes.",
    "Good",
    "Enjoyable class with very important topics. The readings were interesting. The guest lecturers were relavent and interesting. The film was interesting",
    "This course covered many interesting topics but could be improved by more guidance from the professor during discussions.",
    "Very good selection of readings. Diverse sources seminal to the topic and also of philosophical interest. I would have liked more lecture (20%) and less discussion (80% instead of 100%) because at times the curriculum seemed disjointed or entirely independent work.",
    "Excellent course! Great readings, nice guest speakers, and a great overall atmosphere.",
    "Strengths: I liked this course because of the increasing relevance of the topics covered (specificially, how we can care for and handle the huge aging population). In general, the readings for the different weekly topics were pretty good. Also, the two guest speakers fit very well with the course.Weaknesses: I wish we got to hear more of Becca's thoughts and experiences instead of just the student presentations that happened almost every week. A mix of both Becca and the student presenters would have been better.",
    "strengths- definitely covered a topic that is not often covered\/addressed explicitly in overview public health courses.very interesting materialinteresting class design (seminar\/discussion), which allowed the students to guide discussion and voice opinions and integrate personal experience into topic discussionweaknesses- lots of awkward silences because class discussion was not very rigidly structuredfinal assignment was a research proposal- very broad topic- I thought there was a lot of \"expecting\" with this assignment and not enough direction",
    "I generally enjoyed Health and Aging. The selected readings were all very interesting. I felt I had a good grasp on the concepts, issues, and current research regarding health and aging. However, I wish the class was more structured and that the instructor taught more of the classes.",
    "The course was a nice respite from the rest of my courses which were all quantitative in nature. This course was heavy on the reading -- each week was a different topic related to health and aging; some topics were more interesting than others, and some were quite dry and boring. Coming into this class I did not know that it was technically an SBS class, which others should know before taking it. That is, it is less focused on the epidemiology of aging, and more focused on the social aspects. There is a lot of psychology-related material and concepts.Each week, two or three students would lead the discussion of the readings for the duration of the class (2 hours). This is not a bad idea, but I think that it should only be for 1\/2 of the 2-hour duration. When the professor, Dr. Levy, is barely involved during class discussion, it feels like she is not even there. Sometimes I wondered, what is the point of her being there? She should lead for 1 hour and students can lead for the second hour. The other problem with this format is that students in the class were reluctant to participate in discussion. The discussion leaders would ask questions, and it would be...crickets. Something needs to be done to facilitate more discussion from everyone (although I don't believe in forcing people to talk), and the student-led discussion do not seem to promote that.Besides the readings and leading the discussion, we had 4 response papers, a research proposal, and a presentation of our research proposal. This workload was fair. Originally we were supposed to do a response paper every week (12 papers or so), which definitely would have been way too much work. Four papers is appropriate. I also enjoyed the guest presentations, especially the one about driving.",
    "Learned various aspects of health and aging. Even though I initially wished the course has a structured lecture format, at the end I could understand why seminar is also a good format for a course on aging. Also, even though I learned and realized things I would not be able to in other courses while preparing to lead a weekly discussion, I thought discussions led by the professor would be more informative."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Professor Levy was extremely knowledgeable. She seemed quite modest and humble about her work. I really learned a lot from her course. I think the class would be improved if she lectured more.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Extremely willing to provide feedback. Very nice and helpful. She is very intelligent and has a lot of expertise in the field, so it may have been better if she provided a little more insight instead of it being strictly seminar style.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy is very knowledgeable; however, I would have liked to learn more about her research and views on issues\/research in gerontology. The completely student lead discussions were too long and did not allow for any sort of formal instruction.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Becca Levy is well versed in this area of expertise. Her publications were some of the most interested readings assigned to us, so I wish she would have presented more of her methodology and steps-to-publish in order to support our following in her footsteps. The course was CDE heavy (as expected) so a professor-driven, rudimentary review of epi methodology and policy frameworks would have helped frame discussion. Specifically, a re-cap of analytical techniques (e.g. diff-in-diff, comparison of two means, t-test, anova,) and study design (ecological, cohort, case study) would have really helped ground the class in a recommended approach to aging studies (rather than review of aging readings). The latter is accessible in everday life, and I'm not sure very much was gained through student speculation.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0I think Becca is a great person with lots of really interesting research experience, yet we barely got to hear from her during class! I understand that the class was conducted in a seminar fashion (2-3 students presented a new topic each week based off the assigned readings), but 1 hr 50 minutes can be a daunting amount of time and I think the class would have benefitted from Becca giving a general background\/introduction to the topic before the student presenters took over. Becca providedvery thoughtful and helpful comments on response papers&rough drafts of the final paper. She was also very responsive to email inquiries, particularly about developing out ideas for the final paper.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Dr. Levy was a very passionate instructor for this course. She was very willing to work with me and develop my research interests as it pertained to this course. I will say that she is somewhat timid by nature and could have taken a stronger leadership role in facilitating group discussion.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Becca Levy is a wonderful instructor who is very knowledgeable in the subject matter. Because of her rich background in the field, I wish she lectured more or shared more of her experience in research during class. However, I think she was very creative in the way she structured our discussion-based classes.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0Becca Levy is knowledgeable, nice, and always provided good feedback for our paper, presentations, and response papers. Besides that, however, I don't have much else to say since she kept quiet for the majority of the class discussion. I am all for allowing students to engage in discussion without too much input from the professor, but she should be involved somewhat more -- i.e., with more leading questions, examples, and ideas, especially when people are reluctant to participate.",
    "Instructor: Becca Levy \u00a0The professor is very kind and understanding of students. She is very knowledgeable and helpful. She is open to students' feedback and is very willing to work with students."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to everyone. I think it is important to think about public issues from the perspective of older individuals. However this course does require a fair amount of reading and writing. If you enjoyed the required SBS class, you would definitely enjoy this seminar.",
    "Could choose it.",
    "This course covers a wide range of topics related to health and aging and is applicable to many fields of PH from policy to epidemiology.",
    "moderate reading, compelling topic with sub-interest following (can be a fun small, intimate group), ideal for CDE students seeking practice designing interventions.",
    "This course was an interesting elective and offered insight into a topic not well covered in other classes at YSPH.",
    "This is a good course if you have a particular interest in aging. The topics are very relevant to all tracks, but I felt a little behind being in HPA as opposed to CDE in terms of the proposed research final paper (which, as a note, should be a realistic study proposal idea - this was not clear when we initially chose topics). It's a nice SBS course, but the set-up of weekly classes did not end up being ideal for what I was looking for. Still, very interesting and unique topics are covered.",
    "We discussed the theory, political implications, health disparities, stereotypes, and current research in health and aging. Everything covered in this class can be applied to all tracks at YSPH. I would recommend this class as an elective to others interested in this field of study.",
    "I would recommend this course to those looking for a reading-based class, focused more on theoretical and social aspects of aging and health, rather than epidemiological aspects. Beware that the professor does not lead the class discussions (except the first lecture), and as a small seminar course, participation is expected.",
    "It is a good introductory course on the topic of health and aging. Yes, I would recommend it."
