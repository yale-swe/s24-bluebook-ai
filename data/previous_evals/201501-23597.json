   "comments": [
    "The best aspects of the course were drawing on Amy and Bill's extensive knowledge as practitioners and questioning the \"right\" way to do conservation. Additionally, having guest speakers and having informal time with them over dinner was most interesting and eye opening and helped me figure out what I want to do professionally.",
    "The best aspects of this course were the variety of papers that we read for class and the in class discussions with other students and some of the professors input.",
    "I absolutely loved this course, particularly the discussion-based format. The class fit my interests perfectly, and I was very pleased with the range of topics covered. Amy and Bill were both wonderful; I feel like I have learned so much hearing about their experiences in the field. One of my favorite aspects of the course was the guest lecture series - this really added to the class.",
    "Amy and Bill are wonderful teachers and resources both inside and outside of the classroom and bring wonderful insights from their years in the field. This practitioner-teacher model is fantastic for students with applied interests and Yale should be looking for every opportunity to expand offerings like this.",
    "The guest speakers that were brought in every week were really great as they brought in a wealth of personal experience and somewhat different perspectives on the topics we covered in our readings. Plus Drs Vedder and Weber have a wealth of experience all their own! Also, the lightning discussions at the end of the semester were really excellent.",
    "I really enjoyed the speed debates at the end. They let the class debate a wide range of issues that might not have fit into the course, but were important topics nonetheless. I enjoyed the seminar nature of the course as well. It was great to hear what other students who have worked in the field thought about the various issues we discussed.",
    "Discussions",
    "Great professors. Extremely useful, applicable materials. The tools learned in this class can be applied towards any sort of project, not just conservation-oriented ones.",
    "Great variety of speakers! I liked the format, and appreciated Bill and Amy's enthusiasm for the topic.",
    "Guest speakers & class discussions",
    "A space to speak your mind about conservation, and push each other, while referencing the latest texts on the matter. It was a class that felt more like an interactive meeting, full of experiences.",
    "I feel like I've walked out of this course with a base knowledge and understanding of conservation practices. Hearing from speakers working in the field currently was invaluable. Amy and Bill were inspiring teachers.",
    "The range of the topics covered in this class is very comprehensive and offers the students the opportunity of evaluating and learning about conservation from various perspectives. We had examples from different parts of the world so we were able to compare how different nations give different solutions to the same problems related to conservation. The discussions in class were also very profound and questioned our past knowledge and concepts that we previous had about conservation. It was also possible to learn more about the experiences of my classmates. The professors are AMAZING and critical part of the course. Their experience is critical to enhance the discussions and bring different perspectives on conservation issues.",

   "question_text": "What aspects of this course need the most improvement?",
   "comments": [
    "While the discussions were great, and mostly ran by students, I think some of the topics blended into each other and I don't know if there is a way to separate them so students don't need to redesign their lecture because someone else before covered their material.",
    "It would have been nice to have a few more lectures by Bill and Amy throughout the course. Though the student-led discussions were useful, I really enjoyed the few lectures we did have, as they were often connected to the instructors' own experiences in the conservation field. Perhaps it was difficult given the number of students in the class to allow everyone to lead a discussion while including more lectures, but I felt that these occasional lectures stimulated, rather than prevented discussion. My only other comment is that it would have been nice to see a greater variety in terms of the types of speakers that presented during the speaker series. Many of the speakers were conservation biologists, but it would have been interesting to hear more from others in the conservation field, such as environmental advocates, policymakers, or attorneys, for example.",
    "Classes at FES seem to really emphasize the student-led discussion model, which is good experience for the student leaders and can sometimes generate great conversations, but can also fall flat. Bill & Amy do everything they can to avoid bad discussions but at the end of the day it's in the hands of the students, which is risky. Even more input and guidance from Bill and Amy during the discussion - seeding it with tough questions, etc., would be ideal, because that's when the best discussions were generated in my opinion.",
    "It might be nice to have a wider range of speakers- most speakers this semester came from a background in conservation biology and work or had worked for WCS at some point. Not to say that their perspective wasn't valuable, but it might have been nice to have a greater range of perspective.",
    "While this would bring my discomfort, I think the thing I would change is to let students who are leading discussing crash and burn a little more. Amy and Bill are great that they step in and help when questions remain unanswered, but I say if students are going to lead a seminar let them lead it fully. And of course if it gets so bad the instructors need to step in okay, but I think it is a good learning experience, though uncomfortable, for those leading the class to adapt and practice asking questions in different ways.",
    "I think that we skimmed too quickly over some of the project elements - workplan, budget, etc - that actually took quite a long time to complete in the final project. In retrospect, completing a partial workplan and going over it in class would have helped later when creating one for the final project.",
    "At times, I wish the class had been more talkative. Not a fault of the professors, but sometimes people just weren't as chatty.",
    "I would have preferred the class to be a bit smaller, but I appreciated everyone's thoughts and insights.",
    "I missed more structured classes. The course is fundamentally based on discussion and students participation, which might be very challenging for shy people and international students. I think that time time could be more fairly balanced between discussions and lectures. Lectures could came in the first half of all classes and give the base\/new perspectives for the discussions.",

It gave me more of a practical idea of what is involved and the issues of conservation and how to think of new ways in which they can be improved upon.",
    "Teetering on the edge of wanting to pursue a career in conservation - at first I thought the class would be too heavily focused on the traditional conservation paradigm but it evolved into a thoughtful consideration of the policy and economic challenges facing this field as well as the env'tl management field at large.",
    "As someone interested in going into the field of conservation and rural development, but with a background in international affairs, this course was a great survey of issues in the contemporary field of conservation.",
    "I plan on working within the field of community conservation post-graduation. This was a great way to explore conservation from a variety of different angles and hear perspectives from people who are anthropologist, biologists, and economists. This was the first course I have taken that let me explore these issues in more detail, but also still get a good survey of what is going on in the field.",
    "As an anthropology student very much interested in conservation, this class allowed me to meet other students with similar interests and learn through various conservation case studies. I really appreciated approaching conservation topics in an interdisciplinary way.",
    "It is want I am passionate about and my future, and its unique in Yale.",
    "I am focusing on forest conservation and restoration and how to increase policy effectiveness in this realm. For this reason, the course was very important to give ideas about what is functioning and what is not and how."

Try to read what is more interesting for you and take advantage of the professors experience. They are very knowledgable and accessible."
