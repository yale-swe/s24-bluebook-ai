    "I developed a better understanding of airflow and the various mechanisms that may be used to solve for important variables.",
    "I feel like this course refreshed and built on skills I learned in fluids. I definitely feel like going over the concepts again helped solidify them and the introduction of the application to airfoils was an interesting framework to use.",
    "a brief review of fluid mechanics, some inviscid incompressible stuff, airfoil design and lift\/drag relationships, some boundary layer theory, some Navier-Stokes, some compressible stuff, all geared towards how air flows over a body moving through it really fast",
    "You learn an enormous amount of theory for aerodynamics. This is only a minorly practical course. It is mostly theory.",
    "A quick review of fluids and you are thrown right into the course. Airfoil theory and actual 3-D lift are primary concepts with other focuses such as boundary layer theory and shocks."

   "comments": [
    "This class did a very good job of covering a variety of topics that built on one another. However, lecture could be scrambled and confusing. Additionally, the course was described as being based in both theory and design; however, a larger portion of the course covered theory. This made it seem as though information was being given without application.",
    "A strength of this course is that if you put in work, you honestly can learn a lot of fluid dynamics theory. A weakness is, you're just learning theory in this class. If you wanted much practical about planes, this isn't the ideal class for you. We took this in the \"more practical\" year which basically meant we skipped all of the complex variable stuff, but it still honestly wasn't very practical.",
    "The class was very interesting, but could definitely be improved. For one thing, we didn't do a whole lot of problem solving, mostly just a lot of theory. So at the end of it, I don't feel super confident that I'd be able to solve these problems. However, I definitely did learn a lot. Lectures were pretty scattered at the beginning of the semester, but once the professor got a feeling for how much we knew, the lectures started to become a lot more effective and I was able to keep up way better toward the end.",
    "This is a brutally challenging course. Possibly one of the hardest theory classes I have ever taken. But if you take the time, you will learn a lot. This is not a slack elective. Dont bother if you want a chill class. The prof is demanding.",
    "The structure of each lecture involved a short review of the previous lecture which was very helpful. The pace of the course was very fast and it is a little difficult to decipher what was written on the board at times."

    "I would take this class if you're interested in planes and are looking to go more in depth into your fluids theory. Juan can seem tough, but he's honestly pretty funny and willing to go over things again and again with you. However, he also is so smart that he doesn't really understand what its like to be an undergrad. He skips a lot of steps on the board, so many that things seem to appear out of thin air (and then you realize you just skipped five steps). You honestly just need to be comfortable enough to raise your hand and say \"I literally have no idea what you just said, can we go back.\" Also, I just finished the final and I have no clue what my grade in the class was going in or will be coming out. No one seemed to do well on the exams and we didn't get much feedback on where our grades all sat. There are weekly psets which usually aren't too bad, but the midterm and the final especially were HARD. Overall, this class wasn't really what I expected, but I would take it again because I really like fluids and am happy to go more in depth about the theory even if it was painful at times",
    "If you're like me and you suck at absolutely everything but fluids, this is the course for you. Literally the only thing I can do is fluids, so this was great for me. Other people definitely had a rough time, and Juan is such the stereotypical nutty professor, so definitely not one for the uninitiated.",
    "Highly recommend this one. The course covers the (very limited) prerequisite fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, so you can even take it without those prereqs. Engineers and non-engineers with a strong mathematical background should both do well in this course.",
    "Its tough. Delamora is a brilliant but tough prof. Its a small class. Take it if you really want a challenge and to learn a lot about Aero theory. Im not great at math or theory though, so it was a steep learning curve.",
    "This course is a difficult one, but it can be rewarding. The homeworks are a mixture of theoretical questions and applicable questions where software is provided to help find solutions. If you are willing to put in a lot of time to ensure you don't get lost throughout the course, it could be very rewarding."
