    "BEST CLASS OFFERED AT YALE",
    "I'm so glad I took this course as it was one of my first in ethics. even though it was a very short period of time I feel like I learned so much.",
    "It is an interesting course to start thinking in issues that maybe you are not aware of. However I think that for people that is really involved in these topics, and as for many students at FES, there is a close connection and awareness on the Ethical problems. There is space in the course to talk about more difficult topics related with environmental ethics, beyond \"obvious\" problems. It would be interesting to show different views, how our own parameters of ethics could be \"wrong\" or denying valid points made by other groups that are \"against\" the environmental values that people at FES hold."

   "comments": [
    "Great opportunity to engage with ethical concepts important to all environmental fields. Diversity of materials and topics was helpful for working through these concepts, and for drawing in students from different disciplines into discussion with one another.",
    "The hybrid online course was my favorite part. This allowed students like me to be able to take the time to come up with insightful comments about discussion questions posed online. So instead of having to read everything the night before, which often students don't do, we were able to take a week to read and answer. Better for learning. Made me more interested in the subject.",
    "In class discussion that allowed all the students\/instructors to communicate and share ideas.",
    "A lot of space to discuss. Variety of topics.",
    "So many! The lectures were great and interesting, I particualrly liked the curated lectures from other sources (e.g., NAACP and EPA) that I otherwise wouldn't have watched. This class has sparked my curiositiy and given me a foundation to build upon when thinking about human-environment interactions."

   "question_id": "FS0044",

   "comments": [
    "Perhaps going into some greater depth in some of the subjects. It was a broad overview of ethical issues and I feel like we didn't go into enough depth on some issues.",
    "One hour is far too short to properly delve into the material in a meaningful way. I would suggest perhaps making the in-class discussion 2 hours long and having a different set of students facilitate the discussion so there is a variety of discussion formats rather than just question and answer.",
    "I think time management during class meetings is key. Felt that many times we were able to have discussion everything wasn't said. Also, with final presentations, one group talked for almost 20min.",
    "This course was heavily tilted towards looking at environmental ethics as they related to science, and particularly health. I would say that I expected an environmental ethics course to spend more time reading and discussing more qualitative ethics-specific literature and environmental ethics movements (e.g. for deep ecology, reading Arne Naess and Gary Snyder, etc.).",
    "As I comment before, within the variety of topics studied, different world-views showed as valid points could made the class more interesting, and could be helpful for the students to become more aware of the \"real\" world and the difference of views, that could have different and valid points, based in different values. - The videos are very interesting. I like the selection and pace of the interview videos. For the lecture videos, the pace may be slower to allow the students to hear and take notes.",
    "This course was well managed, so it's hard to say! I'd love to see it be a full-semester course to allow deeper discussion about a wider range of issues. This is an important class and unfortunately unique at F&ES, as I think many FESers would benefit from this kind of instruction and thinking."
