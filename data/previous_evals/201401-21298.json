   "comments": [
    "Perfect class for creative writers--much of the class discussion revolves around craft, audience, the art of storytelling and how stories shape our lives. There's also lots of opportunities to do your own creative work, including writing for children. The central text of the course, \"Trickster Makes This World,\" is something I would recommend to any humanities student, ever.",
    "Literature for Young People had a fabulous syllabus and a great atmosphere. Everyone who was there really wanted to take the class, so it fostered an environment of fun, excited people. Plus, what better way to spend two hours than revisiting the past and discussing things like Dr. Seuss and Harry Potter? I would recommend the course for the reading list and seminar atmosphere. Professor Stepto was also nice and extremely helpful. Occasionally I felt that there was a bit too much reading assigned for the class, especially towards the end of the semester when we started reading longer books. I felt that this didn't allow for us to really get into the book and discuss them in a meaningful way. That aside, I still felt like it was a wonderful class. It was so nice to curl up and read Matilda rather than some esoteric old English poet.",
    "Hard to beat the reading list for this class, but class discussion was often underwhelming. Asking questions like \"what would children like in this book?\" get old pretty fast. In addition, secondary reading was not as targeted as it could have been. There are probably better ways to use a credit in the English major. Although creative projects were pretty fun.",
    "I would recommend this class, especially for students who were voracious readers as children and loved their books. It was so wonderful to be able to come to a class where everyone else had read the same books that I had read as a kid and loved them just as much so that we could all fondly appreciate\/gush\/talk about them for two hours. That was my favorite part of the course -- that I could bring up even books not on the syllabus or books farther in the series and everyone would know exactly what I was talking about and join in the conversation. It's also just extremely fun to reread and refeel the delight you felt as a kid when you read the books the first time and to see new things as an adult.",
    "Absolutely take it if you're interested in the material. You'll probably be re-reading much of it, but from a more mature and analytical standpoint than when you did as a child. However, remembering your reaction as a child reader (or guessing what children's reactions to texts would be) is important, because class discussion often touches on the theory and practice of writing for children. The in-class performances are delightful and for the final assignment you can submit either a critical work or a creative project: I chose the latter, as it seemed a good deal more fun.",
    "This was a great class! I was worried that analyzing some of the books I loved as a child would take the fun out of them but that in no way happened. I was exposed to some literature I hadn't read as a child, looked deeper into books I had read, and learned about different methods of writing for children. The syllabus offered a great variety of classic books and new fiction as well as both picture books and postmodern texts. It was both comprehensive and exciting. I would recommend this class to anyone! Non English majors would love it as well.",
    "Take it. Simple as that.",
    "Loved this class!! The reading list is beyond amazing, and you will have so much fun doing it. Discussions are always interesting and fun, and getting to do creative projects instead of papers is really great. Professor Stepto is clearly passionate about children's literature. It will probably depend a lot on the people in your class, but we had a great group. Definitely recommend.",
    "Literature for Young People is a great way to remind yourself why you fell in love with reading, or, if you aren't yet in love with books, it's an opportunity to give them an another try.",
    "This is a fantastic class, and you get to read books totally different from what you usually study in a literature class. It's fun to reread old favorites and to get to discuss with everyone else how your impressions change reading them as an adult, in addition to how you react to books you never read as a child. Professor Stepto is great, although she does have a tendency to lecture for too long and not let discussion run for long enough.",
    "This was a very enjoyable class. Readings were long but not very difficult , usually including one or two novels or short stories plus a few works of criticism for each week. Nothing unreasonable. Discussions were interesting, and usually focused on the books as literature rather than as \/children's\/ literature. One of the strange choices of the class was the deadlines for submission of work. At the beginning of the year, Professor Stepto told us that our critical and creative short works were due on the day that those works were to be discussed, which was hard for me, since I usually take topics from discussion itself. Later, she told people that works could be submitted any time, which would have been nice to know earlier. The best part of the class was the final day on which everyone presented their final projects. Some people had put together some amazing projects.",
    "Literature for Young People is definitely worth your time! It is a nice change of pace from other literature classes in the English department because of the nature of the material you'll be reading: everything from \"Little Women\" to Dr. Seuss's picture books. With this diversity, everyone in the course will have an opportunity to find a topic or writer that they really love. (And you may have the opportunity to return to some of your favorite books from when you were a chid.) That said, be aware that this course is different from other literature courses, because you'll be required to submit some creative assignments (short stories of your own, group theatric performances, etc.) in addition to literary criticism. So you may need to step outside of your comfort zone a little, but it will be well worth it in the end!",
    "Literature for Young People is a great class to take if you're capable of a lot of self-structured scheduling; the assignments are due at your own discretion, so it's important that you stay on top of things. You should also come to class prepared to discuss the assignments thoroughly; I found it was helpful to have a few larger themed questions and comments prepared before class. Worth taking, absolutely, if only to reread classics from your childhood from an academic perspective."
