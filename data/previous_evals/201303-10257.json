    "Math 230 is a good, but difficult class. I took this class with no prior knowledge of multivariable calculus or linear algebra and did just fine. Do not let students who have not taken the class deter you from taking it with their rumors or their preconceived notions. They don't know what they're talking about when they make unjustified criticisms about this class. The problem sets take around 15 hours a week, and they can be pretty tough. At the beginning of shopping period, 80 students showed up. Half of them dropped out over the first two weeks, and I think less than 30 made it to the end of the semester. To be successful in this class, you need to collaborate with others, and you will probably become friends with everybody in the class. Take this course, and you will learn a lot of math.",
    "Math 230 is a great class if you are willing to put in the effort needed to learn the material. The course covers a wide range of material from differential multivariable calculus to manifolds to much of linear algebra. Hadari is a wonderful teacher, and managed to tie everything together so that for the most part the course flowed smoothly despite the changes in subject matter. Homework can be rather time consuming especially for the first few weeks of the course, with psets ranging from 10 to 20 hours to complete. That said, they are integral to understanding the material in class, and extremely stimulating. Tests aren't overly hard often erring on the easy side of things. I would recommend this course to any student who loves math and is willing to devote his or her time to learning it. While prior study of multivariable calculus and linear algebra is not prerequisite for this course, it certainly helps. It was an amazing experience and I look forward to 231 next semester.",
    "Math 230 is a rigorous, fast paced course that you should only take if you have a genuine interest in mathematics and proofs. However don't be discouraged if you think the class is too difficult: as long as you are willing to dedicate a vast amount of time to the course, you will learn an incredible amount in a very short period of time.",
    "This is the kind of class where there are over eighty people who come to the first class and under thirty who are still there at the end of it. If you're one of the thirty who remain, it's a truly incredible class. You'll cover a diverse range of topics in addition to the core linear algebra and multivariate differentiation. Hadari is a brilliant lecturer and you'll learn a ton from him in the 2.5 hours of weekly lecture. But you'll learn more from the 12-15 hours that you'll spend on the problem sets. If you haven't taken any linear algebra or multivariable calculus, I wouldn't recommend the class; while Hadari technically only assumes a BC Calc-level of experience, he blows through the elementary linear algebra and multivariable topics very quickly, so you would end up spending even more time outside of class familiarizing yourself with them. If you do have that kind of experience and you actually enjoy math and are considering a math major, shop 230 and do the first problem set; if you can do it in under 18 hours and find it really interesting, then I recommend the class wholeheartedly. If not, it's probably not going to be the class for you.",
    "I would recommend 230 to anyone who is truly interested in studying mathematics. The class is a huge time investment (an average of 15 to 20 hours a week on p-sets), but the investment is absolutely worth it. You will come out of this class knowing not only so much more math, but also knowing how to really study and learn math. Professor Hadari is also extremely helpful and knowledgable, although the rumor is that he will not be around next year.",
    "Do it if you want to learn a lot of math and you don't mind spending a lot of time working on math for two semesters.",
    "Math 230 is an introduction to proof based math. We start from scratch, defining and proving everything we use. Major definitions and proofs of theorems will be done out in class, and smaller proofs are on the homeworks. I would absolutely recommend 230 to any student thinking about studying math or even just curious and determined to learn more about math.",
    "A. On the first day of Math 230, the classroom was overflowing with students. People sat in every chair, on the floor, spilled out the door. There were people galore--about three score, maybe more. Hadari, decked out in camo shorts and a Jack Skellington t-shirt, loped in, tossed his keys on the table, and surveyed the class. \"We've got a lot of material to cover this semester,\" he said with a gleam in his eye, \"let's go fast!\" And so he did, blazing across the chalkboard faster than any of us could copy down notes, lucidly explaining wildly abstract concepts as he wrote. Chalk sprayed in all directions, coating Asaf's noble visage and shirt. A student sitting on the floor in front of me began to cry, frightened by the terrible beauty of abstract algebra--she was not the last to quake at the mention of the field axioms.Over the next few lectures, the size of the class dwindled. Hadari culled the herd to a stable population in the second week when he devoted a problem set to topologies and the Hausdorff distance. It was a trial by fire, but those who remained in the Blaze that is 230 met great rewards. It is for these, dear reader, that I highly recommend this class (but only if you're a mathochist).The Blaze is defined largely by its harsh yet just taskmaster. Professor Hadari is a phenomenal lecturer--his clarity and energy made the early morning time slot the highlight of my academic week, without fail. His teaching quality isn't limited to formal presentation, however: he generously offers daily Asaf Hours, in which he re-presents the material in less formal, more intuitive terms (he is very good at passing along useful ways of thinking about difficult material). Hadari also has a certain mystique. Why does he always wear that one Serbian polka-rock band t-shirt and sandals, even in Winter? How does he grade tests so insanely fast? How does he lecture without notes? Why does he slide down railings when no one is looking? We will never know, but we salute him regardless.Yes, the problem sets take 15-25 hours to complete. Your life will be organized around math, and you will have a lot less free time than many other freshman--230 is, as one student confirmed, more work than all three courses in Directed Studies combined. If and only if you're willing to commit to this, 230 is the class for you.I would argue that the strength of this course comes from this immersive quality. Given the level at which you are asked to apply the material and the amount of time you spend doing so, it's hard not to get immensely better at proof writing and mathematical thinking, as well as to master your calculus and linear algebra (though the p-sets cover way, way more than this). I can honestly say that this class changed how I think.The time commitment involved also leads to one of the best aspects of this class, the group of people that develops out of it. Professor Hadari encourages us to collaborate on p-sets (i.e. unless you're very, very good, you'll probably die if you don't), and by doing so you really learn how to work with other people. It's a useful skill, and it's also just fun. My best friends are the people I work on problem sets with, and the class, as a whole, is unusually tight-knit.If all of this sounds great, but you fear that you lack the proper background for such a theory-heavy class, have no fear. I started off with no exposure to proof-writing before this class, and while that made the first few weeks quite tough, I eventually caught up to speed--you will get better at this stuff, and your p-sets will not take as long as the first one or two. Previous knowledge of linear algebra or multivariable calculus is helpful, but not necessary; one of my friends did well in the class with only AB calculus under his belt. Hadari is also a very fair grader.(Praise be to Wenyu, the best TA.)",
    "If you're considering taking Math 230, you know what you're in for. If you're a math major, it is completely worth it. Be prepared to bang your head against the wall on more than a few late nights, but all the work pays off tremendously. Grading is very fair and takes into account the difficulty of the course. Homework is dreadful, but it makes the tests seem easy. I would take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "Take this course if you're comfortable (or willing to go through the pain to become comfortable) learning math independently. If you do, this course is going to make you better at math. Hadari has a strong grasp on the material, gives good intuition and motivation for concepts and proofs during lecture. But even though lecture is excellent, you'll still need to do a lot of work on your own to get through the homeworks. A good study group is useful (practically and psychologically) but to really get the material you need a good sense of self, to push yourself to really understand material instead of just getting the solutions from your partners. While very difficult during the term, at the end the grading is very fair so would not worry about grade from the class. It will be your most important academic commitment, so be aware of that when considering this with the other courses you want to take. Still, if you're thinking about being a math major, I highly recommend you take the class. You'll either realize math isn't for you or find yourself reaching new levels of interest for the subject.",
    "An advanced mathematics course that covers a very abstract treatment of vector analysis and linear algebra while also dabbling in topology, analysis, graph theory, abstract algebra, and other fields along the way. Quite a large workload but entirely worth it just by how much your understanding as a mathematician improves.",
    "Math 230 should only be taken by people who are truly interested in mathematics. It involves a lot of work but is worth it in the end. If mathematics seems boring to you most of the time, do not take this course. If you like math and enjoy spending hours every week on psets, then this is the class for you!",
    "This class is not for the weary, but provides an exhaustive introduction to the workings of Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus. Professor Hadari was incredible, as was our TA (though I know both of these will be different the next time 230 is offered). I would highly recommend this class for someone looking for a challenge and who wants to stretch their understanding of math and their ability in it.",
    "This class is not for the faint of heart. The problem sets consistently took me at least 15 hours and often more than 20 hours. However, we covered an incredible amount of material, the majority of which is really fascinating (I in particular have a soft spot for linear algebra). The professor is extremely on top of the material. At times the proofs in class are difficult to follow, but this can usually be remedied by reading the textbook and doing the homework (also, don't be afraid to look up online resources). By the end of the term, nearly everyone had found a consistent study group, which made the problem sets much more manageable. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone planning on majoring in math. You will come out of the course a better mathematician who is no longer intimidated by proofs.",
    "it is a had freshman mph course. I would recommend it.",
    "Very difficult, but definitely worth taking. You learn a ton of cool math, and you really feel like you're diving into everything in some of the most in-depth ways you can.",
    "MATH 230 was like drinking from a firehose.No, it was more like drinkingfrom a spring of molten lava while balancing on a floating piece of rock.This course has many strengths. The breadth of topics covered is immense; it is a survey course of the many different areas of math, which is great; the variety of techniques I used in my proofs increased significantly; and I made some of my closest friends in it. Perhaps most importantly, I learned to think critically--it wasn't until the end of the semester that this instinct began to kick in, but I'm grateful that it did.Suggestions for future& prospective students:- Be prepared to deal with a loss of self-esteem. Seriously. There will always be someone smarter than you--but as long as you stick with your love of math and persevere, both of you will do just fine.- IMPORTANT: find or start a group that you stick with for the semester to work on problems, study together, and generally goof off. So many kids dropped the class because the difficulty of keeping up with problem sets became unbearable without friends to share it with.- Some homeworks will never be returned.- This course is not for everyone. You must be ridiculously stubborn and possibly stupid to devote this much time (15-20 hours\/week) to one course. Unless you really like math, of course.- Don't be intimidated by others. Yes, this is really easy to say (and I was guilty of it), but it's not productive or conducive at all. There are people here who are much more prepared than you in certain areas and will rub your face in it. Don't worry about them.- Related to the previous topic, you may be frustrated that the proof-based way of thinking is not at all intuitive to you at first. This understanding and intuition will come--it may come during the first week or the last week, but as long as continue to work your brain, you will slowly get into a pattern of how to tackle problems. This involves recognizing the connections between concepts (connections which, due to the dense nature of the textbook, may not at all be obvious to you at first--this is where asking questions comes in), and thinking on many different levels about a problem. Don't give up--always be ready with another approach. Don't confuse not knowing how to finish with not knowing how to start.Good luck with your semester, and enjoy the journey.",
    "great course, covers a lot of material in a short time. don't underestimate the time psets will take, but they're worth it.",
    "A great course.Math 230 is not for the faint of heart. It does not, as many believe, require an excess of mathematical ability, but rather it requires an incredible stubbornness and a vast work ethic. You will spend somewhere between 10 and 15 hours every week on problem sets, probably more at the beginning of the year. You will have problems that you have no idea how to solve and that will require your classmates, your TA, or your professor just to finish. You will spend hours puzzling over a simple question only to realize the answer is trivial. You will also gain (assuming you do not already possess) an incredible appreciation of and talent for mathematics.Math 230 is not for the faint of heart. Be warned that on some weeks you will barely see most of your friends. With that being said, you will also form extremely close friendships with your classmates, fueled by your common interests and your days spent together. Be warned that many extracurriculars, classes, and conversations will seem boring in comparison to your math work. With that being said, you will be covering material more interesting than almost anything you have seen before. Be warned that no matter how good at math you believe you are, there will always be someone better. With that being said, you will meet the people who will help you, and the people you will help, for the next four years.Math 230 is not for the faint of heart. It prevents you from pursuing lots of other interests. It consumes your evenings. It is my favorite class this semester.",
    "If you elect to take this course, it will define your entire semester. The workload is insane, and working with others is a requirement. However, when you are finished with the course, you will gain unparalleled insight and appreciation for the subject of mathematics. The course material is fascinating and thought-provoking, and the professor and teaching assistant are brilliant at delivering this material. For those who are willing to step up to the challenge, this course will provide you with an educational experience like none other.",
    "You learn a lot. You work a lot. You lose some sleep but you'll be glad at the end if you stick it out. Not for the faint of heart.",
    "Math 230 is an intense proof based class on linear algebra and calculus, focusing on manifolds. Homework load is intense, about 20 hours a week. Homework groups help. Though difficult, it's a great class with a great teacher. I would definitely recommend this class, but only to those with a inclination for complicated mathematics"
