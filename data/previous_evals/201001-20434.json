    "I recommend this class because by the end you will have learned a lot. You should concentrate on taking very neat notes throughout, and cite the textbooks where certain topics come from. The final exam was difficult, but necessary to culminate what we had learned throughout the term. You should study throughout the term to make sure you understand each topic of the course, because the final was fairly comprehensive. The homework assignments take a lot of time to complete, mostly because they require some literature searches and some computations\/plots. It's a good idea to study with classmates.",

    "This will help me any time I see a talk using radio astronomy and\/or about ISM. It's good to know about topics like extinction, absorption, dust, and other things that need to be accounted for in observational astronomy. Also, star formation and other fields that use radio astronomy are particularly pertinent with some of the new telescopes coming soon.",
    "Essential background for understanding the factors that mediate processes I'm interested in."
