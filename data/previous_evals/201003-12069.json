   "comments": [
    "An engaging course, and the seminar is not any worse than the lecture. If anything it is better because students can actually have hope of participating if they want to (and they don't have to if they don't feel like it). I don't understand why people believe that the lecture course is less work; besides having twice the number of P-sets, they also have sections to go to. Simons is a nice lady and is very knowledgable about relevant current issues. The only thing you ought to know if you take this course is that Simons expects you to have at least a vague idea of what's going on in the lecture, since you will occasionally be expected to solve a problem with a partner, and she will go around and check everyone's progress.",
    "If you already took AP Econ, by all means take the seminar over the lecture. The seminar atmosphere is really much better than the lecture and you have so much more opportunity for student-teacher interaction. I really enjoyed the debates and discussions we had in class that would have never occurred in the lecture. However if you've never taken econ before you'll probably find the class a bit too fast-paced and difficult to keep up. I never took an econ class before this and was at a huge disadvantage since most people in the seminar had already taken AP econ before. Overall a solid course but too fast-paced for my liking.",
    "I would reccomend it, especially for an econ major.",
    "The class moves VERY fast. Be prepared to do a lot of the learning outside of class on your own. Simons knows her material, but it is sometimes difficult getting her to explain it to you. Make sure you have a study group, because it is difficult to survive in this class on your own.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who understands that they're going to have to work a lot harder to do well in the class than they would in the lecture, but also wants to really engage with the material. I wanted to take econ because I felt that it was an important thing to have a basic understanding of, so I really enjoyed the class until it came time for exams, which were extremely stressful. I thought that Professor Simons was a good teacher and would always answer questions, but it was really important to do the reading, especially before class if possible, to really learn the material.",
    "Simons is a pretty good professor and gets through all the information, although I think sometimes she goes too fast or gives too few examples for certain concepts and leaves us not quite solid on much of the information. Koker is supposedly a great professor as well. The seminar class is definitely harder than the lecture class, but I think you also learn a lot more\/better.",
    "This class is great- Simons is really funny and good at teaching. Also, there's no reason to freak out about the difficulty\/curve; if do the readings and ask questions if you're confused, you'll be fine. Also, I'd highly recommend the seminar format- it was great to be able to ask questions and to have discussions about real economic policy. You should take it- and not just because people say that \"you should take economics.\" Take it because it's really an interesting subject! I had never taken economics in high school, and this class was a great introduction.",
    "Overall a great class, very work intensive, but I learned a lot about microeconomics",
    "Yes, but I would encourage them to consider the lecture as well.",
    "This course is a much more in depth introduction to economic theory than is the lecture, and also a much harder class. You pretty much have to read every page of that book if you want to have any clue what the professor is talking about in class. Don't take this class to fulfill a QR requirement. Don't take this class if you want an in depth discussion featuring diverse perspectives. Take this class if you want to really understand the basics of the field, from the unchallenged perspective of the field itself."
