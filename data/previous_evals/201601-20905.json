    "Excellent photography class in which you learn how to look at, appreciate, talk about, and produce art photography. Don't be fooled by the reviews that say this class has a hard workload, the work ends up being extremely enjoyable and a good break from typical university-style course work. I definitely recommend this class if you can get in.",
    "Digital Photography is an absolutely amazing course, and I would recommend it to anyone, especially people not in the art major and underclassmen who want a taste of a serious art class that they can take back into their everyday lives. It is one of those courses where you get out what you put in, so if you really push yourself to take tons of pictures and get better and think hard about what those pictures mean (as the course already encourages you to do), you can get so much out of it.",
    "I'd recommend taking it credit D",
    "This course opened my eyes in so many ways, and I don't use that metaphor lightly. I came into ART 138 with a good deal of photography experience and what I thought was a fair idea of what a good photograph looks like. But Ka-Man, Mary Kim (our TA), and the other students totally challenged and expanded my preconceptions about photographs in the best of ways. I felt myself improving as a photographer with each assignment, even especially those I found challenging. By the end of the course, I found myself viewing myself in a way I never had before: as an artist.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. I am not an art major, but this course taught me so much. It was a relief to use my mind, my body, and my emotional capacity in ways that are so so different from many other Yale courses. The classroom experience is also incredible; you really get to know your 15-17 peers because you're seeing each other's work all the time, and even helping each other select photos and edit once you become close. Also, Ka-Man is a sincere, open, and funny professor. Try to get into her section if you apply for the course!",
    "This class is incredible as long as you're willing to put in the time and effort. Expect to shoot at least 100-150 exposures a week and to spend at least 3-4 hours editing and printing in lab before critiques. Ka-Man is wonderful, and she is always willing to meet individually to help with ideas, selections, and editing. Class critiques were constructive and very encouraging. Additionally, if you are struggling financially and cannot afford a camera, it is possible to depend on the DMCA rental cameras. You just need to be on top of uploading your photos and returning the cameras before 10am.",
    "Definitely, take it."
