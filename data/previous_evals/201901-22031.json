    "Calculus 2: Integrals, Taylor Series, etc.",
    "I learned about many concepts in Calculus II - strategies for solving integrals, determining convergence\/divergence of series, Taylor\/Mclaurin series, volumes of revolution, polar coordinates, etc. There was also extensive use of Calculus I and other math topics (trig, derivatives, graphing, etc.)",
    "I gained a competency in more advanced mathematics with a particular emphasis on integration, series convergence, and Taylor series.",
    "Obviously I learned about single-variable calculus, but one thing I really felt I got out of it was the ability to visualize the mathematical concepts. Rather than memorize different rules and such, my teacher made it so I could visualize the problem and figure out formulas from there.",
    "I learned series and sequences.",
    "Basic calc 2 knowledge",
    "Math 115 emphasizes on integral calculus, series, and briefly touches on polar and parametric equations.",
    "Calc",
    "I learned a little but more about both math, and how to teach myself math.",
    "I know how to solve series now!",
    "I learned about convergence tests and Taylor series which are helpful for making approximations.",
    "I learned a lot about my style of learning and note taking and really increased my understanding of differential equations and how many of the real life applications.",
    "How to do calc ii (integrating, limit evaluation, parametric and polar fxns",
    "Most of the class was on integrals, but we also learned sequences and series, and parametrics.",
    "Integration and associated methods. Series, assessing convergence and divergence and associated methods. Polar functions, parametric functions, and associated processes. Using integration to determine areas, etc.",
    "Integral calculus of one variable. Problem solving skills.",
    "I learned about solving integrals, approximating areas using Riemann sums, sequences and series, Taylor series, volumes, parametric functions, and polar coordinates!",
    "knowledge of calc 2",
    "I developed more profound knowledge over certain mathematical mechanisms. Many things were only understood surface level deep when it came to why we solved problems the way we did."

   "comments": [
    "I didn't really like the \"flipped classroom\" setting for the course. I felt like sometimes I would come in with more questions than I originally had, but at the same time it would leave me feeling frustrated because I didn't know what was going on. I did like that my professor was very",
    "Strengths of this course included routine homework such as problem sets and explorations, holding review sessions and covering material and content in a good pace. No weaknesses.",
    "I thought that the explorations were useful because they helped me to think about the material before learning more in class. Brett Smith explained the concepts clearly and made sure that everyone was understanding the material. I liked the think, pair, share exercises which engaged everyone in class.",
    "I am not even gonna talk about the strengths. FLIP CLASSROOM IS STUPID! Periodttttttttt. I don't understand why Yale just can't teach math. You can't expect students to learn a subject on their own and come in with their own questions. There were so many students that didn't even know what they don't know. This class only benefits people that have taken Calculus 2 before",
    "The course is good overall. Every professor has a very different teaching style, so the course could benefit from standardization. Also, it is not ideal that there are students in the class who have taken Calculus BC or equivalent alongside students who never took AP Calculus.",
    "I don't like that it is a quasi flipped classroom in which we do homework assignments before the class where we learn the topic. I preferred the structure of Math 112.",
    "I thought the course was great. Explorations made you think about the class beforehand, which I recognize as valuable. Sometimes the homeworks felt a little long, but I suppose this is necessary.",
    "It could use more clear instruction and the class moved too fast for me to take notes and think clearly during the partner sections.",
    "1 more midterm to split the material more.",
    "The strength of this course is the canvas explorations that are done before class. They force us to have some practice with the new concept before lecture.",
    "The teaching style does not help",
    "The exams were extremely difficult. I think homework and class examples should align more with what is expected on exams.",
    "I think that there was a big difference between what was asked of us in class and in the Psets, and in the exams (midterms and finals). The class could be improved by either making more clear what is expected out of students for the finals and midterms, or if the teachers taught us the actual material necessary to succeed!",
    "The course talks a lot about series and sequences, which is why I understood them more than trig functions. I think more time should be spend on understanding trig.",
    "The midterms were sometimes different from the psets problems but I think doing practice exams were really helpful.",
    "I really thought my section was really helpful and I learned really easily from them. The teaching style was very interactive and kept me engaged. Professor Smith made sure we understood all topics and the way he wrote on the boarded highlighted was easy to follow and all the important ideas were easy to pick out and tell apart from examples. I think review sessions before exams could be better and the exams were also something I wish we could get more information time in advance.",
    "Strength: Brett smith, office hours, practice tests Weaknesses: explorations are never gone over and the class is impersonal",
    "The strengths and weaknesses of the course depend entirely on whose class you are placed into at the beginning of the year. Because I had Dr. Smith, I thought the class was well-structured and well-taught, but I know others who said this class was absolutely awful because their professor offered no help. This is not a new problem for intro math courses at Yale, but it should still be fixed.",
    "The strengths of this class was that the professor was willing to help with problems that occurred. Some weaknesses of this course was that the midterms and exams were weighted very high, and it seemed to stress me out more with taking them. I also felt that the course went very fast and if you didn't understand something it became very hard to keep up with the class",
    "Honestly overall a good course, set up for student learning and subsequent success.",
    "Seeking help when I need it is one of my weaknesses. Also, getting my skills practiced in test prep and p-sets to translate to exams is something I need to improve on. Sometimes I find myself preparing so much for an exam and doing less well than I would have hoped to.",
    "I thought the course was run very well - explorations were great introductions to the lecture material, the psets were difficult but not terribly long or in any way impossible, and there was support for learning in the form of office hours, review sessions, and peer tutors!",
    "There are more strengths than weaknesses. This class has engaging homework assignments that helped incredibly for exams."

   "comments": [
    "If you don't have to take this course, don't take it. The professor was great, but the topics covered can be a bit hard to understand and convoluted. Also, the flipped-classroom setting can also be an adjustment and make the topics more confusing.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a student because the material is straightforward and the grading system is fair.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because the explorations and problem sets made it well organized for learning and the exams covered material that had been taught and explained in class.",
    "I would not recommend it unless you have to take it or took it in high school.",
    "Yo so if you're MCDB and reading this please keep reading. I talked to the DUS and you do NOT need this class for your major. On the spreadsheet thing it says Math 115 or higher but Stats can cover this (and if you're pre-med this benefits you even more because stats is a requirement). I think the class is cool and all if you need it or are even interested in it, however, I mistakingly took it thinking I needed it and am now crying because my final is tomorrow and my GPA will be hurting.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who likes Calculus, wants a challenging math course, or needs it as a requirement. The course is definitely harder if you haven't taken AP Calculus. I did not, but it seemed like most of my classmates had.",
    "Yes, this is an important course for developing the math background needed for any STEM career.",
    "Absolutely. The math wasn't boring, and the midterms weren't unreasonable in their difficulty. The course felt very manageable overall, so it makes a great QR credit for anyone.",
    "Maybe; I think if you have a genuine interest in math you'll find the course engaging, but most people take it as a requirement so it's just eh. It's not too hard though if you put in some effort.",
    "Yes, it gives a basis for math.",
    "If they need it for their major.",
    "Yes. If you luck out with a good professor, this class can be very engaging. The calculus will come in handy with other courses like physics.",
    "Not if it ISNT mandatory",
    "Do not take this course unless you need it for a pre req.",
    "I dont think I would. I took calculus in high school and I think I understood everything then more than I did during this class because concepts are explained in ways that are hard to understand.",
    "Yes! The material was interesting",
    "I would really recommend this section if you like to engage in class and learn from examples and trying things out yourself.",
    "Yes as long as you get one of the two good professors: Brett and Pam",
    "No, unless you have to take it.",
    "No, but it is a prerequisite for many majors.",
    "Yes, it truly increased my appreciation for math and its processes.",
    "Yeah absolutely! Chances are you're considering taking it because of some major or even pre-med requirement, but calculus is actually fun! You learn so much over the course of the semester that I have to say this class was one of the most fulfilling ones I've taken in terms of the sheer knowledge you gain.",
    "Not unless they need it as a requirement, in which case I would not recommend against it.",
    "i recommend this course. I think you must really be careful with which professor you choose because other students who took other professors did not have same experience as me."
