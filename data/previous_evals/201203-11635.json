    "I believe that the Chinese department moves at an appropriate fast pace to learn a respectable amount of Chinese. I would recommend anyone considering taking L1 to ask themselves whether they truly have a passion for languages or Chinese specifically, because otherwise, you will have a difficult time justifying to yourself doing all the work that this class entails. Ultimately, though, it is quite rewarding, and the professors arethe best around.",
    "Chinese 110 allows you to improve drastically in just one semester. There is a general focus on all four aspects of learning the language: speaking (emphasis on tones), writing, reading, and listening. The class is as rewarding as the amount of effort you put into it. It definitely requires a great deal of preparation (there are short quizzes every day and a chapter exam every 2 weeks), but it's well worth the work."
