   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about contested monuments and public space and became a better essay writer.",
    "This course addresses a contemporary urban\/art issue head-on. I went in feeling like I had a clear-cut idea of my opinions on controversial monuments, but that view was complicated throughout the course (in a really good way). The class addresses confederate as well as other contentious art objects in public space.",
    "This course totally expanded my thinking about monuments and monumentality -- it's about much more than just a debate over confederate statues, and it challenged me to think deeply about memory, public space, commemoration and more.",
    "I learned what monuments are and how they might be distinguished from memorials and sculpture. I learned about the history of Confederate monuments as well as of a series of other contested objects (like Richard Serra's Tilted Arc). We discussed the function of protest, counter-monument, and the government. I don't think I got any outright answers from taking this class, but I definitely learned how to ask better questions and was awakened to the complexity of the problems surrounding the practice of public memory.",
    "Critical thinking about sculpture, media representation, public space, and community opinion of public art.",
    "Students learned not only about the ideologies and histories which produced confederate monuments in the US, but gained a critical eye towards the act of monument and memorial making across place and time."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were in the discussions and the active engagement within New Haven. I see no obvious way this class could be improved.",
    "I think the readings were engaging. Prof. Raab's syllabus was broken down into themes in a really effective way that made the content feel diverse (my biggest concern had been that it might get monotonous, but it didn't.) I would have preferred more liberty in the final paper assignment (an extended analysis of a contested monument in physical and historical context). It felt like just a long version of the same task as the short paper assignment. I think it would have been more interesting to be able to approach ideas like monument\/monumentality, historic production\/reproduction, etc. more generally in the final paper.",
    "really just an amazing course!",
    "I thought we had a lot of interesting discussions in this class. Professor Raab is a great facilitator and did an amazing job making sure everyone got a chance to speak and keeping the conversation moving. I definitely think the course became more interesting about halfway into the semester, maybe because we started to explore a wider range of topics that were related to Confederate monuments but not directly about them. I loved having guest speakers come to the class as well -- Professor Raab got a really interesting variety of scholars with different areas of expertise to help direct our thinking. In the future, I think it would be great if the class diverged from Confederate monuments earlier on in the course. I feel like some of the readings we did early in the semester seemed to make similar points, and our conversations around them felt a little repetitive. I would have loved to spend more time on some of the topics we broached later on, like appropriation, or have delved into some more critical material around questions like representation. In other words, I thought the premise of this class was great (obviously, since I took it) and I learned a lot from it, but I was most excited to see how the idea of \"contested monuments\" could include an enormous variety of material that I don't think we totally took advantage of. I also occasionally wished our discussions were a little more rigorous and pushed the topic even farther, to its full potential, but this is more an issue with the people in the class than with the class itself. But considering it's only the first time this class has ever been offered, I'm confident it can only get better.",
    "This course had super interesting readings that varied really well from specific case studies to more theoretical frameworks. It analyzed monuments from numerous lenses thinking about space, community reception, morals and meaning, as well as historical context. I think it was really well organized. If anything we often had too much reading that we got to talk about, so maybe either making sure all readings are essential, or being more careful within time limits to try to address the numerous things.",
    "While the course was, obviously, topical, its scope extended far beyond what one might have envisioned having just read the course description. Using confederate monuments and their history as a jumping off point for a larger discussion was well considered, I think."

    "Yes! It was reading intensive, but lead to really amazing conversations.",
    "i would absolutely recommend this course! professor Raab is amazing and the seminar discussions are great -- it's a subject that's impossible to be neutral on, and so everyone is engaged in a really wonderful way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The material is fascinating and exposes a lot of underlying assumptions we have about art and government. While I've mostly chosen art history courses in the past because I thought the actual art was beautiful, this class (in which the art is definitely not beautiful, per se) forced me to think about how that kind of subjective opinion influences our perception of value. Furthermore, monuments offer a unique opportunity to see how closely interlinked art, capital, the public, and the state are. While this is true for an enormous range of art objects, this class was the first one in which I really had the opportunity to delve into those connections and to discuss them with other people. Plus, Professor Raab is an enormously kind, well-organized, and helpful professor, and should this class ever be offered again I'm sure it'll be even better. In summary: I always thought the issue of Confederate monuments was a complicated one, but this class revealed to me just how complicated the topic was. Definitely take this class if you want an opportunity to delve into a highly relevant topic that will also surprise and fascinate you in ways that you didn't expect.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. Prof Raab is awesome, and the content is really interesting. While sometimes conversation can get pretty intellectual the class is grounded by its foundation in the considerable controversy really tangible objects can create---Prof Raab first conceived of it following the events in Charlottesville in the summer of 2017. The course brings you to focus on the contested nature of various monuments in New Haven itself---requiring a really careful and meaningful consideration of history, art, and space in an analysis---while also inviting students to pursue their own research in the final paper on a contested monument of their own choosing (this can and did take many forms).",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! The material and discussions were relevant and engaging, and Professor Raab is fantastic."
