    "learned how the Middle East was dramatically altered by World War I and still faces implications from the war today. I learned about treaties and circumstances that partitioned the Middle Eastern land and all the consequences of that. World War I is largely only known from the European perspective but this class gives insights to the other less known sides of the War.",
    "This was a fun class that taught me a lot about the Middle East between 1911 and 1937. Definitely complex subject matter, but this class approached it in a good manner. I also enjoyed the weekly reading responses.",
    "Great background on the ME in WWI and a good perspective on European influence in the region",
    "This course focused mainly on reading skills. Exorbitant quantities of reading were assigned weekly, and students were expected to have a general understanding of -- and write 500 words about -- every aspect of its content. Therefore skim reading became a requisite skill, and one that students had to develop to sink or swim.",
    "I didn't know very much about Middle Eastern history before this course, so I'm definitely glad to have learned some basics on the area in the last century. I also was excited to broaden my understanding of WWI as existing outside of the European theater.",
    "This class gave me a new perspective and body of knowledge about a topic Ive studied frequently. The material was valuable in helping me understand the complex, confusing, but highly important arena of the Middle East during the Great War. In addition to discussing the military history, we focused on ideas of nationalism, state formation, and continuity.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths: interesting subject matter, good readings, interesting discussion weaknesses: little unorganized",
    "I think discussion could happen a bit more organically (no going around the room at the start to have everyone talk about their responses). The strengths are definitely Professor Wyrtzen and the well-curated syllabus.",
    "There were several issues with this course: 1) the class size was too large; 2) readings were much to long; 3) classes lacked organization and required substantial prior knowledge. 1: This course was way too large. The class size should have been reduced to about 10 students. The class was far too large to form intimate relationships with other students and the professor. Instead, it became more of a elementary-school style \"go around the circle and share,\" where no one knew each other's name. This significantly undermined both my enjoyment of the class -- as I really looked forward to more personal debates where I could participate -- and also my engagement with the material. Many of the classes reverted to more of a lecture style as well, where Professor Wyrtzen would talk the entire time instead of engage us in discussion. 2: Each week, this class assigned on average 100 pages of reading. Even if the class met only once a week, this is impossible to accomplish combined with the course work for five other classes. In reading responses, points were deducted if we did not provide overviews for every part of the reading. Many of my classmates didn't do the readings at all, and just summarized the abstract and received full points. When I did my best to do at least part of the reading in depth and wrote about it, I had points deducted because I did not cover the full scope of the material while my peers received full credit when they didn't read at all! This sort of grading combined with an overambitious workload incentivized students not read whatsoever, which was really sad because the class went over such cool material. 3: Professor Wyrtzen was very knowledgeable, but oftentimes the class lacked direction. He would frequently go into long tangents and vacillate about his opinion on a certain topic. For several classes, we were all a captive audience while he thought something through, which was frustrating because it seemed that we put the work into the class while he came unprepared. Also, the main point he was trying to make was lost. Instead of engaging with broader, academic questions, Professor Wyrtzen also seemed to focus more on some students' more provocative and useless questions. For instance, instead of discussing something like the role of the Kurds after WWI (this is an example, not the actual subject), we focused instead on whether using the English names of small contested villages propagates colonial sentiment even when local populations refer the village by different names in different languages (this actually happened). This was very frustrating because I felt like my time was wasted and Professor Wyrtzen was humoring students who were being intentionally provocative for attention instead of those actually interested in the material.",
    "Very interesting readings and approach",
    "A large portion of this class was Prof. Wyrtzen hashing out ideas for his book, which meant that we were lucky enough to be taught by an expert in the subject, but also that this seminar often felt like a lecture.",
    "The syllabus was interesting! Class discussions could be improved. Professor Wyrtzen generally did not come prepared with discussion questions, so our seminars often consisted of rambling conversations about the readings.",
    "Professor Wyrtzen is the greatest strength of the course. His curiosity and passion for what he teaches is so helpful. The readings were also constructive and well curated."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if interested in World War I and Middle Eastern studies.",
    "Absolutely! It is a captivating period of history, with fascinating themes throughout the course.",
    "Unless you have a genuine interest in WWI's effect on the Middle East, this class is probably way too technical. It's a lot of really specific details about events that are not particularly relevant (or made particularly relevant) to broader themes. It probably won't be the case for every year, but this year the class unfortunately turned into more of a workshop on Professor Wyrtzen's book than a chance to engage with a variety of sources an ideas.",
    "Yes! Take this class - it was really fun and I feel like I learned a lot. Just be aware that the final project is not a typical history paper.",
    "Yes, professor Wyrtzen is great!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Despite its flaws, I learned quite a bit about the role of WWI in the Middle East. I would only recommend this course, however, if the student had prior knowledge or was willing to put in hours upon hours per week. Otherwise, the sheer time commitment wouldn't be worth it.",
    "Take it!! I knew nothing about the making of the Middle East until taking this class. I loved the final project for the class, as if was both informative but also innovative in creating a website to show the different topics during the 20th century.",
    "Yes! Very interesting course to take if you want to understand the modern Middle East",
    "I would recommend this class, especially since individual classes and discussions might run smoother in a year when the book is completed.",
    "I would definitely recommend this to another student with any interest in politicos or history because its implications are far reaching."
