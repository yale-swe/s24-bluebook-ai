    "You should take this if you have even a small interest in how the western world and culture as we know it was formed. When considering Directed Studies, I decided I want to understand what the meaning of being human is and how it has changed. I received an answer of sorts, and got out of the class so much more than I thought I would.",
    "DS Literature 001 (Semester 1) is a course that delves into ancient Greek, Roman, and Italian authors who contributed greatly to the Western canon. A lot of reading is assigned; writing a paper once a week in addition to fulfilling the required reading necessitates a great deal of time and effort, but it is very much worth it.",
    "If you're at all interested, shop it. It might not be for you, but it could possibly really pique your interest (DS seems be polarizing like that). Just my inclinations, but I thought the Literature component was the best part of DS--the works seemed to talk to each other in a way that I didn't find on the other syllabi. LeVen is a good section leader; she clearly has meaningful insight into the works, but she sometimes has trouble conveying her knowledge. You'll likely see salutary progress in your writing quality, as she makes this a special focus of her class.",
    "This course is a whirlwind tour of ancient and medieval western literature. It gives a solid foundation in the ideas of these books even if you end up wanting to reread them and think about them further in the future because of the wild pace. I would recommend the class to another student while warning them that sometimes it can feel as though we can only treat the surface of these books and ideas.",
    "This was the highlight of my first semester of DS. No offense to Philosophy or HP, but the readings in Lit can't be beat. Homer, Greek drama, Ovid, Virgil, the Bible, and Dante are all amazing to read and even more rewarding to discuss. The pace of the reading was fast, but not unreasonable, and the essays were actually pretty enjoyable to write. If you have read any of those authors before and enjoyed them, this is a class you ought to take.",
    "I would. You learn so much and afterwards you really feel like you have a good basic grounding in classical literature. Its an important thing to have and I would have regretted not taking it.",
    "I would say expect to work hard and don't expect the grades to come easy, but you will feel accomplished in the end.",
    "Yes, because the material we covered is essential for the study of any other subject."
