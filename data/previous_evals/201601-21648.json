    "A little bit harder than L1, but still quite enjoyable.",
    "This class is 'aight. It's not a huge amount of work and you learn a good amount of Korean. There is a lot of talking in class which is good. I think my spoken Korean actually did get better. There is a quiz every morning so if you are chronically late you may wanna take section two so you don't fail every quiz. The tests aren't particularly hard, but they weren't what a lot of people in the class expected. She is really big on full sentences so when you go through the book, if there is a full sentence that is in the vocab book (not just a word) write that down and remember it. You will be tested on it. Also she's really into the stories in the book, so to avoid her getting testy, just read the main story that week. It'll literally take ten minutes and it saves you a lecture the next day.",
    "Only if they really want to learn Korean. If they do, it will be a very rewarding experience. However, if someone is merely trying to satisfy a language requirement they should take something easier.",
    "A fun class that might be a bit different from KREN 110 with Lee sunsaengnim. Professor Choi seems really scary at first and the system is really different from L1 with Professor Lee in that there's a clearer more structured homework schedule (basically everyday) and there's a greater emphasis on packets Professor Choi prepares rather than the textbook (but the content ends up being the same anyways). However, Professor Choi's actually pretty chill and just focus on learning Korean and being interested in the culture. She does want to get to know you, so when you can, go to language table. Basically, though it might seem a bit stricter at times, it ends up being a fun, chill class just like Korean L1."
