   "comments": [
    "Pretty much everything needed for basic calculus, and some stuff form calculus 2.",
    "I learned the basics of calculus, including topics such as limits, derivatives, differential equations and integrals",
    "I learned how Yale assesses how we learn math. I learned to think about calculus more conceptually",
    "Calculus",
    "Pretty standard Calculus AB class. I had taken AB in high school and learned essentially nothing, but I have a much greater understanding of derivatives\/limits\/basic integration\/basic DiffEQ after this course.",
    "I learned one variable calculus and how to solve a few real world problems with mathematics.",
    "Primarily derivatives, integrals, and some specific formulas.",
    "Finding derivatives and integrals of functions and applying them to real world situations.",
    "I learned a lot of new mathematical concepts.",
    "You might hear a lot of negative comments about this class because it is an intro to calc and many students in the class have taken in it before. However, this is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I have actually learned so much although I studied IB calculus before. The course has a very unique combination of understanding theories and applying them to real-life examples. The exams are very close to what you study in class, and they test your knowledge of theories, and not only numbers. I recommend taking this class!! especially with Professor Ian!",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of single-variable calculus- from the limit definition of the derivative to taking integrals and differential equations. I also learned about the level of preparation it takes to succeed at the collegiate level.",
    "I took calculus in high school, so I had many of the basic skills required for this course already, including some of the conceptual work that others struggled with. That being said, I felt my understanding of limits, integration and differentiation were cohered significantly through Ian's emphasis on understanding why we apply the skills we do in this course. So it's more an awareness of the skills than the skills themselves that is new and interesting and helpful in math 112.",
    "I better developed my skills in taking derivatives and integrals",
    "The skills of single variable calculus including a deeper understanding of limits, derivatives, and integrals",
    "Basic calculus skills",
    "I learned\/attempted to master almost all skills that are required of a calculus course.",
    "I learned how to better study information out of class. This course helped me understand how to better analyze material and also helped me learn how to further my understanding of certain topics by combining skills I already possessed.",
    "I learned about integrals and calculus",
    "I took this course as a senior in high school so it was a nice way to ease myself into college mathematics. This course was mainly focused on the derivative, its definition and its applications. I enjoyed this class because rather than learning rules and applying them, we had to understand the concepts behind the math, which made it more interesting and engaging to learn.",
    "Introductory calculus concepts.",
    "This course helped me understand better math concepts and principles.",
    "I learned about calculus in a different way, as it was more conceptual and theoretical than purely math-based. I learned how to apply these concepts and rules in a mathematical way.",
    "While taking this course, I learned how to better grasp an understanding of the mathematical concepts I've been taught and work with to solve problems. Rather than simply asking students to answer questions, Math 112 pushed scholars to write thought-out responses to some questions, enabling them to make connections between topics and understand the true meaning behind questions.",
    "I learned how to take the technical and calculation skills of calculus and apply them to certain real-life scenarios."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The topics covered in class, though relevant to the P-Sets, are very different from the questions asked on the P-Sets and exams. If students are going to be asked particular types of questions on homework and exams, they should be prepared for those types of questions in class.",
    "The informaiton is always presented in a clear and understandable manner. The turoring sessions for the problem sets, as well as review sessions before exams, are all very helpful. However, I did not like the Ximera assignments. I think the website was not a good reflection of student learning and should not be graded as such. Sometimes, even if all the questions are filled in, the website does not indicate that the assignment is 100% completed. There were also many instances when the website has the incorrect responses, and will not give students credit even if they enter in the right answer.",
    "The Problem sets were really difficult. I needed peer tutoring for all of them. There were some concepts that werent taught well that showed up on the midterm and final.",
    "The course was well organized, but the workload for the course was a bit oddly spaced and I think that the due dates for problem sets or ximeras could have been better organized.",
    "Very theoretical I prefer more examples",
    "The strengths were the professor (IAN!!) and the availability of peer tutoring and resources to help students (office hours, practice midterms, etc). Material was always taught well, but the PSETS were significantly harder than the examples we did in class (as it should be, I guess). Could be improved by smaller class size, which I get is hard because of the high demand for a few professors.",
    "The course was interesting and paced appropriately. I dont think a whole lot could be done to improve it.",
    "Enjoyed this course. Did not find Chimaera's helpful.",
    "Reading questions carefully on exams.",
    "The course was challenging, yet it encouraged critical thinking and problem solving.",
    "The course and its structure are almost perfect. I believe the assignments were fair for all students whether they took calculus or not before. However, I would reduce the amount of Ximera assignments, and make the psets structure and content a bit closer to exams.",
    "I thought this course was taught very well. It allows you to get as much out of it as you put in. I found the Ximera sections very helpful for solidifying my knowledge of each section and peer tutoring hours were crucial to helping me understand the psets. Ian was also incredibly helpful and one of the best math teachers I've ever had.",
    "Could be better if there were more hands-on practice work in class. Note-taking process feels a little rote as well. I liked that students are asked to share and teach with their neighbors in class several times each class to verify that we understand concepts, and there is plenty of time for questions whenever a subtopic is discussed,",
    "I think that the ximeras could be a little bit more helpful and be more like the tests",
    "I struggled with attention to details and taking what I learned in class and applying it to harder test like questions.",
    "The P-Sets were not as indicative of the exams as they should have been",
    "Strengths: the material is taught well Weakness: the material is taught too fast and concepts taught in AP calc are glossed over because it is assumed you know them",
    "I thought that the class itself was well structured but I wish the peer tutors were better advertised and I wish that there were more times for recourses outside of class as the ones given often conflicted with other commitments within my schedule.",
    "strengths were optimization and implicit differentiation weaknesses were integrals",
    "I think this course was very well taught.",
    "Strengths: Ximera was definitely helpful for me, as it allowed me to review important concepts before exams. I also liked how students had access to office hours throughout the week for help on PSETs or simply to review class material. Weaknesses: N\/A",
    "The weekly problem sets and Ximera were helpful in consolidating the information learned in class better. It would be better if there were more peer tutoring sessions, especially near the end of the course during finals.",
    "One strength of this course would have to be the lectures. I truly liked how my section's teacher, Professor Adelstein, taught students major concepts by breaking them down through short problems in-class alongside the worksheets he distributed during the session to help better our understanding. One weakness of the course that I think needs improvement is how teachers give feedback to students on tests and examinations. With little to no written text explaining how a question was graded and why, students can often feel confused and worried about their future performance as they do not know for certain what they may have done wrong on past assessments. In order to remedy this issue, I suggest that teachers correct and grade their own students' work, circling and drawing arrows to places they find fault in work in order to not only pinpoint mistakes but show students exactly where they need to adjust their method.",
    "I believe this course's weakness was its lack of more in depth explanations rather than teaching students as if it is material they should already understand. In addition, I believe more practice as we learn new concepts would help solidify our knowledge in them and ability to apply them on tests."

    "You're probably going to have to take it. It's not bad, it's actually a pretty good class. Just make sure you get a good professor\/instructor.",
    "I will recommend this course to anyone who would like to learn calculus.",
    "I would only recommend the course to students who took calculus in high school. Although the course description says that students can take the class with no precious knowledge of calculus, I dont think thats true.",
    "Yes if you need it",
    "Yes, especially if you take it with Ian. As far as intro math classes go, I couldn't have really asked for anything more.",
    "I would, with the caveat that they should get a tutor in order to make sure they understand the material because it is easy to fall behind.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes, because it is very important for most majors and the teaching was great.",
    "Yes, Professor Adelstein is the one the students should take it with.",
    "Yes. Please consider taking this class even if you have taken some AP or IB calculus. This course focuses on the ACTUAL UNDERSTANDING of theories and their applications. By the end of the course, you will be able to prove why such theories make sense, prove why they make sense, and why their converse don't!! So, take this course if you are interested in learning beyond memorizing derivatives formulas and applying them in the exam.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking to get a good base knowledge of calculus for their studies or to go on to higher levels of math.",
    "Sure, I mean it's a prerequisite that you have to take for many other courses... so take it if you need. It's basic enough also that if you're looking for an easier QR it would work well.",
    "Yes. It is a good course for Econ majors who need a math course.",
    "Yes because it was interesting to learn about further math concepts",
    "Yes I would, its a manageable calculus class especially if you have taken AB calculus in highschool",
    "If you took AP calc in high school this course will be fine but if you don't have a strong background in calculus this course will be very challenging.",
    "If you are interested in math then I would recommend the course",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Only if it is required. Being that I am not a STEM major, I don't see the necessity of taking this course. However, it was required for another program of mine and so I took it this semester.",
    "This course is good if one wants to either recall or understand well math concepts taught in the class.",
    "Yes, because it allows you to learn math in a whole new approach, making it interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who feels shaky in Calculus despite having background in the subject from high school. I consider Math 112 a nice Segway and re-introduction into the major concepts behind Calculus due to the challenging Problem Sets and weekly Ximera homework assignments that kept students up to date with material. However, I would still warn them about the possibility of getting a professor who they may not meld well with and understand completely since, as I've heard from many other students, the learning curve of Math 112 depends heavily on the teacher's performance."
