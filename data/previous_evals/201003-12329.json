    "I would recommend this course. I took it credit\/d\/fail and this was a great decision for me. I'm a psych major and could have pulled off an A\/A- if i worked very hard, but the midterm, final, and paper are all very writing-intensive and take much time and energy to prepare for. If you don't have a bunch of time to devote to this class, take it credit\/d.",
    "Take it! its a lot of work but interesting.",
    "Yes - but only if you must take it for major\/pre professional requirement. Is more work than other psychology classes at Yale but is also more rewarding.",
    "You will learn a lot in this course. It is not for the faint of heart, however. The textbook is around 1000 pages, you'll have a 4000 word essay due, you'll have a midterm and a final with 30 essay questions to prepare (5 of which will be given) on each. That said, it's actually worth it if you're interested in development. I would also recommend developmental biology. Just cause it's awesome.",
    "I learned a lot of really interesting material in this class. However, it's not an easy class. The debates were often difficult and the paper and midterm\/final were a lot of work. It's nice that Prof Keil gives you questions to study, but there are SO MANY questions. It is a class that I talked about a lot though. The material was really cool.",
    "This class is fascinating: you learn about why you're the way you are and watch youtube videos of babies in class which is awesome. Regardless of whether or not you're a psych major, this class is very interesting. But beware of the workload: weekly section with reading repsonses and debates, 2 tests in which you have to prepare 30 essay questions of which 5 are asked on the test(final had 30 from midterm and then 30 new ones)so this takes an incredible amount of preperation and then a 4000 word paper where you design an infant experiment. If you're willing to do the work, this class will reward you and be a very worthwhile experience!",
    "Wonderful course! Professor Keil gives fantastic lectures and the material is up-to-date, organized and super interesting! Work load is reasonable, though maybe a bit heavy on the writing for a psych course.",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "It is a great class that goes over how we develop cognitive systems in childhood. I would definitely recommend it for anyone interested in psychology. I loved Professor Keil.",
    "It's a lot of work, but material itself is fairly easy if you just put some time into it. A lot of memorization for the exams, Prof. Keil gives a list of potential essay questions - 30 for the midterm, 60 for the final - which is pretty excessive. If you like kids and don't mind putting in the effort, this course could be rewarding. If your looking for a fun class to take, skip it.",
    "Only take it if you must. This class is a lot work, and most of it is unnecessary. I feel like Keil just tries to find ways to give you more work and make your life miserable. Also, he needs to get his book published (if he ever will) before he teaches this class again. The pre-published version has a lot of typos, horrible picture quality, and no table of contents or index, which is extremely annoying, especially when preparing for the tests. He gives you 30 essay questions to prepare for the midterm, and 60 essay questions (30 from the midterm) for the final, which is kind of ridiculous. In order to find the answers, you have to look through the book and find the section that talks about the question, but this takes forever because there is no index and table of contents. Also, there is a 4000-word final term paper as well. On top of 60 questions you have to prepare for the final.",
    "Deceptively a LOT of work. The last week determines 55% of your grade, and the finals take so long to study for.",
    "Great introduction to developmental psychology. A lot of reading but well worth it if the subject is interesting to you. It's more than just baby psychology, and has a lot of really implications to other branches of psychology, so I'd recommend the guys to take it as well (the gender skew is pretty substantial as well towards girls, take that as you will)",
    "Dev Psych was hands-down my favorite course of this semester. Frank Keil is a wonderful lecturer and runs the class extremely well; even at 9am in the morning, I was immediately enrapt and almost never dozed off when I got to class. For anyone interested in development, which is to say you are remotely interested with the question of how you became you, you must take this class. It is a must for psych majors, but I would recommend it to so many others. It may seem like a chick class at first (okay, and yeah, it kind of is), but as one of the few males in the class I can say that anyone, regardless of gender, should find this interesting.",
    "Psych 140 is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! It is very well taught and the material is extremely interesting. The sections include debates, which are actually very laid back and fun. There is a lot of work, but it is definitely worth it. Any psychology major or even anyone who ever wants to have children should take this course!",
    "I loved this class. It was a good survey of important aspects of human developmental psychology. Professor Keil is a fantastic lecturer and the material is extremely interesting. The fact that I could stay awake and amazed at 9 in the morning every time is evidence enough. The class was very accessible to anyone who had taken an introductory psych course. It is a lot of work, but I never felt that the work was mindless or excessive. The topics covered were extremely interesting, and watching videos of cute babies was always a plus.",
    "Even though it is one of the hardest psychology classes I have taken, and I'm a senior psyc major, it was also one of the most interesting. Professor Keil is a great professor and I love going to every lecture, even though the were at 9 am. It is a lot of work twice a semester for the midterm and the final, but he tells you the format at the beginning of the semester so it should not be a surprise. There are 30 essays to know for the midterm and an additional 30 for the final. As long as you prepare the essays in advance, they are extremely manageable.",
    "Yes, take the course! Maybe rethink that if it's offered at 9 am again...",
    "Interesting class. Section debates could be dull at times, but the material was fascinating and confirmed my decision to be a psych major. Your grade breakdown: 25% midterm, 35% final, 20% paper, and 20% section. Don't do the readings, and instead just go to lecture. Even though it's at 9 AM, it's worth it. T",
    "Yes. Be prepared for the writing though--decide if you like essay tests.",
    "take it if you are a psychology major and need to. There is a lot of work for section that counts for only a tiny bit of the grade. SO MUCH WORK. also SO MUCH WORK. EXAMS REQUIRE SO MUCH STUDYING AND SO MUCH WORK.",
    "Don't take this class if you're already taking a heavy class load. If you're very interested in the material, then maybe think about it.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology and particularly developmental psychology. The class provides a lot of information on the material and is very interesting. The class is a lot of work, but if you put in the effort it isn't difficult. All of the exam questions are provided ahead of time. The material is interesting and Professor Keil shows cute videos and studies in class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. The lectures were great (though 9AM was brutal) and professor Keil is awesome. Section seemed unnecessary, but it's kind of interesting because they're just debates on current topics in DevPsych (day care, ADHD, violence and TV, etc). The essay exams are graded harshly, but you get all of the questions beforehand. Expect to spend two weeks of your life frantically preparing long answers for 25+ questions. There is also a long paper due at the end of the course (~15 pages).",
    "This class is pretty interesting, a good psych course if you are only going to take one. The tests are easy and the section is pretty fun. There is not too much work and you don\u0092t need to go to lecture.",
    "PSYC140 is a good class; I would definitely recommend that people take it. Developmental psychology is both a very interesting topic and a topic that is highly related to other areas of psychology and cognitive science, so it is a really worthwhile class to be spending your time on. The format is rather amorphous compared to many sorts of psychology courses, so you have to get used to that, but once you do you will learn a lot. Also there is an emphasis on research methods sorts of topics, which is nice if you have an interest in research.",
    "If you go to class and section, and keep up with the readings then you will be all set.",
    "I learned a lot in this course, although a lot of it I already knew from intro psyc. Professor Keil is a good professor, but it is sometimes difficult to sit through his lectures so early in the morning.",
    "Pros: Some of the topics are really interesting and cool to learn about. Sometimes Prof. Keil gives pretty good lectures, but not always.Cons: The \"textbook\" is atrocious - it is basically two giant course packets without continuous page numbers or an index. There are also typos, etc. because it is a pre-publication draft. It's really cumbersome and discouraged me from doing all the reading.An even bigger con was how ridiculous the midterm and final exams were. Midterm: you're given 30ish essay questions and you will have to answer 5 in class. Final: you're given 30 ADDITIONAL essay questions and you will have to answer 5 of the 60 in class. On top of all the other work during reading week, I didn't have nearly enough time to outline all of these questions in order to do well on the exam - even considering the fact that I had outlined almost half of them for the midterm. It was unrealistic and overwhelming."
