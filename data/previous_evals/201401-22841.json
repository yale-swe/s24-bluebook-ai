   "comments": [
    "While the work load is a bit heavier than other graduate seminars, the benefits -- in my opinion -- go far beyond many other courses. Professor Gage's assignments, from readings to written assignments, are not meant to be busy work, but to help graduate and undergraduate students master the field, prepare for exams, and help other students in the class with their own work. It's a very collaborative and supportive seminar environment and the books are all fantastic.",
    "An in-depth study into the history and historiography of American conservatism, including its economic, evangelical, and philosophical strains and its sociocultural implications. Absolutely take the course if you have even the slightest interest in American politics.",
    "An excellent course in every respect. Great readings, intelligent class discussion, and an outstanding professor.",
    "Lots of reading, fascinating material.",
    "This class covers the major debates over the development of the modern conservative movement, what groups belong to it, and to what degree it has achieved political success. I would recommend it as a good overview of 20th century American history, not just for politics but also race, class, and gender."

   "comments": [
    "This course has been incredibly helpful for my own dissertation project and has helped deepen my understanding of American political and 20th century history. I'm very glad I took the course.",
    "Added genuine substance to an area I've long been interested in.",
    "I have a much better grasp of the historiography on 20th century American society and politics, especially understanding why the history of conservatism originally developed and how it has changed over the last several decades. It has also reassured me that the topics in which I am interested have yet to be addressed with the methodology that I intend to use."
