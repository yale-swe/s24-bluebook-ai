    "Spring DS Literature is a great course, with Cervantes, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy its high points. Be sure to do War and Peace over the break. Professor Jewiss is an excellent section leader and guide through western literature (although there was some disparity in her handling of different aspects of the syllabus; she was much stronger on Cervantes than Shakespeare). Her class discussions are invigorating and her grading is fair and helpful. If you're thinking about dropping DS, don't. The spring term of DS Lit is especially interesting in how it challenges some of the presuppositions on which the DS program is based.",
    "The second semester of DS Literature is a bit of a let down after first semester. Stick with the program if you really love DS, and you will certainly be glad you stayed. The reading load increases quite a bit second semester, which is something to keep in mind. On the whole, though, the reading is enjoyable and worth your time. Professor Jewiss is good, but her lack of discussion regarding the broader themes of texts can be frustrating for some students. If you enjoy extreme close readings of texts, then this is the section for you.",
    "You read some classics that everyone should read; feels like less of a necessary class than first semester or the other 2 sections of DS. Do a lot of reading over the vacations.",
    "Please read all of the books. Your experience in class will be a dozen times even better if you do. Why did you do DS in the first place? To read the books! War and Peace and Don Quixote were probably my favorites, yet those were the ones many DS students did not read because of their length and because they were assigned for vacation. Don't make that mistake. Also, Professor Jewiss will call on you if you're quiet (as she should).Professor Jewiss is a wonderful teacher. She is perceptive and well-read and asks the most important, thought-provoking questions. The way she led our class discussions and her insights inspired me to constantly stay on top of my reading so as to give justice to the lofty ideas she placed before us. She achieved a balance between focusing on the particulars of each work as well as on their common threads. She helped me improve my essay writing as well (LOOK AT HER COMMENTS!).She is unassuming but would earnestly evaluate the merits of our ideas, always giving us the benefit of the doubt but also disciplining us to ground our statements on evidence from a close reading of the text. Great, cheerful woman, with a light-hearted sense of humor and who is moreover very devoted to literature because she herself is so profoundly sensitive to it. What more could you want in a professor?Professor Jewiss demands closereading of the text so ground your claims in evidence! Go to office hours and discuss your paper with her in advance (it really makes a difference on the quality of your paper) She can be a tough grader, so I would start the year with Credit\/D\/Fail, but hopefully she will help you with your writing by the time you must decide to change to a letter grade. If you're really not doing well, go talk to her; she is very kind and cares about her students.",
    "I would recommend that you know what you're getting into before you take DS",
    "What does it mean to be human? To what extent should we create the Self? How natural is love? Can we, ever, actually know everything? Can we know ANYTHING? This aren't the questions of DS philosophy, but rather of DS Literature, a key part of exploring the Western tradition which touches on the open-ended questions of the human experience using fictional characters who outlive the authors that questioned it. Not only will you read lots of Great Books (and most of them are actually pretty great from an entertainment point of view as well), you'll dig right in to the core issues of the texts, as standalone works and in relation to one another. If you've ever read a book and want to read more, you'll absolutely love this class and this section.",
    "Yes, writing improved, read great books, learned a lot!",
    "It's a reading intensive course and the authors are a bit more difficult to understand and the books are much longer than 1st semester but it's definitely worth it to learn about the more modern authors. I would recommend this class but warn the students that it definitely isn't a walk in the park."
