   "comments": [
    "It's a great course to take as it cultivates skills useful in life and all sorts of . The professor is readily available and the material is interesting for people of all different art backgrounds. I would recommend it to other students.",
    "It's really really rewarding, and definitely worth it.",
    "Take ENGL 114. You may THINK that you are a good writer, but despite your SAT Writing Score or AP Score or (insert random standardized test here), you can still take a lot from ENGL 114. I, for example, learned how to appreciate naunced ideas, write academic papers, and anticipate counterarguments. Talking about counterarguments, I'm not writing this as a humanities-based person: I was heavily STEM-oriented during high school, and did not expect much from this art-centric class. I was wrong about my first perceptions of this class, and would definitely take it again. Again, don't be afraid to expand your horizons! You're at Yale, and despite what some pundits may say, there is value in a liberal arts education.",
    "This particular English 114 section was a great class. I learned a lot about both academic writing and art. I recommend this class especially to people who have very little experience with visual art, because the class really taught me to appreciate art and the humanities. I recommend English 114 in general to anyone who wants to improve his or her academic writing immensely. It is a perfect introductory-level writing course for Freshman. The class is difficult, and the workload can be quite heavy, but it is definitely worth it.",
    "It is important to have an interest in art, because then the class will be extremely valuable to you. However, it can also introduce you to art. I would recommend it to another student, it is a good class to take the first semester of freshman year. There is a great deal of reading, so make sure you are up for that.",
    "A pretty good class. Very good way to jump headfirst into college writing and research, though it's a bit difficult in the inherent subjectivity of art. Regardless, you'll definitely improve as a writer, as well as a reader, especially if you are interested in art (for this particular section). It's still a great class if you don't have any background in art or art history, and it might actually be better that way since you'll get a more organic experience. Do note, it is a decent amount of work, with 4 essays throughout the semester, but the work pays off."
