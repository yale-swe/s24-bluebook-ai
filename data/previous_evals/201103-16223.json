    "Loved this class. Lectures were always interesting and Prof. Schwartz really impressed be by knowing everyone's name. Sometimes I felt like the lectures were a bit out of order and getting the most out of the class was dependent on doing the assigned reading for important background information, but overall the structure was fine and it wasn't too hard to piece things together. It's the best course period that will satisfy both a Rest of World and Preindustrial requirement, and it's a great way to get an introduction to Latin America if you were like me and didn't know much going into the course. Workload is manageable, you don't have to do all of the reading. You will be itching to visit South America after you take this class!",
    "Yes, only to those who are interested in the area",
    "Definitely- great class.",
    "A great survey of an important period of history that isn't too hard and can be fun. Readings can be a lot but not if you prioritize\/enjoy them.",
    "There is a lot of reading assigned in this class. That said, if you're interested at all in Latin American history, this is a very interesting class and you'll learn a lot. I would highly recommend it for history majors looking for a way to fulfill the \"rest-of-the-world\" requirement.",
    "would recomend it if it is a subject you're interested in.not too hard, but can get dull at times if you are familiar with the topics",
    "Yes if you are interested in latin america. But be warned, this is a lot of work for a history lecture, section assignments are overwhelming. A lot of reading too. But the material is easy and the tests are very fair.",
    "yes for a ROW."
