   "comments": [
    "A good class to learn french.",
    "French 130 is the next step in learning French and the last class required to complete the foreign language distributional requirement. If you are taking it for that reason, carry on. If not, consider why you are taking the class before you enroll. 130 taught me nothing that 110-120 did not already cover. The class is tedious and unhelpful and the workload is much more trouble than it is worth.",
    "Good class. I definitely recommend Madame Burton. She is very nice, but more importantly makes sure that you are ready for the tests. The class is lots of work (a bit over an hour a night), but if you do it all you will get a fine grade and learn some french.",
    "French is an extremely useful language to learn, so I would definitely recommend to continue to L3 with Madame Burton.",
    "It is a lot of work. At least 2 hours a night reading or watching films. And then you need to do the course packet work and any other additional assignments that the instructor assigns. It is time consuming, but it really did help me learn french.",
    "Strengthening of grammar concepts in French learned through the study of French literature and cinema. Highly recommended for those interested in the language and literature.",
    "I would recommend French 130 with Madame Burton to another student who is willing to put a significant amount of time into the class. Madame Burton does assign work in addition to the daily audio programs, and has stricter standards for the compositions than some of the other instructors. However, the additional work is mostly preparation for class discussions and activities, and the success of those activities makes up for the extra time outside of class.",
    "Highly recommended. Most fun I've had in French yet.",
    "Interesting class, a lot of work but you can do well if you are just disciplined and get the work done. Mme Burton is super sweet and helpful! She gives extra papers that help you learn the concepts better than people from other classes so tests are much more manageable. Take it :D",
    "FREN 130 moves quickly, but you do end up learning a great deal, in terms of vocabulary and tenses, and have great exposure to the literature and cinema of France. Be aware that audio exercises do often take quite some time, though, and that starting out, coursework can feel a bit overwhelming, but it does get better with time. I highly recommend Burton for this course; she made the class very lively, facilitated great discussion, and while definitely not the easiest, is approachable, helpful, and encouraging. I would hope to have her for future French courses. Overall, the course is definitely a strong one, and I am glad to have continued my French studies with Yale's department.",
    "I would recommend it, and also to any graduate students considering taking the full language course. It was an intense but informative and enjoyable way to get back into language learning."
