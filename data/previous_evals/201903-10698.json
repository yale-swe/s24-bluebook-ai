    "I learned about the history of robotics and some modern developments.",
    "You learn a lot. You cover the basic history of robotics and learn a few reactive based robot architectures (Subsumption, Motor schema, REX, and DAMN) in depth. You also cover dynamical systems, human robot interaction, few basics of AI, autonomous vehicles, collaborative manufacturing, humanoid robots and more. You also do a simulator robot project, which honestly is a bit of struggle, but still is quite fun.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - interesting topic, different from the more theoretical CS classes in that this one has more practical applications, Scaz is great Weaknesses - the group project had some flaws, I think they made it too difficult by introducing too many changes late in the game (which I know was kind of the point but it kind of took away from the interestingness and fun-ness of the project and made it painful), not everything in the environment in the Webots application worked 100% correctly, like turnRight() actually made you turn left and vice versa which seems like would not be that hard to just fix, but little things like that that just made the project more confusing and annoying than it should have been",
    "I think this course is very unique and interesting. That being said, the project could have been better planned and some of the lectures seemed unrelated to the greater point of the course.",
    "Strengths: many fun stories about robots and you will meet a LOT of them. Prof Scaz was a great lecturer, who presented the experiments and studies in an engaging way. Weakness: 1. too hand-wavy on many important topics that deserve elaboration. In the time of a 50-minute lecture, we were only able to cover the definition of the terms, but not enough time to actually learn why we define a framework like dynamical system for example and how we could apply to robotics. 2. The materials were a bit outdated. What you learn for the most part is what people proposed half a century ago.",
    "The course lectures are interesting but the project had some issues. For example, if half of the grade for the project is going to be determined by documentation, there should be much better guidance on the kind of documentation that is expected. If you do just the requirements listed on the sheet, will you be fine? Does commenting code count as documentation? I don't think it's necessarily the right decision to have that be such an important part of the project grade without being crystal clear about what the final documentation should look like. Overall the project was fun and interesting though, and gave us a chance to learn how hard robotics is.",
    "This course was one of the best CS courses I've taken at Yale. We covered a lot of material, somehow learned it in depth, and applied it in an actual project. We also had clear notes with all of the powerpoints posted. Perhaps the only weakness is that it took a while for our homeworks to be graded, so we didn't really know too many grades before the midterm.",
    "Strengths: the group project near the end of term really helped us reinforce concepts through application, the professor makes himself available after lecture and at office hours to answer questions Weaknesses: the grading of problem sets as well as exams are very harsh, the TAs aren't very helpful at answering questions about the problem sets at office hours",
    "Scaz is a great lecturer and it's a joy to go to class. The class is the opposite of hands-on and you spend lots of time talking about practical concepts. That being said, Scaz makes this clear and you still learn lots. The addition of the multi week robotic simulation project this semester was really fun and felt like a great time to apply some of the things we learned in class.",
    "The course organization is strong and material is interesting. Scaz is an engaging lecturer and overall a fair professor -- the psets, midterm, and final are all doable with some decent studying.",
    "The course is too large for its own good. The projects and assignments could be interesting, but there is not enough personal engagement to really explore the topics. Lectures were highly variable in quality and topic, but overall felt anecdotal, and it was difficult to know what was vital information to remember.",
    "I think scaz is a great lecturer, which makes it easier to attend the morning lectures, but apart from class, I think the psets and tests aren't really organized well for learning. There aren't a whole lot of practice resources provided by the course staff and online, which makes studying and looking for online resources difficult. Although there's a piazza, I feel that the answers are often surface level and response time is a little too long.",
    "The coarse gives a good, broad overview of robotics; however, I wish it would have focused more on applications and less history. Overall very good though.",
    "Most all the topics we covered were interesting to me and lectures were very engaging. The project we did used really frustrating and unimpressive software, so I didn't really enjoy that part.",
    "Lectures are always interesting and fun to listen to. The homeworks provided an opportunity to truly understand and apply the structures and topics we learned in class.",
    "Grading is awful. Let me say it again. Grading is awful. TA's took off so much for little mistakes. I wish I had read the reviews.",
    "Scaz is an excellent lecturer and the material was incredibly engaging. The final project was a lot of work but I enjoyed it overall.",
    "Scaz is an amazing lecturer - I never once got bored during his lectures",
    "The lectures are clear and usually fit in each 50-minute lecture. Since this year was the first time the group project was given as an assignment, there were some bugs and problems with the code. Testing each code release would be helpful for the students. Also, for problem sets, being more clear about what the question was asking for would have been helpful.",
    "The grading was very confusing and there was extremely limited help for psets or exam preparation. However the lectures were engaging. I would say there was significant overlap with AI",
    "The strengths are definitely the lectures and problem sets. Scaz is an awesome lecturer, I always feel engaged and leave having learned something cool. The problems sets are a little more open-ended, having you really think through concepts and design robot architectures without worrying about building the entire thing or having one right answer. After the problem sets, we did a big project of coding a controller for a robot to survive a zombie simulation. The concept and team collaboration on this was great experience, but one weakness is that the project depended somewhat on mastery of C and computer vision, even though no courses like 223 were prerequisites.",
    "The course gives you a good understanding of which efforts were made and which problems had to be dealt with to reach the current technological level in robotics. Scaz is definitely a strength of this course because he isn't only very knowledgable about the material through his position of running the Social Robotics Lab, he is also a great lecturer who likes to tell the stories underlying specific developments or robots. A weakness of the course is that it doesn't go beyond being a survey course. It doesn't dive into a specific topic for several lectures. Instead, each lecture covers a different matter. Moreover, the idea of the project is a very interesting one, but it should be better prepared. There were many bugs in the given environment (Webots), which made the project very time-consuming and frustrating. It would also be nice if the course focuses a little bit more on current developments and problems in robotics.",
    "weakness; bad organized exams, vague assignments",
    "I just love this topic so I found the course very interesting",
    "Very interesting class, and Scass does an amazing job of keeping lectures interesting and exciting to go to. The two problems I have with the course involve the homework and the tests unfortunately. The class is taught in a very humanities like manner where we are encouraged to do our own thinking about big overarching questions in AI development so there's often no right or wrong anwser. But a lot of the questions on the homework are pset styled where a lot of questions must have a definitive right or wrong anwser. This makes answering questions so much more difficult than needed and there's been a few times where a good justification for an plausible anwser is completely shot down because it wasnt the anwser that was being looked for. In terms of tests, the material in the class is very broad and encompassing, we go from drawing robot architecture diagrams to skimming over machine learning to talking about the social ramifications and unanswered questions of robotics. It's a lot of material and the homework and lectures do very little in terms of guiding us towards exactly what we should be understanding for the class. Multiple times I felt like I had a good understanding of the overall topic of a lecture to be presented with a question on a minute detail that we just skimmed over in class. As a side note: The project was interesting, as we had to program a robot in a simulation but we were forced to program in C, which from a pain, especially for those who have only coded in higher level languages. The material is fascinating and the lectures are very well crafted to really give us a good sense of the current and past state of robotics research, but I hesitate to recommend this class non-credit D (it's not a lot of homework for the class but the grade is much more dubious) simply because of the imo unfair and sporadic homework and test system.",
    "The content from the lectures was great but the final project was very unstructured."

    "Yes, this class was very different from most cs classes at Yale, and I learned a lot! Scaz's lectures are also very engaging.",
    "I would recommend as an elective for a CS student, especially if Scaz continues to teach it, because it is interesting, practical, relevant, and has real world applications you can easily see",
    "I'd recommend this course to students who are really interested in robots. Students who take this course should know that it's very light on coding, and heavier on learning architectures.",
    "Only if 1. you are very into robotics and want to do some research in the social robotics lab or 2. you want to have an easy CS elective that balances out coding-heavy ones like CS 323.",
    "I would generally recommend this course but know that it's a lot of history rather than modern machines. Nevertheless, I found that it gave me a great foundation in robotics and am glad I enrolled. Check to see if they're still doing the project - it's a lot of work, but shouldn't be too bad if you start early.",
    "I would recommend this course to all students. I thought it was very interesting, not too heavy on work, and covered material that will only become more important as time goes on.",
    "Yes if you are interested in robotics. You do learn a lot about the field, but the grading is harsh and can stress you out.",
    "Absolutely! I'm a mechanical engineering major and this course was really awesome. It has a low workload and you really just need to go to lecture and start your psets early to succeed in the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this as a CS elective, one of the best lecturers and interesting coursework that has real-world implications and examples. There is some intellectual thought in considering whether robots are intelligent and what ethical questions they raise.",
    "The class is worth taking for people interested in the history of robotics or in human-robot interaction. I would not recommend the class to someone interested in learning the development process for robotic\/autonomous systems.",
    "Yes. Just know the two homeworks at the very beginnning of the semester carry a lot of weight for the grade.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who needs a relatively programming-free cs elective, most of the assignments don't require programming, and understanding of any of the concepts doesn't have to be done at a very deep level.",
    "Sure, it's an engaging and broad overview to robotics that you'll be able to keep up with.",
    "Yes! Would highly recommend to anyone interested in intelligent robotics, even if you are not a CS student!",
    "Not at all. Professor was ok, but course was horribly designed.",
    "YES - one of my favorite courses so far.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in robotics at all, take this course",
    "If you are interested in broadly learning about intelligent robotics, then I would recommend this course. Additionally, if you want to take Prof. Scaz's Intelligent Robotics Lab course in the Spring semester, you need to take this course as a pre-requisite. It gives an introduction to different topics in robotics, so that you don't go into too much depth over one topic. It was a good class; however, there was some overlap with the materials in Scaz's Artificial Intelligence course, so if you've already taken that and want to learn something a new, a different class might be better.",
    "Yes if youre not really nervous about your grade, and havent taken scazs AI class",
    "Yes, but I would say even though most of the course doesn't involve programming you should be pretty confident in your programming skills if you want to do well.",
    "Yes, this course is one of the better CS electives. Scaz is a great lecturer who makes classes enjoyable, and the workload isn't overwhelming. If you put in the necessary work and time, you'll do well in class.",
    "No. Cuz the exams are so bad.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because it is a fun CS course, not dry or boring at all. its a really fun application of coding that also requires you to think outside of the box in a way that you can't just use coding knowledge for.",
    "Very interesting class, and Scass does an amazing job of keeping lectures interesting and exciting to go to.
