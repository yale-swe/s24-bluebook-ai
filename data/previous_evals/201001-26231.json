    "This course was fantastic. It's a little bit difficult to evaluate in comparison to other courses, because it was first of all an experiment, and second of all the pace and work content were just different. All of the things we had to do and learn were very real and pertinent to our fieldwork, so it felt like a lot more work than other classes even though it may not have been. The readings were sometimes different for different people\/groups, so it's hard to evaluate those holistically too. Anyway, this class was the best ever and I hope it's offered every year!",
    "This course is an extremely valuable addition to the FES roster. It gives any student looking for practice implementing interdisciplinary environmental research a very useful field component. For students who are about to engage in summer research it really helps apply the concepts and methods discussed in class, improve confidence levels and learn how to design and conduct independent research."

   "comments": [
    "Getting to go to costa rica and actually follow through with research we designed ourselves",
    "Uhhh....everything? I'd say the best part was the fact that it was an opportunity that really isn't offered often or anywhere else. Social science, although many people study it and many people do it, is something that you kind of just have to learn by doing. A course like this is so INCREDIBLY valuable because it allows students to learn from an experienced researcher in the field, which is just a wholly different experience than learning in a classroom, especially within the context of social science. I'm so incredibly glad i got to have this experience before i graduated, and taking a class like this earlier on in my academic career would have been completely invaluable.",

    "The opportunity to engage in experiential learning, learn from our peers, and work as a team bringing complementary skills, backgrounds, ages, etc.",
    "The ability to carry out a real life, social science research project. Learn from experience and limitations encountered in the field.",
    "Amity was really responsive to our thoughts and completely let us design the research project, while being very supportive and giving us advice when necessary. She struck a really great balance."

   "comments": [
    "Maybe just a better sense of pacing in the first few weeks, but of course that's something that will improve the next time this course is taught.",
    "More emphasis on different research methods, explanation of why you use different methods in different research scenarios, greater depth of research methods literature.",
    "This course was an evolving process. Some of the readings did not turn out to be very relevant but we could not have known that beforehand. In the future it will become progressively easier to tailor the materials to the most pressing issues.This class was a wonderful learning experience for all participants regardless of their incoming level of experience with applied social science.",
    "Perhaps be a bit more strict about the language requirements for the course.",
    "It was disorganized, just because we were the first group going, which could be seen as something that needs to be improved, though I didn't see it as a problem. The disorganization really helped us all learn, since we wanted to learn more about how to run this type of research project. Either way, I think it will be more organized for future classes, which will help them delve more deeply into the issues we began to uncover this semester."

    "This course pretty much sums up my overall program - my background has been in social ecological research, although always on my own. Until now I had never done group work or worked with a more seasoned researcher, which was one of the most valuable parts of the class for me personally. Basically this class brought together all of the skills I have learned more or less haphazardly in my academic career and put them to use working on a larger project. It is also an extremely valuable (crash) course in research methods, which I had never taken formally either.",
    "This course gave me an opportunity to practice what I've learned in the field.",
    "As an MeSc student this course is extremely important in preparing me for my own research andputting into practice research design, field work and data analysis. I have learned many lessons that I hope to apply in the future and I am excited to get back out in the field this summer.",
    "Has been invaluable in helping me prepare for my master's research project.",

    "Ive never worked with a group before, so integrating everyone's perspectives, goals and ideas was a little difficult to get used to. But overall I think group work ended up functioning excellently. Having multiple eyesand ears in interviews (especially in Spanish), having multiple backgrounds and skill sets represented, and just having people with different personality types turned out to be incredibly valuable both to my experience personally and to the work we conducted together.",
    "Most work in the class was group work, and I enjoyed learning from the diverseperspectives of everyone in the class.",
    "Working in a group allowed us to triangulate our data, challenge our biases, and collect more data than any of us could do on our own. We emerged with a plethora of data and strong relationships on a community level. Our group dynamics were very strong and taught us all much about ourselves.",
    "Working with a diverse group let us use each other's input and specialties in many different areas.",
    "Advantages were being able to get more interviews in and to get different perspectives on the information we gathered. Disadvantage was having so many perspectives that we ended up with a huge all-encompassing project, which was hard to manage at times."
