    "Writing a senior essay in English was one of the best decisions I made at Yale. It was the most challenging and rewarding academic experience. You don't have to write a senior essay; don't write one if you don't have an idea for one. Talk to a potential advisor early, and make sure to choose carefullysome professors will talk to you just a couple times a semester, and others will meet with you more regularly. If you want to write a really good essay, you'll have a blast putting the necessary work into this project. If you don't love your topic, you're gonna have a bad time of it. If you want to do this, definitely do it.",
