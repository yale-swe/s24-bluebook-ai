    "If you're thinking of taking this class, then presumably you already took EEB 460 and did a project over the summer (you can't take 461 otherwise). In which case yes, take the second semester. You keep reading papers, but also work on writing your summer research up (paper and oral presentation). Same format as spring semester, but more relaxed in terms of discussion. The professors don't grill you so much as have a conversation with you.",
    "I found the second semester of this class to be much better than the 1st semester. This may be because we had a smaller group, but also because I think we knew how to read the scientific papers in a better way by this point. Thus, if you do take the 1st semester, I strongly suggest you take the second semester. This semester's speakers were amazing and very insightful, and provided some great advice for aspiring scientists. It is really a gem of a class within the EEB department, and we get a lot of support for writing up the summer projects. If you are considering taking this class, you will have done the first semester, and so I won't go into much of the background. Suffice it to say that it is a wonderful learning experience.",
    "This class was a pleasure to take. The discussions were engrossing, the literature was broad, and the subject matter was fascinating. The instructors did a great job of choosing articles that demonstrated a tension in the literature. It came to show just how debated the frontiers in medicine are. This is a must-take class for any scientist who actually wants to understand disease.",
    "We had a 6:4 or even 6:6 faculty ratio at times. The guest speakers were phenomenal, the faculty members are very supportive and treat you like colleagues, and there is very little assigned work (just writing up a paper on your summer research, which hopefully you were planning to do anyway). My only warning is that if you are someone who is shy when it comes to speaking up in seminars, there is really no other way to show you have done the readings, and even if you aren't shy, depending on how the discussion goes, you might not really get a chance to speak without saying something that sounds redundant. However, you will learn a lot from the faculty members and your peers, and the readings are quite interesting too so be sure to keep up with them!",
    "The course is a comprehensive overview of the nascent field of evolutionary medicine; Steve Stearns, the creator of the course, also created the field. Great opportunity to learn from the most relevant people in the subject."
