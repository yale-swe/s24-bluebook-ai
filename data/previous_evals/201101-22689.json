    "It's theater. Theater Now.",
    "This is a good class in which to learn about contemporary theater. Professor Robinson is great, and you get to see shows!",
    "Theater Now is an incredible way to educate yourself (and have the ingenious Marc Robinson educate you) about what is happening in theater today. Don't let the silly name fool you -- this is an important class to take for anyone who plans to go into theater professionally, in any way. Maybe not as important for English majors who don't know anything about theater (and you may be out of your element). But I feel like I've learned SO much and have a wonderful foundation of knowledge to use as I go out into the world of theater NOW! but seriously.",
    "This is a fantastic, fantastic class. Professor Robinson is a brilliant teacher -- one who I actually value his class remarks on. The play's rock and it's just a great time. Try to take a seminar with him if you can! So smart!",
    "Theater Now is an excellent survey of what's going on in contemporary theater. Prof. Robinson is incredibly brilliant and incisive in his criticism while making his students feel comfortable in the validity of their own ideas and offering plenty of time for their discussion and observations. We saw a few plays -- two at the Rep, one in New York -- over the course of the class, which was awesome. I recommend this class to anyone who's interested in reading a whole bunch of bizarre, sometimes amazing, plays, and talking about them in an engaged way around a seminar table filled with theater people. (An English major, I was in the minority, but I never felt too scared-off by my lack of experience with theater to share my views.)",
    "This is a wonderful class. The plays we read are diverse and engaging, discussion was wonderful, and the workload was manageable (weekly blog posts, one short paper on a production we saw, and a final paper). One of the more enjoyable class experiences I've had at Yale, largely because it was a great group of people, and Marc Robinson is great at leading seminar and facilitating discussion.",
    "This was a really great class. It's a great opportunity to get to know a lot of the most exciting and important contemporary playwrights and theater groups. Marc Robinson leads a great seminar.",
    "Theater Now is a fascinating course that looks at recent experimental works of theater. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in expanding their knowledge of contemporary theater through reading and viewing new plays."
