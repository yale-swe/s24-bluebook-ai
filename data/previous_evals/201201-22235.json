   "comments": [
    "It is a really interesting course. Definitely learned a lot. But be prepared to contextualize a lot of things on your own. I would describe this course as an introduction to some key contributors to literary theory and their ideas. I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in gaining knowledge and understanding of lit theory.",
    "Basically a philosophical class with beautiful texts. It changed not only my understanding of texts and writing but influenced my overall philosophy on identity, history, time, politics, and media. Everyone at Yale should take this class.",
    "The course as taught by Professor Jacobs takes a very particular approach towards lit theory: this is not exactly an introduction, it is more of a 'deconstruction take on lit theory.' That being said, if the 20th century development of lit theory from Freud to structuralism to post-structuralism is what you are looking for, Professor Jacobs' course will offer you an interesting narrative on that.",
    "I'd wanted to take it since sophomore year and finally did my last semester here. so worth it.",
    "It is a hefty class, but I would thoroughly recommend it if you're prepared to think through a lot of theory and change the way you look at literature. It has illuminated much of what I've read in past courses, which has been a terrific experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants a grounding in HOW to understand theory. Don't treat this like DS: you won't just read a bunch of important dead white dudes and absorb a canon -- you'll do the much more advanced work of learning to read well and analyze complex texts.",
    "In retrospect, this course was better than it seemed at the time. It's a lot of complex readings and a lot of theorists, and while I feel like I now have a foundational grounding in some big names (de Man, Derrida, Foucault, Barthes, and some others), I wish there'd been some more variety than just Judith Butler in terms of not just reading dead white males.",
    "This was a bit more of a sophisticated approach to the topic of literary theory than a typical survey course: you both read important texts in the history of lit theory, but then read the thinkersback on themselves. This was a really interesting thought experiment, but I had a lot more fun with it because, as a senior, I had some exposure to these thinkers and this level of discourse; I think I would had struggled a lot as a freshman. This course doesn't offer a broad survey of the -isms, the way Paul Fry used to teach it, which was a bit disappointing; it would have been great to have a bit more of both styles, so doing the level of deep reading already on the syllabus, but including either the Fry lectures or textbook readings, so that Barthes is accompanied by structuralism, Derrida by deconstruction, etc. Carol Jacobs is, however, the best - brilliant and genuinely caring and just so wonderful - so for her wisdom alone, you should take this class if you're at all interested in the material.",
    "Great but challenging class. The readings are generally short (20-50 pages) but really intense. I learned a lot in the class though; the class completely changed the way I read, but I wish I had taken it later so that I could get more out of it. The assignments are extremely reasonable; instead of a final, we had three quizzes, which made the studying more efficient and manageable. There were two papers with enough guidance that I didn't feel lost.",
    "If you're a literature major, you're required to take this course, and I would recommend that you take this earlier rather than later, as it will change the way you read literature in the future. This is a good survey of literary theorists with an emphasis on how to read for the issues in their own writing. The course culminates in a paper that encourages you to use one of the theorists to read an art object of your choice, which is an effective way to help you see the material's applicability to the outside world.",
    "It's good if you want to read a little more into structuralism and deconstruction but it pretty much ignores any theory apart from that (i.e. postcolonial, formalist, etc.\u0096\u0096I write these terms not knowing what they mean since the class didn't teach me).",
    "It's a good group of readings, and Professor Jacobs is clearly very smart, but this was not an Intro class. You will not come out of it with any kind of survey knowledge, and she doesn't even teach the immediate context for the works you do read (which are almost exclusively structuralist or deconstructionist). Take it for the readings, but not for much else.",
    "This course is a loosely guided close reading, and it only makes sense to take it if you are prepared to read and engage with the texts since the lecture does not summarize but offers an interpretation.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone that has some interest in the idea behind writing. The material presented is definitely challenging but the instructor and teaching assistants work hard to make it comprehensible. It was a good course, but it was a little overwhelming at time, especially towards the end when the readings got more dense and longer.",
    "I would only recommend this class to people that are very interested in lit theory. The texts are often frustrating and difficult to get through.",
    "I think many people, before they've encountered literary theory, have a preconception that it will be boring or irrelevant or needlessly complicated. I went into Intro to Theory of Literature thinking just that--but it ended up being probably the most rewarding class of my Yale career so far. Prof. Jacobs' lectures really illuminated the texts--it was incredibly rewarding to struggle with the essays, begin to understand them, and then listen to Prof. Jacobs unpack them in class. You end up with a real understanding of the questions, the styles, and the stakes of these authors. My section, with Moira Weigel, was phenomenal. It was the most satisfying, enlightening section I've had at Yale. (I know, I got very lucky with this course.) Moira is always willing to meet with you to discuss paper topics, recommends outside readings, or just talk about the texts. A really fantastic class. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Taking this course, I felt like a character in Kafka's novel: there are texts, lectures, and discussions I don't understand but everybody else seems to get them.",
    "An excellent course. Professor Jacobs chose to focus on one aspect of literary theory - deconstruction, from its roots in Freud through to its blossoming in Butler. This may not be the whole picture, but it is, at least, one comprehensive way of looking at literature, and has deeply influenced the way I think about reading, writing, and the world. Professor Jacobs's lectures were, for the most part, very illuminating, and my teaching assistant was spectacular. The amount of work was very manageable. A tiny bit more guidance could have been provided on written assignments.",
    "LITR 300 with Prof Jacobs was a very thought-inspiring class. I learnt a lot from Prof Jacobs' deconstructive reading of the text we read, which ranged from Freud to Foucault, from Barthes to Butler, all of which are classic and very exciting texts. Prof Jacobs took the class differently compared to her predecessors Prof Saussy and Prof Fry, and since Prof Fry is teaching it next year (2012-2013 Spring) again I will suspect these words won't be very indicative about the course then. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this course a lot. I think this course has shown how theory can be applicable even now, rather than what critics profess in opposition.",
    "Lectures are enjoyable, section is thought-provoking, and the workload is manageable.",
    "Great class. Lectures are a bit jumbled but sections are enjoyable and the readings are great if you are interested in literature",
    "My condolences if, like me, you are a literature major. This class COULD be really cool (check out an earlier version on OYC) but it's structured in an unhelpful, nonsensical way. The class was us reading in succession 5 or 6 random theorists, some of whom, though very interesting, did not specifically write about literature (eg. Freud). That would be fine, had we not been assigned to like, 400 pages and 3 weeks of Freud: What??? Anyways lecture was mad boring but a good opportunity to edit essays\/do work for other classes. I hear Prof. Jacobs is great in small seminars, so do that. Oh, and pro tip: you can take this class Credit\/D. Even if you're a Lit major.",
    "Great class for lit majors",
    "all of carol jacobs' lectures are works of art, but this class was 100% dense scary theory. it is a great class but i will probably get a b- in it. then again i didn't do the reading. my point: take it, but work hard."
