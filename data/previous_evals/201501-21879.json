    "Great way to get experience running your own study, doing the data analysis on your own, etc. Lots of work and can be tedious, so make sure you pick something you're interested in. I'd only recommend this for people who are serious about conducting research in the future (grad school, med school, etc). Also, people should have a strong background in statistics.",
    "The nature of independent research means that you will get out of the research what you put in. However, this is a great department to do research in as they're super flexible and really want to help you get your project off the ground!",
    "Absolutely do it. The most valuable learning experience you will have at Yale. It is great also to be in a lab setting and learn about the other projects that people in the lab are working on. Working through the successes and issues alone and with your mentor helps you grow as a thinker and scientist.",
    "Yes! It is a great way to get research experience and 10 hours a week isn't bad."
