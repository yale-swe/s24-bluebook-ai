    "I took this course to improve my writing skills. I not only improved my abilities generally, I discovered I could write poetry and learned about the basics of that art. I highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their skills and cultivate a personal writing practice. Prof. Chapman will challenge you in the ways that you need, and you will be encouraged by what she affirms in your writing, with the result that better writing will come after the course is over.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Professor Chapman will help you write better poetry. I am sure you will learn about yourself along the way. You will take the lessons you learn about image and sound to your research papers. Watch the way even your blandest academic writing is transformed by this experience! This course is labor intensive, but well worth the effort.",
    "The class consists of reading poetry, writing poetry and workshoping poetry of your peers.",
    "Amazing class! No need for previous experience, not a significant workload, but really fun writing assignments. You basically have the option on how much time you put in....if you are in a pinch with other classes one week, this will not be a terrible burden, but if you feel so inclined, you can put more time and reap massive personal benefits! Writing poetry can be really therapeutic :) Professor Chapman is really helpful. Make the most of the group also! Setting up extra outside workshops can be super fun and helpful for getting feedback on your poems.",
    "Definitely take it. Professor Chapman is awesome, and you'll get a lot out if it, even if you're not an English (or related) major",
    "Take this class if you at all can. You will learn more about poetry than you ever have.",
    "Great class for those with little writing experience to learn the mechanics of poetry, and also for those with more experience to push themselves and jumpstart their writing. I'd recommend the class to both parties"
