    "If you are reading this, you will have taken the first semester of translation already, and you will know how wonderful Professor Waters is. Absolutely continue with translation, and take this course. You work on your individual translation project throughout the term, which is incredibly fulfilling, and you get to edit everyone else's pieces, which is fascinating. Do it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you liked FREN 185, please continue with this course. Professor Waters is amazing and you'll really get to know the works you and your classmates are translating. I also got to know the rest of the class pretty well given the small class size. Another cool aspect of the class is that the environment is collaborative, even more so than the first part of the sequence. Please take this!!",
    "Yes. This is a great class for anyone interested in French literature, translation, close reading etc.. If you decide to take the full sequence in one year, you would also get to know your classmates really well, which is definitely a plus."
