    "Yes, absolutely. The material in this class is wonderfulI feel I learned so much!",
    "Pretty interesting course, I wish the conversation had more direction. Seemed too nebulous sometimes, but that also might have been a more personal preference.",
    "Absolutely recommended. Get into Prof. Nakhimovsky's section if at all possible.",
    "This class was a survey of the trends in political theory that run through a selection of highly influential and oft-referenced works in the Western tradition. The layman might accuse DS of blindly worshipping a Western canon that doesnt exist, but the DSer is actually well aware of the fragility and arbitrariness of the Western canon and the possible paradox of political philosophy all the while. Ironically, I think DSs ambitious mission statement of reading through the Western canon in a year encouraged me to pay closer attention to the order and content of my syllabus than I would have in a class that seemed less controversial. I certainly feared that DS would breed arrogance, but it actually promoted great modesty instead I leave feeling humbled about what I dont know and aware that my knowledge is provisional since I read these texts without much historical context. I would definitely recommend this class because it is irreplaceable. While some of my friends tried to recreate this curriculum with Intro to Political Philosophy, the thematic organization of that class categorized their thinking for them and biased their readings whereas the chronological organization of that class left us to fend for ourselves and create our own themes to trace across the works we read. My friends would condense the works we were reading into epigraphs whereas I emerged from DS feeling like that kind of oversimplification only does a disservice to these complex, multifaceted works. I want Directed Studies to be the best version of itself, and one recommendation I would make is for professors to provide performance evaluations for the students. The only feedback we receive is through our papers (and office hours), but I would have been so, so grateful if my professor had reflected on my own strengths and weaknesses and offered advice for improvement rather than just assigning me a meaningless grade at the end of the course."
