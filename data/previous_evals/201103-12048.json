    "I would not recommend JDST 279 to another student because I feel there are other classes that address the topics better. For instance, a class on Jewish thought or Jewish philosophy would probably touch on some of the issues we covered, but without the confusion of knowing that you're taking a class on radicalism that never mentions it after the first week explicitly.",
    "This is an interesting look at Jewish religious radicalism throughout the last millenium. If you don't already know the historical material, sometimes it is a little bit hard to follow since the readings do not explain much and assume familiarity with the topic. That being said, the class is interesting and you learn a lot.",
    "Would recommend it to any student wanting to understand Orthodox Judaism, to the right of modern orthodoxy, in the modern era. With the catch that the student have some understanding of Judaism and modern Jewish history before taking the course.",
    "Historically and geographically broad to be comprehensive, but thematically cohesive. It was a fun class! It's not just about Jewish Radicalism, though it covers plenty of diverse Jewish movements; you'll come out of it understanding more about religion's place in society."
