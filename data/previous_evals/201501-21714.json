    "This is a comprehensive survey class on spectroscopy where you learn a great deal.",
    "Take this class as one of your electives. Prof. Saunders is just a great human being who knows so much and is very willing to share and help you succeed. Go to class and take notes because his power point slides are only the basic skeletons of the lecture. The essence is in his drawings and examples on the board. The oral final is awesome. You get to chat with Prof. Saunders for a little less than an hour about spectroscopy and life in general. It's not intimidating at all, much better than written finals because he helps you along the way.",
    "This class gives a great overview of many forms of useful spectroscopy and the pros and cons of using each form. I would only recommend the course to chemistry majors, as it fulfills requirements for that major and is useful in that discipline, but will not ultimately help too much for other Yale courses.",
    "I took this as an elective for the Chem major and it was okay. I learned a lot about nmr but we didn't go into much depth for the other forms of spectroscopy."
