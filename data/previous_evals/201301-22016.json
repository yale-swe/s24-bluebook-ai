    "Straightforward: A solid (I think) introduction to elementary Italian grammar. I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "This class is MUCH easier than L1. It goes at a much slower speed (no more weekly tests) so that the information is actually digestible. The course also focuses a lot more on culture than L1, with several movies, an opera, readings from the Decameron, and even a trip to the art gallery. While I don't feel that my speaking has improved very much, I have a deeper appreciation for Italian culture from this class. Rachael is a really nice person, but if you really want to master the language, I'd take it with a native speaker. I guess this is true for all language classes, but I just feel like I lost out by not having a native speaker this semester. However, that said she is probably the easiest of the L2 professors and is a lenient grader. The class really isn't that much effort overall-- it almost feels like cheating that it's 1.5 credits.",
    "A very good class for intermediate speakers. Pretty hard but you just have to put in the work. I would recommend this class to another student because it is engaing and helpful.",
    "NOT AN EASY LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT!!!!!"
