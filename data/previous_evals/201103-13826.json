   "comments": [
    "There is very little reading in this course, which is good for anyone who dislikes reading very long texts. The weekly essay (alternating between rough draft and final draft) is quite challenging, but the work you produce will be worth it. Take this course if you enjoy writing or are looking to write about something you find interesting.",
    "English 120 i14 s a class that requires a great commitment of time and effort. It is certainly a challenging course that requires extensive reading and writing, yet it is also a very rewarding course. If a student is truly looking for ways to push his writing skills to new heights, then this is the right course. This course compelled me to engage my writing in a more personal, meticulous manner, and I've seen and felt an improvement. Therefore, I would certainly recommend this course to other students.",
    "Yes, it definitely makes the student a better writer. The intensive nature of the writing forces and focuses the student to immediately get better at writing, and to become a more skilled and specific writer.",
    "Take this class if you actually enjoy writing and want to improve. The lessons you learn taking this class will undoubtedly help you with your writing in the future.",
    "English 120 14 is a highly recommended writing course for everyone, regardless of their potential major.",
    "This class was challenging but rewarding. I was surrounded by fantastic students and a great teacher. Although the class was hard at first, I quickly found my writing groove with the help of the essay readings and discussions. I now feel that I'm a much improved writer, and feel confident moving forward in my college career.",
    "English 120 was one of the best classes I've ever taken. I loved everything about it--the professor, the students, the class format, the paper topics, etc. I could really go on and on about how wonderful this course was. I haven't met anyone who regrets taking this course. Take it!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. At the beginning of the year, I felt like the alternative, ENGL 114, seemed a bit tedious; I wanted to focus on a different style of writing I wasn't used to, especially because I don't regularly read the New Yorker or the New York Times' op-ed page. The class itself was really rewarding and Mr. Oppenheimer was a great teacher. It was definitely a class you couldn't BS; he could always tell if I wrote the draft the night before, or if I neglected to outline my essay. Every paper I received, I understood the reasoning behind my grade (though bear in mind: Oppenheimer is considered to be one of the hardest graders out of all of the ENGL 120 professors). If anything, you'll learn how reading contributes to great writing, and how important editing and deadlines are to writing. And honestly, I feel like the class challenges you to improve your writing a LOT.",
    "This course is great. If you are interested in learning to write, this is the course for you. The reading for the course is interesting. It's what you want to read but don't have time for. You pick all the writing topics, so they are enjoyable. The course is a lot of work, but most of the time it doesn't feel like homework.",
    "It's a class aimed at teaching you how to write about yourself. The course consists of writing about a personal experience, another person, a place, a cultural criticism and an argument. The final essay prompt was literally to write whatever you wanted, which made it challenging but liberating. I would DEFINITELY recommend this class with Oppenheimer. Even if you are a sophomore, take it.",
    "It is your duty to yourself to take this course, and if you can, take it with Oppenheimer. You'll write 6 essays, while some other sections have only 5, but this just means less weight on each and more opportunity to improve your writing, which is what the class is all about. Take this class only if you love writing and are confident in your writing ability, and even so, be prepared to be cut down at first. If you're deciding between this and English 114, as I was, the distinction I see is that 120 is about about writing for yourself, with a large degree of freedom to choose topics, whereas English 114 is more geared to preparing for writing research papers and other academic writing. For me, 120 was the clear choice once I figured that out. A little something about the structure. You'll write a rough draft and final draft of every paper and turn one or the other in every week. It's a lot of writing. Ours were due Tuesdays, and assuming you have T\/Th class as well, leave your Mondays as open as possible (but also consider working over the weekend; when I did, I didn't regret it). Oppenheimer gives thoughtful comments and is available to talk after class and in office hours. If you need help choosing a direction or are stuck on a certain part or anything, really, go see him. Just please, please, please take this class. It's made me rethink my initial aversion to the English major and has made it clear that I won't make it out of Yale without taking several more writing courses."
