   "comments": [
    "Yes. I had options of taking one of the following courses:-> Graphics (with Dr. Dorsey)-> OS (with Dr. Ford)-> Database Systems (with Dr. Abadi)-> Parallel Computing (with Dr. Sherman)Out of all this had a lot less work load.",
    "It is a good course covering from openMPI\/OpenMP\/Pthread and cuda. The assignments is well designed, you should get some peeks of the parallel programming.",
    "I would recommend it to every CS student, although it is somewhat tough",
    "great course",
    "Highly recommended if you are interested in parallel programming. It might not directly applicable to your future work or study if you don't focus on high performance computing, but knowing the basic concepts and limitations of parallelism is rewarding anyway.",
    "I would definitely recommend since the material is great and the instructor is also great.",
    "As long as the student is willing to invest the time needed to grasp the concepts I heavily recommend this course",
    "This course was a great intro to several areas of parallel programming. I would definitely recommend, as I learned a lot and thought it was also fun.",
    "I would summarize this course as a serious CS course for students who use (or may in the future use) C++\/Fortran and want to learn how to write parallel programs. I would recommend this course to another student if they have a strong CS background."

   "comments": [
    "It helped me a lot to a new area of a kind of programming - parallel programming. A lot of new knowledge but really need time to digest and get your hands on practice. Assignments are fairly difficult and absolutely need some time to work on. Excellent class with great balance on theory and practice. I would recommend all graduate students to take.",
    "To compute things in parallel, to optimize the load balance",
    "It deepen my knowledge of cache, locality, parallelism, GPU, shared memory and other performance stuff.",
    "My research will benefit tremendously from it.",
    "This course has really helped my reserach. I have been able to speed aup my simultaion by 1000% using some of the techniques learnt",
    "My research involves working with a code framework based on MPI, so this was extraordinarily helpful in getting me up to speed on what was going on there."
