   "comments": [
    "A broad introduction to the synchrotron characterization techniques offered at Brookhaven National Laboratory's National Synchrotron Light Source II (and other synchrotrons around the world). I would highly recommend this to anyone in materials science, chemistry, biology, physics, etc. who might use synchrotron techniques to characterize materials, films, nanoparticles, biomolecules, etc. It is highly specialized though.",
    "Sure. I will recommend this course to student who works on materials, as it can offer us countless knowledge on spectral characterization.",
    "Yes, I recommend ENAS 725 01 to anyone who is interested in materials science.",
    "One of the most useful courses ever...",
    "Great class if you're interested in ever working in a national laboratory either as a permanent scientist (career oriented) or a user, especially interest in working on a beamline at a light source. Course provides a shallow but very broad overview of synchrotrons and the different type of experiments carried out, as well as some detail to understand the concepts behind each spectroscopic technique.",
    "Yes, will recommend! All speakers are nice and professional. TA is great! Field trip and donuts are awesome."

   "comments": [
    "It very much deepened my knowledge of my discipline (materials science) and the many methods I can use to characterize materials. I will be performing extensive synchrotron studies as a part of my dissertation, so it was very helpful to receive some formal training.",
    "I got better understanding of the synchrotron fundamentals and the application-directed instrumentations. It also expand my horizon on imaging area.",
    "I learnt a lot about X-ray techniques in materials science.",
    "It allowed me to further understand the inner workings of a national synchrotron facility and opened up the idea of applying as a postdoc to one of these facilities in the future."
