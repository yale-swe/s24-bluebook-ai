   "comments": [
    "I learned more about reading and writing in spanish and had more experience after this class in creating my own work.",
    "In this course I improved my command of written Spanish while also learning how to craft stories and poetry in another language. The course also introduced me to some very intriguing authors that I otherwise would not have encountered. I now feel much more confident writing both fiction and nonfiction in Spanish and have gained more experience with the Latin American (particularly the Caribbean) canon.",
    "Taking this course certainly expanded my vocabulary in Spanish, and exposed me to different writing techniques and styles",
    "My ability to think and write creatively in Spanish was the most valuable skill I developed in this course. I learned how to express myself as freely in Spanish as I can in English.",
    "In this course, I was exposed to new hispanic literature, much of which was by authors who I had heard mentioned by name before. It was exciting to get to delve into their pieces and also write my own inspired pieces by their work. For me, it gave me the opportunity to hone my reading and more importantly, my writing skills, in Spanish, while also learning about fundamental contributors to the hispanic literature world. It opened up a whole new genre for me.",
    "Writing, creativity and analysis of literature",
    "I was able to practice and improve my spanish. As someone who was a native speaker but fell out of the habit due to distance from family and spanish speaking relatives, I wanted an opportunity to engage with the language beyond grammar and vocabulary. This class helped me practice my spanish and my creative writing skills.",
    "I took this class to practice and improve my Spanish writing skills. I'm a native speaker but I had not done any work in Spanish for the last 7years. I have shopped many classes in the Spanish department but only this one challenged me and motivated me to improve. I am confident in my writing skills again. I also learned how to criticize other people's work and have mine criticized in either to make it better. I also want to point out the variety of authors that we read and how much I learned about other cultures and histories. I absolutely loved this class!!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think the professor is a definite strength in that she cares a lot about her students. At times the class was unorganized and there wasn't very much to do. However, the discussions were very good.",
    "The strengths are its workload (not too much, but just enough to keep you engaged), its structure (divided between poetry and story writing, very effective), and its professor, Maria, who is just wonderful. One weakness of this course is the lenience of the instructor. Some students need more guidance and structure than others, and while Maria certainly gives plenty of feedback on our pieces, I sometimes felt as though certain students got away with late assignments and missing work unfairly.",
    "The course is very flexible, it allows students to express their creativity in many different writing forms. There is nothing that can be done to improve it. A second semester continuation would be great though.",
    "The strengths of this course are the exposure to excellent short stories and poems of Latin American culture and the opportunities to replicate their styles.",
    "I think that the course's major strengths lie in the content. Reading work by such notable and important authors in the hispanic world provided a solid foundation for me to draw from for my writing. I also think that Professor Jordan does an excellent job of supporting her students and creating a safe and creative environment. In terms of improvement, all i can think of is maybe having the opportunity to write a few more short stories?",
    "Amazing course. Any strengths\/weaknesses are simply my own personal preferences and do not go against the quality of the course itself.",
    "This course was amazing because Maria Jordan created a very positive atmosphere for learning. Every Tuesday and Thursday I was excited to go to class because I knew I would learn a lot and enjoy it. She made sure we learned the material while still engaging with us individually as students and as people.",
    "A very interesting course. It would have been helpful, however, if the general direction\/format of the course was laid out more clearly at the start of the course. A really fun class to take!"

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I definitely would. It was a very fun and interesting class to take.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student confident in his or her command of Spanish grammar who wishes to be introduced to some fresh and exciting authors. The student should also be willing to revise his or work several times, as the final portfolio at the end of the year depends on this.",
    "I recommend this course to anyone thinking about taking an L5 Spanish class, or just anyone who speaks Spanish, in general, because it has definitely been one of the greatest learning experiences I have had in my life.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course as a well-balanced addition to any semester's schedule. It is fun and relaxing, though it does require consistent work.",
    "Yes, I would most definitely recommend the course to another student even remotely interested in this area. I thought that it was a very engaging and educational course, I definitely achieved what I intended, which was to practice my Spanish reading and writing skills, and overall, it was an extremely good experience.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who can get into it. You will never have a professor like Maria Jordan and you will enjoy every class session.",
    "I strongly recommend this class to other students!! Especially if you are a native speaker and don't want to get bored in class. Not everyone was a native speaker in the class but everyone had a really high Spanish level which made for a really fun class fully in Spanish!",
    "This is an amazing course for students trying to hone their skills in written Spanish. You get tons of feedback and every single piece you submit is carefully edited by the professor. Plus, by the end of the semester you will have a nice set of presentable writings in Spanish ready to be shared. I can totally recommend it.",
    "Y.E.S. I loved this course. Highly recommend it! However, if you are a very slow reader, this course might prove a little challenging for you. There is more reading than one might expect in a creative writing course."
