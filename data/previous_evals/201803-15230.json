    "I learned many legal elements that I have never considered before in my line of work.",
    "This clinic gave me the most tangible skills I've gained from a single course at Yale. I don't have a legal background, and Marianne provided readings and time during discussions for us to ask about legalese or legal processes that weren't clear to us. The clinic also focused on developing specific legal skills like drafting FOIAs, press releases, giving a press conference or radio interview about our cases, using Environmental Justice online tools to create exhibits for our cases, giving streamlined presentations and receiving constructive feedback, and the list goes on and on. We also devoted a significant amount of time to discussing the ethical issues and potential issues we might encounter doing environmental justice work - specifically coming from Yale and working with communities remotely.",
    "Overall, this class was very useful and informative. I deepened my knowledge about environmental justice issues and learned practical skills, including legislative drafting and filing FOIA requests.",
    "General introduction to law and environmental injustices in the U.S and the world at large."

   "comments": [
    "The course was great for the first time it was done at FES. I hope it becomes a staple. The course could be improved by enabling us to travel to meet with the EJ communities we're working with. It is hard to sit at Yale and not have any sort of in-person relationship with the clients. There should be additional funding that will enable this to happen.",
    "This class was well-structured, highly interesting, and included productive class discussions. Strengths included the opportunity to gain hands-on experience and highly relevant skills. I would have appreciated spending more time on American environmental law and hearing about other students' projects.",
    "The workshop was very useful. Marianne brought her rich experience in the subject matter to bare which really enhanced understanding of the core concepts. For me, the only weakness was the fact that the capstone deliverables were loaded and not very well-structured"

    "Definitely take this course if you have any interest in Environmental Justice. And even if you don't, you will gain skills that will be transferable to other courses and to your work after FES.",
    "This class is amazing, but you should know that it is a big time commitment!",
    "I highly recommend this course for those interested in environment law and social injustices in the U.S with respect to distribution of environmental burdens."
