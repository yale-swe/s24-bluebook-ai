    "Learned about ancient economic activity and how it differed from the economic activity today, as well as the vast amount of different viewpoints for studying the ancient economy.",
    "Critical thinking; careful reading; improved writing - great understanding of the overall state of the field of ancient economics",
    "I learned how to evaluate the work of other authors and coming to my own conclusions, supporting them with presented evidence.",
    "Learned how to analyze different texts and form arguments either rejecting or agreeing with their theses. Also learned how ancient historians gathered their data and what resources they used to formulate their arguments.",
    "I learned a great deal about the Ancient Economy, understanding historiographical debates, and navigating archaeological and ancient primary source evidence.",
    "Studied trade and business roughly 800 BC to 200 AD",
    "I learned how to compare different approaches to studying history, and practiced how to analyze the meaning of different types of sources and evidence."

    "Strengths: Readings, Professor Weakness: Occasional Lectures - sometimes drawn out",
    "The course lecture could greatly benefit from some organizational structure and specific goals. A bit rambling as was.",
    "Strengths: great, engaging style of teaching, very open to office hours and approachable Weaknesses: no glaring weaknesses",
    "I thought there could have been a little more clarity on the final paper, specifically how to make an argument about a historiographical debate. Otherwise, I found the class to be very interesting and appreciated Professor Manning's efforts to make it engaging, such as including the film at the beginning of the course and the class with food from Roia at the end of the course.",
    "Strengths: Joe Manning has a great lecture style, and brings in fun extras, such as guest lecturers or food samples"

   "comments": [
    "It is a great way to learn about a topic that often falls through the cracks in other courses on the ancient world.",
    "for history majors, this class is an easy fill for pre-industrial but other than that, it is pretty low engagement and uninteresting unless you're interested in the ancient Mediterranean. if you desperately need a PI credit, take it and its only 3 essays. other than that, not worth it. Professor is super nice though.",
    "Yes, take it if you are interested in ancient life.",
    "It's a very interesting course if you are interested in ancient history. Otherwise, it might get a little boring. Professor Manning is an incredible person who really loves what he's doing.",
    "If you need for something, but I am deeply interested in the ancient economy and did not find it particularly interesting or even comprehensive.",
    "Yes, great course",
    "Yes, good class in a unique field",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The grading can seem a little ambiguous since it primarily revolves around 3 papers, but overall you learn a lot by attending class and doing the readings.",
    "Yes, Joe Manning is a fantastic professor. Anything with him is a good call."
