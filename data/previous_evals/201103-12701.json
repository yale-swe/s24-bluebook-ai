    "Musicianship was a lovely addition to my course schedule this semester. There is no homework, just two hours a week of listening to music in class and dictating it. I definitely improved my ear, and Sarita is phenominal \u0096 try to take the class with her rather than a graduate student.",
    "I would definitely recommend Music 219 to any musician who wants to improve their musical ear. The class is a lot of fun, and you getto listen to really great pieces of music. If you can, try to take it with Sarita Kwok, because she definitely makes the class more enjoyable. In addition to the class meeting twice a week, you must go to keyboard lab for half an hour once a week. 219 is a very good fifth or sixth class because there is rarely any work assigned outside of class. The only work you might have is to prepare an exercise for keyboard lab or practice dictations for a quiz.",
    "If you like dictation, you'll have fun in this class. If you don't, you won't. You will get somewhat better at dictations over time, but if you're looking to bolster other ear training skills, you won't get much of that here.",
    "Refine your ear-training abilities. Don't take this course unless you need it for the music major or really enjoy taking melodic\/harmonic dictations; there is not a lot of support if you don't understand the material."
