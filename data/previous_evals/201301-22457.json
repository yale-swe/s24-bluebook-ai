   "comments": [
    "This was a course full of curiosities - if you're looking for a laid-back opportunity to read some interesting books and to talk about them with a famous professor, take it.",
    "fantastic, take it if you can",
    "You read a bunch of biographies -- some stellar, some kind of strange and more imaginative than a typical biography -- and then try your hand at the craft itself by writing a final biographical research paper. Professor Gaddis holds you to a high standard in terms of polished writing AND a well-researched product, so I stressed about this class, but I was very happy with it in the end. Take it if you can get in!",
    "Definitely take this course.",
    "Gaddis is great, end of story. He's also very kind and cares for his students. My one regret: not going to office hours. His wife is lovely and funny. You should really like biography to be in this class.",
    "Yes. Take it.",
    "Absolutely -- take it.",
    "You'd be crazy not to take this class! A seminar on biography with a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer, who also happens to be one of Yale's best seminar leaders, who will both walk the class through the historical questions surrounding readings, and help you become a better writer. The reading is a lot - a book a week, but you can get by without doing absolutely all of it. Two major writing assignments - a five-page autobiography (a fun but intimidating project) and a final research biography (the prospectus is also graded). Take the class! You won't regret it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Gaddis is a great teacher and the final assignment is fun."
