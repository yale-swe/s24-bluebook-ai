   "comments": [
    "Well organized. Effective presentation of the material that was intelligently conceived and efficiently delivered.",
    "Everything made sense.",
    "Material was conveyed in a logical sequence in which one topic built upon the previous. Homeworks directly reinforced materials covered in class.",
    "Excellent and well organized",
    "The course was a good introduction to basic concepts in structural design. It was very well organized, and all topics built logically from previously covered work. The weekly homework assignments were helpful in reinforcing what was learned in class. The diversity of the other out-of-class assignments was also a good aspect of the class, and often contributed to a more hands-on\/intuitive understanding. The PowerPoint presentations were the least helpful of these assignments, while the testable trusses and columns were the most helpful.",
    "I think the material was presented in a very effective manner.",
    "Fine, but there should be more emphasis on concepts sop that structures can be condensed into one semester only.",
    "The structure of the course was perfectly fine. My only comment would be about the assignments. Many of the assignments were repetitive but in a way that was tedious instead of reinforcing the concepts. The assignments should focus on a greater variety of problems.",
    "I thought the workload was mostly very fair and reasonable. Occasionally the homework assignments were very long, but they helped to teach the concepts. I thought the sequence of the course made sense. Prof. Moon said that he slowed down the syllabus somewhat this year, and I think this pace is pretty good. Any faster would be more difficult to understand the concepts.",
    "My only misgiving about the course material concerns the homework assignments. I found that they were often more difficult than the material we covered in class and that they were also sometimes unnecessarily time-consuming, especially given the course load for this semester.",
    "The sequence of the course was clear and well-organized. Professor Moon tied in our Studio work when possible, which was a nice way to relate the course material to our design projects."

    "I expected to learn about structures and my expectations were met.",
    "I expected to learn basic structural principles and systems, and their practical applications. These expectations were fulfilled.",
    "Very mid range expectations that were far surpassed",
    "My expectations of the course were met. It provided a basic and useful introduction to structural design. Professor Moon was particularly effective in showing how the content is relevant to architecture was a profession, and how the concepts could inform our own design process.",
    "I was expecting to be totally overwhelmed with this course since I do not have a strong background in Math, but I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to understand just about everything that was presented to us.",
    "I was hoping to be able to have time to digest all the information covevered in class. Instead, as the term progressed, it became more an exercise in jumping hurdles. The course material does not cater for those without math backgrounds.",
    "I hoped to understand the basic principles, and yes, this expectation was met.",
    "my expectations were met.",
    "I expected there might be more physics and calculus and more math--but I am very glad that there is not! I think there is just enough math to teach the concepts effectively."

   "comments": [
    "I found this to be a very informative class with valuable knowledge for me in the future.",
    "It was very valuable. As an architect I need to at least have basic understanding of the structure of a building.",
    "Valuable in the sense that I think every architect ought to have at least a basic understanding of structures. Perhaps not as directly relevant to other coursework.",
    "Very valuable",
    "While the content of the course is not the most interesting, I feel it was important and necessary information to learn. The value of the course was in helping to expand my basic knowledge of structural design principles, which will be very useful in future design work.",
    "This course has a much more cut and dry value than many of our other courses. It is very clearly important to know how to make a building stand up.",
    "Again, the concepts and basic principles are valuable because this will influence the design process, but I will forget the equations very quickly.",
    "I enjoyed the course, found the material interesting, and appreciated that the material was geared toward what would be practically applicable in the field.",
    "Due to the overload of work this semester, it was practically impossible to spend the appropriate amount of time to really learn the material.",
    "I actually enjoyed this course by the end, which is saying a lot, because I am not much of a \"science person\"--but I found it really helpful to learn these basic concepts and develop the intuitive reasoning for why structures are formed the way they are. I ended up using a structural argument for my final studio project, which I never would have been able to do at the beginning of the semester."

   "comments": [
    "Great teacher, OK TAs.",
    "The instructor was very good as well as the TA's. I feel that Prof. Moon is a fine instructor.",
    "Prof. Moon was able to convey the ideas very clearly. He has teaching this course down perfectly. The TAs were helpful in better understanding the homework assignments and any other questions we may have had.",
    "Dr. Moon is an unknown gem in the ysoa faculty. He is dedicated, supportive, responsive and an obvious expert in the field. YSOA should do all they can to keep and promote him. He is a thoughtful and unique instructor who is totally dedicated to the individual student's learning and experience.",
    "Overall, Professor Moon was a very effective instructor. He had extensive knowledge and presented the content clearly, for the most part. Sometimes, he would skip over certain basic assumptions in his presentation of the material that caused some confusion, but he was always willing to answer questions and give further explanations. The diversity of skill level within the class often made it difficult to maintain the pace of the class. Sometimes, the lectures would get bogged down in unnecessary questions and explanations that were only helpful to a few people. For the most part, though, Professor Moon kept a good balance between keeping pace and offering more extended explanations.The TA\u0092s were particularly helpful in holding weekly homework review sections and were in general very available whenever needed.",
    "I found Prof Moon to be an effective teacher. Although the TA\u0092s were always willing to help they were not always on the same page and would sometimes lead us down the wrong path. I thought Daria was completely on top of things, but I was less sure about the other two.",
    "Prof Moon was doing the best he could, considering the amount of information that we needed to cover, but it was from pillar to post when it came to finding someone to teach us the material properly after class.The TAs also did their best, but perhaps the material should stretch past the first year.",
    "Professor Moon is an excellent teacher. His only weakness is his spoken English. It was often difficult to understand his explanations, or for him to understand our questions.The TA's (especially Daria), were very involved and wound up teaching us half of the material outside of class time.",
    "since I usually had a good understanding of the material, i rarely talked to the TAs. Although I greatly appreciated the TAs attempt to keep everyone in the class up to the same speed.",
    "Prof. Moon is a great teacher, and understands very well the difficulties of first-semester students learning structures along with all the other requirements placed on us. He is a very reasonable and fair teacher. Daria was an excellent TA, going above and beyond to schedule extra help sessions and to lead homework reviews. Kipp and Shirley were not particularly helpful, and occasionally gave incorrect information to us during homework reviews.",
    "Professor Moon is really great. He has an incredible mastery of the material and is very dedicated to teaching. However, I do feel as though he sometimes rushes through material that is clearly problematic or confusing in an attempt to keep pace with the syllabus. This is an entirely understandable urge but when the majority of the class evidently fails to grasp a particular concept I feel that he should make allowances within normal class hours (he did offer several review sessions but they were difficult to attend given our course load) in order to ensure understanding.",
    "I appreciated Professor Moon's emphasis on communicating broader structural concepts, rather than nitpicking quantitative details. Blending conceptual ideas with problem sets, slide show lectures and building competitions provided a refreshing break from the workload of other courses. He made the material interesting and engaging, as much as possible.The TAs where invaluable to the course, particularly Daria Zolotareva. She always made herself available for questions and has an excellent command of the material."
