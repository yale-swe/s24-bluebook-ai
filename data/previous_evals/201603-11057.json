   "comments": [
    "I gained a deeper knowledge of France, and the trends, events and people that shaped the most revolutionary country in Europe for a 100 years.",
    "I learned to read literature as a historical source. I learned about the process of the historian and the complicated relationship between different points of view (specifically later historical analysis of the revolutions in France)",
    "I developed a comprehensive overview of the revolutionary period in France, with an emphasis on the social changes and continuities.",
    "A working knowledge of some major events and social trends in France from 1789 to 1871.",
    "I developed analytical skills for reading historical sources - both fiction and nonfiction.",
    "did research in the stacks for the first time; learned about the social and economic transformation of France from the ancien regime to the Third Republic; read \"primary source\"-type books by Zola and Balzac, which are ***extremely*** depressing but informative about the early to mid 1800s; considered parallels and repetitions to modern day stances in nativism and populism",
    "note-taking was key to success in this class. I learned to listen attentively and to review information discussed in section as well. At the same time, discussions were a crucial component of the course and sections were very engaging and informative. The oral final was a very good practice because I definitely learned to speak much better in a formal setting on concepts learned in class. I also found it valuable to practice speaking on subject matter learned in class because it helped me retain information better.",
    "Learned about French history from 1789-1871, lots of new historical information that I otherwise wouldn't have known. Very informative and interesting class.",
    "Great knowledge of the social history of France during this time period. More focused on social history than political history (although of course you will learn a great deal of political history).",
    "I learned a lot about France, many things that I didn't know before regarding the Revolution and an in depth look at why French society was the way it was during this time period. It was important in this class to look in depth at the people and way of life of French society.",
    "I learned about lots of different aspects of the many revolutions that took place until 1871.",
    "Critical thinking and writing.",
    "I learned a great deal about revolutionary France, as well as the process of researching History and unraveling historical narratives.",
    "I feel like 18th and 19th century France is a subject that most people have some sort of knowledge about, however cursory. I enjoyed this class because I can now keep track of every single revolution and regime change that occurred during this period. I don't simply think of this part of history as time of revolution and upheaval anymore. In other words, this class is a good lecture small lecture course that gives you great insight and a lot of detail about an issue that you may already know a little about from general history and high school courses.",
    "I learned a great deal about how to think historically, as well as the specific information I obtained.",
    "Being able to take pieces of history and connect them together in addition to tying their significance to present times."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It is very interesting, and Professor Merriman has a passion for the subject.",
    "There are very few assessments, and I think that this was a strength because it encouraged self-regulation. A weakness was the discrepancies between the reading and the lectures, I would have liked more correlation (not to mention some context for the books).",
    "I think this course could definitely use an overhaul, especially with the readings. We read almost no primary source documents until we were assigned entire books to read. I know there must be somewhere in the middle, and I know this because I found tons of primary sources (in translation!) that I used for my research paper. It would have been fascinating and enlightening for the rest of the class to have the opportunity to read and discuss in section, but mostly we just read from a textbook or from actual novels that I know nobody actually finished. Additionally, I think this course would be vastly improved with some kind of visual aid during the lecture.",
    "This course is strong in that Professor Merriman is extremely engaging as a lecturer. His lectures were always very informative and engaging, striking the perfect balance. The only weakness was that there were not many ways to be graded, so a lot of your grade comes down to the two tests.",
    "Merriman is a great lecturer and really brought the material to life during class. I took this class for the humanities credit, but it ended up being one of my favorite classes this semester. Sitting through lecture twice a week was extremely enjoyable. The work load is very manageable and grading is very fair. For the most part the readings are interesting as well. The organization is probably the weakest part of the class (the lecture notes are a little scattered) but it's not a big problem. Highly recommend.",
    "enjoyed the lectures and section, book selection was nice too. An improvement: lectures could be more organized- I felt that toward the end of the semester, class ended early but some of our topics like education and rural France could be delved into more deeply during that time",
    "Professor Merriman is a very knowledgable teacher that goes over subject matter clearly and efficiently. His extensive mastery of the time period makes it so that his students have a far better understanding of the subject than when they first started the class. The style of the lectures and discussion sections were also conducive to learning most productively.",
    "This is a classic Yale course. It should stay exactly as is.",
    "The content of the lectures is fantastic, but the lectures themselves are often a little disorganized--there were ID questions on the final that we never learned about in class.",
    "Sometimes Professor Merriman could be a little bit all over the place, but he is a great lecturer and the class is really interesting.",
    "I thought it was very interesting how all the pieces seemed to connect as we went through the years in France. I think it is a well taught course and Professor Merriman really has a passion for the subjects.",
    "I thought Professor Merriman had interesting things to say in each of his lectures. Sometimes the syllabus was unclear but I felt that the overall course covered many different parts of the Revolutions well.",
    "This course is absolutely incredible. I loved every minute of class. It felt like a TED Talk every day. Possibly the best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "The course was great all in all.",
    "This course was extremely strong all around. Merriman is an amazing professor and scholar of French history, and he excels in about social issues of the time. The only way the course could be improved would be through letting students know of the paper deadline more in advance. We were still able to complete the paper in plenty of time, but in the first half of the semester, the paper requirement was not well defined. Otherwise, Merriman is extremely organized and prepared to teach.",
    "The lectures of this course are hit and miss. I feel that there is no real overall message or theme of the course, and the excitement of some lectures fizzles out in others.",
    "I cannot think of a way it could be improved--one of my favorite courses.",
    "A tad more structure to the lectures.",
    "The material was very interesting except that the readings were sometimes too long. This made it hard to retain all the information and pinpoint which parts of the reading were most relevant to the understanding of the course.",
    "Prof. Merriman is a fantastic lecturer. Take it.",
    "The lectures were interesting, the readings were interesting. The workload was manageable. The only thing I didn't like was that some weeks we had 10 pages of reading and others we had 300, which was a little annoying depending on the week."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if your interested in why and how revolutions happen in a country like France and a city like Paris.",
    "Great class. Merriman peppers his lectures with anecdotes from his extensive experience in France. Sure, the lectures aren't always extremely organized, but who cares? The exams are fair, and class is worth going to.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is disciplined enough to do the work without any assessment.",
    "If interested in anything related to France and\/or history, I would recommend this course. Merriman is an enthusiastic professor and really knows his stuff.",
    "I think I missed the charm of this course. While it's a very light workload (a midterm, a paper, and an oral final that takes 10 minutes), I would not say it's worth it. I was disappointed in Prof. Merriman's lectures. As a historian and author with serious name recognition, I was hoping for something more, but the class comes off Merriman's poorly-organized ramblings on French history. I found that much of my learning came from the readings (mostly textbooks until he assigns entire novels), though even after taking the final, I only have the loosest of grasps on what actually happened in the period 1830-1871. If you're interested in learning a lot about French history, I'd skip this class; there are better courses offered by the history department.",
    "This class is incredibly engaging. Professor Merriman is amazing, and is really passionate about the subject matter and his students, and France in general! An amazing lecture for both non-history majors and history majors. A must take.",
    "Yes. If you want to take a history class for the humanities credit or just because it's interesting, this is perfect.",
    "Merriman is a great lecturer, and the readings are interesting and capture mid-1800s France in an incredibly dark but entertaining way. Take this course if you'd like to understand how a country can transform from feudalism to socialism over the course of a century- from a social history perspective.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student, most likely if they were interested in studying history. This course involves a very specific time frame in a very distinct region of the world so it must be a subject matter that a person is interested in if I were to suggest taking the course. Overall, Professor Merriman does a fantastic job of making the lectures interesting and engaging and in that sense I do think any other student at Yale would enjoy the course.",
    "French Rev with Merriman is a Yale classic. Merriman is a really interesting lecturer, if a little all over the place. I would say his weakness is he knows the material too well and sometimes forgets to highlight the obvious parts of the history. His books are excellent but some of the other books are mediocre and too dense. They could use refreshing and he knows it. Overall, I would strongly recommend this course. The oral final option is especially great and really allows you to engage with the TA.",
    "Absolutely, Merriman is the man.",
    "10\/10 would take again. Amazing course with amazing professor.",
    "If you don't have any background in French history, I would probably not recommend this course. However, if you enjoy social history and the French Revolution, this class is great. Merriman is an enjoyable lecturer and class was always fun.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned so much about France that I'm able to apply to other areas of history as well. It was an engaging course with an engaging professor.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students because it is an interesting subject and Professor Merriman is a great professor.",
    "I would recommend this to someone looking for a fifth class",
    "Without a doubt! Super important period, and Merriman might be the best prof I've had.",
    "Knowledge I learned was specific but extremely interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. The content is extremely interesting and engaging, and Professor Merriman is one of the most inspiring and entertaining people I have met. A truly amazing course with an outstanding professor.",
    "I would recommend this course as a good humanities credit to students who need the distribution requirement. It is a relatively easy workload, but it is not boring and the material is interesting. One has a lot of creative and intellectual freedom with the paper, so you can work as little or as hard as want. I believe that there are probably more interesting and engaging history lectures for people in the major though.",
    "John Merriman is among the best professors at Yale and my personal favorite. I couldn't speak highly enough of him and the course.",
    "Social, intellectual, and cultural history of France from 1789-1871. Tons of interesting material covered. Merriman assigns manageable reading and allows pleasant flexibility for the paper topic. One of the most brilliant historians of France and Europe alive today.",
    "Take it to establish a better understanding of France during some of the most tumultuous years and how the effect still lingers in modern-day society.",
    "Prof. Merriman is a fantastic lecturer and deeply passionate. Take it."
