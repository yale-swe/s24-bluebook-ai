   "comments": [
    "Knowledge about contemporary Japan, Japanese culture, society, behavior, norms etc.",
    "I developed valuable writing skills. I developed a more concise and coherent writing style. I learned a great deal about Japanese culture and history.",
    "I really loved this class because I felt like I was getting a much more nuanced understanding of Japan.",
    "I have learning how to write better. I have also learned a tremendous amount about modernity in Japan with a good historical overview as to why and how Japan is in its state bar it is in today. I also, got to understand race relations in East Asia a lot better.",
    "I loved this class because it was a great introduction to Japanese society from an anthropological lens. It was great for someone like me, without formal knowledge on Japan. I also learned a great deal about anthropological methods like ethnography; the midterm paper was a great way to explore this. Also, I really liked the scope of topics that this class covered, I found myself always being able to compare what we were learning about in class to another class or even to my daily life in American society.",
    "Knowledge about various facets of Japanese society and their evolution throughout time. How to write clearly.",
    "Basic understanding of what a study of a group of people is like. Good foundation for the anthropology of Japan.",
    "I learned important tools\/ways of thinking in sociology\/anthropology as well as some of the important questions that they're interested in. I gained a much deeper understanding of many facets of Japanese life, which I came into the class having no prior understanding of.",
    "This course is great for those who are interested in learning more about the field of anthropology. After taking this course, I have a better understanding of what this field actually is.",
    "Informed about how misconceptions arise and can affect culture Thoroughly examined cause and effect chain leading to current situations Learned how to assess texts within differing contexts and perceptions",
    "How to write clear, concise essays.",
    "I learned SO much about Japanese society in this course. I learned to consider historical factors in shaping current trends.",
    "This is the best class I've taken at Yale. Thanks to Prof. von Baeyer's amazing teaching and feedback, my writing and critical discussion skills improved. Class debates, essays, film responses, and lectures were all amazing learning experiences. The lectures were unbelievably interesting, and I actually looked forward to all of the homework readings.",
    "I learned key ideas in anthropology both in terms of theory and methodology by looking at the example of modern Japanese society. Specifically, we learned ways in which the spheres of family, work and education has been changing and practiced writing."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - incredibly interesting material ; readings are extremely well handpicked and the professor is truly an amazing, very engaging lecturer whose knowledge depth about Japan is unparalleled. It is also a writing credit and it actually (unlike other WR courses I've taken at Yale) improves your writing due to the sheer number of writing assignments there are, but also because the professor makes you submit a rough draft before every assignment is due, which really helps (both in terms of improving\/reworking your writing and in terms of organizing yourself and avoiding writing your paper the night before) Weaknesses - none that I can think of ; a lot of assignments (short paper, midterm paper, final paper, 4 film responses plus bi-weekly questions you have to post online) but it is all well worth it and doesn't even feel like a lot given how interesting the material is.",
    "Strengths: This course offers a great deal of information about Japanese society, a lot of which is very interesting. Its workload is completely reasonable, and students are guaranteed to learn something from every lecture. Weaknesses: None.",
    "This is a wonderful class, no improvements necessary.",
    "Strengths: The Professor is engaging and the material is new but manageable to understand. Weakness: hard to hear classmates at times in class",
    "Strengths: Professor LeBaron von Baeyer gave incredibly helpful advice on my writing! And if I was ever confused about something, she was always accessible by office hours or email. I also liked the class size (my semester was like 20ish students) because it meant that Professor LeBaron von Baeyer could lecture when needed but the size was small enough that we could still ask questions or participate in a discussion\/debate. I also love the draft system in this class! Basically you are given a hard deadline for a draft that Professor LeBaron von Baeyer provides comments on, and gives you a grade for that would be the grade if it was the final version, but if you improve on the draft and make all the changes, you can expect an increase in one or two letter grades following the draft. Weaknesses: I wish there was more emphasis on writing style\/methods, before the drafts are due. Professor LeBaron von Baeyer gives great comments on your drafts, but I wish there was more discussion on the writing style before even the drafts are due.",
    "Strengths: Clear feedback from the professor on writing assignments. Weaknesses: More discussions could be held among students during class time. The length of reading assignments can be shortened.",
    "Everything about this class is fairly reasonable. The only thing I would change is the page-limit requirement to a word count requirement on the longer essays.",
    "Professor LBVB really knew what she was talking about and came into the class very well-prepared for lectures. She explained things clearly and structured the class well to cover a different facet of Japanese society every class, while also introducing some elements of sociology that though which we could look at the topics discussed. This class isn't the best for really improving your writing skills, though, as you don't receive a lot of feedback or any workshops. It is the class to take if you want a semi-easy writing credit that you can also learn a lot from! You do have to be prepared to do 60\/70 pages of reading per class, however, or else you won't get much out of the disucssion.",
    "Discussion sections (small group) to facilitate conversation",
    "The writing assignments are very helpful, especially because there are mandatory drafts. The class could potentially be improved through standardizing discussion and lecture. Some days are all discussion while others are all lecture.",
    "The readings were very interesting, although some of the more economics-based ones were pretty dry.",
    "I thought this course was absolutely perfect.",
    "This course was excellent - no changes needed!",
    "The course encourages student participation by requiring the students to post discussion questions on readings before each class. The course is structured very coherently and the readings explore different aspects of each topic, while also allowing for synthesis between readings. The learning is supported by a wide range of material such as readings, film responses, a choice of creative writing assignment, research project and presentation."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, a million times. You will learn a lot and you will LOVE the readings--they are fantastic!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor is very kind, and grading is completely reasonable. As long as you read the assigned readings and pay attention in class, you are guaranteed to succeed. The workload is completely manageable. You will get a lot of feedback on every assignment you turn in so you will know exactly how to improve it.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class. The material and the readings are so interesting, and you can see the care that went into selecting them. Both the midterm paper and final were enjoyable to write, with a lot of freedom given to topic selection. Everything from the films to the readings, I really felt like it was a nuanced presentation of the material.",
    "I have already been telling students about this course because it a an incredible way to begin learning about Japan or anthropology, and he Professor makes this very fascinating material intellectually challenging but also acessible.",
    "Very much so! This was easily my favorite class of the semester. Very much accessible if you do not have ANY prior background knowledge on Japan. Great for all types of majors, even STEM majors.",
    "This was the first Anthropology course I took at Yale, and it definitely exceeded my expectations. It was a very enjoyable class. I would definitely recommend it to other students, especially those who need a fun writing credit.",
    "If you have any interest in the anthropology of Japan, then absolutely. Even if you don't, the class is still very, very interesting. The readings are picked well and discussions are insightful. The professor is also very nice and helpful. Only gripe is the page requirements for the mid-term and final essays, but it's nothing much. Seriously, how a nation can go from complete poverty to one of the world's leading economies to now an above-average economy is so interesting. The shifts in mindset of people of different generations is very eye-opening.",
    "Absolutely! Take this class if you want to learn more about anthropology or Japan (and especially if you don't know anything about either, like I did!). Professor LBVB really knows her stuff and is a great lecturer. I think what really makes this course great, as compared to an introductory survey course in the social sciences, is that you learn what anthropology is and gain that perspective, but then you also get to see how it's applied directly to study all these different aspects of a country. So you leave really knowing what the field is about and what they do. Also, Japan is really cool!",
    "Anyone interested in finding out what constitutes Japan",
    "Yes, this course was great from a non-major perspective.",
    "Definitely! You learn a ton about Japanese culture all while improving writing skills.",
    "Yes, it was a fun and interesting course that touched many aspects of Japanese society and history.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. SO GOOD. SARAH IS AMAZING!",
    "I would recommend this course to all Yale students -- both writing development and content are excellent.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in gaining a broad understanding of the modern Japanese society and how it is changing. The course is very well taught and the readings provide very interesting material!"
