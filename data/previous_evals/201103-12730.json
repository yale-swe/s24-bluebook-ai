   "comments": [
    "Good choice for a biology lab. Lab reports are long but there is only one every two or three weeks",
    "As far as bio labs go, this is one of the best. The work is very spaced out: a lab report every two weeks and four quizzes. Unlike other labs though, you actually have to think about your results; it's not just robotic directions followed by a summary of what you did. It's like controlled research.",
    "It was informative and added a lot to the class. It's the only lab I've actually thoroughly enjoyed. Lab was often short and relaxed. The lab reports are every other week, and long (they take 3-8 hours - 2 of the 6 reports took a very long time, and they rest were pretty relaxed).So, it ends up being quite a bit of work on write-ups (but less than most labs). None of the work is stressful and lab itself is fun and relaxed.",
    "Definitely recommend it.",
    "No, unless you really like drosophila fruit flies and scoring hundreds of them under the microscope for hours.",
    "It's a good lab to take along with the Genetics course if you need a lab. It's not difficult to get into and labs are only due every other week, although they take a really long time to write up.",
    "One of the best labs you will take at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class while taking genetics. It's a good way to see the concepts from lecture in a lab format. The sections are small, so it's pretty laidback. The lab reports take some time (one due every other week), but the TAs are really helpful during lab and when answering any questions. You'll feel that you have a betterunderstanding of genetics for sure after taking the lab.",
    "Not a bad lab, although the grading is MUCH different than any other lab I have taken.",
    "During the course of the term, this course was the bane of my existence (the lab reports take A LOT of time and require a lot of thinking), but looking back now, I see that I learned a lot and I'm really glad I took it. It is the only lab course at Yale I have taken that really forces you to think and understand what you are doing instead of blindly following directions in the lab manual.The experiments were interesting and I liked how we spent a few weeks on each model organism. The lab also really helped my understanding of the lecture course because I saw how the concepts were applied.The sections were small, partly because a lot of people dropped the class, so by the end of the term my section had six people, which was great because we got more personalized feedback from the Professor.Basically, take it if you are interestedin genetics, want to get to know the professors, and have the time to write the lab reports.",
    "This is a good lab to expose you to writing lab reports and working with model organisms. I would recommend taking it.",
    "yes if you want a interesting, introductory lab with not a lot of reading outside class and a really chill atmosphere",
    "It's a bio lab of moderate difficulty. The lab reports are fairly straightforward, if sometimes lengthy. Best to work on them as early as possible, but for those like me, a day before is doable (except the fly lab). If you're taking the Genetics class concurrently, it'll probably help you out quite a bit.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who has not taken a biology lab before. Since I had never take a bio lab before this the first time I was able to apply what I had learned in lecture in the lab. Most of the labs were simple but interesting. I really liked the last lab where we got to transform bacteria and then run their DNA through a gel to see if we were successful. The only tedious lab was the Drosophila one where we spent a lot of time just scoring fly phenotypes. Professor Dawson is a really good professor. He is always good at answering questions during lab and the TA's are very helpful as well. There are 6 lab reports. 5 of them are 1500 words and one of them is 3000 words. And there are 4 pop quizes. I found the lab grading to be kind of tough but my TA gave back useful constructive feedback.",
    "Great - you should take it.",
    "Definitely take this course if you are taking the lecture. The lab material complements the lecture material superbly. When the genetics final comes around and you are wishing you had studied more... fear not. You can draw on your genetics lab experience. It will save you.The class is also fun. I had a wonderful TA, which always helps, but I loved the professor and I found working with the model organisms enjoyable. The flies are great!Be warned that the lab reports are long, boring and joyless... but you'll be thankful later that you did them.",
    "Great lab. I personally recommend it as one of the two labs to take for the MCDB major. The course is excellent for the following reasons:1. The course is very well organized. The handouts are detailed and well written and the experiments are designed to let you get out at a reasonable time (at most by 5:30 pm, most around 4:00 pm).2. The instructors are great and they really care about your progress in the lab. Professor Dawson gives a good lecture at the beginning of the lab that discusses past results and introduces the new lab, helping you understand the content of the experiments.3. The lab reports are reasonable. We had 1500 word limit on our reports, preventing them from becoming too long and laborious.In short, a great lab.",
    "Hard, kind of boring, but useful. I'm a junior and it was my first bio lab (I'm a bio major), but it was better than physics lab and orgo lab. Take it to learn about some cool stuff, but be prepared to spend some time figuring out how to write the discussion. Dawson is cool, but make sure that you get Pam Chan as your TA. She is the best!!",
    "Most definitely. Not too much work outside of lab (I mean, the reports can be long, but you almost always have 2 weeks to do them), and in class, you actually learn things and can enjoy the non-stressful environment (unlike, say, Orgo or Gen Chem lab).",
    "The experiments were interesting, but the lab reports were terribly long and complicated and the grading of the lab reports was very harsh. The lab quizzes, which were supposed to be generally about the techniques being used, were often very detailed an nitpicky and nearly impossible to do well on.",
    "My favorite lab at Yale so far. Better than orgo and physics labs, but it's the only bio lab I've taken so I can't compare to those.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to. It's not awful, but labs are tedious (you'll spend a lot of time staring at flies through a microscope), and you have a lab report due every other week and four pop quizzes throughout the semester. If you have to take it, then take it concurrently with genetics lectures, because the only good thing about this lab is that it teaches you the concepts pretty well. I learned complementation testing and chi squared testing much better through lab than through class.",
    "The class was a lot of work, and each lab report is worth a lot, so messing up on one of them tended to make it difficult to do well. The labs themselves were relatively fun and you learn a lot about how research in a genetics lab works. I would recommend taking genetics lab, but definitely not simultaneously with other time consuming courses because the writeups take A LOT of time.",
    "I really enjoyed the actual lab time. Lab quizzes are usually hard and difficult to predict\/study for. Lab reports are due about every two weeks. This seems nice, but it actually made them very difficult to write because they covered so much information from so long ago. It's very important to take good, organized notes in lab. I found the professors and TAs really knowledgeable and helpful."
