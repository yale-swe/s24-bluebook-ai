    "LOTS OF READING. Awesome professor and really interesting topic. If you haven't thought about race, but really want to engage with it critically take this class.",
    "I would recommend this course. If you're ready for it. If you're thinking about taking this course, you probably should have felt or thought about in some way, a range of subjects regarding race and want new challenging perspectives. I promise that you will come out with so much more in your analytical and linguistic arsenal than you ever thought was necessary.",
    "Take this class, AFAM major or not if it is taught by Feimster. She is the best, the class has insightful and meaningful discussion, and it will change how you look at and talk about race. The best. It is alot of work as a WR but well worth it.",
    "Absolutely! Take it. Feimster is a boss.",
    "I would recommend AFAM 410, because you learn valuable tools and a clear theoretical framework for discussing race and racism in the United States. The people in the class are awesome, and I feel that I definitely got a lot out of my experience.",
    "This class is a thorough introduction to questions of race in America. You cover theory, history, and (some) objects of popular culture. Professor Feimster is an talented and devoted teacher and thinker; she gave me a vocabulary to talk about race and to situate myself and my experience in our broader racial structures. I'm immensely grateful for having taken her course and would recommend it to everyone."
