   "comments": [
    "So many skills and insights! This was a totally different way to think about writing, arranging and telling a story. I had gotten fantastic training about how to do this in print from previous writing classes I had taken at Yale, but this was the first time I started to think about those same skills and strategies and how they would translate to an auditory medium, and it was so interesting and enlightening.",
    "My radio skills had some dramatic improvement, mostly thanks to the personal dive into a journalistic venture.",
    "How to cut and edit tape, how to put together different stories and form a cohesive narrative",
    "Reporting, mostly. What goes into a good podcast and how to structure it. also about a lot of cool things on campus that my classmates made episodes on and that I didn't know!",
    "Became very good at managing audio, working with interviews, and creating a coherent final product.",
    "I knew next to nothing about audio journalism\/storytelling. This class got me thinking about how crafting an audio narrative\/story might differ\/be the same as crafting a narrative for a written piece. I grew as a storyteller through the radio pieces we listened to and the essays we read. On a more practical level, I learned how to use Audacity - which has already proved helpful in terms of sound editing.",
    "I learned a ton about how radio works and how to make good radio content.",
    "This course provided a great intro to long-form radio\/podcast journalism. I learned a lot about interviewing, structuring pieces, audio editing, and what makes radio good. Most of all, the course provided the opportunity to work on one long piece.",
    "Put simply, I learned how to make a quality podcast. This class offered me equipment to use, templates to follow, techniques to employ, and, perhaps most importantly, space in which to test out ideas and receive brutally honest feedback. My love for and knowledge of the podcasting medium blossomed among a group of more than a dozen creative, devoted, and persistent classmates, from whom I learned how to give meaningful feedback.",
    "This course featured a good balance of the history and theory of radio storytelling and practical experience. You get both a chance to listen to and discuss excellent audio storytelling, and try your hand at it yourself. A great chance to develop your technical skills in recording and producing audio content."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think we should have had more outside work and exercises. A few practice assignments to get us used to tricks of audio editing and cutting tape would have helped us better with our final project. And I would have liked a few story writing assignments to get us practiced on how to arrange the story of our final podcast.",
    "The course would do well in having people take on roles even earlier during the semester so things don't have to finalized when things come down to the wire. It also do well in setting a few guidelines on the need to be reflective and critical during edits. Other than that, I have never had as much fun and pride in a course as much as this one.",
    "It was honestly amazing to be able to take a journalism form that I admire and be able to create my own piece. I loved how the class was discussion based and we got to learn from ours peers.",
    "Listening to more classic podcasts and dissecting what made them great was extremely helpful, since I don't think anyone came in with a whole lot of podcast experience. However, some earlier deadlines would have been way more work for us but also would have resulted in better end products, I feel.",
    "Awesome course. Cool reading\/listening, good class community, fun final project, and good low pressure opportunities for feedback. Visiting speakers were great too. I wish two things were changed: 1. The final project should not be Yale-specific. I found it kind of self-indulgent and annoying as is. I didn't like the obsession with making it a real thing out in the world either. 2. A little more structure earlier in the semester. Maybe two two minute projects and a 10-15 min final project rather than a 15-25 minute final project.",
    "Very enjoyable, free-flowing, and engaging. Students have a lot of independence to create their own episodes.",
    "I really loved the listening that accompanied this class, and the freedom to focus on one story for the entire semester made the class fulfilling at the same time that it was very manageable, as you could work on the story on your own time. That said, I wish there were more solid benchmarks throughout the term, and more specific editing assignments. When it came time to put my piece together, I had very little technical understanding of how to score my piece, and wish I had had more opportunities throughout the term to practice.",
    "The discussions were often tedious and no one knew when to stop talking. I guess that's what happens when you let future podcasters into a small three hour seminar. The homework is fun, though, the best. Listening to the pods and reading the essays made the class the best one I took all semester. Mark is clearly smart and knows his stuff, and it's cool to work on one project for the whole semester.",
    "The strongest aspect of this course was the workshop format. Comments from my professor and from classmates really improved my work. My main problem with the course was that it was so unstructured. We were expected to learn how to produce a 20min+ radio piece on our first go, which I think proved to be too ambitious. I think more structure would have been better. Had we worked on a few shorter pieces, we could have had more opportunities to improve incrementally.",
    "This course was amazing. Its main strengths included the peopleProfessor Oppenheimer clearly knows what he's doing, and my classmates consistently surprised me with their tenacity and creativityand the podcast exampleslistening to some of the best that Radiolab and This American Life had to offer was immensely useful in developing my own voice and editing style. In addition, the professional orientation of the course, which shone through during our collaborative edits and interviews with producers, ensured that the class was both unique and directly beneficial for my professional life. The only weakness I can think of was our reading of Death of a Pirate. It was a really interesting book, but I don't think anything in its 300 pages helped much with developing my final podcast.",
    "My main recommendation for this class would be to include one or two shorter, lower-stakes projects earlier in the class, probaby during the part where we are reading, listening and discussing professionals' work, to give people a chance to try putting a small story together. I think it would be helpful to try doing a 3-5 minute piece first, so that by the final project people have a bit of experience and ideally some feedback on stylistic things."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!!! Such a unique, cool experience. Mark is amazing, and your classmates will likely be too. Making a podcast is such a distinct type of work that I'm not used to at Yale, and it was such a stimulating project to work on!",
    "Do not take this course unless you are willing to commit to producing an incredible story. It is only fair to the other students and Mark if you are 100% committed because this is not a class but a team effort.",
    "Yes definitely would recommend. A unique and incredible way to learn about radio journalism from an incredible professor",
    "I mean, it's podcasts. With Mark Oppenheimer. If you like either of those things, this is the course for you! If you like both those things, drop everything right now and apply for it. I mean, you just listen to podcasts, talk about why they're good, and then make one yourself. How much better could it get?",
    "I would recommend this class! You learn a lot about podcasts, and surprisingly are very capable of making your own by the end of it. Not only teaches you about podcasts but about story structure in general. Different from any course I've taken at Yale- in a good way! Not too many assignments other than listening to good podcasts until the final project, which was really rewarding to produce. Highly recommend!",
    "This isn't really a course. It doesn't have any structure or way to build up work or skills.",
    "Yes! But only if you're excited about the final project.",
    "Take it if you get in! It's a wonderful adventure of a course.",
    "This is a chance to create a podcast series with a group of Yale students and a professor who loves Yale and loves radio and is passionate about bringing these two things together. The course is going to certainly change from year to year as Mark finds new ways to incorporate professional from the radio\/podcast industry, and develops new\/improved ways to structure the course (this was its first year) - but you get to listen to\/discuss great pieces of radio journalism, your learn basic sound-design\/editing techniques, and you have the liberty to pursue a story of your choice for an entire semester (turning it into a 20ish minute episode). If any of this sounds appealing - go for it.",
    "Yeah. Mark can be almost too encouraging sometimes such that you don't get very much feedback, but I genuinely think it's just because he's excited about our projects. The way the class functions is heavily dependent on who's in it, so scout it out during shopping period, but I would definitely recommend taking the class.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in producing long-form radio pieces and has a strong background in journalism.",
    "Take it if you can get into it. It'll improve your writing, public speaking, ability to give and take criticism, and capacity to conceptualize a creative product from beginning to end. This class offered me equipment to use, templates to follow, techniques to employ, and, perhaps most importantly, space in which to test out ideas and receive brutally honest feedback. My love for and knowledge of the podcasting medium blossomed among a group of more than a dozen creative, devoted, and persistent classmates, from whom I learned how to give meaningful feedback. Plus, Professor Oppenheimer is one of the smartest and down-to-earth professors I've had at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course. Podcasting Workshop can take pretty much as much work as you are willing to put into it, but remember you are making a product which will be available externally, so probably only take if you are committed to making a polished final product. I enjoyed the course, and the amount of input students had in designing the direction of the project."
