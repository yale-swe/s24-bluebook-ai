   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the class, I don't regret taking it, and I would definitely recommend it to another student, especially because of the professor.",
    "Basically we just have weekly discussions on a topic, and there isn't much else to it. It's a pretty laid back class.",
    "Students take turn leading lecture every week. The subject of this class is inherently interesting, and probably one of the most useful classes I\u0092ve taken at Yale in terms of changing my perspective on how I view the world versus how I think I view the world. You\u0092ll feel infinitely wiser if you take this class seriously (perhaps not so much in the academic sense, but more so for your own well being in life).",
    "great class; relevant and thought-provoking",
    "One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. A great seminar with really good discussions, and a very manageable workload (with reading you'll WANT to read, and therefore WILL read (more of)). Incredibly interesting topics in modern psychology, dealing with the self. Some neuroscience background is helpful, to keep straight all the regions of the brains the studies bring up. And you'll also discuss how to lead a better life and maybe even come away with some new life perspectives. Plus you get to meditate, which I recommend you do even if you don't take this class. But you should take this class.",
    "I would definitely recommend Meditation and Self-Regulation to students interested in neuroscience. The seminar is mostly student led and laid back. The discussions are generally very good because students are able to bring in their own personal knowledge and research background to answer questions. The reading each week was interesting and not too overwhelming.",
    "If you're interested in meditation, this class provides a wonderful opportunity to deepen your understanding, from a scientific perspective. You read some of the most important papers on mindfulness and meditation.",
    "I found the subject very interesting, and Jeremy does a good job of making it accessible to everybody. The class's format is a bit static, and I would have liked to hear much more input from Jeremy, as he is so knowledgeable. He seemed to be hiding his knowledge from us by letting us do most of the talking. The workload consists of one presentation (i.e. teaching one of the classes) and a final 20ish page research paper with a flexible self-imposed deadline.",
    "Definitely take it, it was a great experience and I came out of it with more than just theoretical knowledge. I definitely appreciate the practice of meditation more, and it's a great way to combine science and spirituality."
