    "only 4 homework assignments, one final project idea presentation (5 mins), and a final project",
    "The nonparametric course was both interesting and engaging. The material was interesting and Professor Zhang did a great job of presenting and explaining it.",
    "The course topics are useful and cutting edge. It involves methods widely used in different areas. But I prefer the instructor to give more details of methods discussed in the course.",
    "The content covers the majority of modern nonparametric techniques, and the designated textbooks are great resources. However, I don't think the course fulfills its goal, if it has a clearly-defined goal at all. It seems to me that, instead of finding a good balance between theoretical and practical aspects of the methods, it wildly oscillated between the two extremes. I don't think students coming out of the course would have the deep theoretical understanding that the lectures and homework sometimes tried aiming at. Nor would they have enough confidence to comfortably put those methods into use, because there was almost no training provided by this course in that aspect. In general, I am pretty disappointed by this course, and I benefited from it a lot less from other statistics classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "The lectures were very helpful and it is useful to have the lecture slides before hand. There are several very interesting and useful topics covered in this class.",
    "Very helpful, especially the project.",
    "This course talks about nonparametric identification like kernel, splines, tree-based methods. It is a very useful course and we can apply directly what we learn into our research. Although this course covers the asymptotic property of kernel regression, the pace of this course is too slow and we only introduce some topics and idea. This course is more like machine learning rather than nonparametric identification. I expect this course to be a very rigorous class about nonparametric identification including minimax rate, but unfortunately the course does not cover this broad and rich topic. In addition, the weekly meeting (1 hour and 50 minutes) is not very efficient and productive because every week we only cover small amount of topic. I highly suggest that we could meet twice a week for 1 hour 20 minutes like the class in Statistics Department where class usually meets twice a week. I like the topic of tree-based methods but I think it is redundant and too slow. We spent almost half the semester in tree-based method but it is possible to talk about regression and classification tree in one class.",
    "More organized."

However, I don't think the course fulfills its goal, if it has a clearly-defined goal at all. It seems to me that, instead of finding a good balance between theoretical and practical aspects of the methods, it wildly oscillated between the two extremes.

Nor would they have enough confidence to comfortably put those methods into use, because there was almost no training provided by this course in that aspect. In general, I am pretty disappointed by this course, and I benefited from it a lot less from other statistics classes I have taken at Yale. I particularly find the homework assignments of this course of very little help. Also, the instructor picked course materials from many different textbooks, which is fine. However, he did not provide clear information on which parts of those book best correspond with his lectures, which made self-study very difficult.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The instructor was excellent in explaining methods and ideas!",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Prof. Zhang's lectures were very clear and having lecture notes beforehand was helpful in focusing on listening to the professor rather than writing down things.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Excellent instructor. Very good to students.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Good teacher",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0The professor is very knowledgeable and good at explaining. He cares about his students and supervises us to choose a good research topic for our term paper. He is patient about our questions. He will write notations in blackboard for us to understand better about the material.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Good at explain things in a very intuitive way.",
    "Instructor: Heping Zhang \u00a0Professor Zhang explains concepts very clearly. I think his explanations are intuitive, and he's great at pointing out what is most important in each lecture. I also liked that he emphasized being an active, critical thinker and understanding the reasoning behind each method, instead of focusing on details in the math. The lectures are engaging, too, because Professor Zhang is very funny. Overall, I really enjoyed the lectures in this course."

   "comments": [
    "this course is for those who have been already familiar with a majority of parametric methods, and for those who have research topic that is correlated\/involved with nonparametric methodologies",
    "This course is very helpful. However, if you want to grasp the knowledge of the course thoroughly, you need to do your own homework besides the assigned load.",
    "There is probably no good alternatives offered by Yale on a relatively practical nonparametric statistics class (the one by the stats department is way too theoretical for someone what just want to learn new ways to analyze his\/her data), but it is not a good course itself. I would be cautious in recommending it to another student, for the reasons I listed above in Questions 6-7.",

    "This course goes through non parametric methods. It is a very challenging course but you will learn a lot.",
    "The course is very intuitive. Maybe we can have more homework with application focus not theoretical focus."
