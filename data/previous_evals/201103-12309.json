   "comments": [
    "YES! Take this course, it will open your eyes to a whole new world and teach you invaluable lessons about yourself, your peers, and your environment.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone, potential Art major or not, who wants to learn how to use a dSLR. Of course, a potential student should be prepared to purchase said camera.",
    "You learn about photography, and you apply it in the digital age. You take a ton of pictures based on the assignment, and you go through a selection process, then you edit, then you print, then you present them to your class in a critique, and you learn more, and thenyou do it again. It's personalized and rich with new ideas - you learn from your classmates, from your professor, and from the work of past great photographers. You get out of it what you put into it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It can be a lot of work at times, but the tangible skills learned are some of the most valuable I have learned here.",
    "yes absolutely. it's not a gut, but it's a very different kind of work from reading and papers, so it feels like a break. really interesting and fun, and awesome skill to have.",
    "A useful blend of how to create photographs technically and reasons why you, personally, should make photos. Overall, it was a good experience, a good introduction to the field and possibilities of digital. Dru is more traditional in her approach to learning photography and composition, but I think that's a good thing. She wants to build a compositional foundation in color and pictorial space. She doesn't rush it, that's key.",
    "Good if you want to learn digital photo. the quality of the course is dependent on your investment, there are a lot of different reasons to take digital photo, so i guess your experience could vary.",
    "I was really interested in learning more about digital photography, and Art 138 02 really gave me that introduction. I was worried that we were going to spend the whole time doing weird photoshop affects, like changing the colors to be wacky. You could probably do that with the skills you learned in the class, but thats certainly not the point. Instead, you learned how to edit the color in the image to make better contrast, clearer prints, and more vivid colors -- although within the scope of a photo that looks \"naturally\" taken. You also learn how to make black and white prints near the end of the class.I dont think I was quite prepared for the amount of time that printing would take -- its quite an intensive process (4 minutes \/ print plus editing the picture). So make sure you have time in your schedule for the course. Its less work then black and white from what I can see.If you like a ton of structure and want to always know what you are supposed to be doing, dont take this class. If there are projects you are passionate about that you want to explore and want feedback from the teacher throughout the course, take this course. The teacher, Dru, will put in a ton of extra work to students that want to put lots of effort into the course -- she's great.Katie Koti, the TA, has really awesome work if you are interested in landscape or representations of gender\/sexuality. At the same time, she can be very difficult to get a hold of.",
    "Awesome intro to the art of photography. Dru is a boss. So helpful and encouraging and insightful with her feedback. The crits were solid, and class was suuuuper chill. If you want to take a great photo class at a very manageable pace, this is it, and Dru's for you. Head's up -- this is an art class, not a photoshop primer, though you do get very familiar with photoshop, bridge, and printing.",
    "I took this class expecting to learn a lot about the technique of taking photographs. Though we did receive a bit of direction in that area at the start of the class, I found the emphasis on taking images in sets or with similar themes that could then be shown together to be a bit limiting and, ultimately, quite frustrating. I would have liked for there to have been a bit more discussion about the history of photography and the methods related to composition and exposure. But all in all, this was a wonderful course that provided a great break from my more rigorous academic classes.",
    "Yes. Definitely, you will need to work for it, but it is fun!",
    "I really enjoyed this course. It was the perfect introduction to digital photography. I learned how to use all of the functions on my camera and I learned the basics of editing through Photoshop. The projects pushed me to photograph new things and they were spaced out well to allow enough time to really experiment and produce an end result that I was proud of. I would highly recommend this class to everyone. Knowing how to produce a beautiful digital photo will come in very useful in life!",
    "This is a really fun course and I would definitely recommend taking it. It is not really any work because all of the assignments are fun and the critiques are not high pressure at all.",
    "Take it. If you have a busy semester, then only take it for credit, but its very worth it -take it! Don't be put off by the fact you need to buy or get a camera (if you don't already have one), think thats its probably a better investment then a textbook you will never open again."
