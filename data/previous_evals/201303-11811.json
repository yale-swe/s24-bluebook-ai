   "comments": [
    "Good drawing class for beginners. No previous drawing experience required, weekly assignments. Assignments tended to become more time consuming as the semester went on, but the assignments were fair. We would draw pretty much all class, which was good practice and also relaxing. I would recommend this class.",
    "This is a great course; while it is a \"basic\" drawing course, it is also an intensive drawing course. Time in the classroom will be spent largely learning by actually drawing; the course highly experiential in its style. Homework will also be a major time commitment (approx. 8 hours a week). Highly suggest this course.",
    "Basic Drawing w\/ Villalongo is a pretty good course. You spend the first half of the course doing pretty standard line drawings of various still lifes of different figures (prisms, spheres, cylinders). The later half of the course involves more creative independence - for instance, there's an assignment in which you have to render a word such as \"cut\", \"scratch\", \"tear\", etc. - it's a lot of fun to figure out how to render your word and see how others approach theirs. The way actual classes work: Tuesdays consist of posting up your homework and critiquing everyone's work followed by drawings; Thursday's are pretty much entirely devoted to doing drawings of a still life in the center of the classroom. Homework is usually 2-3 drawings and it's always due on Tuesday. The class ends with a large-scale final project: it's pretty demanding but you have a lot of freedom with what you do. If you're looking for a challenging but fun art class, I'd highly recommend. Do NOT expect this to be an easy, gut class - that's not what this is about.",
    "Half studio time, half critiques of homework assignments, and keeping a sketchbook throughout. Steady assignments all along, with a final push towards more creative work at the end. All in all, there was a good blend of structure and freedom.",
    "Easy class. Great insight into basic art. Stimulate creativity and alters visual perception of the world.",
    "I learned a lot about basic art drawing skills. I would recommend the course to those who are interested in art and who wish to learn how to appreciate an art piece.",
    "A technique based class that covers all of the basics of mark making including materials like charcoal and ink and techniques like subtractive drawing, mixed media etc. A really great class, it was fun and greatly improved my drawing technique and confidence. Villalongo is a really cool professor.",
    "Good class, Villalongo makes learning the drawing basics very accessible. A lot of work, but worth it!",
    "Definitely recommend. The first half of the semester primarily involves using vine charcoal to draw boxes, cups and other simple geometries. The second half of the semester is more creative."
