    "I liked the lectures, however I think the TA sessions should have included installation of relevant software for completing the homework as well as examples of how to execute an analysis pipeline. Additionally I think the homework should have used datasets less than 1Gb in size because not everybody has access or knowledge to handle such large data for the purposes of a homework assignment. Sometimes a single step of the homework would take at least one day to run, which makes it difficult to learn from or redo any of the steps. If a single step takes a day to run, it is important for us to know how to do each step before beginning the homework, otherwise re-running due to mistakes takes up too much time.",
    "It provides a nice introduction to some newly-developed techniques with associated data in genomics and genetics. It might be better if the instructor could do some hands-on analysis of some of those data together with the students."

    "Instructor: Hongyu Zhao \u00a0The instructor was very good. He focused on the statistical concepts behind many modern methods. I think some examples of applications of tools may have been nice, but it also could have been saved for TA sessions.",

    "I thought Xiaowei was a good TA. She was very nice and provided helpful hints on the earlier homeworks. I think it would have been very helpful to have more of an idea how to complete some of the larger homework assignments involving analysis of sequencing data. As mentioned above, I think there should have been (at a minimum) installation of requisite packages during TA sessions, because having to debug an installation for a day just for a homework assignment is unreasonable. Also learning about the relevant functions in each available package would have been useful because some of us had never seen certain software before.",
    "The TA could help the students to clarify their confusions and help the students to solve the problems in their homework."

   "comments": [
    "I think the course is interesting if you plan to analyze sequencing data in the course of your research. It is mainly for those who value a deep understanding of the underlying statistics of the methods and possibly develop new analytical tools for high throughput data. The homework assignments are a bit unwieldy, I would recommend auditing the course.",
    "This course is worth learning, if you are going to do some research in the area of genomics and genetics, since it provides a clear introduction to the concepts in that area."
