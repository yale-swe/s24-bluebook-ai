    "MUST TAKE CLASS!! Professor Cowles (even if he's still young) is probably the best lecturer I have had in all my years here at Yale. Take it and you won't regret it!",
    "Minds and Brains was a great fifth class. The workload was manageable, with the blog posts not being time consuming. The midterm was a shock due to the amount needed to memorize, but it is a history class so that is understandable. Then with just a final exam, i highly recommend to this to anyone interested in medicine or psychology. Discussion sections switched technique every week with visits to the Med School or activities with candy in order to understand the working of the brain. Dr Cowles is a very captivating professor who keeps it interesting the whole way through the semester.",
    "It's a great class! I would definitely recommend. It contains very interesting and relevant subjects, and Professor Cowles is amazing. There is not too much work involved but instead the readings are enjoyable. Take this class!",
    "A historical review of psychology through the lens of its relationship to culture.",
    "Take this class if you have the chance. Every lecture you will learn something new in an interesting way. Professor Cowles is a wonderful lecturer and the work load is light.",
    "TAKE THIS!!! It's a great course for anyone and everyone, period, but especially for those interested in learning about the history of mental health. The lectures were clear and engaging; the readings were meaningful; and the blog posts were weirdly fun to write. Most importantly, Professor Cowles is an incredible instructor. He is thoughtful, organized, humorous, and responsive. Plus, PSYC 135 a great way to fulfill a HU credit.",
    "Take this class! You will really enjoy it :)",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE",
    "A really cool new way to look at science and medicine for those like me who have never taken an HSHM course. Each lecture was interesting overall, if not the nitty gritty details (which is really the most you can expect from a large intro lecture course). Helped open my eyes to how even our cherished disciplines of academia can be politicized, and be weapons of oppression and stigma. I'm grateful for that knowledge, as it helps me use a critical eye when I examine current debates around mental health, violent tendencies of the disturbed, etc.",
    "Amazing class!! I don't even know where to begin. The materials selected are fascinating by themselves, and Prof Cowles brings them to life through a wonderful mix of primary literature, images, modern movie clips, and comics. This is one of those classes where you fell genuinely gipped if you have to miss class. What's more Prof Cowles is extremely receptive towards feedback - he actively seeks it out, and genuinely listens to it. After the first few weeks of class, he sent out a survey for us to fill out in section which generally requested that he slow down - and he did for the rest of the semester. The second survey (after the midterm) criticized the format of the exam, so he changed it for the final. Overall, a great class with a great professor. Take this class before you graduate.",
    "Minds and Brains follows the history and evolution of the study of the mind and brain. I recommend this class to everyone. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The material is interesting and the pacing of the course is very well managed. Henry Cowles is one of the best professors I've ever had. In his first semester as a lecturer, he managed to convince hundreds of people that he was worth taking a risk on, and it paid off. His lectures exude his passion about the material and kept me engaged for an entire semester. I actually looked forward to going to this class every single time just to hear Professor Cowles speak. His jokes always landed and he made this class extremely enjoyable. I recommend that everybody try to take a course with him.",
    "It's a great class! Professor Cowles is the perfect balance between funny and serious. You don't go very in depth but we cover a large amount of interesting topics.",
    "An overview of the history of psychology, how it relates to modern practices, and the discourses\/controversies that have persisted in the field since its origins. The course is simultaneously theoretical and factual--a great balance of abstract concepts and concrete historical understanding.",
    "I would say that it was a good class that covered a lot of interesting material, but it would have worked better as a seminar, and also if sections had been more connected to the course.",
    "I would recommend this course. It does not require an exceptional amount of work and you will learn a lot from the work you do. It is interesting and might change your perspective about some mental health and social issues.",
    "I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS CLASS! Professor Cowles is an amazing lecturer - he can get a lecture hall of over 400 students engaged and enthusiastic about topics ranging from asylums, psychotherapy, lobotomies, advertisements and psychopharmacology. The content of the class was very interesting, coupled with the dynamic and entertaining lecture style of Professor Cowles made Minds and Brains an incredibly enjoyable and informative class. 10\/10 WOULD RECOMMEND.",
    "An easy and fun course.",
    "This is such a great class. You will learn so much about the history of psychology from the 1800s to the present. If you are interested in mental illness, asylums, phrenology, eugenics, ANYTHING in psych, this a really great class to take it. The professor is AWESOME and the TAs really care about you. I would highly highly recommend. It was my favorite class this semester, maybe even of my whole Yale career!",
    "I would recommend this class to other students.I think the brain is fascinating and this class studies the brain through the lens of history which is not a traditional approach for most psychology classes.",
    "Professor Cowles is a great lecturer and some very interesting topics were covered. The only downfall of this course is that the lectures seemed a bit randomly arranged at times, which I am sure will be fixed in subsequent terms.",
    "fine, take it if you need the requirement",
    "This course is a great overview of different cognitive and mental topics, like asylums, medicine, and lobotomies. It is extremely interesting and Cowles is a great lecturer. TAKE THIS",
    "Great course, highly recommend.",
    "One of the best lectures I've taken in my four years at Yale! It's so well-structured so you're never confused about how one topic relates to another. The themes and subject matter are so interesting and relevant also. This was the first year of the course, so I'm excited to see how Professor Cowles alters the syllabus based on student critiques. Take it if you can!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This is hands down one of the best classes I've taken this semester. If you want to have fun, learn something new and genuinely be engaged in the material, take this class.",
    "Professor Cowles is a wonderful, wonderful teacher. Sometimes his lectures are confusing to go over at home because he makes persuasive arguments that you have trouble connecting the dots for once you're doing it by yourself. The grading is fair, lectures are fascinating, readings are interesting, section is good. Definitely a great, great class!",
    "Minds and Brains in America is a great introduction to the history of psychology and psychiatry in the U.S. It's got a manageable workload: weekly readings, four blog post assignments, a midterm, and a final. Professor Cowles is a good lecturer, and the course is fairly organized. Minds and Brains is a new course, so I'm sure it will keep improving--it improved even while we took it, and Professor Cowles really cares about making it better and better. If you're interested in taking a good intro history or HSHM course, this is certainly a great option.",
    "Damn, was this a fun HSHM course to take. I would recommend any Neurobiology, Neuroscience, or Cognitive Science take this to get a ton of context for their respective fields and how they collaborate and intersect. If you are an HSHM or History major, Prof. Cowles gets you really into the fields and shows you just what a good (and young) historian looks like. I am so glad this course was offered as a lecture but I know it would be even more enlightening if it continued as a seminar. While it's still a lecture, you should take this course and then recommend all your friends to take this course.",
    "I would recommend to a friend! But I also think that the course would be even better in a seminar - for more stimulating discussion. Or at least have the TAs really engaged and have them have some expertise in this field. I understand why they didn't - many of them were signed on last minute, but hopefully in the future, the TAs can be a little more connected with the material and more of a source of expertise.",
    "Interesting class that covers a variety of topics related to psychiatry and mental health. Would recommend as a 5th class or humanities credit.",
    "Great class lectures are interesting, not too much work. Readings can be kind of dry in some weeks, but overall a good class. Exams are a little insane, though.",
    "I would definitely recommend the course because it's a cool way to think about minds and brains and especially how interactions with medicine and science affect how we think about ourselves and those around us.",
    "I thoroughly enjoyed this class. The lectures are extremely engaging, but also very fast-paced. They are also necessary if you want to learn the material. It is a great fifth class and a really good introduction to the history of science.",
    "PSYC 135 is a definitely-take class. I am a STEM major and was just looking for something to fulfill a distributional requirement, but I got so much more than that. Henry Cowles is a new lecturer, but a great one. He makes lectures interesting and also conveys his information well in two 50 minute periods. He is a master of organization and everything connects well to themes that he details throughout the semester. The content is interesting and not difficult to understand. Overall, the work load is pretty light. We had the first year so the work might change, but in our semester it was just 4 small essays, a midterm, and a final. Make sure you like your TA because it makes a difference. I had a bad one and it really did feel like a waste of what could have been an enriching section. Overall, I would definitely take this class again.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! It was one of my favorites at Yale so far. Professor Cowles is great.",
    "I highly recommend this class. I knew nothing about minds or brains before this course but it was by far my favorite course this semester. The lectures are fast paced and engaging. There is minimal outside assignments but you end up learning a lot.",
    "weekly readings + midterm + final + 4 reading responses. the reading responses are not difficult at all -- some can be done in under 2 hours. the readings are really interesting so do not skip out! one of the best parts of the course is the wonderful readings they picked and chose from various sources, many of which are major works. not a super gutty class but definitely also not a super heavy workload. the lectures kind of shape a perspective, though, and keep reinforcing these perspectives and themes. so you really don't need to do as much \"new thinking\" and \"synthesizing\" as you may expect.",
    "If you're looking for an interesting overview of theories of the mind and brain, this is a good class. It doesn't require any prior knowledge of the subject,and prof. cowles is an engaging lecturer. Lectures can move a bit fast, and some of the reading is a bit dry, but overall positive experience.",
    "A class that is a must. Professor Cowles was amazing, the material is addicting, and the history sheds so much light on how hard psychology fought to become a legitimate science. Anyone who has any interest in history, psychology, behavior, people, or the development of science in general, this course is for you. Everything from transorbital lobotomy to a middle-aged Italian woman who talked to ghosts and accidentally revolutionized the scientific method. TAKE THIS COURSE",
    "A very interesting history of science course; learn how to analyze science using historical arguments. Would recommend.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The subject material is just fascinating and Prof. Cowles is an incredibly engaging lecturer. The best thing about this class is that it has thematic continuity; Cowles does a great job linking lectures together to make broader arguments about the course material. I was truly intellectually stimulated and I'd really recommend this course to anyone who's interested.",
    "Take this class. It isn't difficult and is quite interesting. Prof Cowles is a great instructor and I really liked how the slides were set up. This is a great class for anyone (freshman to senior, humanities to STEM) to take.",
    "HIST 118 01 was a course mapping out the history of the mind, the brain, and the difference between the two. I would definitely recommend it to another student, it was a fascinating course and Professor Cowles is a wonderful teacher.",
    "It is a very interesting course that walks you through the history of the mind and the brain which sounds very broad and is very broad and making the connections between now and 1800 techniques to understand the mind is very interesting.",
    "An amazing class for anyone interested in psych.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It is interesting and fascinating, and revealed to me concepts about western psychiatry that I was previously only vaguely aware of. Professor Cowles is an amazing and talented instructor, and I will surely be taking more of his classes in the future.",
    "Going in, I didn't know what to expect from Minds and Brains; however, I truly enjoyed the class. The lectures were incredibly organized and Professor Cowles was receptive to feedback. The workload was manageable (four blog posts) and the exams (a midterm and a final) were fair. Additionally, the actual course content is quite interesting. I highly recommend this course.",
    "this is a good class if you are a psychology\/cog sci person. i am neither of those and thus found it very boring but i know a lot of people liked it.",
    "GREAT CLASS!! I actually looked forward to attending lecture, the workload was light and the material super interesting even though I'm not a humanities person. I didn't even mind taking the final. Definitely recommend! One caveat: blog posts might add more work than you expected.",
    "Minds and Brains is a must take class. Professor Cowles is an amazing professor and a great guy. This is not a class you can pass up on during your undergraduate experience at Yale.",
    "Minds and Brains in America is such a cool ad interesting class that combines psychology and history. Even if you are not interested in either of these fields, the class still talks to many of the topics of the science and medicine of the mind that everyone has dealt with in some way or another. Some topics include asylums, phrenology, lobotomies, neurasthenia, mesmerism, and more! So interesting and Professor Cowles is such an amazing lecturer. His engaging personalty and references to modern day things that every one can relate to (since he is extremely young) make this a must take for any yale student. The course load is also not too bad but the assignments do allow for a student to take the topics they have learned and apply them to many different things while connecting the pieces to see the topic as a whole throughout history,",
    "Recommend it if you're into big, energetic lectures. Take it with friends!",
    "Yes, the class isn't too hard, and isn't too much work. The readings are long and the longer they are the more boring they seem to be, but some of them are great. If this ever becomes offered as a writing credit, take it as a writing credit because the tests are unnecessaryily hard in that he expects you to write much more than you're capable of in a certain amount of time.",
    "This was a great course and really taught me to look at psychology, science, and especially current-day discourse about mental health as a product of circumstances, context, and historical influences. Professor Cowles was a great lecture and such a caring and helpful professor. The plans for section were also a great supplement to class, which is not always the case. The overarching themes were pretty cohesive across the class, though occasionally it seemed like the lectures were structured to perfectly fit a certain somewhat arbitrary structure, simply for the sake of being a neat narrative. I thought this class was very fun, not very stressful, but still thought provoking, I learned a ton, and got a lot out of it.",
    "Take it. Not too much work-- the blog posts are easy, readings are minimal, and tests are not bad. Professor Cowles is a fantastic and engaging lecturer. And whatever your background and interests, this class will find a way to satisfy them.",
    "I would take this, the material is interesting and the teaching is phenom. Be prepared to get angry at cis-gendered straight white males with beards in the 1700s-1900s.",
    "Yeah, take it. It was good. If you can't no sweat, but if you're looking for a fifth class this is interesting and engaging.",
    "This class was very interesting in that it falls into a ton of different categories but overall I would recommend this class to almost anyone because it is applicable to everyone. It focuses on the development of psychological health and knowledge in the United States and is extremely interesting.",
    "I would recommend Minds and Brains to anyone mildly interested in the history of science, medicine, etc. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale and one of the best professors I have had. Tests are fine as long as you keep up with the readings since they tie in really well with the lectures. Take this class!!!!",
    "If you think this course sounds even a bit interesting to you, I highly recommend you take it. It is a fascinating exploration of the historical context of sciences of the mind\/brain over the past two hundred years. Prof. Cowles is enthusiastic and a superb lecturer. This was his first time teaching a lecture course, and he was extremely receptive to student feedback, which will make Minds and Brains even better in subsequent years, I'm sure. Unlike other classes in which, when it comes time to study for the exam, you are left puzzling over textless slides, trying to figure out the meaning behind a mysterious image, Prof. Cowles' slides provide a clear outline of the lecture. The workload for the class is reasonable. Readings are shorter than most history classes, and quite interesting. There are four \"blog post\" assignments, which are essentially 500 word reading responses to supplementary material (an online article or a film). The midterm and final are fairly easy, and the grading is fair. Overall, this is a great course. You'll come out of it with solid knowledge on a wide variety of topics related to the history of minds and brains. If you have the chance, don't miss out on taking this course!",
    "Minds and Brains was a GREAT course. It built the foundation of psych and cogsci from an abstract and concrete perspective. Very well taught. Exams were very hard and expectations were unrealistically high. Readings were long but did not need to be completed in entirety. Highly recommend. Cowles is a boss.",
    "This is an interesting class, and if the topic appeals to you, take the class. But remember that it is a history of medicine class also, which was something that I was not as prepared for.",
    "Great Course! Minds and Brains looked at the different movements and moments in the history of psychology and the boundaries between mind and body, medicine and morality, and science and pseudoscience.",
    "A must take, which is impressive given that this was Professor Cowles' first time teaching it. Despite it being a new class, it filled the Law School auditorium. His lectures are the most organized, thought out, and structured lectures I've experienced. He designs each lecture around a specific topic in minds and brains and presents a thesis related to it. He includes the argument on a slide at the start of each lecture, and breaks each lecture up into either 2 or 3 parts. The material felt disjointed at first, but around halfway through the lecture you start to see common themes pop up that connect the historical trajectory Professor Cowles draws out. He was also really receptive to critique, especially since it was his first time teaching this course. He started out lecturing really fast and after feedback slowed down the pace. The midterm was a bit crazy because he had us memorize the names and dates of images and quotes he included in all of his lectures, but after feedback about that, he changed the exam format for the final, which focused on synthetic themes and significance. Definitely take this class! You'll learn a ton about how ideas about the mind and brain (with a particular emphasis on mental illness) have changed over the past couple of centuries.",
    "Yes!! Definitely a manageable and interesting class. Professor Cowles is wonderful!!",
    "I would definitely recommend the class, it was super interesting and insightful for someone like me who's a pre-med and will be using the tools and techniques that were discussed in lecture.",
    "I highly recommend Minds and Brains. I think it would be valuable for students from many different disciplines, because the material is scientific, medical, and historical. Beyond that, it's just a very interesting class that will really help you understand how we think about the mind and the brain in American society. The readings are good and are relatively short, and you have lots of opportunities through reading, lecture, and the blog posts, to apply the course's themes to present-day issues and debates.",
    "Really interesting course and fair workload",
    "Professor Cowles is literally the best professor I've ever had. He thinks so, so deeply about HOW to teach and does an incredible job at it. In fact, every single Yale professor could learn form Cowles' style. Everything about this class worked -- the incredible quality of the PowerPoints and lectures, Cowles' intelligence and mastery of the subject matter, the interesting nature of the readings, etc. I strongly, strongly urge you to take it! Hands down one of the BEST classes at Yale.",
    "This class has been one of my favorites. Professor Cowles leads a great class filled with lots of fascinating material about America's history with ideologies about the mind\/brian and psychology. The workload is not tough at all; just a few blog post every few weeks and readings to for weekly sections.",
    "lots of interesting lectures on the mind throughout recent history (past ~300 years), great for anyone looking for an easy class that's science history-related",
    "This was an incredible course about the history of psychology and psychiatry. It covered a lot of different topics but connected them with over arching themes and ideas. I would definitely recommend this course to another student.",
    "Great introductory class for psych or history of medicine that is interesting to listen to, with a great professor!",
    "good class for a humanities credit that isn't writing intensive",
    "Would recommend this class if you want an interesting humanities credit that isn't particularly demanding. Could be boring on occasion, but for the most part, was a pretty engaging lecture that I actually wanted to attend.",
    "I would definitely recommend Minds and Brains in America to another student. Minds and Brains in America is a phenomenal course! The course material is all extremely interesting -- and in my opinion, extremely relevant to everyday life and modern concepts of the mind and brain. The course material is taught in an extremely engaging, yet organized, way. I absolutely enjoyed every single lecture and the topics this course had to offer. As a Psychology major, I felt I learned a lot of important lessons about the history underlying my field of study. I especially loved how this courts highlights how our concepts about the mind and brain are fraught in subtle ways with racism and sexism. Professor Cowles is phenomenal. He works hard to plan every single lecture perfectly and truly cares about student feedback. He's a great speaker and truly brilliant -- I loved all of the new perspectives he had to offer. The work load was manageable, yet still challenging, with lots of room for creativity. No weaknesses I can think of -- Cowles always immediately addressed any negative student feedback in his lectures.",
    "Professor Cowles is amazing. He is very intelligent, funny, and cares about conveying his knowledge to students. Overall, the class got to be kind of boring on a day-to-day basis, but looking back at everything we learned, it was an intriguing subject and body of work to study.",
    "Yes. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "It's fine.",
    "I recommend the class. Lectures are entertaining, and the readings are pertinent and of reasonable length. Pay attention to the big themes (the tweets) and see what broader connections you can make.",
    "A cool look at psychology in America through history.",
    "Take this course!!!! If you need a humanities or just want an easy, super interesting class stop looking because this is it. Cowles is an incredible lecturer (proof by the fact that lecture attendance was better than any other class I've taken) and the material is interesting and very relevant to today.",
    "Minds & Brains was an all-around awesome class. It fit perfectly on the axis of what I'm interested in (psychology, philosophy, cog sci, history, medicine, etc), but I think a lot of people who are studying completely different things still found ways to be really engaged in this class. I thought the readings were all fascinating and we got to take a unique and really cool field trip during section to the Yale Medical School. Professor Cowles is adorable and a great lecturer. He really cares about all his students and makes it clear that he wants everyone to succeed and will be there to help in any way he can. He and the TFs are super responsive to feedback and adjusted the style of the class and sections based on our evaluations of them throughout the year. The exams are fair (although you do need to study) and the blog posts are easy and fun to write. Definitely, definitely take this class!",
    "Yes",
    "This class is amazing and everyone should take it if they are interested in psychology, cognitive sciences, history, or history of science and medicine. This class is very cool.",
    "This was such an amazing course! I cannot say enough how much I loved everything about this class! The professor is an amazing lecturer, my TA was incredible at keeping us engaged in section, and the exams were reasonable. THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS!! TAKE IT FOR SURE!!!",
    "A good overview of the way that mental health and illness have been portrayed and treated over the course of the past two centuries in the United States and abroad. Very broad overview.",
    "A great way to get a surface level understanding of a wide range of topics relating to the history of minds and brains.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was super insightful about various parts of American history I had no idea about. Professor Cowles is a great lecturer, and readings are pretty interesting. Their also fairly long, but you can get away with just skimming them.",
    "Overall, I thought Minds & Brains was a good class, though sometimes it felt a bit scattered. When friends would ask me what the class was about, a good explanation often failed to materialize. Ostensibly, the course was a history of psychiatric medicine, but sometimes the lectures felt more like TED talks on single topics rather than a coherent chain of historical ideas that all flow into each other. I often found myself asking \"Why does this matter?\" or \"How does this idea connect to those before\/after it?\". Nevertheless, the course was extremely well-taught, which I felt compensated for some of the course's other deficits. Section was a total waste of time, though.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student.",
    "A must take!!!! This class is very interesting, and Professor Cowles is incredible. He really tries to help his students, makes the material easy to understand and more interesting, and the assignments (blog posts) are actually fun to write. The workload is very minimal, besides section each week, and the exams are very straightforward. Definitely take!!!!",
    "Most of my friends were in love with this class. I definitely was not, but it was an overall good course. It wasn't much work and the material was interesting, but at times it felt superficial and the train of thought of lectures were at times confusing.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who is interested in the history of psych and treatment of illnesses.",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class to another student. It taught me a lot about mental health and illness today and how the past have helped to shape the policies of today. Any student interested in history, psychology, or the history of science\/medicine should definitely take this course.",
    "Would 100% recommend. Amazing lecturer, interesting information, cool material covered, and applicable to many areas of study.",
    "Minds and Brains in America is about the history of the science (and pseudoscience) of psychology from the 19th century to the present. It is a history of what Americans, both professionals and the general public, have believed about the mind, brain, and soul. The lectures are clear, well-structured, easy to follow, and informative. I learned a lot in this class. Professor Cowles is fantastic. The tests were fair and we were told exactly how to prepare for them and we knew which pool (types) of information he would make the questions about. I found the tests were both flexible and comprehensive. The short writing assignments were easy too, especially because the material was so interesting.",
    "Yes! It's a great course. But it is one of those courses that you get what you put into it -- so attend lecture, take good notes, do the readings, and DEFINITELY study for the exams. But yes I would recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course for sure! The only bad part was having to do a lot of what seemed to be pointless memorization for the midterm. The final was very fair though!",
    "ABSOLUTELY. I loved this class so much that words cannot even begin to describe how highly I would recommend it to literally anyone. The huge lecture hall was filled every lecture with people from all sorts of academic disciplines, and the class itself is by nature interdisciplinary. If there is ONE class that you MUST absolutely take before leaving Yale, IT IS THIS LECTURE WITH HENRY COWLES.",
    "Take this class if you are at all interested in psychology and the mind. The historical aspect of psychology that is lacking in classes like Intro Psych is visited in depth in this class.",
    "Great class, definitely take if you have any interest in the material and are looking for a fun, entertaining and engaging course. Reasonable amount of work and readings. Tests were a bit of a time crunch, but were certainly reasonable. I would take any course Prof. Cowles offers, he is an excellent lecturer. I would place this course in the must-take category of Yale classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in medical history. The course material is very interesting and the workload is extremely manageable.",
    "Recommend this as a fifth class. Keep in mind that this was the first time it was offered as a lecture.",
    "This is a fantastic class. Take it. The midterm was pretty difficult and the final kinda difficult to know how to study for, but I think it's going to change. Take this class. It's awesome.",
    "A lot of memorization but interesting because it all connects to the way we see mental health today. Take it for sure.",
    "It is a must take course at Yale! I think that the courses are really relevant to modern day issues and it was very enjoyable.",
    "Very interesting course material, engaging lecturer, fair exams. I would recommend this course.",
    "It was a great class and I would definitely recommend it to others. It was fascinating and always enjoyable.",
    "Take if if you're interested in the history of the mind, not the actual study of it.",
    "Definitely a history of science class; take it if you are interested in the subject and you will find it engaging. The course load is definitely manageable with two bluebook midterms and four short write ups through the semester.",
    "A lot of fun, and a lot of really interesting\/relevant material. I would definitely recommend to anyone.",
    "A summary of the history of the treatment of minds and brains. You will learn a lot of interesting things and the work isn't too challenging if you apply yourself.",
    "This was a fun class. Interesting material, great lecturer, and a completely doable workload.",
    "Definitely take this class. It was absolutely fascinating. You learn so much about why psychology and neurology are the way they are nowadays. I keep finding myself relating my course material to things in my every day life, and it is so satisfying to see all of these connections in front of me. Professor Cowles is amazing, and the workload is totally manageable. Take it!!",
    "Professor Cowles is the absolute best!!! Take it just for him. The course was very reasonable and the material interesting.",
    "Wonderful class. Great holistic view of topics in medicine over the past few centuries.",
    "Take this course and you won't regret it, whatever your major is.",
    "Minds and brains was a low work history class with a unique topic. The lectures are interesting. The grading is hard and arbitrary. There are not many assessments, so little mistakes can add up. You learn a lot.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was an incredibly interesting and fun lecture, an awesome professor, and not too much work. What more can you ask for? The class consisted of a midterm, a final, and four short blog posts (500 words each). The midterm and final were essentially ID's and essays that were very fair and not too challenging if you went to and enjoyed class. There was also a weekly section. I loved the course, and would 100% recommend it. Really not that much work. You can skim the readings and be perfectly suited in the class. Not to mention that most of the readings are really interesting!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class to another student. This is because it is a fun and interesting class where you will actually enjoy going to class. Also, the workload is fair, but you gain a lot of knowledge from the court.",
    "It is a class about the treatment of the mind and brain in America. It is more of a class on the medical history of the brain.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another course. PSYC 135 was an interesting examination of the treatment of psychiatric illness in America since the 1800s.",
    "Interesting class about the history of the treatment of mental disorders and how ideas about the mind progressed over time.",
    "Minds and Brains is a must take if you are interested in the treatment of mental disorders. It's a topic that is relevant to everyone in many ways, and it will change the way you look at the intersection between history and science.",
    "GREAT course. I'm a senior cognitive science major, and I still learned a lot. Cowles is awesome - funny, engaging, and knowledgeable. He's the real deal. The first exam was a bit difficult because we had to memorize dates, but I think that Cowles did away with that after receiving student feedback. The second exam was very reasonable. If you show up to class\/pay attention, there is no reason why you shouldn't do well in this course. HIGHLY recommend!",
    "I would absolutely recommend PSYC 135. The material is fascinating and Professor Cowles is a wonderful lecturer. The only downside is the size of the class. I think it would be much better as a seminar. Apart from the size, though, I loved the class.",
    "It is a combination of psychology and history and medicine and maybe a few other subjects. It is a stimulating lecture course that I highly reccomend because the material is interesting and also gives one perspective on the treatment of mental health today.",
    "Psych 135 is a fantastic class to learn about the history of the brain. I learned a great deal of how psychology came to be today, and I am more confident that I wish to major in psychology after taking this class. I would highly recommend the class to another student for these reasons.",
    "History of psychiatry from 1800's to present day.",
    "yes!!! reading isn't too much and professor Cowles is a really awesome lecturer. Also you WILL learn a lot.",
    "I would absolutely recommend PSYC 135 to another student! It was one of my favorite courses that I have taken at Yale. Lectures were always extremely engaging and well-organized, and I looked forward to attending section each week. I would recommend this course to anyone!",
    "Minds and Brains in America is a very interesting class that investigates the way humans have understood the mind and how it works throughout history. We covered a lot of different topics, many of which are not offered in a traditional HSHM\/ Psych\/ Cog Sci class. We talked about how they came to be and how they, if they were, disprove. We also focused on how these ideas still permeate into modern society even if they have been disproven within the scientific community. Overall, I really loved this class and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in any of the cross listings or just interested in how humans have understood the mind. It is a truly amazing class and I would recommend it to all!",
    "An informative class",
    "Great course about the history of mental illnesses. Very relative to todays world. Definitely take this class.",
    "Highly, highly recommend. The course is only going to evolve and get better from here, and it started out at really good.",
    "A must take. This changed my perception on so many things in other classes and in life. Cowles is also such a genius.",
    "PHENOMENAL class. Professor Cowles leads incredibly interesting lectures on the history of insanity and psychology\/psychiatry and is also a professor who clearly cares about his students. He is constantly going the extra mile to make sure students are engaged and interested, and is remarkably unpretentious and genuinely fascinating. Super highly recommend if you are at all interested in the subject. (Plus the work load is pretty light too).",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! The material is bizarre and extremely interesting, I can't think of another context in which I would learn the things I did in this class. Lectures are really interesting and Professor Cowles is a great lecturer. Readings are a sometimes boring and unnecessarily dense, but overall it was a great experience!",
    "Great class!",
    "This is one of my favorite classes that I have taken at Yale. Professor Cowles is an amazing lecturer, and I learned so much.",
    "AMAZING CLASS!!!! This class was the perfect mix of science and humanities. It was basically a history of psychology class, but super super interesting. Lectures were interesting. Midterms and finals were fair. Not too much reading TAKE IT",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The workload isn't high, and you definitely get a new perspective on the system of psychology and mental health that is so relevant to our world today.",
    "Definitely take this course! Professor Cowles is amazing, and makes all the material so interesting! The workload is manageable, and the readings are very interesting. Sure to become a Yale classic course!",
    "It was a great course! Cowles is a fun, engaging instructor an the material is fascinating (if you're into mind stuff as well his history of medicine). Cowles is funny, personable, and works in modern day examples. Readings aren't too long and section discussoin are interesting.",
    "It's a great class to take no matter your major, for its incredibly interesting and there is no opportunity to learn about this stuff outside of college.",
    "Great class! I would absolutely take this class if you have any interesting in psychology, the mind, or history of science.",
    "This is a great class, but I would recommend taking it only if you are interested in the subject matter. Though it's kind of disguised as a psych class, it's not- it is a history class, focusing on changes and movements in psychology ranging from the 19th century to the 21st. Professor Cowles makes very specific arguments which makes the material interesting and allows you to learn a lot not just about the material but also about what it is to be a historian. There's quite a bit of reading-- it's all primary source material-- and it's wise to do all of it for exams. It's a lot, but manageable. The exams are predictable and not too difficult, as long as you prepare for them in the right way. Lectures were extremely enjoyable to attend, especially compared to other history classes I've taken- you will rarely be bored!",
    "Minds and Brains is an overall very interesting and informative class. The lectures are fairly structured so it can be at times dry but the subject matter is really cool and Professor Cowles presents it well.",
    "I would recommend Minds and Brains because I really do think its changed the way I view the history of medicine in America, and things in general in my life. I found this class similar to Marci Shores European Intellectual History Since Nietzsche insofar as both of the classes broadened my perspective on life, not just with regard to history, but also with respect to things that I think about in general. Many of the lectures were fascinating, and many were disturbing. I think that it is very important to be cognizant of the less than pleasant origins of techniques and schools of thought that are now commonplace and taken for granted as objective. I think that we often view the horrors\/mistakes of the past as unambiguously wrong and foolish, and that we forget how little time has passed since those mistakes were made and how convincingly people promulgated those ideologies and ideas we now find to be reprehensible. If you dont really know what Im talking about, check out the Supreme Court case Buck v Bell (1927) wherein the Supreme Court upheld a Virginia law that forced a woman to be sterilized because she was deemed to be a moron (because she was raped and had a baby out of wedlock). Thats some crazy shit that happenedright here in the good ol USA. And there are several, much more recent and equally disturbing instances. In any case, if you have any interest in medicine, the history of medicine, or the concept of the self, you should check this class out. Its a good one.",
    "Super, super interesting class. Very well taught. Not too much work, but you'll be missing out if you don't keep up with the work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the brain! The course offers a new look at the brain and mind that I haven't been exposed to before. The lectures are engaging, section is helpful, and the readings are interesting!",
    "I would say this class was a very history intensive review of psychology. It's a lot of books and people and what they did and their impact on the history of psychology as a whole and I would only recommend this to someone who is either really really really interested in psychology or someone who is more history based. I don't really like history but do like psychology quite a bit, but did find this a stretch for my interest. Although I did really enjoy the class as a whole, the very history intensive side was not particularly enjoyable for me. All in all to my fellow students who don't have the dislike for history that I do I would say absolutely go for it because Professor Cowles is great and the entire class is an elsewise very interesting and unique way to look at psychology.",
    ". OMG YES TAKE IT . Part 1: The Magnificent Henry Cowles Henry Cowles is an absolutely magnificent lecturer; he is a dynamic, engaging, charming, funny, light-hearted, interesting, and entertaining lecturer. I always look forward to his lectures and enjoy them thoroughly. The lectures are very well-organized, and it is obvious he puts a lot of time and effort into forming them. He does exactly what he says he will do, doesn't pull any fast ones on us, and is so encouraging and kind that his students feel he truly wants them to succeed. Henry Cowles is definitely one of my favorite professors at Yale. His jokes are the most adorable thing ever in the world, and people srsly need to back off his ties cuz they're totes adorbs too (love them, Henry, really, you do you). Dude can spew his vast knowledge a mile a minute, but he slows down his genius to the perfect pace for lectures (though he sometimes slips into rapid mode, unconsciously I think). He is very open to feedback and will even change his methods mid-course if the class is in consensus over an issue. This guy legit has a cult following formed out of love and admiration. #henryCowlesForever #henryCowlesFanclub #luvThemTies #magicBulletSalesman #luvThatBeanie #yaleWinsHenry #harvardLost #professorCowlesOnTheMic Part 2: The Class In general you explore psychology through history, learning about different methods of understanding and studying the mind and brain and how the introduction of new tools and technologies shaped the formation of various theories of mind throughout history. The material is super interesting, and there's not much work. We had a midterm, a final, section, and four 500-word blog posts. I didn't do any of the readings, and I think I did fine. Material is straightforward from the lectures, and exams are very fair. This was Henry's first lecture class, so he may choose to change things up a little next time, but honestly, you cannot go wrong taking a class with this guy. See above paragraph if you need convincing. You talk about stuff like the early asylums, neurasthenia, phrenology, eugenics, sociobiology, pills, anti-psychology, famous psychology experiments, etc.",
    "Minds and Brains in America is a fun class that teaches you all about the history of psychology, mental medical practices, and everything to do with minds and brains. This class gives you perspective on our mental treatments today.",
    "This course is a very interesting course about the history of medicine. I really enjoyed this course even though it doesn't relate to my major at all. I would highly recommend this course to any student, whether or not it relates to their interests. I found it fascinating and the workload extremely manageable.",
    "I would absolutely recommend minds and brains to another student. The material was extremely interesting, professor Cowles is a great lecturer, and the assignments are very manageable and chill.",
    "A history of psychology\/science about the mind and brain. I would definitely recommend this class, subject matter was very interesting and it was taught well.",
    "Yes. It's great for psych and non-psych majors alike. It's a really interesting course that touches on aspects of history that often go unmentioned otherwise.",
    "Take this class!! It was one of my favorites of the semester!! The material is fascinating and Professor Cowles is an incredible teacher- so intelligent, funny, and personable! If you like cogsci or psych, you will love this class.",
    "This was my favorite class this semester and I definitely recommend it. There are weekly readings that are never more than 100 pages and 4 short writing assignments (500 words each) throughout the whole semester. The midterm and final are very reasonable and you can do great if you study the main themes presented in lecture.",
    "A sneaky hard gut which teaches you about different famous people and their contributions to psychology.",
    "This class is one of my favorite classes I've taken; convinced me to change my major. Minds and Brains is kind of a \"history of psychology\" class, but with a focus on how society changes how we diagnose and view mental illnesses. It's not hard (midterm, final, and four 500-word \"blog posts\"), and the readings aren't too long. Professor Cowles is absolutely amazing, and super supportive. His lectures are incredibly clear and well organized, and there are slides that make everything really easy to follow. He does a great job tying every topic to major themes so by the time the exams come, you're just reviewing erreadings and any details you may have forgotten because you already have a great sense of how everything ties togethThe grading of blog posts seems to differ by TA, but nothing was graded harshly as far as I can tell. Absolutely take, especially if it falls in your major.",
    "This class is amazing - I would 100% recommend this class to a fellow student. The professor is great, the material is interesting, and the readings are cool (though a bit dense and hard to understand sometimes). Take this class.",
    "A cool course on the history of psychology in the world and the US. Lots of reading and a mandatory section make for a large time commitment, but you also learn a lot. There is a clear liberal and social justice bias in this course which sometimes even delves into being explicitly anti-science, so go into this course ready to immerse yourself in this viewpoint and have your opinions dismissed if they don't line up with it.",
    "HSHM 216 is a great class especially if you are a science major looking for a history class. It is not a lot of work and the information is very interesting.",
    "Yeah I would recommend it to another student!",
    "It's a very interesting course with a lot of good discussions, but make sure to keep up with the readings. What you get out of it is what you put in.",
    "A fascinating class that looks at how we (Americans and sometimes Europeans) have conceived of mental health and the mind since the late 1700s, and why we may have conceived of it in that way.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in the history of health in the US.",
    "Highly recommend. Awesome lecture style by professor Cowles and an extremely interesting subject material. Covered centuries of information about the treatment of the minds and brains but did not feel like an overwhelming amount of information with the way it was presented by the professor.",
    "Absolutely. The content is incredibly interesting on top of Professor Cowles being a great lecturer and an all-around good guy. Even section was fun!",
    "Yes take this class! Prof Cowles is so engaging, the material is very interesting, the evaluations are totally fair. I loved every lecture and was never bored.",
    "Yes, yes, yes! Take it! This semester was the first time the class has been offered, so there were a few kinks, but Prof Cowles was quick to work them out, which suggests that the class is only going to get better and better. The material is fascinating and it's presented in a way that's both super engaging and super digestible. You will not believe how organized Prof. Cowles is. And you will love how Prof. Cowles's organized lectures make getting a good grade on exams realllyyyy attainable. Just take it yall",
    "I would completely recommend this course! Minds and Brains in America was probably one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale so far. The material was fascinating and interesting. Professor Cowles truly made the class though. For his first time lecturing, he was terrific! He was engaging, entertaining and informative. He was clearly knowledgable in the subject manner and presented it in an easily understood manner. He truly was invested in his students' learning progress because he was willing to ask for feedback and act on this feedback. His lecture slides were clear and provided good visual information as well as the key points from the lecture. The reading materials were not too lengthy and all were rather interesting. They also complemented the lecture materials very well. To be honest, the class didn't have many weaknesses in my opinion.",
    "Take this class!! It's a wonderful multidisciplinary approach to the history of mental health, neurology, etc. and Professor Cowles is an amazing lecturer and person to get to know!",
    "HIST 118 is a great introductory course to a variety of studies, such as Psychology and the History of Science and Medicine. Students who are unsure about their academic interest should take this course. In fact, any student who wants an interesting course to round out a schedule should this this course.",
    "KInd of like the history of psychology. Pretty interesting and is applied to stuff today. Not too hard to study for after the first midterm once we didn't have to know dates anymore. Cool class",
    "Definitely more emphasis on the history aspect but has a nice science twist to the class.",
    "Minds & Brains is a pretty straightforward lecture. Interesting topics. Would be a great 5th class.",
    "I liked this class, lots of info, not much time.",
    "Henry Cowles is a phenomenal lecturer, and you will learn so much at each meeting. He wants each student to understand and be happy in the course. It's a rare course where lecture, section, and the readings fit seamlessly together, and it is very clear why everything is included. There were four blog posts (no more than 500 words each), a midterm, and a final. I would recommend this class to anyone!",
    "Minds and Brains is an engaging, inspiring class that lends a crucial perspective to modern conversations on mental health and neuroscience. The historical backdrop it provides is endlessly fascinating, and will make for a great many conversations around the dinner table. I would definitely (vehemently!) recommend this class to my peers.",
    "PSYC 135 was a fascinating course: From Day 1, Professor Cowles held the audience captive. His lectures were amazing -- interesting, topical, and informative. The last lectures were just as full as the first ones -- something that obviously speaks to their quality. This was my first history course at Yale and I'm glad to have taken it. There were ~ 50-100 pages of reading per week, four written blog posts, a midterm and a final. The midterm focused too much on names \/ dates, but Professor Cowles and staff obviously realized this as the final exam ID's focused directly on significance. The blog posts focused on general topics connecting themes throughout the course. And the readings were topical and supplemental to the lectures. The topic of this course in Minds and Brains in America, but its reach spans far beyond the history of psychology. We debated how various tools, such as phrenology and fMRI, have transformed into theories of mind. We discussed mental health, mental illness, pills, and other issues of today. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject of psychology. Professor Cowles is an excellent lecturer, the subject is fascinating, and the workload is manageable.",
    "YES EVERYTHING IS WORTH IT THE READING THE LECTURES THE SECTIONS THE EXAMS NO COMPLAINTS TAKE IT",
    "TAKE THIS! SO GOOD! not only is the material super interesting, but this stuff also matters. it's also not hard.",
    "It was definitely an interesting course. Each lecture covered a different topic, and the topics together formed a basic chronology of psychology in the US. I enjoyed the format, but I know several students who were not the biggest fans.",
    "This really was a great class. I really enjoyed it, it wasn't too much work, but I learned a lot. If you have trouble with history, this is likely not the class for you. Also, be prepared for some very technical information, since this is the study of science and medicine, things can get very technical if you are not used to it.",
    "Take this class!! Professor Cowles is a great lecturer, the material is fascinating and pertinent to absolutely anyone (though I really think pre-meds\/Global Health fellows should have to take this class), and there is not too much work at all. I highly recommend, and considering this was his first shot at teaching the class, I am sure it will only continue to improve.",
    "A lecture course about the history of mental illness and health in the United States.",
    "Minds and Brians was a fantastic class. It has EXTREMELY interesting material, and an EXTREMELY reasonable workload. I probably put about two hours a week into this class. Moreover, Professor Cowles is outstanding. I have never seen a professor keep an auditorium full as the semester goes on because people usually lose interest in attending large lectures. Definitely recommend.",
    "Yes I would recommend, and definitely go to class, because every class was interesting. I wish I had gone more often."
