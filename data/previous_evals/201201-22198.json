    "Covers everything you need to know about multivariable calc, but if you are not a good self-learner, beware. Some of the teachers are great but some are terrible. The material is not inherently confusing or difficult but the teacher plays a large role in how it's presented. Shop different sections of Math 120 if you can.",
    "If you're pre-med, just take Math 115, especially if you've already taken Calc BC in high school. I felt like I spent way too much time on math this semester--going to class three times a week, then having to learn the material from the book on my own, and FINALLY starting my pset which took FOREVER. Which is why I just stopped going to class.",
    "Really only take this if you have to. And if you do, find a TA you can understand.",
    "Math 120, for me, was not a very fun course. Your experience will vary greatly depending on the quality of the teachers, which range from legendary professors like Michael Frame to PhD students in their mid-20s who should not be teaching (which was my case). The weekly problem sets can be pretty challenging at an average of maybe 4-7 hours each. There is also little effort made to connect the relatively boring material to real world applications. Also, 90% of your grade is determined by your performance on 2 midterms and the final.",
    "No, just no",
    "Unless you have to take this course or really enjoy math, I wouldn't recommend taking it. The concepts that you learn are interesting, but also abstract, so the class can be rough. I'm good at visualizing things in 3D, and a lot of what you learn in this class is based in 3D, but some of the concepts are hard to imagine because it's about flow and not necessarily substantial objects. I went through a lot of hills and valleys--mainly valleys--during this course. I entered the class believing I could grasp math relatively easily, but--maybe it was the new setting or something--I had difficulties. However, at the end, I do believe I finally grasped the concepts and could do the work: it just took a lot of individual effort and determination. Also, the videos on Khan Academy really helped in terms of understanding what you were actually learning. The MIT Open Course videos on Multivariable Calculus were also helpful (but a lot longer than the Khan Academy videos).",
    "I would not recommend Math 120 at all. It was a terrible experience. I am a student who really enjoys math, but who is not naturally good at math. I always thought that working hard would be enough. It was not enough in this class, mostly because I had a really terrible teacher (Anton Zeitlin) who did not teach me anything and who was incredibly condescending. This class was just a really frustrating and discouraging experience. It's SOOO not worth it, unless you're naturally good at math and don't need a good teacher to succeed, or if you get a good teacher (which you can't always control)."
