   "comments": [
    "Great research methods class. Not too much work throughout the semester. Material is really interesting (genetics behind neuropsychological disorders and other behavior traits). Prof. Cannon is fantastic, although his voice can be a bit one-note. The opportunity to work on real data and create your own term project is awesome. Midterm wasn't bad, either. Only cons: our TA was not great\/helpful, the project paper does take a long time, and the group element of the project wasn't great, either. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "A pretty good course. Useful information to know. The two exams required a lot of thinking rather than asking you to memorize and regurgitate inconsequential information.",
    "Even if you don't have a very extensive science background, I would recommend this class if you have an interest in learning more about behavioral disorders or about genetics. It's an interesting class that is very accessible to non-science students or students who have a limited background in statistics. For a research methods class, the workload is not too bad.",
    "Behavioral Genetics is a fascinating course with a relatively light workload. If you have any interest in the genetic root of mental disorders, or interest in how you would go about figuring out if any behavior is heritable, this is the course for you. In the first half, you learn the techniques for determining heritability and for figuring out whether specific genetic variants (i.e. SNPs) are related to a phenotype. This part involves almost no outside work, apart from studying for the midterm. The second half features a weekly lecture on specific findings from different clinical populations. In the second half, you work on a final paper using the data set Professor Cannon gathered a few years ago. You can ask some really cool questions from it since it has SNPs as well as all sorts of phenotypes. The only rough part of the course was that we had to write up out final paper of about 20 pages in less than a week. Hopefully they will force you to start writing earlier in the future. In sum, a great course."
