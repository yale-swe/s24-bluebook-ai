   "comments": [
    "Great course. Very comprehensive. Help available whenever needed. Work is not difficult if you follow in class.Tests are open note, which makes learning so much easier!",
    "Great introductory math course. I would recommend any course Professor Frame teaches.",
    "MATH 101 is a look eat how geometry applies to nature. You look at fractals, population growth, length contraction, etc. Don't think just because it's not calculus means it's not hard! I would recommend it to another student - the class was cool and the teacher was amazing!",
    "Great course. Take it!",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend this class - if you can get in, you should definitely take it.",
    "I did fine in math classes in high school, but I have just never been good at math and it has never come naturally to me. This class was perfect for me - I had some prior math skills (though not calculus), but I did not have to remember everything from high school trigonometry to be successful in this course. I would wholly recommend it to anyone in a similar position as me. I was really struggling to find a QR credit that was manageable - I even struggled when shopping Frame's Fractal Geo, which is supposedly the easiest math option for Humanities people. This class was manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend it! I usually don't like math classes, but I found this class to be very enjoyable. Michael Frame is great!",
    "This class is at the very top of the list of those that I would recommend to a fellow student.",
    "Yes, take it if you have the opportunity, because it is straight-forward and Professor Frame is a joy."
