    "A good class that'll put some weight on your cultural baggage, but don't let yourself intimidated by German grad students.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Structured like a graduate seminar so be prepared. The professor talks a-lot and the grad students can be intimidating but the class discussion was the best I've found at Yale. I loved all the readings and I left class with questions about myself everyday. Take it."
