   "comments": [
    "This class will really teach you to appreciate the connections between math and biology. I took Calc BC in high school (which is this courses equivalent) and I think it really expanded on that pool of knowledge.",
    "New perspective of looking at math and combining it with biology; made math a bit more interesting",
    "I really don't think this was a calc class as much as it was just doing biological models and also linear algebra. I took Calc BC in high school and this was very much different in terms of content except for the short period of series we did at the end in which I still felt very confused.",
    "Improved integration skills, modelling biological situations with differential equations, phase planes, manipulating series, writing Taylor\/power series, using them to solve integrals or differential equations",
    "This course familiarized me with a number of widely used mathematical models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra, Fitzhugh-Nagumo, etc.) along with various biological, ecological, and social scientific applications of these models. Additionally, I learned several important integration techniques and techniques for solving differential equations (including linear algebra).",
    "I learned advanced single integration techniques, differential equation analysis, basic linear algebra, and Taylor Series evaluation.",
    "Math 116 was wonderful. I learned topics in Calculus 2 and Linear algebra, all within the context of biological systems, which was quite fascinating.",
    "I learned some good fundamentals for math models in the scientific context.",
    "Understand concepts in mathematical model analysis, phase planes, linear algebra, series, and more - also readings on various biological topics",
    "Much of the information of this class was motivated by the effort to analyze and solve differential equations being used as models. This included integration, phase plane analysis, power series, and linear algebra topics like finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This course also introduced me to various specific models like the logistic model, the Lodka-Volterra model, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model, and the Van der Pol oscillator. A fundamental realization of this course was just the vast scope of applications which calculus holds, and that was particularly nice because most other math classes I've taken lack concrete applications that give the material importance.",
    "I learned to recognize and analyze different types of biological models. My integration skills improved tremendously throughout this course. Additionally, I learned about both power and Taylor series, which I had not studied extensively before this course.",
    "I feel that I received a solid introduction to math modeling, a topic that I had never been exposed to before. I chose to take the course to look at calculus topics through a lens that would be more relevant to my field of study than most math classes, and I definitely feel that 116 met that goal - I now feel equipped and excited to look at biology topics with a mathematical perspective.",
    "This course taught us how to mathematically interpret and evaluate many scientific texts, while at the same time teaching us skills such as integration, linear algebra, and series.",
    "This math course was a very interesting way of looking at mathematics. Being completely application based, if provides a different way of learning math, and a foreign one at that.",
    "In this course, I was able to take advanced math and apply it to different models used in different scientific experiments.",
    "Learning how to analyze a scientific article for the important\/relevant parts, a sound understanding of Taylor Series and power series, the skills of integration and differentiation in an applicable way",
    "Through this course, I was given the individual insight that I enjoyed this interdisciplinary style of class with the combination of calculus and biology. Was able to learn differential calculus through this class while also gaining the skill of being able to efficiently read journal articles."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength is definitely the professor. Professor Hall puts in so much time and effort into this class and truly cares about the students and their learning. He was always available to meet and answered any and all questions with great explanations. Another strength is the readings. This broke up the math lectures and introduced an applicable and interesting topic.",
    "Problem sets were always very difficult. I felt that even though I paid attention every class period and took notes I could not even begin to answer a lot of the questions",
    "This course has very interesting readings, but I think it focuses too much on readings rather than mathematics concepts. It was fine for me because I had taken Calc BC, but I do not know how I would have survived without that prior knowledge.",
    "The professor taught too quickly, in my opinion, and going into this course, having already taken calculus II in high school, it was nothing like that. Expect some linear algebra and math modeling concepts that you have never come across. And since the professor taught too quickly, concepts were not grasped well enough, in my case any way",
    "The readings were difficult to understand and a bit above our knowledge base.",
    "This is the first time Professor Hall has taught this class since Michael Frame, and I think the class focuses too much on the scientific articles that you have to read every week. We spend too much time discussing them in class and not enough on class material and it gets hard to answer the problem set problems because I feel as though we didn't really cover enough of the material. I think this class needs to focus less on readings and have more time allocated to covering actual math concepts from the curriculum. I also did not like that there was no real textbook and that instead Prof Hall would reference Prof Frame's textbook occasionally. I felt that given how limited our time was on course content due to the reading discussion, I would have liked to have had the option to have relevant resources from a textbook to refer to so I could better learn the material.",
    "I didn't really like the readings associated with the course, or find them particularly helpful. Peer tutor super helpful! Didn't particularly like that sometimes we learned stuff in class on Tuesday that we needed for the pset due Thursday, impeded my ability to work on the pset over the weekend\/prepare questions for office hours on Monday. Class was super helpful and straight forward. Lots of examples provided that helped with comprehension. Wish the midterms were given in class and not late at night.",
    "This course is excellent in that it arms students with much of the knowledge they will need to understand numerous concepts and phenomena within the biological and medical fields. The lectures are thorough and supplemented with Professor Frame's notes. The only weaknesses of the course are that it is very fast paced, and it would be helpful to have more practice problems available in addition to the required homework.",
    "Professor Hall is a good teacher who is well qualified to be teaching this class. However, I think that the class would benefit from (1) a book that explains the concepts in more detail and (2) a section discussion that could be used to ask questions about concepts and also the dense technical readings that are assigned weekly.",
    "The class is very well taught but a bit rushed at times.",
    "The course was good at integrating readings and just normal math.",
    "The course was helpful in gaining an overall understanding of how mathematical models are used to analyze biological issues, but the readings were sometimes too esoteric and difficult to understand; class discussion took a long time and didn't help us understand how to actually develop models. Overall, Professor Hall is very helpful and genuinely cares about students getting the material",
    "I thought I was very strong when it came to putting forth a strong effort. I did my best to understand the material conceptually. However, I could definitely do a better job of asking questions in class. Asking question would definitely help to clarify the material that was most difficult, and ensure that I am more engaged in the class.",
    "I think the balance between the readings and the math concepts was nearly ideal, and the topics were all engaging. Even the problem sets, while difficult, felt like a productive learning experience that contributed to the generation of new knowledge rather than a reiteration of class concepts. One possible area for improvement would be that the end of the course covered Calculus II concepts very quickly, yet the final exam demanded a high understanding of these topics that we only began to work through.",
    "This course was strong in the sense that the class size was rather small, meaning that the students could develop a closer relationship with the professor and could therefore be perhaps more engaged in class.",
    "The teacher of the course is one of the strengths of the classes. Dr. Hall was an excellent teacher and readily available to student input. A negative is that there is no textbook. Many students would have preferred one to study from, but I'm not sure a textbook would exist to cover what we cover in the class. A strength is also the Peer Tutor.",
    "It was difficult for me to adjust to the class, but I was able to get the hang of the class as time went on.",
    "The class did not feel very unified, and a lot of students came individually to Professor Hall for help instead of working together. Sometimes the articles were really dense and it was hard to judge how deep of an understanding was required for the class. The problem sets were challenging but always possible and an appropriate length.",
    "Strength of the course was the repetition each week of having one reading and problem set, which helped pace the course overall. Weakness of the course is that the topics were not always related in the most succinct way. Additionally, many times the content that appeared on the problem set were not covered in class, so some were difficult to complete. This problem was much better towards the end of the semester so if the style of teaching was carried throughout the entire semester, that could be an improvement."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. Although you may not learn as much straight math as say math 115, it is a great alternative where I felt I learned a lot of different techniques. It is a class that is not very stressful as Professor Hall is always available to talk and help you.",
    "If you are a pre-med student or fan of biology and for some reason have to take math, I would really recommend this course because it is very interesting, even though it is definitely not a gut.",
    "I would recommend this course to students who like math and want to see it in an entirely different perspective, but I would not recommend this course to students who aren't as invested or inclined to math because while I found the information interesting, it was difficult for me to grasp because the professor taught fairly quickly. Be prepared for topics outside of calculus II, even though this course says you only have to know up to math 115.",
    "I think students should take Math 115 or Math 120 instead if they can. I took Math 116 because I heard Math 115 was a mess with it being a flipped classroom, but I think Math 116 was difficult because it didn't seem like a traditional calculus class whatsoever. Above all, it was hard to seek help for this class because of the way all the problem sets were applications of calc in biological models. I think this was what made this class so hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend for someone looking for a biologically based calc class, very interesting, or for someone looking to be in a smaller course with a great professor-easy to get small group\/one on one time with him. . Weekly readings with discussion posts, weekly psets, two midterms at night on Wednesdays, one integration quiz-you take it until you pass, and eventually everyone gets 100 on this. Peer tutor really helpful with psets. Professor very sweet and helpful.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a solid conceptual understanding of the type of math used in biology, medicine, and social sciences (especially analyzing dynamic systems of differential equations).",
    "I would suggest this course to students who believe they have a strong understanding of variable manipulation, and especially students who took BC calculus in high school. The additional layer of difficulty that the readings as well as the connection to biological phenomena bring make simply learning the concepts presented not enough. Students should be prepared for a math class unlike anything they have taken before due to the specialized nature of the subject matter.",
    "Yes I would recommend. It's great especially for premed students like myself.",
    "Yes I would because it is different than just a normal math class, which I like. It's challenging but rewarding.",
    "I definitely would recommend, especially if you want concrete applications to the math you're learning. John Hall is among the best teachers I've ever had, and the course gives you the foundations of Calc 2 while opening your eyes the variety of applications there are to the material. Also, a lot of people describe the course as \"Calc 2 for bio people\" but you don't necessarily have to be a bio major to find the course interesting, and while some of the articles we read can get technical, any background you need to know is explained and the focus remains on math, not the biology.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Overall I enjoyed this class a lot, and the readings provided insight as to what we were learning in class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend (and have recommended) this course to other students; the teaching was excellent, and the format provided a lot more variety than a typical math class, with the readings providing different ways of engagement. I found it very enjoyable to have specifically goal-based math learning, in which our quantitative problem solving was coupled with qualitative contextualization. I would recommend the course especially to people with an interest in biology because it paired well with other science-based coursework.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student because it teaches mathematics in an interesting and different angle. The material learned in class is also useful in any kind of field.",
    "Yes, this class was my favorite class this year. We learn math in a completely new fashion, and apply it to models that are conceptually visible to the students. Great way to learn and experience mathematics.",
    "I would recommend this class to students who are interested in ecology and applying math to science.",
    "Yes, this course is a great way to continue studying math but in a context that is more applicable to biology\/chemistry majors who are not interested in higher level math.",
    "I think this is a great class for anyone thinking of pursuing a field in medicine or other natural sciences, but for the purpose of learning mathematics, it may be best to take Math 115. Additionally, if the student had not been previously exposed to differential calculus and integration, this may be slightly difficult to catch up."
