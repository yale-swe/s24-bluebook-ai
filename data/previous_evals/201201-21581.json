   "comments": [
    "Some interesting stories. We read them, hear about them in class, discuss them in section, and then write three papers overall about them.",
    "If you are interested in Spanish\/ Portuguese culture, then this is a really good course to take (otherwise you might find it boring). You can write about whatever you want (which might be challenging sometimes - because there's SO MUCH you could write about). I'm a math major, with an interest in Spanish literature (not the typical Spanish\/Portuguese\/English\/Psych major) and I loved the course. The workload was manageable and I had a great time writing the essays.",
    "I had my qualms with the course since it was Portuguese literature, but I couldn't be happier that I discovered it. I thought I would hate a lit course, but I can't imagine having taken something else.",
    "Yes, if interested in the material.",
    "If you are interested in Portuguese\/Spanish literature, mainly short stories and poems, I would recommend it. There is a huge range of readings, from 17th century poems to modern day stories so even if you don't like one part of the class you will definitely love another part.",
    "I would say that this course is very interesting and the subject material is engaging. However, I would not recommend this course to anyone trying to fulfill Spanish requirements. Very few readings are in Spanish and the focus of the courseis definitely Brazilian culture.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Jackson is really great and the class is interesting if you need a fun writing credit.",
    "This class is an overview of Portuguese\/Brazilian\/Spanish literature in which the main character is on the edge of reality. I recommend it to anyone interested in mental illness, Portuguese\/Brazilian\/Spanish lit, or simply to take a class with a professor who is passionate about his field."
