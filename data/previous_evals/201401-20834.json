    "An excellent class and if you're at all interested in Korean, take it! It's a decent amount of work but a lot of fun.",
    "Korean has always been a language that I really wanted to learn. I took Spanish early on to fulfill my language requirements as I had taken Spanish throughout high school. When I decided to take Korean it was a way for me to learn a new language and enjoy a class that was different from my science heavy workload. KREN 120 is hard but I learned a lot of basic grammar structures and can now write letters and express intention. It covered a lot of material that I had hoped to cover. I would definitely recommend this class to any students that are interested in learning more about Korea, learning Korean, or just want a fun language course.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn Korean! It's a lot of fun--though a lot of work, as well.",
    "Definitely recommend",
    "Great second class in the introductory Korean sequence. I would definitely recommend the class to a student looking for a fun language to study. Very reasonable amount of coursework and more fluid after coming from KREN 110.",
    "One of the best languages out there. Even though it is difficult, it is often an intuitive language that can become very easy to derive as you learn it at a higher level. Go for it."
