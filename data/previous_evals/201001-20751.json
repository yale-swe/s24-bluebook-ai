    "Yes, I would recommend this course to the students who are interested in information theory.",
    "I would recommend it to any statistics student, just because Yale is so strong in the field and the subject matter plays such an important role in modern statistics. If they are not a statistics student, I would recommend it to anyone with a potential interest in studying in the field. If they are like me and are interested in information theory and its applications, they will thoroughly enjoy the class."
