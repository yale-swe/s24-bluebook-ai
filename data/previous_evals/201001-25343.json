    "YES, ABSOLUTELY! TAKE THIS COURSE WITH EVAN!",
    "Take this class. It will change the way you think about acting and Evan is extra-ordinary.",
    "I would summarize my theater 211 experience a simply amazing. I cannot speak for everyone in the course since it really does depend on who your teacher is but if by some miracle of God, Evan Yionoulis is teaching this course again (or any undergraduate course really) I say take it.",
    "A great continuation of Introduction to Performance, and a surefire way to improve oneself as an actor and person.",
    "Our section approached the class through two-person scenes, though different professors use different styles of teaching at this level. I would absolutely recommend this class for anybody interested in improving their acting. The class helped me to clarify and organize my process and made me much better on stage for it. If you ever get a chance to take an acting class with Evan, do it. She is simply the best.",
    "Absolutely. This scene study class is a truly precious experience for a young actor."
