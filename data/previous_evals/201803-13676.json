    "This class teaches a unique historical analysis through the study of one person (Nelson Mandela); one learns to draw insights from various different sources such as autobiographies, biographies, other scholars thematic work, works of the person in study, works on the political\/academic milieu of their time. Through this study of one person, one learns about",
    "This was the first class I've taken that was focused on a person instead of a time period or theme. I learned a lot about how you think critically about a person, place them in history, and study their autobiography and the ways they try to prevent themselves. Besides a thorough understanding of Mandela and 20th century South African history, I also took from this course an understanding of the political philosophy around anger and forgiveness.",
    "I learned so much about Mandela's life, the political landscape in South Africa, and the philosophies behind Mandela's politics. But more importantly, I got a really interesting variety of historical narratives about Mandela's life -- this course really makes you think about how historical knowledge is extremely subjective.",
    "As an American with little knowledge of South Africa, I gained a huge amount of exposure and understanding of a history which was very new to me.",
    "I learned so much about Nelson Mandela and the history of South Africa. I also learned to look at different aspects of politics, how an individual and a group formulates their politics, how movements form, how \"great men\" are created etc.",
    "- a well rounded knowledge of South Africas history - a deeper grasp on Mandela, his contributions, his faults, and his molding. This course honestly taught me more about Mandela that I have gathered throughout my lifetime. - how to better manage such a heavy reading load, while grasping the main concepts. - the ability to listen better to others interpretations of concepts that were much different from my own. - how to pin together opposite viewpoints discussed in readings and form my own opinion based off all of the background information given prior.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about apartheid, South Africa, Winnie and Nelson Mandela. The professor was highly knowledgeable and the class wasn't an ode to Mandela, we discussed his flaws as well, which was great.",
    "This was a fantastic class and I learned so much about the life of an incredible human being."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: J. Steinberg has immense knowledge on SA, Nelson Mandela, and personal experience from living in SA during the uprising of the leader. His immense involvement and work on SA makes it very enjoyable to listen to his insights and anecdotes. Also, the conversation is always high-level as he tends to summarize the main points and dives deep into each of them. Two weeks are devoted on watching documentaries, which is pretty refreshing! Definitely enjoyed the change. Weaknesses: Although, the class was on Nelson Mandela, I think too much time was spent dissecting the different parts of his life. It was getting kind of tiring by the 7th week, but definitely got much more interesting when we started comparing him with Winnie, Fanon, Ghandi -- I wonder whether a few NM classes could be sacrificed for more comparative weeks like the last ones. Sometimes, there is no debate in the class; sometimes it becomes a class where students are simply asking questions and he is answering them. I am not entirely sure how this dynamics was set.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Steinberg's knowledge of the subject matter and interest in engaging with students. He picked out an excellent set of readings for the course that generated more than enough questions for the class period while also being a manageable workload. Seminar was also fascinating because Professor Steinberg had so many anecdotes to contribute. I understand that the point of this course evaluations is to critique classes and help improve them, but I found very little that needed to be improved. However, I thought the last few weeks (anger\/forgiveness and Fanon) were some of the most interesting discussions of the course, and wonder if it's worth spending more than a week on these topics.",
    "This course was a fascinating dive into the life and significance of Nelson Mandela, one of the most important figures of the 20th century. The structure of the course made a lot of sense, and the in-class discussions were thoughtful and enhanced my learning. Professor Steinberg was incredibly passionate and knowledgeable, and his teaching was strengthened by how much of the history he actually lived through. While the readings were very interesting and well-selected, there was occasionally so much reading that it was hard to synthesize that week's information. I would have also appreciated slightly more clear instructions regarding assignments and slightly more extensive feedback on my work.",
    "This was a great course. Would not change much. It would be helpful to have a rubric and more of an outlined syllabus of expectations for assignments especially since we had so few. It may be interesting to make the final paper a final project. In other courses like this that has been a very rewarding experience and more educational than the traditional paper. Just an idea to shake things up.",
    "Strengths: selected readings, brilliant and challenging discussions, and a devoted professor. Weakness: everyone does not contribute equally to discussions, so sometimes a persons stance can be unknown for the entire semester.",
    "Standard amount of reading for a seminar, paper topic was up to the student. Weaknesses: the only assignments were an annotated bibliography and the final paper, so there was no way to gauge how well you were doing in the class. Plus, the final paper was expected to be 20-25 pages. You were welcome to meet with the professor to discuss your paper throughout the semester, but without any graded assignments it was impossible to gauge what he was looking for\/expected.",
    "Fantastic professor."

   "comments": [
    "Definitely. Awesome class with an awesome instructor. Mandela can get too much by the 6th-7th week, but bear with the class and once other figures come into play, it becomes more interesting.",
    "Absolutely. This is the best course that I've ever taken at Yale. The discussions were rich and interesting, and Professor Steinberg is remarkably intelligent and great at facilitating conversation.",
    "Strongly recommend this course, even if you know nothing about South Africa or Mandela. Professor Steinberg makes the course very accessible to those of us without a lot of knowledge of the subject matter. The readings are fantastic and Professor Steinberg is a super interesting guy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You get so much information and a really nice understanding of how to read historical figures and movements. Plus the seminars are so stimulating and enjoyable.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Yes. I learned a lot and the professor was great. The readings were also very interesting.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes definitely! This class focuses on the life of Mandela and those around him, while giving interesting insight into political theories at work that could be applied to other contexts.",
    "Absolutely. However, I believe that the course is only offered this year. If Professor returns, I believe that this course greatly assists one in developing a better understanding of South African history, the revered Mandela, and different takes on history that are often only discussed superficially.",
    "You should take this class if you are interested in the topic and are prepared to write a 25 page final paper.",
    "Yes!"
