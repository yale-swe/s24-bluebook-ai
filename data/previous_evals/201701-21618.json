    "I know that Professor Lierl is relatively new to academia, but this course was a clusterf--- (can I say that in evaluations?). I came into this course thinking it would be about governance in Africa, given the course title \"Governance in Africa\". However, the coursework was just reading research studies conducted by others. There was no knowledge base of how governance in Africa actually works on either the national or local levels, and the entire class was merely reading research papers about fixing problems associated with African governance. Class discussions were another issue. Professor Lierl would pose a question to the class and, since no one ever did the readings because they were dull and time-consuming, we would just sit in silence for minutes at a time, staring at each other. There wasn't much helpful feedback on the course projects, many of which were written about countries outside of Africa.",
    "I would have liked more feedback on assignments throughout the semester. I really like the syllabus, it was well structured and organized.",
    "Great, interesting and stimulating discussions."
