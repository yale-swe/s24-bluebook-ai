    "Great course. Practicum is an invaluable experience. You will learn a lot, and you will enjoy your time in class.",
    "This is a must-take class for any psychology major! Dr.Volkmar is world renowned and it has been one of my favorite class I've taken at Yale.",
    "There's pretty much no work but unless you put in the effort to go to the practicums and write a good essay there's no guarantee for an A. The class is also rather lassez-faire. You could learn a lot about autism, or nothing at all, depending on whether you choose to go to class.",
    "Take this class if you know someone with Autism. It will give you a chance to analyze what you have seen in an academic context.",
    "It is a really great class. Basically zero academic work until the final paper (15 pages; whatever you want relating to autism). However, you do have to devote one morning or afternoon (3-4 hours) to going to a school\/center for children or young adults with Autism, which is an incredible experience and is really what makes the course great.",
    "This course is a TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. I learned nothing about autism. The lectures are all over the place, prof. Volkmar is never there, and the placements ate stressful. This subject matter has so much potential, but volkmar's set-up is totally ineffective. I think prof. McPartland probably does a much better job.",
    "This was an interesting course, though it was sometimes repetitive between guest lecturers and hard to engage with so many different instructors. I wish Professor Volkmar had been in front of the class more often. The placement is an extremely valuable part of the course, and I liked that there was an emphasis on going into the field instead of necessarily doing readings and assignments, though I do think we could have benefited somewhat from making the readings more incentivized via discussion and so forth. When it came time to write the final paper, it felt like that was going to be 100% of our grade, which was a lot of pressure -- though it was also nice not to have a lot of work during the semester. Some guest lecturers were better than others; a favorite for me was the mother of an autistic child who came to speak. Overall I think the course just needs a bit more continuity in terms of material and instructors. Also, if you know something about autism coming in (which most people probably do), you might not end up learning all that much unless you push yourself to do the readings and explore new topics within autism in your paper."
