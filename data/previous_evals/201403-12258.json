   "comments": [
    "I'd recommend this course.. it's a bit of overlap from abnormal and health psych",
    "The idea and structure are awesome. Great practical experience, and the triad meetings were a fantastic way to practice helping skills. My problem is with the professor. She provided no explanation of how the grades would be calculated or what percentages different assignments would contribute to our final grade. Lectures were disorganized, as was the class overall. Expectations were not clearly communicated, either about what assignments we'd have to do over the course of the semester or about the details of individual assignments.",
    "Definitely would recommend if interested in clinical psychology. Weekly readings and 1 page single spaced reading responses, weekly journal responses to field placement. Field placement is for 1-2 hours a week. Enjoyable class, was able to learn and apply clinical\/helping skills.",
    "I would highly recommend this course if you can get in!",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class if you are able to get in. This class is usually year-long but we only had to commit to one semester. There requirements: a) go to a community mental health center field placement b) write a thought response and journal entry each week c) write a final paper. The weekly essays are not much but do require time commitment to get a good grade. Lockhart is incredible so so smart, sweet, and hilarious. Loved this class and it was one of the highlights of my Yale career.",
    "Yes take it if you can get in!! It is a great class and a unique experience to apply clinical skills in a real life setting!",
    "The course is an interesting overview of therapeutic helping skills as pertaining to clinical treatment of abnormal psychology. That said, it feels like a lot of information is jam-packed into a very short period of time. The course used to be a year long, and to fit it all into one semester is somewhat impractical. We also learned a great deal in our field placements, learning from people afflicted with mental illness in the communitythis was a unique and valuable experience and one that I was glad to have had. Oftentimes, it felt like what we were learning things that we already knewbut it turns out that a lot of the skills clinical psychologists use are common sense. Towards the end of the semester, what had otherwise been a reasonably low workload suddenly ramped up significantlybe prepared for a large paper at the end of the term, along with a final presentation and other end-of-semester wrap up assignments. In short, take this class if you're interested in clinical psychological work, but know that you may already have the skills you need to be a good helper.",
    "I would recommend this class for sure! However, you definitely have to have a real interest in the diagnosis, treatment, history, and stigmatization of mental illness, as well as a desire to commit to learning through experience how to help others. If you are looking to learn how to help people with mental illness, even in the smallest of ways, this class will teach you the practical skills to do so and give you experience acting as a helper. But you definitely have to be committed to this goal, as there is a pretty substantial out-of-class time commitment.",
    "This was the first year the course lasted just a semester rather than an entire year. I enjoyed it and felt that, in terms of course material, we were able to cover everything without feeling rushed. The field placement, however, would have been a more meaningful experience had the course lasted a year, especially since we did not begin the placements until mid-semester (as background checks took several weeks to be cleared). The field placement is what makes the class, and placement experiences vary, but it seemed like everyone got something out of their experience. I didn't find the course material terribly exciting, maybe because I was familiar with some of it previously, but it was a worthwhile class if you're interested in the practical applications of psychology.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who wants to gain practice experience in clinical psychology. The practicum portion of this course is where its real benefits lie. Most of the information presented in the actual class meetings is repetitive of other psychology classes like intro or abnormal. But, the information is re-framed through the lens of learning helping skills. This class gives you useful knowledge about how to listen and talk with people that anyone can use, regardless of if you plan on pursuing a career in clinical psychology."
