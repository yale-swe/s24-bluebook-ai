    "The course is tough and requires a lot of work. Unless you were very interested in the topic or required to take it I don't think I would recommend it. It was not as interesting as I had initial hoped and it didn't present as many new reactions as I thought it might.",
    "Yes, specially for those students in organic synthetic chemistry.",
    "a very hard class. you'll learn a lot, but be prepared to fail exams even though you knew all the material going into them.",
    "This class was solid. I would recommend it. The lectures were well put together. I learned about a lot of new reactions and about reactions I already knew about from a new perspective (like the Wittig and HWE olefinations, the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, and the Wolff-Kishner reduction).",
    "This class is absolutely essential, even to someone with a strong background in synthetic chemistry. The subtleties that are presented in this class with change the way in which one looks at reactions. This class is the first step to being able to solve those mechanism problems that the advanced students can solve so easily."

    "The course was helpful towards a possible future dissertation because of the synthetic material learned and it has deepened my knowledge to an extent but I feel if the pace had slowed and the course was more focused then it would help even more.",
    "It gives an overall knowledge in organic synthesis.",
    "learned useful mechanisms and learned how to discern mechanisms on the fly.",
    "The information in this class will be used in some way in almost every aspect of my research."
