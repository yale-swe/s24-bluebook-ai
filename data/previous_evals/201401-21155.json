    "A tough class but important pre-req. The work you do forces you to think creatively and problem solve in new ways. You will be frustrated but so rewarded with the completion of a model. Take advantage of your TA's! They're wonderful and there to help you brainstorm methods of model making as well as what you want to convey in each model.",
    "You will laugh, you will cry. You will get better at architecture, but you won't know how or why.",
    "Analytic Model is definitely a class for a dedicated architecture major, and not just a curious student. It is a huge amount of work, but if you're like me, you will find after this class that papers and exams suddenly seem incredibly mundane compared to the creativity and craft that goes into analytical model-making.",
    "When you take this, Emmanuel won't be teaching it, which is a shame. His enthusiasm, knowledge, and humor are hardly equaled. And in a class like this where you are going to be spending so much time on it, where he embodies the spirit of the class, it is a shame.",
    "Take this if you are an architecture major -- if you are not, take it only if you are willing to put in a lot of work and really really want to learn about architecture.",
    "The course is incredibly fast paced but Emmanuel teaches the material well. His lectures are really engaging and his critiques are constructive and helpful. I think what was lacking was getting taught the model making skills better. They way it worked out was that we figured it out as we went and that consumed a lot of unnecessary time. But overall the class was great.",
    "I would both warn against and recommend the class. You have to love it for it to be worth the time and effort.",
    "ARCH 249 is an extended investigation of a single piece of Architecture that lasts the course of an entire semester. The specificity and intensity of this process requires a great deal of concentration and abstract thought. The student benefits primarily from feedback concerning his\/her own analysis as well as from the exposure he\/she gets to the feedback others receive. I would only recommend this course to another student if that student is seriously interested in pursuing Architecture as a field of study.",
    "Analytic Model is a great class (also required if you're planning on applying for the Architecture Major). Unfortunately, Petit won't be teaching it anymore, but I hear the new profs are awesome as well. START YOUR MODELS EARLY. THEY TAKE SO MUCH LONGER THAN YOU THINK. Also, take advantage of your TF's. They're so amazing and are so incredibly helpful as long as you reach out to them.",
    "If you're intending to major in architecture, you will be taking this course. Otherwise this is definitely not a course I would recommend for someone not majoring (excessive work, overly specialized curriculum, often inaccessible lectures). For architecture majors, this class is a tough introductory class, as much of the understanding of the subject will come from simply trial and error. While sometimes discouraging, as no project will ever feel complete to you, if you commit the (very large) amount of time needed for this class, you'll come out of it with a large body of work and a technical knowledge of how to build, use 3D modeling software, and an understanding of materials. Don't put off the work ever, or you'll suffer from a hefty amount of all nighters, but if you commit to each project and invest in all your work, the class will be well worth the workload.",
    "Required for architecture majors, but I took it as a non-architecture major. Although it was definitely very tiring and stressful at (many) times, I don't regret the decision and really enjoyed learning what I did in this class. The woodshop is amazing and fun (especially when you're not there the pulling an all-nighter on Wednesday to finish a model), I got to learn how to use Photoshop, and Rhino, and how to laser cut designs and also got first-aid certified."
