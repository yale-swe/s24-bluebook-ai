My only suggestion would be to have at least two or three sessions in the computer lab to play a bit more with the software; I think this would be specially useful for those of us who were not familiar with it before the class.",
    "The format of the homework -- three chances -- properly emphasizes the learning process.",
    "The associated historical context readings Experience of the professor both in the theoretical and applied uses of the math we were discussing The approach of the material from various angles and in order to meet the learning styles of different students High relevance connections of all topics--allowed us to understand the fun and elegance in the math because it was also so clearly important and tangible the problem sets were challenging but extremely fair: I felt like they built very reasonably off of what we learned in class and then concretely demonstrated the applications and connections to the word problems\/real world contexts"

   "comments": [
    "The online discussion on Canvass on the book was not great. I think this kind of book is not conducive for a lively online debate. If I had to choose over reading E or having an online discussion, I would eliminate the latter and keep the former. Also, doing more practical exercises in class would be helpful to demonstrate the usefulness of the concepts we were learning.",
    "More frequent tie-ins between the concepts being learned and the real world scenarios to which they are applicable.",
    "The second half of the course maintained the breakneck speed of the first half, which was I think where difficulty arose because it was material that was more likely to have not been encountered by students before this course. Thus, we were learning the most advanced and complicated material during the busiest part of the semester, and were most likely to have not encountered it yet. I think that this is relatively inevitable, but maybe providing more background materials (more applied examples of ODE!) would at least mitigate the trickiness?",
    "The course was a little front loaded on calculus. In the future, an online interactive review of calc could occur simultaneously with the material in the course that was most new and useful (linear algebra\/ ODE and constrained optimization). More focus on these later topics would strengthen the overall value of the course. Also, the statistics and probability review was amazing. Integrating the math concepts we learned into these disciplines I think was one of the most useful things I learned all semester and this part of the course could definitely be built on. More use of R would be really great. I could imagine offering this same course, but with an optional 4th credit that integrated R into the course material with a 1 or 2 hour lab section each week. This could be great!",
