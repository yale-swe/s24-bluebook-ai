   "comments": [
    "If you have to take calculus, take this class. If not, don't.",
    "Definitely recommended if you want to progress with math or just need to knock the requirement out of the way. Lachowska is definitely a good professor to have.",
    "Its a great and pretty challenging class. I would recommend it for students who aren't very solid in math, as it strengthens the necessary skills for calculus and higher levels of math.",
    "I would rather have taken a different QR, but I needed to complete a calculus class. Take it only if you need it.",
    "It's classic intro calc class. Take it if you need to fulfill a math requirement.",
    "Be prepared to sit through a class where 75 percent of what you're taught will not really help you to do the homework. However, help sessions run in conjunction with the course are an excellent resource and infinitely more instructive\/helpful.",
    "Yes I would. It is a good intductory class.",
    "Good solid class that should be required for all students.",
    "Coming out of AP Calc AB the class was a pretty easy review. I would recommend this for students who are looking to take care of a requirement with an easy A.",
    "Math 112 is very good for people that really need a review of basic calculus, or are learning calculus for the first time. The class is very worthwhile, and anyone can learn a lot from it.",
    "It would probably be pretty tough to take without having taken calculus in high school.",
    "Math 112 is a review of a lot of the topics in AP Calc, so if you are able to accelerate past it, I would recommend it.",
    "Take it ONLY if you need Math for a prerequisite, otherwise it's a bit of a hassle."
