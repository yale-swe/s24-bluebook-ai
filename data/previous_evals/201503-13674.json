   "comments": [
    "The seminar focused on the rise and fall of medieval song forms, from their possible development out of dance to eventually becoming more closely associated with poetry than music. I would certainly recommend the class to another student, were it to be offered again.",
    "This course looks at the genre of the formes fixes across several centuries. I would recommend it, particularly to a student who is not necessarily interested in early music, as it gives a good foundation in literature and a way into understanding the period.",
    "Even if other students are not directly interested in medieval music, or French music, I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested at all in song. Although the repertoire of the course was very specific and well-defined, the professor did a great job of making connections to songs with refrains from other times and places, I thought. One particular strength of the course, I thought, was how many different musicological and music analytic topics were discussion vis-a-vis the formes fixes, which allowed students a lot of freedom in picking a final project that resonated with their own interests."

    "For me, this class offered exposure to an almost wholly unfamiliar time period. A lot of the material covered will certainly be useful moving forward, as it has inspired me to take a particular interest in songs.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of a specific area of my discipline."
