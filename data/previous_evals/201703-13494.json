   "comments": [
    "Interesting talks! Though quite few this semester",
    "not as useful as I would hope",
    "This seminar was pointless. We met like 3 times and the professors just asked \"Is there anything you want to tell us?\". It wasn't a productive use of anyone's time. Seminars should be more frequent and purposeful.",
    "I feel like this was an okay opportunity to meet and discuss SBS related issues, but could certainly be more frequent, and more structured. I feel like I am still hazy on course selection for next year, and didn't get as much face to face time with professors as I would have liked. A less formal and more mingle type seminar would be helpful at least once or twice within the semester.",
    "I wish we would have had section more frequently, as I would have loved to get to know the faculty and my fellow students more. I feel like this would have been a good chance to connect with my SBS cohort (especially if we could have eaten during section). The sections we did have were interesting though!",
    "monthly meetings don't make much of a seminar",
    "Good course that gave a wide exposure to speakers and industry trends.",
    "Good, could have been more frequent.",
    "Most of it was useless, especially for students who've had job experience (not even extensive experience). Perhaps make it more worthwhile with actual, real-world activities or maybe get rid of it",
    "Strengths: Engaging, interesting to hear from speakers coming in Not enough meeting times to have weaknesses",
    "The smaller seminars with more discussion were helpful, and it was nice to see other people in the department and talk about events\/improvement areas with Trace and other faculty. It would have been nice to have had better lunches, as we were told during the accepted students day that they provided healthy lunches during the seminars.",
    "Should be more consistent and offer food options other than sandwiches",
    "excellent class--I learned a lot!",
    "It was good, but seemed like other concentrations had more involved seminars. Would have liked more engagement.",
    "Fantastic guest lecturers. Only weakness was the inconsistency with when the seminars took place. Would have been great if they were every other week.",
    "The seminars throughout the semester were helpful and interesting. It may be improved if there were more of them - but I know there are limitations to the budget on this. Really appreciated the opportunity to meet with a speaker one-on-one, which was offered to any student who so desired.",
    "Only had a few seminars the whole semester with half of those few being a speaker, not much to say",
    "Strengths: The speakers were very interesting as they discussed topics we don't have the opportunity talk about in the classroom",
    "I enjoyed the course. It was interactive and engaging",
    "We only had two seminars if I recall correctly. One was advertised under a completely different title and topic. It seemed disorganized in general, but that was fine with me. Main complaint: there were insufficient options for people with dietary restrictions (allergies, vegetarian, lactose free, etc). I often couldn't eat during the seminar. Really not acceptable since simply planning better and more inclusive meals should be a given for a required lunchtime seminar.",
    "I enjoyed all the lectures!",
    "Strengths - we had some great speakers come in to talk about relevant public health experience, it was also a safe space to discuss our experience in the Yale MPH program Weaknesses\/Improvements - I felt like we did not really have that many speakers come in, having a more consistent speaker series would allow students to gain more from this seminar.",
    "The lectures were very engaging and relevant though the discussions were not particularly approachable if the professor with whom you have a concern is sitting in the room listening to the discussion. More approachable forums to voice concerns could be with just the chair of the department or with fewer teaching professors present.",
    "I only went to this course on two occasions, as it was only required for first-years twice. I was disappointed that the course was not more intensive. It would have been a wonderful opportunity to get to know other SBS students and faculty."

    "It's a requirement you have to do. It's no work, but it's not helpful either.",

    "highly recommend!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this for another student. Very informative.",
    "Though some of the seminars were mandatory for first year students, I would highly recommend going to any\/all of them. They give a good sample of possible topics of interest and about what is currently happening in terms of research in our field.",
    "This course was a series of lectures for first and second year students on varying topics. Some of the lectures were on current events while others were specific to our program and YSPH requirements.",
    "The series of seminars is an efficient way to meet all the faculty in SBS and also gain a comprehensive background in current research being conducted to explain various social determinants of health.",
    "It was very interesting",
    "A rewarding experience!",
    "This course is a great way to connect with fellow students in my department each week, and I would recommend it to other students. It is a great way to listen to talks as well as have lunch afterwards, and some of the sessions are used for voicing feedback directly from students as well.",
    "Useful for getting to know the department."
