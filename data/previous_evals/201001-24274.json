    "The material was interesting, and the coursework was not that difficult for the most part. I had very little bio background (only MCDB 120), but this did not seem to hinder me much. Admittedly, I often felt like I understood a little less than most others in the class because of it, but that was usually in regards to information which wasn't really significant to the main course material. As far as the exam, it was not bad and everything came from something explained in lecture.There was a final presentation and paper instead of a final exam, which is nice as well.",
    "Yes, but only if you have the proper chemistry background.",
    "I would recommend it. I have recommended it to every MB&B and Chem undergrad I know.",
    "TAKE IT! However, I would highly recommend taking biochem before hand because it assumes you have a pretty strong understanding of proteins in particular, and other biological processes\/topics.",
    "Half of the course is dedicated to lectures, followed by a 'final' exam that will stand your hair on end. Expect to be learning some seriously tough science. Following the lecture component you will prepare and deliver a presentation on a topic largely of your own choosing. You'll learn however much you want. In my case, I learned a lot. It's really worth it, and certainly a good class to take in pursuit of the major requirements."
