    "Very similar to L3. I'd say it was a worthwhile class, but if you don't love french and aren't planning on continuing French past L4, you might want to consider another class.",
    "French 140 is a great next step for those who have completed FREN 130. It follows logically from the preceding course with a moderate increase in difficulty and expectations from the instructors. The course is both well organized and interesting.",
    "Hard fourth level french. Do the work and you'll be fine, fall behind and it's hard to catch up.",
    "YES! Especially with Madame Santos, although she won't be teaching again next year. Fren 140 in general, though, is a great opportunity to expand your vocabulary, reading comprehension, and is a good review of grammar. You won't regret it, especially if your goal is fluency!"
