    "Very difficult, very time consuming, quite rewarding.",
    "Highly recommend, even if you have taken AP Computer Science. The workload is a little high, especially if you've never programmed before, but there are ample resources to ensure your success. By the end of the course, you'll have the ability to learn new languages by yourself, which really is an amazing thing. Start your PSets early, though, if you want to complete them successfully. Procrastination is especially dangerous in programming, where the stupidest bug can suck hours of your time.",
    "Take CS50. Do it.",
    "Ah, CS50. How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways, I hate thee for thy endless bait and switch Also--the problem sets were such a (fun way to spend every single Thursday night) I hate thee for thy gimmicky DJs. I hate thee, as with love I have for bae File I\/O, hash tables, and mallocing We learn char*, cause nothing is a string? I hate thee and have nothing else to say. I hate thee for thy switch to PHP I hate thee for thy cult (do not be fooled), I hate thee, though I took you credit d I hate Malan who wasn't overruled My heart heavy with things I cannot free() Don't take this or you'll certainly be schooled. Seriously, the only good thing about this class was my TA, Sam Levatich. If you're thinking of taking this class, do yourself a favor and stab yourself repeatedly while doing all of CodeAcademy instead. Good luck.",
    "This is the best course that I've taken so far. It's indeed challenging, but also rewarding. Just take it.",
    "yes good stuff to know",
    "Beware: this class is HARD and will eat up significantly more time than any other class at Yale.",
    "Great class, just be prepared to work. The 10-15 hour per week is not an overstatement like with many other classes. It's the most work I've put into a class and I'm a senior.",
    "SO MUCH WORK. Do not be fooled by the DJs, the parties, the cake. It is NOT as accessible as the professors and staff claim it to be. Be prepared to do a lot of work and NOT understand the concepts, still. That being said, the class is so so well organized. So much effort is put into it, and even if you are confused 99% of the time, you walk away learning so, so much.",
    "This is a difficult course that's jam-packed with information, most of which you'll have to teach yourself through practice and trial-and-error. I would definitely recommend that you take this only if you're taking three other classes (I took this with a 5-course schedule) and know you can spend hours trying to learn the material. I can't say I regret it though, because I did learn a lot of useful knowledge.",
    "Take this class if you are willing to work a lot. It definitely teaches you a lot but that comes at the cost of spending a lot of time on the problem sets. Very rewarding by the end but becomes a lot of work mid semester.",
    "A very interesting class, and fun at some points, but very work intensive. If you're heavy in extra curriculars, think twice before taking it. If you're an athlete, think twice before taking it. If you're a senior, think twice before taking it. Problems sets started easy but became much more frustrating and time consuming towards the end. Expect to spend at least 20 hours a week on the class, even if you take it credit\/d.",
    "It's a lot, but it's pretty cool what you'll be able to do by the end.",
    "I hesitate to recommend this class solely due to the workload. I dont know 1 person who took it and didnt struggle with it.",
    "Take CS50!!! It's a lot of work, but ABSOLUTELY worth it!",
    "Don't be fooled by the cake and high production value of the videos! This course isn't all fun and games. The psets get really long and hard about 4 weeks in. However, coming in with no programming experience, i feel like I walked away with a lot of introductory knowledge about something I was really clueless about before. So in that sense, it was definitely really rewarding.",
    "Take it! You'll learn to code and a bit more -- I feel like I got a lot out of this course. That being said, the work really ramps up around week 5, so don't get caught off guard. It is definitely not an \"easy\" course.",
    "CS50 is a lot of work for an intro course. That being said, talking to actual CS majors, it appears the workload is nothing compared to 223 or 323. There are a lot of resources out there if you have time to spend on them. It's probably helpful to get some basic programming knowledge (through Khan Academy or something), just to make the first few psets easier. But then, it goes into theoretical, and even those with a bit of experience (like myself) end up struggling. However, it was so worth it in the end, and might have turned me into CS major.",
    "Very hard. If you are completely new to the field, as I was, I recommend trying to take it at the same time as a friend with a bit of experience. I often found that I would have a tiny problem in my code that a more experienced friend would spot -- without this type of regular but minimal help it would have been difficult to move on with each problem.",
    "All-online character of the course gives it great flexibility, so long as you trust yourself to keep on track with the lectures (if you fall behind too much and you don't already know what you're doing, you could be screwed). As someone who had very little CS experience before the course, felt that it was extremely difficult and did not do a good enough job helping newcomers to the subject. That said, this was the first time it was taught at Yale and I hope that the next iteration does a better job of that. Gave me some of the most difficult nights I've had so far in college, and a lot of stress given that I wasn't able to complete some problem sets (which, as long as you invest a lot of effort, isn't a disaster) but taught me a ton. Now that I'm through it, I'm happy I took it. If you've taken AP CS in high school or anything else higher, I'm sure you'll be fine. If you haven't, be prepared to put in a lot of hours (I'd guess I averaged 15-20 hours per problem set, excluding the first couple).",
    "Beware, this class is much much harder than you will be lead to believe. At first, they give you cake! They show you funny videos in class! There's a DJ! But the material is actually intensely difficult for someone without any background in computer science, and in many cases the relentless emphasis on We! Are! Fun! actually hindered my learning experience. They will lure you in with fanfare and pomp, and by making the first few weeks much, much easier than the rest of the semester will be. But the course soon grows difficult at an alarming rate. The lectures are not helpful in teaching you what you'll actually have to do on the problem sets. There is a large staff of student TFs who try to be helpful, but they're undergraduates, not professional teachers, and so there's a limit to how effective they can be. As a result, you will spend much of your time teaching yourself the material. Do not take CS50 unless you are prepared to spend a minimum of 15 hours a week on this class. I took this as a fifth class because of the way it had been marketed to me, expecting it to be a fun and interesting course to take on top of my already full schedule of in major classes. It ended up being more work than my other classes combined. Did I learn a lot? Yes. Was it worth the toll on my emotional, psychological, and physical health? Absolutely not.",
    "A hard course for a beginner in CS, but also with a great learning curve.",
    "This is hard and takes up more time than any other class I've ever taken at Yale, and I'm an engineering major who's taken real classes. Be warned. If you want to learn comp sci, go for it, but don't try to make this one of many hard classes like I did.",
    "Intensive CS introduction.",
    "Maybe. Depends how interested they were in the topic.",
    "CS50 is an amazing intro to computer science. 10 out of 10 would recommend to a friend. Do not be completely fooled by the promises of cake and free t-shirts, this is an actual class with actual work. However, you get out what you put in. This is a great opportunity, TAKE IT if you ever get the chance (even if you aren't a comp sci major).",
    "A challenge for sure, but if you can stick it out and handle 20 hours of class and work a week, then you'll thank yourself. Don't take it as a casual 5th credit like I did or you'll be kicking yourself all semester.",
    "This is a very difficult class for true beginners. It requires a great amount of work, but it is extremely rewarding if you stick to it.",
    "It was much more challenging than advertised, and I would not recommend this class to another student if they're looking for an introduction to programming.",
    "A lot of work but an excellent intro to computer science. Lessons are occasionally hard to follow but are for the most part understandable and engaging.",
    "I would say if you have a mathematical mind, you should take it. You really have the opportunity to learn a lot.",
    "SO HARD. Somewhat unreasonable for beginner programmers but rewarding to have completed it.",
    "So much work. Ridiculous. You learn a lot but it's baptism by fire.",
    "I know I may be in the minority, but I loved CS50. I learned so many things, and I made so many things. Yes, it takes more time than they'll lead you to believe at the beginning of the course. But no, it's not impossible. Just plan to spend a lot of time (10+ hours\/week) on this course, and you'll learn a crucial skill. It also does help if you have some quantitative background, but it also isn't completely necessary. Psets do take a while, but that's when the real learning happens.",
    "Do not take this class! It is incredibly frustrating, unnecessarily time consuming, and lessons and concepts are poorly explained. This class is fun for the first two weeks and then the cs figure it out yourself culture kicks in. Maybe that would have happened in any class, but cs50 markets itself as different, which it isn't. I did not feel I got enough out of this class to justify what I put in. TFs were often sarcastic instead of helpful, though some were much better teachers than others.",
    "Tough question, but if you are willing to put in a huge amount of work it is a great introduction to coding.",
    "I really enjoyed CS50! It was definitely a challenging course, but the amount of material we learned throughout the semester was amazing. I had fun doing all of the psets, and the final project was a great way to experiment with the skills I had gained. Also, the TAs are incredibly helpful--office hours were a fantastic resource. Definitely recommended if you want a relatively fast-paced but highly rewarding programming course.",
    "I liked it. I think the course gave me a solid enough foundation in computer science that I more or less know what computer science is and I can learn new things as they arise. The psets take a long time, but I liked doing them and office hours are very helpful."
