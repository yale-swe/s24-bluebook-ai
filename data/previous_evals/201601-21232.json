    "A good, solid basic class that might be more engaging for people who are deeply interested in the topic, but is not terribly challenging if you just need to fulfill a biology requirement and have some interest.",
    "Great class. Take it with Near and Turner if you can. Exam material can be very random, but the lectures and section are great.",
    "This is a very good class. Not too much work (though exams are certainly not easy), not particularly stressful. Professor Near was my favorite of the two professors, with his high-energy, high exposition style of teaching. Professor Turner is knowledgeable and a good professor, but his style of teaching makes it easy to zone out (which is bad because his lectures are more technical and tended to be harder to follow). You will find that it is generally pleasant, at times a bit dull, but a class that will give you a fair amount of knowledge and understanding of important topics in Evolutionary Biology.",
    "I loved this course, which is saying something because I took this my senior year to fulfill a prereq! It was the best intro-level bio course I've taken at Yale, and greatly, greatly outperformed my expectations. The material is engaging and exciting, and the course covers all of the major topics in evolutionary biology. I was so happy to go to lecture every week. In addition, the sections for this class were the best sections I've ever had. Larry (my TA) made them so fun and engaging that I was excited to go to section and discuss papers every week. Overall 10\/10 would take again, and highly recommend.",
    "You've got your evolutionary\/geologic history scattered throughout the course, some fast-paced lecturing about population genetics and quantitative genetics, very detail-oriented exams at times (more on prof Turner's material), sometimes, a general no-idea-what-I'm-supposed-to-be-getting-out-of-this, a one-page literature summary per week, three midterms, a final midterm, and a pleasantly ambivalent feeling toward evolutionary biology. You learn a lot about fish and virus phylogenetics because - surprise, surprise - those are the coteachers' jams. some of it's cool, but you're probably taking it because you have to. if you come in having had an AWESOME intro evolutionary bio class (like with prof.Buss), the life history stuff will be boring. best part: phylogenetics. the end.",
    "Pretty dry, but interesting material and necessary for the E&EB major.",
    "Not a gut.",
    "Great lecturers, interesting readings, not too many assignments. It's a lovely class to take no matter what your major is.",
    "Take it because you have to and it will be doable.",
    "Would highly recommend, even if it is not a major requirement. Near and Turner are engaging and the subject is interesting. Both professors rank as some of the best at Yale.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class. I went into it expecting an okay but required lecture (I'm generally much more interested in ecology) and ended up loving it. The material is very interesting and relevant.",
    "Evolution is great! The material is interesting and I'd definitely recommend it to other students!",
    "EEB 225 is a great introduction to evolutionary biology, and I recommend it for all those considering EEB and as an option for those are looking for a pre-med biology class. Both professors are very good lecturers, and the weekly papers help you delve deeper into concepts learned in class. Section, unlike section for many other courses, is not a waste of time, and the TA's do try to make sure you actually understand what it is the papers, and you do get a chance for some interesting discussions in section.",
    "This is a good, not too boring, fairly easy descriptive biology class. If you're looking for something fascinating, I would point you towards a class like Plant Diversity, Ornithology, or Biology of Terrestrial Arthropods, where you'll learn a lot of the same concepts but in a specific field and in a much more interesting manner. Obviously, this is an intro course that is required for the EE&B major, so you may not have a choice in taking it. I personally took it as an easy sixth class for my science major.",
    "Really interesting introduction to Evolutionary Biology. Not a gutyou'll have to work. But the material is fascinating!",
    "An interesting science course even for non-science majors. The lectures are more story-like than your typical science course. The arc of the material may not seem linear, but that's okay because it's an overview of a broad subject.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're interested in the subject matter or need to fulfill a Science Requirement. Evolutionary Biology was a course with interesting information taught in a straight-forward manner. Professor Turner is one of the best science professors I've had at Yale. He did an incredible job of explaining material, engaging the class, and answering students' questions. With Professor Near it was sometimes unclear what information was relevant and what was anecdotal\/supplementary. So that was frustrating, but overall, he was also a decent lecturer. The textbook is also incredibly helpful and very well-written. Overall, would recommend this course.",
    "It was a good class with engaging lectures and course material. I'm not a STEM major, so I found it to be quite difficult, but ultimately worthwhile. I thought exams were quite difficult, perhaps unnecessarily difficult, but perhaps other students' experiences were different from mine. The sections were well-led and structured.",
    "Interesting, thorough overview of an important topic. The professors are really kind, cool, and good at explaining the material. It's probably only slightly harder for non-biology majors.",
    "This is an excellent overview of Evolutionary Biology and an exciting way to get a glimpse of the subjects in the E&EB major. I came away from the class feeling like I know how to \"think\" from an evolutionary lens as opposed to merely memorizing content.",
    "A great science credit. I really learned a huge amount about a very interesting topic in contemporary biology."
