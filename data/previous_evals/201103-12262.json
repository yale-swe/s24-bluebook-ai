    "Definitely. Think of it as a book club on world events.",
    "Great professor, great class, great classmates. great readings and amazing in-class discussion.",
    "Great class. Take it!",
    "I absolutely recommend this class. It's basically a book club, where you hang out once a week and talk about a book on some current affairs. The books are all very well chosen, and while the reading gets burdensome throughout the semester the work never feels too overwhelming, and you can volunteer your presentations to be during an easier week for you. The one thing that I disliked was how we were all completely in the dark about our grades the entire semester. Stathis is very bad about giving feedback about your weekly memos, so I had very little idea of where I was at. When I check my grade, I'm going to have no idea how I got it. If you care about grades at all, this may drive you a bit crazy, but if you just want to learn about current affairs and become a knowledgeable person, take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. There are few classes at Yale that teach so much on so many subjects without sacrificing depth and specificity. The class came from a wide range of fields and backgrounds, which made discussion great. Professor Kalyvas is very domineering in discussions, which can be frustrating if you are used to more lax seminar discussions, but its worth it to hear his analysis of current events. A lot of the discussions are run in a socratic method, which makes the course more demanding. You have to read a book a week, and write a memo, which is a lot of work, but most of the books are interesting and well-written. Its great to be able to say at the end of a semester that you have read thirteen books, on everything from sovereign debt to Pakistan to Ancient Rome.",
    "I would highly recommend the class! One of the best I've taken at Yale. Professor Kalyvas is truly a delight to listen to, and though he may be very opinionated, he's incredibly smart and engaging. He also cares about every one of his students individually, giving each person as much attention as they want. If you get into this class and don't take it, you'll regret it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Although one book per week may sound daunting at first, it will definitely be worth your time and energy.",
    "Global Politics is an awesome class. However, be prepared to put in some serious reading time if you want to get anything out of this course. Also, Professor Kalyvas is not good at giving feedback on reading responses, so be prepared to finish the semester without a very good idea of exactly what grade you will get.",
    "Polical\/economic book club. You'll learn a lot about the issues today but it is a lot of readin and you have to do it! Worth it."
