    "It's very rigorous and has many assignments throughout the week, which may be difficult to get a hold of in the beginning.",
    "Strengths of the course include the enthusiasm of the teachers, the high involvement of the students in the lessons, and the visual aids. However, the course moved a bit quickly and became quite challenging after lesson 9; being more methodical in explanation of lesson 9 and onwards could benefit the course overall.",
    "Various ways of teaching were a strength. Could be improved by having more partner activities.",
    "It's a great class and has a lot of interactions to practice Japanese.",
    "Everything is great!",
    "The course was very well taught and the teachers focused a lot on making sure that the students were able to practice the material learned sufficiently.",
    "I would like to have them work out grammar on the board. I had trouble retaining the grammar rules when it was only on the presentation slides."
