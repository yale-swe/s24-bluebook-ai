   "comments": [
    "No, I wouldn't.",
    "Took it for a science credit, and was maybe lured into a false sense of security by the other p-set class I've taken, Math 115, which was far, far, more difficult but did teach me that P-SET CLASSES ACTUALLY TEACH WHAT IS ON THE P-SETS. G&G 205, however, does not. But hey, if you're down with somehow teaching yourself random, sometimes obscure bits of scientific calculation (not that that will help with the midterm, which is a whole other kettle of fish from both the lecture and p-sets), the lecture itself really is interesting, even a bit fun at times--it goes by faster than other 75 minute lectures.",
    "Good course if this is what you are interested in, but check it's what you are looking for. Many people were surprised by the content of the class and expected something different from the title of the course. It's also quite some work because of the long problem sets that ask sometimes random facts that are very hard to find. The problem sets were graded very harshly and I don't know what grade to expect.",
    "Natural Resources is a great course for non-stem majors. Though the problem sets can get a bit technical, there are only 6 of them and TAs are your best resources. The final poster presentation was very enjoyable as it was my first time creating such a thing. It helped me think in a scientific hypothesis-driven way.",
    "There may be better courses out there but you should learn this information somehow to be informed about global energy concerns.",
    "This is a course to take if you are interested in the course material. It is not overly-difficult, but it is time-consuming. I would definitely recommend.",
    "Interesting content and science course but not super easy. Really nit-picky grading on tests and psets which make the class low-key challenging unfortunately.",
    "For those interested in energy, this course is fundamental to the understanding of that industry.",
    "Agh - I took this as a requirement, but if you don't have to, choose something else. While the material is very interesting, it is dry. You should know that going in.",
    "Great option if you are looking for a science credit. It's not as easy as some science classes, but it is much more interesting and will seem much more worthwhile at the end of the course. Professor Ague is great.",
    "A vaguely interesting course without too much work.",
    "Good intro course on the topic, if you have any background in: climate change, fossil fuels, or renewables, be prepared for a very repetitive course.",
    "This course is alright. I took it for my science credit. There isn't all too much work. The material is somewhat engaging. Ague is a good professor. Study for the midterm. It's a big chunk of your grade and may be more difficult than you expect. Otherwise, a decent experience.",
    "I would DEFINITELY recommend this class! It is interesting and relevant. Hands down one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The material is not too difficult and it is a great science credit.",
    "G&G 205 is an interesting and eye opening course - I feel like I learned a lot throughout the year. Prof Ague is and interesting lecturer and very approachable, and uses a lot of applicable examples. It's not a ton of work though the problem sets can be kind of annoying - try to find a friend you can do them with.",
    "excellent overview course for people who are interested in sustainability\/environmental science, for science and non-science majors alike.",
    "G&G 205 was overall a good course. It gave me a good overview of the most important sources of energy and natural resources. The field trip to the power plant and the tour of Yale campus was great. The Psets require some basic chemistry knowledge,and do not require in depth knowlege of the topics taught during the lecuture. The final poster project was a fun way end the semester, and I feel like I learned a lot from it about the process of making scientific posters. My main criticism of the course is that it is not very scientifically rigorous. If you are looking to be a STEM major, maybe consider taking one of the higher number G&G classes.",
    "Good course if you're interested in the environment, which is more relevant now than ever. Great way to get a science credit out of the way (if you're not a STEM major) and learn something useful in the process."
