   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, for anyone who likes any work of the Brontes. The reading list (for anyone who likes any of the Brontes) is fantastic, starting with the more famous works but giving you a chance to get a taste of all three sisters. Professor Peterson is a wonderful seminar professor, keeping the class moving and engaged, and she offers a taste of all different approaches to the Brontes--film, criticism, biography, cultural studies, poetry, whatever you like. Not too much reading, and it's pleasurable to begin with.",
    "You should take this class! Professor Peterson is a gem among professors. But only take it, I think, if you are an English\/Lit major; if you are not used to writing English papers, a senior seminar will be a shock to your system, as it's quite demanding.",
    "Yes. It was interesting, if you like the Brontes.",
    "This class focuses largely on novels by the Brontes, with very little attention paid to their afterlives. If you're into New Criticism this class might be frustrating at times because Professor Peterson is a big fan of historicism and you'll be reading and watching a fair amount of biographical works. Overall it was not my favorite English course, but the writing assignments are very doable and structured in such a way that the final paper is by no means overwhelming. Workshopping final papers was definitely the highlight of the course for me.",
    "If you like any of the Bronte sisters, take this class. The reading is pretty much the expected, but we discussed things from a different perspective than I ever had, and I found the course to be really valuable. Professor Peterson was very helpful with the senior essay.",
    "English 431, The Brontes and their Afterlives, is a course which studies the Bronte sisters and all their main works. It also discusses, to a lesser extent, derivative works. The bulk of the work is in the lengthy reading and the 20-25 page paper due at the end of the semester. I would recommend it to Bronte-interested English majors (or a very serious Bronte lover), but don't take it if you aren't up for the paper.",
    "Yes-Professor Peterson is a great teacher--engaging, supportive, and always available for help--and the material of the course is extremely interesting.",
    "In English 431, you read the vast majority of the Bronte works, usually one book per week, occasionally one book every two weeks. It's a fun, discussion-based course, and you have a lot of freedom for your essay assignments. I would recommend it if you are interested in the course material.",
    "This course is what the title promises: a survey of the Bront\u00ebs. Don\u0092t expect too much study of their afterlives (we only read one of them), but that\u0092s not necessarily a bad thing. I would recommend this course to another student mostly because of the strength of Linda Peterson\u0092s teaching. She\u0092s wonderful to have in seminar. She both shares her insights and makes you feel comfortable expressing your own thoughts. Also, she does a really good job pacing the writing load, so that if you write the shorter papers with your term paper in mind (and produce a good rough draft of the latter), you don\u0092t have to be too stressed at any one point. The reading load is sometimes heavy, and the Bront\u00ebs write a very specific type of literature, but you couldn\u0092t havea better guide to it."
