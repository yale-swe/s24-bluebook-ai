   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this class.",
    "Maybe. Not my favorite class.",
    "This is vague seminar. Discussion can be scattered as it is not directed toward studying specific objects, but rather about bouncing from topics of theory to case studies to issues of race, culture, etc. I found it difficult to be engaged in.",
    "A good class if you'd like to learn about the theory of material culture and consumerism. If you like sociology or are interested in theories about consumerism in our culture today, this is the class for you. I don't think you'd want to take this if you're looking for a real history course - look elsewhere. You'll be knee deep in theory and complicated readings before you are able to realize what you've gotten yourself into.",
    "History through objects as opposed to texts - this is a completely new way of addressing the subject and a very valuable one. I learned a great deal and, through my final project, studied a topic about which I care deeply.",
    "If this class plans to make an exhibition at the end, think twice about taking \"A Cultural History of Things.\" The ideas and subjects are fascinating, but you will spend a lot of your free time on the final paper, as it includes examining four different objects. I also want to stress that while this class seems like you will be examining chairs, Beanie Babies and McDonald's the whole time, this class is predominantly based on theory. It is very dense theory, so the seminar discussions often devolve into general object discussions of race, religion or materiality. Make sure that you do all of the readings and have a clear passion for a collection of objects you love.",
    "I would recommend this class to a person who is truly interested in theory and its application to material culture. I thought the readings were incredibly difficult to understand and felt lost at many times, but in the end truly appreciated what I had learned.",
    "Sure. We read a lot of theory, which was interesting but often overwhelming, but did read some much more enjoyable case studies and sociological works, which were fascinating. We had a lot of freedom when designing our midterm and final projects, and I'm definitely glad I took it. Professor Yokota is very helpful and supportive.",
    "This class was not what I expected and was very disappointing; the course as a whole was disorganized. (Additionally, we did not get to put together an exhibition, in the end, which was one of the most appealing advertised aspects of the syllabus.) Readings, and consequently, discussions, were lacking, and each week I left class feeling empty and sad. Don't be convinced by the hoards of shoppers that you should take AMST 424--you'll be wasting valuable Yale time."
