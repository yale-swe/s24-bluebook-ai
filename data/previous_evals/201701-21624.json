   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about poverty alleviation strategies. First and foremost, my thoughts about what defined poverty changed dramatically. I like the idea of defining poverty in terms of capability deprivation instead of income or nutritional deficiencies.",
    "I really enjoyed the group memo project during which we focused on one country- I had previously not studied Latin America at great length and being able to go in depth with learning about Colombia was fascinating. In this course, students learn about the effectiveness and structure of a variety of poverty alleviation methods.",
    "The role of different kinds of program targeting in the success of poverty alleviation strategies. Great insight onto the political and economic proceses behind implementing social programs. Knowledge of the role of institutions in shaping poverty.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about the various factors that contribute to development, particularly in Latin American countries. I came in with little to no knowledge about what makes an effective antipoverty policy or the policy elements that aid in a country's economic development, but I left with fairly extensive knowledge in both areas. Professor De La O has seemingly endless knowledge about development, the causes of poverty, the politics and economics of poverty alleviation, and how effective policy gets enacted, and she does a great job of translating that knowledge into a digestible and understandable form for her students to understand.",
    "The ability to read through complicated and conflicting texts, insight into the complicated yet promising world of poverty alleviation, more about the importance of developing careful policies and the danger of making generalizations.",
    "This was excellent for considering a wide range of studies going deep into a topic. Weighing arguments was really important here, and we certainly benefited from a semester of that. Great course!",
    "I'm not a Political Science major, so this was one of only a handful of PLSC classes that I've taken at Yale. Accordingly, the knowledge that I gained from this course was primarily centered around the various political dimensions of poverty alleviation. We also went more in depth into specific country cases in group assignments and in a final paper. Through this process, I became fairly well acquainted with some of the current events in my country of focus. Additionally, this course introduced me to Amartya Sen's definition of poverty alleviation, which I really enjoyed learning about.",
    "Through this course, I gained insight into some issues on the politics of poverty alleviation (such as education, micro lending, etc.) as well as the formal political economy theory behind this. While I had had exposure to much of the material in the first half of the course through prior coursework, I thought the class was still worthwhile for the space it provided to read important authors in the field and discuss them, as well as to study a country in more depth through the memos."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course are that the readings are relevant and intriguing, the professor is an incredible resource and expert, and the workload is manageable. The weakness of this course is that it limits the amount of students who can take it (though I did like the seminar format... maybe it could be offered both semesters?)",
    "The professor does a great job choosing the students for the class- everyone is very engaged for the most part. It was a dynamic course and the professor leads the section very well.",
    "Honestly amazing seminar class. The quality of discussion was so impressive! The only improvement I can think of is that the group memos were a little bit frustrating sometimes since people didn't hand stuff in on time, but I don't see that as a weakness of the course itself.",
    "I really enjoyed this course, and I think that it is strong in just about every area. The only criticism I would offer is that there was not enough instruction or guidance provided in the syllabus for the memos and final policy paper. We discussed each briefly in class, but I still felt a little lost for each of the projects. Additionally, we did not receive grades back for any of our memos, and so it was difficult to tell how we were doing in the class. These were not significant issues, though, when it came to learning the content of the course, so overall I would say that it was still a great experience.",
    "I wish the movie resources were more easily accessible. Also, the course tended to focus on poverty alleviation in Latin America and not internationally. I would have liked to see more international case studies other than Latin America and a few countries in Africa.",
    "It's an excellent course with an enjoyable group project that allows students to take a deeper dive in particular countries. So that was definitely a strength. The main weakness, I would say was the lack of feedback. I wish I knew what the assessment of our memos or group presentations were. It was hard making decisions throughout the semester when I only knew my midterm grade. We asked for more feedback and Prof. De La O simply said it was fine.",
    "Strengths: excellent syllabus, extremely knowledgeable professor, engaging midterm question and final project. Recommendations: Eliminate or substantially reframe the group project, or at least gut the presentations. Individual presentations or classroom discussions would help more, I think.",
    "I really enjoyed the seminar aspect of the course - it was great to be able to discuss the material in a small setting and take advantage of the other students' knowledge bases. I also appreciated the group assignments. Group work can be a little challenging, but I think it's also a really valuable way to (1) get to know other students in the class better and (2) be forced to engage with the material in a slightly different way than you would otherwise.",
    "Strengths: Interesting readings, manageable course and reading load, and a professor that excelled at leading discussion. While students came in from a variety of backgrounds and prior exposure to development, I would say that class discussions were overall quite strong. Weaknesses: Emphasis on team work in the course, so one's experience there can depend on the team (though mine was great); I wish we had dedicated more time to the material in the second half of the course, as in the first half it was a bit of review from prior development courses. I also had wished the professor had more office hours and was somewhat more approachable out of class."

   "comments": [
    "I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course if you are passionate about the subject. The readings are fascinating and the professor facilitates discussion so that it flows seamlessly.",
    "10\/10 WOULD RECOMMEND! If you get into this seminar, then congratulations, you're doing Yale right. TAKE IT. This has been one of the most engaging seminars I've taken here. Professor De la O is a caring, brilliant professor who has an insane capacity to lead discussion successfully. It was a joy to do the readings for this class knowing the depth with which we were going to discuss them. Incredibly interesting topics on the modern implications of poverty alleviation, made me think of development in ways I had never thought about before!",
    "PEPA is an amazing EPE seminar especially for seniors. It changes the entire way you think about poverty and poverty alleviation.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you are interested in development and poverty alleviation strategies. Professor De La O is a fantastic instructor, and classes were always interesting and lively - the readings, too, were usually enjoyable and quite informative, especially since I had never before taken a class on poverty alleviation. Be prepared to do the readings every week, because if you don't you'd really be missing out on everything the class has to offer.",
    "Pretty interesting class. The best part is absolutely the class discussions during section. Really interesting to hear Ana De La O's opinion on different aspects of poverty alleviation. Frequent group projects in this class, but they aren't overly difficult. Otherwise a pretty normal poly sci seminar focused on poverty alleviation. If you can't get into this, take Development Under Fire for similar work in a lecture setting.",
    "This course teaches you a lot about poverty from a broad prospective. If you want to go in depth with any of the topics the Professor discusses throughout the course, she gives you the liberty to do so in your final paper and within each of your memos which is nice.",
    "Great course!",
    "Great seminar. Interesting readings. Bearable group project. Actual poverty alleviation strategies that aren't just gimmicky rich Yale student's views on all poverty in other countries. Midterm. 3 Memos. 2 presentations. The final essay. Prof. De La O may not give you all the feedback you need sometimes but she's a knowledgeable professor.",
    "This is a good analysis of some of the major policy questions in Latin America. Especially good if you have some econometric background to really push back on the studies we read, or some experience to draw on in poverty alleviation in developing countries. Particularly worth noting: this is not about US poverty policy or anything like it!",
    "Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone interested in poverty alleviation. I felt like this course gave me many opportunities to learn, and also afforded me the freedom to explore the issues that were most interesting to me. I'm very glad that I was able to participate.",
    "I took this course having taken a few others in development (such as Prof. Thachil's Development in South Asia class), and overall I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the readings, professor, and relaxed classroom atmosphere, and particularly enjoyed the discussions we had in political economy on issues such as clientelism and corruption. The group memos are interesting and not burdensome if you have a good group, and the final paper provided a great opportunity to explore issues of interest from the course in greater depth. This is a great course to fulfill the Political Systems requirement for EP&E, and I would recommend it to students interested in development so long as you don't mind overlap with previous study in the first half of the course. Given that ECON 325 (Economics of Developing Countries) may not be offered again, this course will actually allow you to engage with substantive issues in development, as opposed to other courses that just focus on RCT methodology."
