    "Take it, but make sure you have the time and will. It is a class that demands investment. But also, it is a pleasant So credit!!",
    "A very interesting and solid introduction to linguistic anthropology. The lectures are split up over about four topics (although there is a lot of mixing): language and gender, standardization\/language and class, language and race, and language and nationalism. The readings are varied, straightforward, engaging, and not particularly difficult, although the themes can sometimes get a bit redundant and the overarching topics can seem overly drawn out if they're not exactly exciting to you. Lectures aren't particularly exciting, but they're overall quite good. Examples from the reading are used and discussed heavily, making lectures easy to follow and keeping the readings relevant. This class will make you think a lot about why you do what you do when you do it, as any good survey\/intro-type anthropology course should. Highly recommended if socio\/anthropological linguistics seems interesting to you--there aren't many courses on the subject taught here, and this is a good exposure to the discipline.",
    "This course will definitely change the way you think about language and language use in culture. I came into the course from a more structural linguistics background and it radically changed the way I think about language in everyday discourse and as a cultural force. You will also become more adept at critically reading anthropological and sociological articles and analyzing their ideas logically. A definite yes for anyone interested in language and anthropology.",
    "It is worth sitting through the linguistic-wonk lectures at the beginning, especially if one is interested in how language relates to gender, class, race, and its implications on education and if Andrew is still the TA. Beware that Errington is a tough grader.",
    "Review\/exploration of how culture, language, and identity define\/construct one another.",
    "Yes, as long as you are certain you're interested in the subject manner. I found the second half of the course much more interesting than the first.",
    "Looks at the interplay of gender, race, class, etc and how that's reflected in language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. If you make the effort to get to lecture and do the readings (I didn't; wish I had), it will be a really interesting course, with a broad appeal to students of all majors. If you don't think you'll do the reading, don't take it.",
    "The course does a good job of balancing theory with hard sociolinguistic data as a means of informing students not only about language stereotypes and language's relationship with identity (which are interesting in themselves), but about the ways that anthropologists and sociolinguists gather this data and about the ways we can see the thought processes these data reflect in our every day lives. It sounds pretty trite, but this course opened my eyes to a lot of linguistic things going on around me, as well as making me more interested in pursuing more anthropology classes. The reading is not much and the papers are fun and pretty easy to write. Prof. Errington is good, but a little tired, it seems. The first few lectures might seem boring and too theoretical, but I promise you the course gets better and more concrete if you stay past shopping period.",
    "This is a class about the relationship between language and what we think of ourselves and others. Take it."
