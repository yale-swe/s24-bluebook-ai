    "YES, definitely! It's a great class and Lee\uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8is just the cutest thing ever. Her enthusiasm will make you want to go to class even if it's at 9:25. The class is a bit harder than 110 just because the grammar gets more tricky but it's still a pretty fun class. Also, we get to have a taste of Korean food since the Lee\uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8would bring us food occasionally and they are delicious. TAKEE IT!",
    "I loved this class!! LEE SSN IS THE BOMB.",
    "Basically a continuation of Korean 110. Angela Lee-Smith is still adorable, the food she brings to class is still delicious, and Mina still won't go on a date with Andy.",
    "Pretty much your basic language course. The class will give you a pretty good grasp of the language.",
    "I would definitely recommend KREN 120 with Professor Lee-Smith. You learn a lot and each class is interesting. Professor Lee-Smith makes learning Korean interesting. Be prepared to participate in class a lot, although everyone participates almost equally, so there is no pressure. It is a very low-stress environment and you learn how to communicate effectively.",
    "If you're looking to take a new language and has no preference, take Korean! It's a relatively easy language, and the professor is great!",
    "Korean 120 was something of an esteem boost compared to the first semester. I felt like my vocabulary became much more grounded and applicable, and grammar forms were readily integrated into classroom conversation. SSN Lee-Smith is one of those really special professors--she's lively and helpful, and loved to spoil us by bringing in homemade Korean food. The class has a great vibe, and the solidification of our language skills this semester allowed us to engage in enjoyable conversation. This class has a good amount of work, but you'll surely do well on exams if you keep up with the homework.",
    "Korean 120 is a fun class that I would definitely recommend to another student.",
    "If you have any interest in Korea whatsoever, do yourself a favor and take this class!! You absolutely won't regret it. It has been my favorite class at Yale, hands down."
