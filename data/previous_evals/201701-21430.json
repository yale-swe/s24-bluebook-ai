    "I was able to write a few fiction stories. I learned what pitfalls other people have in writing fiction and know how to apply it to my own work.",
    "I learned how to give constructive criticism on students' fiction writing, as well as to be open to receiving feedback.",
    "My writing got better.",
    "Primarily I think what I learned was how to look at my writing from the perspective of the reader rather than from my own. Having the beginning of my novel workshopped in an effective way was enormously helpful with respect to understanding how my story comes off to other people, and where the gaps are.",
    "It's really helpful to learn how to write fiction through a workshop format."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: you can write whatever you want. You have free reign of topics and style. You can polish a piece. Weaknesses: writing quality greatly varies. Some suggestions are not so good and some people relied on others to print out their work, etc. many people were not dedicated to the class.",
    "The structure of the course was such that at least three students had their fiction pieces workshopped every class session. On days when four or five students had to go, time was tight.",
    "It really depends on who enrolls and not everyone took it seriously enough for the course to be truly successful",
    "The allocation of time for discussing students' workshop pieces isn't designed and maintained properly. Some students can much more time for their pieces. Some students also take up too much time talking."

   "comments": [
    "I think this class greatly varies by semester. This semester, it wasn't great. The strangest thing about this class was the variation in writing quality. There were 3-4 very good writers, a few okay-pretty good writers, and a few writers that leave you kind of sad and confused. The feedback also varied. Some was great. Some made you scratch your head. Professor Choi gives good feedback and is very nice. I enjoyed hearing what she had to say. But a lot of people just didn't really take the class seriously and were generallly not fun to work with in a workshop setting. Oh, no readings too. Workload is low.",
    "Would definitely recommend.",
    "take this course if you want to be a writer",
    "Absolutely, especially if you are planning to move forward with writing after college. It is immensely valuable.",
    "Yes. Regardless of the instructor and some rather harsh students, the course itself is a necessity for any disciple of fiction writing.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who was looking to be able to write very freely (like if you are an unconventional writer) and get feedback on their writing. I would not recommend this course for someone who wanted rigorous feedback on their work from their classmates, since the seriousness with which students take the class varies greatly."
