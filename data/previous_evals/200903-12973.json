   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it. It might be slightly more work than the lecture, but the curve is entirely reasonable (don't believe the hype), and Tolga is a dynamic professor. He makes sure to keep every class light and bearable with jokes and anecdotes, and keeps track of how his students are doing at all times.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class to anyone that isn't interested in Econ because it offers nothing more than an intensive introduction to economics classes.",
    "I highly recommend this over lecture. You should do the readings though; it will help you understand Tolga's lecture much better.",
    "Take it if you are planning to do econ major or you are really interested in it.",
    "If you get in, you should definitely take the intro micro seminar. the curve isn't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. Take the class with Tolga because he's the best! He's a really great guy and he tries hard to understand his students.",
    "If you're willing to work and you think you have a decent aptitude for quantitative reasoning, ABSOLUTELY. If not, NO.",
    "If I could start again, I would probably try out the lecture version of Intro Micro. People seem to think that Tolga is better than Simons, and at first he seemed like a funny professor who might lead interesting lectures. However, in the end Tolga taught too much towards the exam rather than making sure that we had a strong conceptual basis in the material. Soon I stopped taking notes in lecture because everything we did was in the book. Unfortunately this course is a prereq for a lot of other courses, but I would recommend trying the lecture course, which people seemed to prefer.",
    "I would definitely recommend the seminar to students! Although it is more difficult than the lecture, and the grading curve much harsher, it teaches the material much more effectively.",
    "I enjoyed it a lot. I know some of my classmates weren't as interested in the material. Take it if you like econ, or take it to find out if you like econ.",
    "I would recommend this class to a prospective economics major. Be warned that the curve is tougher than the lecture so you'll need to know more than just the basic concepts to get an above-average grade. If you decide on the seminar, take the class with Tolga because he is a great teacher and helpful outside of class as well. He holds great review sessions, and tells random jokes in class when the material gets too dry.",
    "Take Econ 110! This class is so much better than the lecture. You learn to solve real problems with numbers. The math is not too hard. Dr Koker is a great teacher and a fair grader. It's not the most demanding of classes but you need to put in some serious effort if you want to get a A. Good class even if you haven't taken Econ before.",
    "If you are interested in Economics, and are not afraid of competition, this is the course for you. If you have Dr. Tolga Koker as your professor, you can be sure that you will find this course one to look forward to.",
    "If you want to take microecon freshman year, DEFINITELY take the seminar with Tolga (yes, everyone calls him by his first name). He is immensely better than the other seminar professor, Simmons. His teaching style is great and much easier to understand than the powerpoint lectures that the other professors use. He writes\/draws everything on the board in chalk so that you can see the rationale behind the equations and graphs. Problem sets are extremely doable, and don't actually take that long. He encourages study groups, so you always work on the problem sets in groups, which makes it much easier. The tests are also very manageable - definitely go to his review sessions (they are awesome, period). The seminar with Tolga, however, was still dry at times and I found it hard to stay awake (the class is 1 hour 15 minutes long), but Tolga does actively attempt to keep it interesting and funny.",
    "I highly recommend this class.",
    "A very good introduction to microeconomics. I had never taken any economics before taking this class, and I enjoyed it. It really introduces you to a new way of thinking. I would recommend the seminar over the lecture, and Tolga's seminar over any others--he is not only helpful but very entertaining."
