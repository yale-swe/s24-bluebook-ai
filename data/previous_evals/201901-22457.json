    "A deep understanding of the biggest challenges in economic development. Understanding what makes certain poverty alleviation programs successful and others unsuccessful. Debunking popular myths (e.g. the overblown claims of microfinance). How to conduct data analysis in Stata (not just t-tests like in Applied Quantitive Analysis).",
    "I learned the basics of what development work looks like\/is comprised of, as well as considerations that are made in the field through Professor Jensen's personal experience. We also worked with Stata to perform analyses with real-life situations.",
    "I learned a lot about ways of measuring poverty and inequality, as well as specific studies done throughout the developing world. It was great to hear Professor Jensen's plethora of anecdotes regarding theories that he himself has worked on or read about.",
    "You will learn about new studies and research being conducted in the area of development. You will develop a working knowledge of basic ideas behind development.",
    "How to understand poverty and economic measures of welfare, development and savings.",
    "I'm really not sure. I learnt some things about credit, savings, and a lot of things about cows.",
    "An incredible overview of international poverty analysis with fascinating studies to back up or refute modern methods of poverty alleviation.",
    "I developed a deeper understanding of the different concepts relating to development across the world, including credit, savings, and insurance, calculations of poverty and welfare, and different household economic models. I also learned how to better use Stata.",
    "Learned about a lot of the nuts and bolts of development, things that might not be the most glamorous but are very useful for having a solid understanding of poverty.",
    "Basic issues in international development - credit, microfinance, poverty lines, savings, insurance.",
    "general understanding of international economics aimed at development",
    "A good introduction to the field of int'l development!",
    "Not much. Some inequality indicators.",
    "Poverty measures, insurance, credit markets, development and inequalities in development, STATA",
    "Why the institutions we take for granted in the US do not work in developing countries and how to develop the proper institutions for developing countries.",
    "Not many, some very basic econ concepts and some stata skills, but that's pretty much it",
    "I developed a rudimentary understanding of current economic research regarding poverty reduction and inequality",
    "All about developing countries!",
    "I felt that this class was an excellent foray into development economics. It certainly deserves a place as a mandatory Global Affairs class. It taught us different ways to think about measuring poverty and explained some of the key problems that many people face in developing countries \/ best practices for how to approach those problems.",
    "Development and poverty data analysis",
    "I REALLY enjoyed this course. Professor Jensen did an excellent job teaching a course that helps students understand different components of development. The course began with an examination into how to measure poverty and inequality. We then explored how savings, credit and insurance can help ease transitory poverty. We ended the course with an examination of inequality in developing countries. Overall, I can say that I'd definitely recommend the course. There's not a lot of work outside of class, except for three problem sets (the first two are pretty manageable, the last one is a pain). You have the option to do the problem sets in groups.",
    "How to examine research. How to work with messy survey data in Stata and get useful results out of it.",
    "I learned about poverty alleviation in the context of stats and quantitative analysis.",
    "All the basic concepts of international development economics, including savings, poverty, insurance, credit, gender, and inequality and health. Super useful for understanding current challenges and issues in international development today",
    "I developed the ability to examine data through Stata and the basic theory of international development.",
    "A lot that I never even knew I didn't know and never thought would be actually interesting topics (e.g. what is poverty\/how is it measured? how do people save? how can we encourage savings? what is credit, insurance, microfinance, etc. and why do they succeed or fail?)",
    "I learned a lot about the measurements of poverty and how to go about approaching some of the worlds most pressing issues",
    "I learned many approaches to international development (naturally) and how to think about these concept in a quantitative and data-based way, which was really helpful.",
    "Basic understanding of questions concerning international development",
    "Poverty measurement. Inequality measurement. Impact of savings, insurance, credit on reducing poverty.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of international development. We started with how to define poverty and inequality, how to measure them, and moved on to big topics like credit, savings, and insurance.",
    "I learned how to measure poverty and inequality, to understand financial markets in developing countries, and about a variety of strategies to increase economic development and reduce poverty.",
    "Learned a great deal about the economic challenges facing the developing world, and some of the solutions that have been tried, and why they do or don't work. This was, I thought, an excellent class in applied economics. Even if you have no interest in development, a great way to learn about how economic concepts play out in the real world."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: great professor, interesting content Weaknesses: p-sets, preparing for exams The p-sets required a deep understanding of Stata, something that all students lacked (but I understand that this was Professor Jensen's first Yale College course and that he may have overestimated our background knowledge). Moreover, the exams were reasonable, but since there are no required readings, you either had the material to study for in your notes or you couldn't study. Maybe the professor could post a list of all the topics that we went over so that you can make sure you have it covered in your notes.",
    "Strengths: The problem sets are reasonable and actually enjoyable because you're applying knowledge to real-world situations. Professor Jensen is also a really engaging professor who works hard to help his students understand the material. Weaknesses: This is the first year the class was taught, which meant that the material was kind of all over the place. At times, we did class-long brainstorms\/discussions, which made it unclear what was material we needed to know during the midterm and what was simply brain exercises. The midterm also tested a lot of information that we covered very briefly (in these sort of brainstorms), which was pretty frustrating.",
    "Strengths: fascinating host of material, awesome prof, lectures were actually very engaging and I liked that there was no textbook because it meant that we actually learned everything we needed to know in class, which was pretty transparent! Lunches with the professor were a lot of fun, and overall it was a lot more enjoyable than a class like this could have been due to the range of anecdotal information provided by the professor, and the relatively low quantitative requirement. Weaknesses: Very disorganized class - why were there 4 TFs?? Unclear if there even needed to be one TF because section was not mandatory and when we went to get help with the PSets they didn't know the answers and used other students' answers to advise their peers...I think Professor Jensen may have spent a minimal amount of time writing the PSets and there were loads of errors in the way that they were written which led to students wasting a lot of time trying to work out what he actually wanted. Also the exams were straightforward but out of 28 points - they could have been out of 100 points and required us to go into more detail, but instead we have a situation where a 24 is a B or something like that, so it was easy to feel that one's grade was somewhat arbitrary.",
    "I thought the in class lessons were very interesting a substantive. The psets felt very separate from the rest of the course and could have been more focused on the information we learned in class rather than stata.",
    "Honestly Jensen sent this course into a complete 180 from the catastrophe that it was before. This was legitimately one of the greatest courses I have ever taken and I came in dreading what it would be given the course ratings of the past. Strong student engagement, fun energy, very flexible and understanding of student needs. This course was fantastic, my only nitpicky recommendations being to perhaps dedicate less time to student input and also the P-Sets were rather intense given that almost all of us had very minimal experience with Stata prior.",
    "I was honestly not looking forward to taking this class and had to because it was a requirement for the major. I had heard negative things about the course in the past and was not as interested in development as I was in security. This all changed after taking the class, it was one of my favorite classes at Yale. One weakness was that the problem sets were a bit harder, especially as they heavily relied on previous in-depth experience and knowledge of Stata, which many students did not have.",
    "The information from lecture was not overbearing, which enables you to actually have a comprehensive understanding of it. The exams are written in a very straightforward way that tests what youve actually been taught, and theyre not excessively hard (unlike many Yale exams that make you feel defeated and then are hugely curved). Problem sets were tougher if you are not super familiar with Stata because its not something we went over in class, but Prof Jensen offers a a lot of support and help.",
    "The problem sets were very hard and assumed a knowledge of stata far beyond what most students had. That said I feel much more confident in my applied statistical ability. Professor Jensen is very impressive but I wish the course had slides or materials aside from his handwriting on the board.",
    "Strengths: Robert Jensen is an absolute gem, so glad Jackson had him teach this course because he turned it from one I thought would be my most hated to definitely one of my favorite classes this semester and maybe all of Yale. He's approachable, funny, explains concepts clearly, and above all is extremely accomplished in his field. You wouldn't think just by being in his class that this man once taught at Wharton. The course introduces interesting concepts you probably never think about when the word development comes up - such as insurance for farmers. Weaknesses: The \"international\" aspect of \"approaches to international development\" does not get dealt with as much. We didn't cover aid or transnational institutions, for example.",
    "I think this course is much too broad. I believe this course would be much stronger if we focused on a few case studies throughout the semester instead of jumping from region to region.",
    "This class is very interesting and the material is timely. The organization is great!",
    "It was fine. I wish he had focused more on case studies of development, had a clearer format for the class, and gave us more feedback on our growth and room for improvement.",
    "Very cool class! Super neat, and prof jensen obviously cares a lot about it",
    "Very engaging lectures. Perhaps there could be more connections between the problem sets and the lectures.",
    "Strengths: Professor Jensen is an incredible lecturer, is so knowledgable, did a lot of his own research, and its very clear he cares so much about his students and their success.",
    "The structure of this class is deeply flawed. We are taught about economics of development, a quantitative subject from a quant-focused professor, in a qualitiative way where we are asked to regurgitate answers in list form. To make this class actually worth our term, teach development from a qualitative, anthropological perspective or teach an economics-based, quantitative class for development. This class tries to make everyone happy (both security and development), and it fails at teaching anything as a result",
    "While this course offered a good introduction to some of the key themes of international development economics, I felt it was lacking largely with respect to practical application. The case studies came only in bits and pieces and without the presentations I felt there was not much room for critical thinking about how countries developed or how different contexts might lead to variable outcomes. I feel that more of a focus on tracing histories of either countries or particular development programs would greatly improve this class beyond surveys of concepts.",
    "I really enjoyed professor jensen's lectures and learned so much in class. I think the course structure is generally very good. However, I would suggest providing students with a copy of the notes from class or putting them on a powerpoint because missing something can have very negative repercussions on the exam.",
    "strengths: really interesting unique material weaknesses: organization and availability of notes",
    "As an intro class, I thought it was excellent. No real weaknesses--except that maybe at the beginning, when Professor Jensen would take input from students, it wasn't clear which was \"correct\" and which wasn't. The professor received the feedback around the midterm and corrected for it in the second half. Professor Jensen, a leader in the field, was a strength as he always had insightful answers to questions in class and set up the course to cover the key concepts in development.",
    "I really enjoyed how the course began with an assessment of how to measure poverty, inequality etc. I think this was one of the strongest aspects of the course. I also really enjoyed learning about how insurance, savings and credit markets can help ease poverty. Although I enjoyed all the different components of the course, it felt more like we were examining three different sub-classes rather than a cohesive class where all the chapters come together for one big learning. I would have really liked if there were an overarching theme for the semester.",
    "It was amazing! Perhaps the grading should have been clearer from the beginning of the semester, but that can be easily fixed.",
    "Would have preferred for some of the material to be slightly more substantive. A lot of lectures basically went like \"here's a topic, here's some research, we don't really know if this method for dealing with poverty works or not\". One method might be to make the course more quantitative, much like the beginning of the course.",
    "I loved this class. I think everyone should take this regardless of their major and really did learn a lot. Only weakness was that I felt like at times the class would get off topic and we would end up in a black hole spiral of random subjects, but even that was interesting.",
    "This is an excellent course. Lectures are engaging and organized very well.",
    "This course could have leaned more into the technical elements of Stata, and it could have done more to provide arguments for solutions to poverty rather than discredit today's best guess for how to solve it.",
    "Strength: one of the few lectures I actually want to go to--like would enjoy actually going to Very well-organized Exams somehow managed to be a good mix of memorization and analysis Weaknesses: sometimes discussions got too long\/drawn out but that got better as semester progressed sometimes sporadic scheduling (of no fault to the professor) not much feedback for improvement on PSETs",
    "Prof. Jensen did great things with this course. He explains things clearly and is always available for extra help",
    "The course consisted of interesting, useful material, but more adherence or better explicit connection to a syllabus would have enhanced the learning experience.",
    "The material was great, and Prof Jensen is great. I wish there would have been more assignments so that the class didnt depend on so few grades. I also wish there was a little more organization to the class.",
    "I think one test should have been replaced by an essay",
    "I appreciate that the content was really interesting. Professor Jensen knows his material very well and has lots of field experience to share with his students. I do wish there was more feedback on student performance throughout the course. The course itself was great but it was hard to know how you were doing grades-wise because the only grades we actually got were from the problem sets. I also wish that there was a little more STATA preparation for the problem sets. I got the feeling that people understood the problems conceptually, but struggled to actually do them because they didn't know the right STATA code.",
    "Strengths: The course covers a large amount of material without requiring large amounts of reading. The lectures are interesting, engaging, and informative. The course builds a solid understanding of the basics of economic development. The course is also well-tailored to those with both more and less econometrics\/statistics knowledge. Weaknesses: Because so many theories were raised and then disproved, sometimes it was difficult to distinguish between what actually was supported by evidence, and what had been disproved.",
    "Prof Jensen was excellent, one of the best at Yale. The major drawback was jsut how slow the class went sometimes, to the point where it wasn't worth paying attention. that and the psets. End the psets. They are dumb, have nothing to do with the class content, and don't teach you anything. In general, @Global, you can't expect students to know stata after one semester of AQA, and we certainly aren't gonna learn more through 3 psets in an unrelated class. Either make a seperate Stata class (a la stats 230 for R), just let students learn R instead, or let Stata go completely. Anyway this class is great though.",
    "Professor Jensen was pretty good overall, but the course material often felt detached from the realities of work in the field. Development in general tends to reduce everything to economic terms, which was frustrating at times throughout the course. Also, discussions often went long with students brainstorming possible explanations for empirical phenomena for half the class at times with little resolution or definitive answer from the instructor by the end. This sometimes put us behind in the syllabus and left students more confused than satisfied."

   "comments": [
    "Yes!!! I learned so much and the workload was average. This course had such a bad reputation when it was taught by other professors, but they've finally found the right one -- Professor Jensen is fabulous! He really cares about his students and wants us to all succeed. Moreover, this class addressed many topics outside the traditional purview of an economics course (e.g. gender, female empowerment, and nutrition). I would recommend this class to non-Global majors too!",
    "If this course becomes more well-organized and you're interested in working in development, yes. Otherwise, probably not unless you're a Global major and need this as the requirement. The first year probably wasn't the best to take it, but Jensen is a great professor and does interesting work.",
    "This has the potential to be a truly fantastic class. I was a Global Affairs snake who used to be interested only in ruling the world and not curing world poverty, so I figured that this course would be hugely boring - not only would the quantitative side be dry and difficult, but the qualitative material would be dull and dithering. NOT AT ALL - Professor Jensen revealed the ways that development policy can have very tangible effects on welfare, and the theories underlying initiatives to solve inequality are beautiful in their own right. I had always figured that international development was ineffective, and that only people in positions of power could make a different on poverty around the world, but the level of detail that Professor Jensen went into on studies throughout the developing world completely proved me wrong, and he did it in a very fun and engaging manner. I am ready to start looking more into the field of development and completely changing my mindset around global affairs. The class really could be special if only Professor Jensen spends more time planning it out; it was a little unfair to have students wasting time working out what he wanted when he could have spent a little more time making his instructions clear. This is not to say he did not care about the students - he met with everyone who wanted to see him, and hosted lunches for all the students in the class, so he definitely was committed to the students.",
    "Yes. Definitely take this class if you're interested in development. I'm not very interested in development, and I still enjoyed it. It's one of the rare classes where you learn a lot without doing a ton of work.",
    "Yes. The professor was incredible and the things he teaches are really useful\/applicable and also important to understand just as a human in the world consuming knowledge.",
    "Not really, but it is a required course so I guess you have to take it.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Prior to this year I wouldn't have wished this course upon the worst of my enemies and felt bad for those like myself in the Global Affairs major who have to take it. Now I would legitimately recommend this to anyone at all interested in poverty theory and analysis, even outside of the major.",
    "Prof. Jensen was incredible. He is the perfect person to teach this core GLBL course.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I loved the class and thought that Professor Jensen was an amazing professor. He demonstrated a true passion for the subject and made it interesting.",
    "Yes, you probably have to take it but it was overall very enjoyable and I would recommend!",
    "If you're global you have to take this course anyway, but it's fine cause it's great as long as Jensen teaches it.",
    "Yes!",
    "Not unless you have to take it. But it's not bad.",
    "Yes! Super cool class, would recommend even if not a GLBL major. prof jensen honestly cares about his students a lot and hes super amazing. def take the class with him if you can! He knows a lot, and this isnt stuff you can read about in a textbook! He teaches from experience!",
    "Yes!",
    "YES! Professor Jensen is actually one of the best (if not the best) professors I have had at Yale! He has so much energy and enthusiasm and clearly cares so much about his students. would take it just to listen to him talk about the topics he cares about.",
    "No. Only take if you have to. I strongly recommend that Jackson heavily restructure this course.",
    "Yes! Absolutely, but only with Robert Jensen!",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants a wholistic understanding of development economics",
    "Yes!",
    "Definitely, for anyone interested in development (via any intersection, whether it be economics, political science, history, etc.) this is an excellent class to take. It will provide you with a number of topics as an overview and then you can follow up on whichever topic in particular that you want to explore in other classes \/ projects. Students beyond Global Affairs should take it, too!",
    "Incredible! You learn awesome stuff in a pedagogically engaging way",
    "Yes absolutely Professor Jensen is a great lecturer and cares about this students.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Yes! Amazing content; great professor!",
    "If you're in Jackson, then you have to take it. Otherwise, I wouldn't call it a waste of time, but perhaps shop it and see if you like it.",
    "100% recommend this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this to any student who wants to learn about international development. Even if you don't, Jensen is an engaging enough lecturer and the content is interesting enough that even a non-Global person or someone not initially into the topic would love this course. I learned so much, and it's one of the few courses I can say that I think I'll remember most of what I learned in this class.",
    "It is fun.",
    "Yes! Such a well-taught course with a professor who actually pulls self-deprecating jokes off well. Very caring (scheduled fully-paid lunches with groups of students, pushed back PSET deadlines if he saw people struggling or if he made a mistake on something, willing to listen to you if you need extensions). Topics are things I never thought deeply about but are very fascinating (e.g. what is poverty\/how is it measured? how do people save? how can we encourage savings? what is credit, insurance, microfinance, etc. and why do they succeed or fail?). and very well-organized lecture This is possibly the only lecture I have taken where I look forward to going to lecture.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's a fine class, but if you are interested in development economics\/international development and not just looking to complete the GLBL major requirement, I would look elsewhere.",
    "Professor Jensen is the best professor ever! His lectures are so engaging and he does so much cool work and really cares about students",
    "It's required, but I would recommend it! It was super interesting and Professor Jensen is really nice. You will learn a lot about the basics of international development.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. This course has received bad reviews in the past, but was much better this year because of Professor Jensen. The lectures are interesting, engaging, and informative, and the course builds a solid understanding of the basics of economic development without requiring large amounts of reading. The course is also well-tailored to those with both more and less econometrics\/statistics knowledge. The problem sets are time consuming, but Professor Jensen is very willing to help. I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot!",
    "Yes. This was, I thought, an excellent class in applied economics. Even if you have no interest in development, a great way to learn about how economic concepts play out in the real world."
