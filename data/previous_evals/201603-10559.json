    "I had completed L1 and L2 Chinese my freshman year.",
    "I have developed the ability to converse more effectively in Chinese. I have also furthered my ability to memorize and handle large amount of work in a relatively short timeframe.",
    "My speaking skills got much better as did my listening skills",
    "Substantial vocabulary, new grammatical structures and sentence patterns, better oral fluency, some practice with reading and writing. There were 9 units in the semester. Each unit included 40-60 words (typically at 1-2 characters each) that we needed to learn how to read and write, plus an additional 20-40 that we only needed to know how to read. Every unit also had 5-6 grammatical structures or sentence patterns for us to learn.",
    "This course dramatically improved my Mandarin speaking, reading, and writing abilities. The course does a good job of forcing you to review past lessons and actively engage with the material.",
    "It was helpful to use class as a time to practice speaking. I learned how important it is to use repetition to help remember grammar points and phrases."

   "comments": [
    "This course is likely one of the best in the country in terms of accomplishing a singular goal: teaching Chinese. However, the passion with which Xu laoshi and Liang laoshi approach this work make the class worthwhile. Sometimes, the amount of work, the frequency of quizzes, and the difficulty of exams get in the way of this passion, but once we reach the end of the course, it's easy for us to see how much Xu and Liang actually cared along the way. I would recommend that in the future, they create the opportunity for students to know their performance\/grades in the course beyond just individual grades on quizzes, essays, and tests. We receive so many grades on a daily basis, some of them exceptional and some of them failing, that it becomes easy to desensitize oneself from the overall picture. Additionally, the PowerPoints on Canvas are not the same as those used in the course. This makes studying for exams particularly challenging. It would be nice if these were updated with the ones that Xu and Liang laoshi actually spent time creating and use in class.",
    "Change up the day to day operations of the class, it got quite repetitive",
    "Strengths: and were both engaging and interesting teachers. I learned a large amount of Chinese in this class and felt substantially more confident speaking it after I was done. The teachers are very engaged with the class and work hard to make sure that we can make as much progress in our Chinese as possible. Note: the two teachers alternate teaching. So for unit 1 you might have Xu Laoshi, then Liang Laoshi for unit 2, back to Xu Laoshi for unit 3, etc. Since Xu Laoshi is from northern China and Liang Laoshi is from southern China, you get experience with both accents, which is beneficial. Weaknesses: the class is very memorization-heavy. There is a quiz every day, and most of the quizzes simply test rote memorization: of vocabulary, of the textbook readings (which are very short: maybe a page per unit), etc. While I realize thats the way to learn a language, the memorization load was so heavy that by the final I realized I couldnt write the vast majority of characters I had learned how to write in the beginning of the year. I feel that I actually would have learned more if we had memorized fewer characters but focused more intensely on them so that I really remembered, instead of just memorizing for the quiz and then forgetting. In addition to overloading my brain a little, the memorization was also somewhat time-consuming, although you do get an extra half credit for the class.",
    "The course's strongest assets are the great professors. I am really impressed with their ability to help students dramatically improve their language levels. A weakness, though this is partially unavoidable with Chinese, is that the course is extremely memorization intensive.",
    "Overall excellent. Has many strengths I'm sure others have pointed out. I'll say though that many students in L3 are freshmen who have studied Chinese for a while in high school (Probably around 4-5 years). This means their comprehension, ability to speak, and reading is usually better than L3, but definitely below L5 . After taking L1 and L2, this course was definitely doable, but it could be tough at times, especially not knowing some vocabulary spoken or written which others around me seemed to understand. Then again, I'm not amazing at Chinese, and while some people who took L1 and L2 were in my situation, but others who took L1 and L2 could keep up just fine.",
    "Strengths: The coursework is predictable after the first week and it is possible to plan out how to prepare for class. Weaknesses: Going over the text in the first lesson of each week, to me, was not a good use of time. I think it would be more helpful to spend more time on grammar. Improvements: Have us write sentences using grammar points to learn the grammar better. Have more opportunities to practice grammar outside of quia."

    "Coming from CHNS 110\/120, I would say that this course is a bit scary. The sheer improvement that you're expected to make this semester can be daunting at first. However, over time, you'll stop missing the 110\/120 gang and be content with Xu and Liang laoshi, who make this course what it is. At times, I found this class to be less written work than 110\/120 because we don't have a workbook. However, this comes with the caveat that it is easy to slack on learning vocabulary and grammar. Additionally, it's easy to fall behind without knowing it because the exams do not include written portions like 110\/120. If you've taken Chinese at Yale before, don't hesitate to take it again, just know what you'll be getting yourself into.",
    "Yes, if youre willing to put in the time to learn the material. The course has no surprises: each unit is structured exactly the same way, the quizzes and midterms follow the same format, etc., so if this was your only class and you diligently memorized everything, youd get close to 100%. Of course, there are other classes so you need to set some limits on what youre going to study, but you can still get a huge amount out of the class and a good grade as long as you make yourself comfortable with the vocab words\/their meanings and the grammatical structures. The teaching is also very good, so Id definitely recommend the course to interested students! I dont have to take any more Chinese to satisfy the language requirement, and I dont have any immediate plans to use Chinese in the future, but Im going to take 140 (the next course after this one) anyway just because I enjoyed this class and would like to learn more. Workload is 27 online homework assignments (10-15 minutes apiece), 9 essays of about 200 characters each (rough draft handwritten, second draft typed, and an audio recording of you reading your essay out loud), 3 hour-long written midterms, 3 hour-long oral midterms in the language computer lab, 2 oral presentations of the essays described above, 1 final oral project, a (very predictable) pre-class quiz every day, weekly half hour oral tutorial sessions with a TA, and a final exam. Since there are so many assignments, its a lower-stakes course: you can afford to mess a few things up and still do okay, which is good.",
    "It's a lot of work, so make sure you know what you're getting into and make sure it's worth it to you. Having a quiz every morning can be a little stressful. When I didn't take Chinese, life was way easier. An hour and a half a day of work is probably the same amount as many other courses, but it's the fact that it's every day that makes it hard. It's not like you can just push the work to the weekend if you have a lot to do Thursday night. No matter how much work you have one night, you'll have to do at least an hour of Chinese if you want to complete the homework and get a good score on the quiz\/know enough to get the most out of lecture.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to spend a lot of time working on their Chinese skills in their own time."
