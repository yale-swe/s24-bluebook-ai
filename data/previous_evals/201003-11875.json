    "Math 120 is very important if you want to major in the science, economics, or any math based major. It is very clear and comprehensive. The problem sets are usually not hard, but sometimes slightly tedious and are not that similar to the midterms and final.If you do not need Math 120 as a requirement for any major you are considering then I would not necessarily take it. The class is made up mostly of kids who need to take the course so they are all serious about getting a good grade and this makes the curve quite tough. Also, many kids who take Math 120 seem to already have taken Multivariable Calculus. The material is more \"important\" than \"fun\" so if you are looking for a one off math class this might not be the one for you.Finally, if you work hard and keep up with the material the whole time, it is not too difficult to get a good grade. If you have taken Calc BC in high school then you should be prepared.",
    "I would recommend it if they have already taken multivariable in high school or feel very, very confident in their math skills. However, the class is not really curved and the material is taught very quickly, so it's hard to keep up with understanding everything.",
    "Math 120 is an almost unavoidable introduction to math at Yale. The course is generally easy (problem sets rarely last longer than 1.5 hours or so), and the material lends itself to high grades. Unfortunately, this results in a very high percentage of the class scoring well on examinations; the curve can be brutal. That being said, the class is well-designed and worth the time. Professor Frame is an excellent teacher (but thankfully no longer the only good one teaching the class).",
    "Taking this class is not a hard decision. The skills learned in this class are essential for many math and science classes, and it is not too difficult or confusing.",
    "The first two midterms are manageable and with appropriate studying, you should be completely fine. However, the final....so much material, so many concepts, all very difficult...Take this course if you have to, not because its fun.",
    "I would recomend it, It is a very enjoyable course but that may have been the instructor more than the course in itself.",
    "michael frame is the nicest, most helpful professor ever. seriously.",
    "Great course with an incredible professor. Michael Frame is a legend, and this is probably his last semester teaching with us. Well worth camping out a math preregistration for 3.5 hours. This is the only way to learn Math 120: this memory will stay with me forever.Easily 10\/10.",
    "It's a great class, definitely necessary for those who wish to continue study in any field of mathematics, science, or economics. The weekly problem sets, like all problem sets, are boring and simply rehash what was taught in the lectures. Exams are fair and are well-organized. If Michael Frame teaches this course, try very hard to get in his section, even if it means getting up early on the preregistration day.",
    "There are two midterms, a final, and weekly problem sets. I would recommend it to someone who knows calculus and has even had an introduction to multivariable calculus. A lot of people in the class seemed to have a strong math background. Take it if you're really interested in multivariable or need it for a major requirement, but don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "It's a typical multivariable calculus class. GET THE RIGHT INSTRUCTOR! With a good teacher, the material makes a lot of sense and comes together at the end, as it should, but otherwise, you might struggle. It is definitely worth taking coming out of BC Calc. If you got a 5 on the AP, there is no need to take Math 115.",
    "I would recommend math 120, but I would suggest taking enas 151 instead because it is more application based and less theory.",
    "This course definitely requires a commitment to want to understand the material. If you are looking for a challenge, this might be a nice with which class to start.",
    "Math 120 is a difficult course, yet will allow one to assess their grasp and enjoyment of math.",
    "Math 120 is simply multivariable calc, and I think how much one likes it depends on how much he or she likes math and the instructor. I personally enjoyed it a lot, as I like math and Frame is an amazing professor to have. One great thing was that everything fit together well, in that everything felt necessary for success and there were never any surprises regarding what we needed to know.",
    "Math 120 is a pretty tough class. I took 112 and 115 last year, which made for good preparation for 120. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on problem sets. If you really want to master the material, you should be doing practice problems and going in for help. I often didn't have time for that and think my comprehension suffered as a result. The final is quite difficult, but most people have trouble with it. The class does have a good curve. If Professor Frame teaches this class again, I would HIGHLY recommend it. I have never been much of a math person, but it was inspiring to go to a class taught by such a dedicated professor. Some teachers could care less about teaching and are only interested in research. Professor Frame is the exact opposite. Not everyone who has terminal cancer chooses to continue teaching, but Professor Frame does it because he enjoys it and genuinely cares about the students. He is a great person to get to know outside of class.",
    "Math 120 is your ordinary entry-level multi-variable calculus class. It's quite competitive, and the class size is around 30 (Frame\u0092s class was the exception this semester - he taught 50 kids). Take it as a pre-requirement, and by all means take it if you canget Frame, but if you won\u0092t be studying a lot of math\/physics it\u0092s not really something that has a million day-to-day applications.",
    "I would definitely recommend it taught by Frame, and I would recommend it even if not taught by him, because it has quite a good textbook and it's important stuff to know.",
    "It's definitely a difficult course if you've never taken multivariable before. Get help as soon as things start getting hard, because once you fall behind it's tough to catch up. Frame is great, although his class is for the most part composed of absurdly intense kids. If you're not naturally mathematically inclined, be prepared to work hard.",
    "This course was well-run, appropriately paced and organized. Homework assignments were manageable and midterm exams were well-timed in the semester; test questions were fair. The textbook was very clear and it was also nice to have a special edition so that only relevant chapters were included. Professor Frame is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, experienced at teaching, and moreover an incredibly kind, funny individual. He was very approachable and helpful during office hours and after class; he would always review what we had covered in the previous class and recap at the end to give a sense of our context and trajectory, which allowed me to absorb the material better as well as more fully appreciate the elegance of the connections between the major theories.",
    "Michael Frame is the a wonderful teacher. He is an amazing individual both in class and out of class. In class he offers us a unique perspective into the many application of mathematics in the real world. I remember one time when he made a Moibius Strip out of a piece of paper with a half twist and began cutting it to make a knot and then an even larger loop. I will never forget another time when he brought in a cube made out of wire and dipped it into a bubble solution to form a hypercube for the class. Everyday he got us interested in mathematics and made sure we would not only have something to learn, but something we could love for the rest of our lives. His message goes beyond what any individual can learn in a math class, and for this I am grateful for taking this course. Multivariable Calculus is challenging, but then again can lead to many other courses of study at Yale. I would recommend everyone to try to get into Frame's course, and if this is not the case make sure you learn from an instructor who can effectively convey the material.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 120. Although I do not think that Professor Frame will be teaching anymore (which is unfortunate since he is such a great teacher), the class is very well-organized and provides a solid understanding of multivariable calculus. Just double check which professor has good reviews so you know who to take the course with. Also, do the practice midterms and finals online! They extremely helpful for preparing for the final.",
    "Math 120 is difficult coming from BC Calc, but manageable. Problem sets get pretty tricky, or at least time consuming, by the end of the semester, but are worth doing as they help in the understanding of the material. The best way to do well in this course is practice problems beyond the homework, especially in preparation for exams.",
    "An amazing class if you have Michael Frame. A decent class that isn't too bad when you need to fill requirements otherwise.",
    "Math 120 was a good course on multivariable and vector calculus. Michael Frame is, as you should know by now, a master math teacher, and at least with him teaching, the material is easy to learn. There are some tricky concepts towards the end of the semester as we go over Green's, Stoke's and the divergence theorem, but nothing too hard. the problem sets took a couple hours to do, but were never too stressful. the tests this semester were pretty easy, but that apparently varies a lot from year to year. Take the course if you enjoyed single-variable calculus and want to learn some more math.",
    "This course is comprehensive but the work load isn't too bad. Frame was an awesome teacher; he explains concepts very well and genuinely cares about his students. Neither problem sets nor tests weren't too difficult. I would recommend this class for a student who wants an extensive background in multi-variable calculus.",
    "Definitely take it! An incredibly useful course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course particularly for any students interested in math. The material is different from that of Calculus BC and you don't need to have done particularly well in calculus to understand multivariable calc. It does require consistent work and you can't cram everything in right before the midterm but as long as you keep up with the weekly problem sets, it should be fine.",
    "I\u0092ve been told that ENAS 151 is an easier option if you\u0092re an engineering student; I\u0092ve also been told this course is pretty difficult and you shouldn\u0092t take it if you don\u0092t have to. But if Michael Frame is teaching again, TAKE IT. (He\u0092s taking the semester off for Spring 2010 and as those who know here\u0092s a great possibility he might not be coming back) All the good feelings I have for this class is because of him. He took pains to revise each concept at the start of the class while also putting things in a bigger context. That said, to give an objective view of the contents of the course, it is pretty difficult, but manageable. Workload pretty average and light compared to 230, taking me about 2 hours per week compared to their 10-15 weekly workload. It gets progressively harder towards the end where all the concepts come together so don\u0092t slack! Like any math class keep up with your work and you should be fine.",
    "Math 120 is a class that will really change your perspective on mathematics as a whole. It is quite difficult, so take it if you want a challenge. I don't recommend it for students who aren't strong in math to begin with. If you take this class, I would recommend Miki as a professor since Frame is no longer teaching.",
    "To be honest, few students that I have known have taken Math 120 for the sake of taking it. The class, for the most part, is filled with students looking either to tick off distribution requirements or to fulfill prerequisites. In addition, the course itself is very practical. The instructors rarely spend time on external applications (I would recommend taking Physics 260 concurrently to learn some of those); instead, they go through the proofs and theorems in a very pragmatic manner. The homework sets are challenging yet manageable; the tests are very well-made; and there is an amazing support network outside the classroom to help struggling students. As a result, Math 120 is a solid multivariable calculus course, and I would recommend it to any student who needs it.",
    "If you can get Frame as a professor, definitely take this class.",
    "Only take this class if you have to!",
    "It's hard. It's much tougher than Math 115. Frame is an amazing professor, but it goes pretty fast and isn't much use to anyone unless you're going to be a math major. At best, it's a major character builder. At worst, it's a colossal waste of time.",
    "This course focuses on four math theories which at the end of the class, come together in one final conclusion. The course moves quickly and depending on yourprofessor, focuses on the proofs and geometry behind each topic with a couple of examples. The class is enjoyable, especially with Frame, but your grades depend largely on your own work. The weekly problem sets count for about 10% of your final grade, each midterm is 20%, and the final exam is 50%. So, most of your grade comes from exam or midterm scores, which means that it is very important to stay up with textbook readings, problem sets, and even suggested extra problems.",
    "This is a great class for both math majors and non math majors. It is not proof based, so you can focus on understanding the concepts and learning how to apply them in future fields.",
    "Math 120 introduces and teaches some of the more tedious topics in Math and while the class might seem a little tough at times, just a little, with attention being paid in class, it all really is pretty easy. Further Professor Frame is a really fantastic teacher and if you have to take this class, for whatever reason he is definitely the man to have taken it with."
