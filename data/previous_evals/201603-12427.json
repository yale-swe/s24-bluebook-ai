   "comments": [
    "I personally think following a textbook for a secondary source of info would've helped. I bought the recommended textbook and it was good to read on the side",
    "Lectures were slow, uninteresting, and disengaging. The materials in the slides were both interesting and stimulating, but the way in which they were presented discouraged many people from coming to class. In addition, problem sets were unnecessarily long and cumbersome, presenting challenges irrelevant and unrelated to the actual topics at hand.",
    "Very hard and too theoretical (we only implemented algorithms instead of actually using them on real data, until the final project).",
    "STRENGTHS: you learn a lot about data mining and machine learning techniques. WEAKNESSES: class is unorganized; Professor Wolf cannot hold attention in lecture and doesn't really explain most concepts in an understandable manner; problem sets required implementation (from scratch) of data mining techniques, which ended up being extremely difficult and taking a ton of time, especially because the structure and organization of the class was so unevenly paced; expectations for the class are not laid out well.",
    "I love the structure of the assaignments and the project. The assaignments need to be more evenly spaced. I wanted to do the last one, but I would have had to let something else drop in order to do it. Also, just as an idea, is there any reason the two parts of the assaignment (the parts on, say, clustering and the part on svm) couldn't be seperated, and given to us seperately? Might help keep the pace up?",
    "I think separating the psets in half and giving us twice as many would help learn the data a lot better and distribute the workload a lot better.",
    "This course was somewhat disorganized. The problem sets came out on an irregular basis, making it harder to plan my schedule. Moreover, the last week had a large amount of work due in a very short timeframe. Lastly, the lack of testing until the final made it harder to tell if i was on the right track. However, no one problem set or test question was grade-critical; there was ample support available to help with the course, and while problem sets were long, they were extremely effective at teaching concepts. All assignments had a clear purpose; they were not just busywork.",
    "Professor invites a lot of questions, but is *very* combative in answering questions. I do not think he realizes this. Answers like \"...uhh, this was on the last slide . . .\" with an implied tone of \"there are no dumb questions ....except for that one\".",
    "The greatest weakness of this class was the fact that he gave \"weekly\" (more like a week and a half) to do psets that covered many lectures. So for example in one pset you would have to implement k-means, DBSCAN and SVM all in one pset (with other things). This was way too much for a single pset and felt that if we had these as weekly assignments and not whenever they were done writing the assignment as a timeline to do say like pset for week 1: implement k-means and do some theory. Week 2: implement DBSCAN or something but don't throw all the material into one pset that has been for the past month because it just makes them too long and you are not able to spend enough time focusing on the individual aspects of the pset."

    "This is one of the few courses where I'd say I learnt a lot of very useful things I'll definitely be using later on and am excited by it",
    "Avoid taking this with Wolf. His lectures are uninspiring and disengaging which leads to a majority of people skipping lectures for weeks at a time. The material presented in the slides is useful and even interesting, but class is not. Psets are unnecessarily long and cumbersome.",
    "Really hard class, but you get a lot out of it.",
    "This class is hard - quite hard. Intellectually speaking, the material is difficult, but any week with a problem set for this class became extremely challenging. Each one (there were 5) took almost 30 hours and I've heard this class is more work than the legendary CPSC 323. The reason those sets were so hard is because out of 6 total problems, either 3 or 4 would be implementations from scratch of data mining techniques. I.e. you're implementing decision trees or SVM or some such algorithm in Python with rigorous standards for testing and a fair bit of visualization and demonstrations required of each problem. In isolation, these problems aren't so bad. But when you have to do 4 of them for a single homework in addition to 2 complicated theory question, the work builds up. Further, Professor Wolf can't explain these concepts well in lecture - even though his slides are fairly high quality, his presentation skills are weak, he can't hold the attention of the class, and he cannot communicate well with students. The same played out in office hours, which were sometimes uncomfortable with him. The class was also poorly organized - we ended up determining 70% of our class grade in the last week of class (30% final exam, 30% final project, 10% problem set all due in a week's time). That said, even the prior few problem sets were extremely challenging, even for people with a strong math and CS background. You do come away from the class knowing a lot about data mining and machine learning and Nick is a fantastic TA, but it's at the tradeoff of extreme pain and frustration during the duration of the class. Let's put it this way: I would choose to not take this class again if I could do the semester over. The class has a ton of potential, but a long way to go before it gets there.",
    "Already have and will continue to do so.",
    "If your math skills are good, I think this course is good. If you don't really enjoy the higher level math and are mostly on the CS side I wouldn't.",
    "Yes. If you take this course, you will learn a lot about a very important subject, and will be able to apply the concepts you have learned. While it isn't the easiest course in the world, the work is fair and useful.",
    "Prof Wolfe is a little disorganized, but it was his first year teaching the course. Not great at answering questions, but is very nice. Material is cool. Expect to put in a lot of work outside of class for each pset, but there were only 4 psets, so planning ahead is your friend. Just wants to see effort on final project, dont stress about specifics. Exam was hard, a lot of memorization.",
    "This course came as a complete surprise. It was taught by a new professor this year, Professor Guy Wolf. You immediately see it when you go to lectures, but his tone when he lectures about topics is soul sucking. It is if he was the complete opposite of an inspirational teacher, and given that the course material is very interesting it is a true shame. The psets are misleading. The first two were long but manageable; however, the last 3 (there 5 psets in total for the semester) were impossibly long, challenging and very poorly specified. Although the class does not specify algorithms (CPSC 365) as a prerequisite and only 223 and some linear algebra, almost every pset espeically the ones after the second required the analysis of algorithms you were implementing. Even though it wasn't too bad, it felt like the rest of the class felt: unfair. He made a pset due on thanksgiving day (for some people he was wiling to give extensions but not everyone). In general, if you are willing to toruture yourself to learn some things that probably other classes at Yale could teach you or online courses on Coursera then take this course otherwise DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. It has not improved and only gotten worse. Please, if you like your sanity don't. The final exam was easy or easy to prepare for, but the final project really was what you made it to be."
