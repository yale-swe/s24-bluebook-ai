    "A LOT of work. Too much. Requires more time than you have to give.",
    "Process control is literally learning how to control processes. It is very applicable in that processes are everywhere in manufacturing and it is extremely important that they be controlled not just to keep up production but also to avoid disaster. While the class is fast-paced and demanding, I learned a ton from it and mostly enjoyed doing it. I recommend staying on top of the material as much as possible and working with a small study group.",
    "As a recommendation, this does not really make sense since everyone taking the class is required to take it (it is a ton of work). However, ABET ChemEs, be excited! I thought this was the best Chemical Engineering class that I've taken - the subject matter is extremely interesting and it is incredibly well-taught. Be prepared to devote a huge amount of time to this class - and especially to the final project at the end of the semester. Start this project early and ask as often as possible for help. All in all, consider it an excellent class that should be worth 2 credits.",
    "They told me Pchem lab was the especially difficult course in the ABET ChemE degree and that everything would be fine after that. They lied. Professor Altman is very nice, but the course isn't. I would not suggest taking this until you absolutely have to.",
    "Definitely a difficult class, but it's required and you actually do learn a lot. There's a final project AND a final exam, so make sure you start the project early. If you're stuck on where to go, just email Altman with your questions and he'll usually respond pretty quickly and be incredibly helpful.",
    "Good course, but too much work. By the last day of classes, we had 70%of our grade still undetermined, which is ridiculous. The project took over 100 hours (5-8 of which were spent running 30-120 minute simulations on school computers, these took even longer on personal computers). For the last month or so, we had both problem sets, which took 10-18 hours a week usually, and the above project which would take just as much time. We do not have the time to spend 30+ hours per week on ONE class. Make the project part of the psets, tie them together such that part 0 and part 1 are pset 6, part 2 and 3 are part of pset 7, etc. Better yet, make a process control lab.",
    "A very in depth course on process control and dynamics. Doesn't matter whether or not I recommend it because if you have it on your schedule it's because you are an ABET chemE so you have to take this course. Lecture will be heavy on lengthy and detailed mathematical derivations, but for the most part you will be tested on broad concepts.",
    "Process Control is a great class. The material is interesting and Prof. Altman is probably the best lecturer I've had in the chemical engineering department. That being said, the class was very demanding and the final project was borderline ridiculous, so stay on top of your work and don't expect sympathy from Altman.",
    "70% of the course grade is crunched into the last week of the semester, when all other finals are happening. You have already resigned yourself to ABET chemE if you are considering this course. No turning back, gl"
