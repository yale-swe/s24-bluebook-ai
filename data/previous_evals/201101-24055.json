   "comments": [
    "Definitely, you learn so much about South Africa in a very chill class setting.",
    "Its an investigation of the transition of South Africa from a colony to the rainbow nation it is today. However, it looks at the many struggles the country has had with race, identity, and language.",
    "A big lesson on South African history and culture basically, in the context of language and identity. Very interesting. I recommend it to anyone. One of my best classes at yale.",
    "Without a doubt, one of the most stimulating and well taught classes at Yale. I enjoyed learning more than I could ever imagine about South African history, culture and languages through a diverse mix of films and scholarly articles. Language is the ESSENTIAL issue in South Africa today, and you will explore the different language groups from a cultural standpoint, and how the multilingual society works in practice. Professor Sanneh has a wealth of knowledge and structured the class perfectly to allow for a good balance between lecture, discussion and student presentations .",
    "Yes! Take this class!",
    "I would say it is a great class about the various different groups in South Africa. We cover how some of them have evolved and how they have shaped the South Africa that exists today. The class draws on a variety of great source material and is very interesting.",
    "Take it!",
    "This is an AWESOME class and I would 100% recommend it to anyone. Professor Sanneh is wonderful! Very interesting reading and watching assignments as well."
