    "\"Thinking\" is a senior seminar, which you can use to fill one of your two senior requirements for the psychology major. Every week, you read two papers and answer discussion questions. Each class session is divided into discussion of last week's reading (which is always engaging and informative) and a lecture by Professor Ahn, followed by a short quiz. This quiz is always easy as long as you're paying attention, and it's actually a great way to ensure that you're engaged and asking questions during class. Despite the difficult workload, this was my favorite psychology class at Yale, and I highly recommend it to any student ready to work hard, think critically about psychological research, and learn a lot. As long as you're proactive about asking questions and getting a head start on assignments, you'll be able to juggle this class even during a busy semester, and you'll gain so much just by getting to know Professor Ahn, who is awesome and brilliant. Take this if you can get in, and pre-register to secure your spot!",
    "Alright, so it's a good course overall! You'll definitely learn a lot! Here are pros and cons... PROS: -Good class structure -You'll learn a lot about our rationality and how to become a better thinker (really!) -Smart professor CONS: -Workload can be intense -Harsh grader -Early class time",
    "Would absolutely recommend. One of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale. The material is extremely interesting. Professor Ahn is an incredible professor. She is extremely approachable and takes a genuine interest in her students. Work is fairly time consuming but completely manageable and generally low stress.",
    "Wonderful class! Definitely recommend if you're interested in psychology, whether or not it's your major. Little background is required, as each week covers a different topic in cognitive psychology. The reading is interesting and the weekly reading responses (usually 6-8 questions with 200 word limit for each -- so, hefty), while painful at the time, were incredibly valuable for learning how to write about psychology concepts concisely and using appropriately academic prose.",
    "Take it!",
    "A challenging but rewarding course! Each seminar is a good mix of discussion of the readings from the week before and a lecture to preface the readings for the week ahead. The topics are relevant and interesting, and Prof. Ahn takes care to choose engaging readings. The workload is certainly formidable; even though the readings are short, answering 6-8 questions about the readings each week took anywhere from 3-5 hours because Prof. Ahn expects you to critically assess the research and think deeply about applications to your life and the world. This always made for lively discussions in class, though, since students actually had to think critically about the readings beforehand and weren't just BSing. There are also weekly quizzes after each lecture (don't worry too much about them - they are pretty straightforward if you had been paying attention during lecture, which is not a hard thing to do because Prof. Ahn is incredibly funny and engaging!) The 10-page final paper was quite open-ended and fun to write once you got over the initial anxiety (and procrastination) of choosing a topic. I highly recommend this course for a survey of practical, relevant, cool psych topics that is at once broad and deep, and for Prof. Ahn of course! Probably the best professor I have had in the psychology department."
