   "comments": [
    "It was an okay course.",
    "I thought the course was interesting and I feel more confident in working as an evaluator.However, I do have some comments on how the course was implemented.Most of the class sessions are dominated by lectures that rely on powerpoint presentations. Unfortunately, these powerpoint presentations seem to be recycled from prior classes or other activities. They can be repetitive and should be redone to deliver a clearer, more succinct set of messages.I did not feel like I was getting enough feedback on the evaluation I was designing. I would prefer that there was more time for me to meet with the instructor and TA about my plan so I could get their feedback.I would love to have these conversations earlier in the semester. Instead, what I did get was a review of my draft evaluation over the Thanksgiving holiday. That review was immensely helpful, but I wish I had more time to make changes and a chance to talk through some of my ideas about this evaluation.",
    "I expected that I would learn some practical real world skills in this class, but found that the instruction occurred primarily through the readings. I was disappointed to find that attending class did not add a lot to the material covered. Would have liked to have spent more time working on the process of developing evaluations, and surveys\/focus group questions in particular. I found the course material to be very general, and felt like i was left to my own to figure out the specifics.There was insufficient guidance at the beginning of the semester as we chose programs to work with for the evaluation development component of the class. Throughout the class many students faced the tension of creating an evaluation that incorporated all of the components we discussed in class and creating an evaluation that would actually be beneficial to the organization that we were working with. It would be better to allow students to focus on the organization OR instruct them to make make evaluations so that an ideal scenario is possible.",
    "The class content and tools are interesting and useful. However, the professor was unredeemably scatterbrained. Lectures were excruciating to watch and attend. The workload is very skewed towards the end of the class.In particular, the examples of completed student evaluations provided on the classesv2 website were poor and misleading to students. In future, I suggest that they be changed and other more comprehensive examples be put up.",
    "Overall, I found the course to be mediocre. Although I enjoyed some of the lectures, I was still left wanted more concrete skills for program evaluation.",
    "Other than something to put on my resume, it was absolutely useless. Evaluation is a fairly easy comcept to grasp, coupled with the skills we ALREADY know from epidemiology, this course was not a wise selection and more busy work than aquisition of knowledge and skills. I could have learned everything in a 1 hour powerpoint presentation without none of the jargan. The final project or workplan was thrust upon everyone the first day we came in. The rough drafts that were handed in early were handed back late with dozens of structural comments. They expect more than they give. MOst of the time they just talked on and on and read straight from the intermidable powerpoints. If we used half the time we sent on meaningless \"group work\" and focused it on final workplan workshops, we wouldn't have had to devote so much time at the last minute to a project that was ahead of schedule.",
    "The course has potential to be very helpful but I felt that a lot of the focus was on summarizing ideas and concepts but not getting into details. Guest lectures were not helpful at all and should not be a part of the course.",
    "The course had so much potential. The material is useful and interesting, even if it's mostly intuitive. And the readings and other materials could be very helpful if doing a real program evaluation.However, the course, itself didn't really add much to the material. Lectures and slides were disorganized, and we didn't learn much by being the classroom that we couldn't have gleaned from 1 article. It just seemed like the course was designed several years ago and hadn't been updated for a while.The class needs to be more interactive, perhaps with smaller assignments throughout the term and discussion in class, and we should read more real evals through the semester.",
    "Very important material but taught ineffectively. The power points are somewhat simplified and lectures add little value to their content.Strengths are that the material is very important to learn. All students of public health should learn how to effectively evaluate health programs and interventions. The instructors are very kind and understanding.Weaknesses are that the class provides little expertise or formal training. Much of it seemed like rhetoric that added little to the skills we're learning in other classes.Ways to improve would be to do more case studies of evaluation programs. Examples coming from best case and worst case situations and designs. Lectures could be strengthened by having less busy work and time filler exercises.",
    "This was not a good class. I learned very little. The assignments felt like busy-work. We were not prepared to complete the final project.",
    "I enjoy that we work with an external organization to complete an evaluation, however, I felt that the final evaluation requirements did not allow us to fully provide the organization with the evaluation in the form that would be most useful for them. Some of the sections were really necessary classroom exercises to demonstrate that we understand how to complete an evaluation, but I would make the requirements a bit more flexible so we could have time to do more tool development if that is what the organization wants. The quizzes were very fair, and I felt an appropriate way to evaluate our knowledge. The classroom exercises, however, often seemed unnecessary and could easily be replaced with time to get feedback on or work on evaluations.",
    "Strengths - The course topic is becoming more and more important therefore a valuable skill to haveWeaknesses - Poorly defined course goals; poor organization of course; lack of adequate guidance from primary instructor and TA;",
    "The course was very useful and provided me with a great opportunity to do community-based evaluation work in a real-life setting. I also felt I learned a lot of valuable skills that will aid me in getting a job, and that I can refer to on my resume. The readings and materials were also very useful, and something that I will utilize in the future.I do wish the readings and syallbus could have been more organized. There was confusion surrounding class topics and readings. Also, the sample evaluations conducted by students did not reflect the quality and level of specificity that was expected of us by the professors.Also, would be nice to have more guest speakers who do evaluation work. I really enjoyed the guest speaker on qualitative research."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Dr. Stevens is very knowledgable but can be somewhat difficult to understand (vague)",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I did not think the instructor was really involved with the class. I felt the TA was our instructor.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I was dissapointed by the lectures. Found that the professor often provided an overview of power points that were presented with out actually reviewing the information that was included. \"this is what is on this page... you can go back and look at the ppt online if you are interested...\" this is not feel like a good use of time.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Professor Stevens is an incredibly scattered lecturer who frequently goes off on tangents. What she covers in 2 hours of class could conceivably be covered in 30 minutes of lecture by anyone else. She constantly appeared distracted during class and it seemed like she was never really present.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0The instructor was passionate about the subject and has very relevant work experience. However, her lectures could have been a bit more direct and focused on actual skills needed for policy analysis.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0When she was there i wasn't impressed, I'm sure they do some good where she works but keep your preeching on how evaluation is more useful than the epidemiology and hard science that this school is based on.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0She brought a lot of real-work experience in conducting\/ designing evaluations into the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0I really didn't get the sense that Prof. Stevens was the professor. Kathleen did most of the work, corresponded with us, graded the material, etc.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise Stevens contributed very little to this class. Her teaching assistant did most of the work and all of the grading.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0This course was primarily taught by guest lectures or the TA so it is difficult to adequately evaluate the instructor. She sometimes had great ideas on a new way to present material, such as in a powerpoint. For the most part, however, her lectures were a bit scattered.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Denise was nice however lectured very few times during the semester. Often seemed inattentive and there only to back up the TA. There were also numerous times when Denise and the TA (Kathleen) seemed to lack cohesiveness and I would often get different answers from them regarding the same question, whether it be in email or during conversation. Denise often appeared as if she didn't understand the questions that I asked or as if my questions didn't make much sense to her. I therefore had to get help from other members in the class who had more experience with the topic.",
    "Instructor: Denise Stevens \u00a0Very willing to help with the evaluations and students' job search. Also very positive and encouraging about class discussion."

    "Kathleen was fine",
    "The TA did a wonderful job. I was very grateful for her comments. Per above, I just wish I had in-person meetings earlier in the semester to discuss my evaluation plan as I saw it.",
    "Kathleen TAed this course, as I believe she has done in the past and she is awesome. She was readily available outside of class to meet with students, and went above and beyond expectations providing feedback on our final projects. However, the amount of feed back that we received during the editing process was overwhelming for some people. I think that this was in part due to the lack of information that we received along the way. Would have liked to have learned more throughout the semester so that the draft of my final project did not need as much feed back and fine tuning.",
    "Kathleen Duffany\/O'Connor was great. She provided good feedback and was very prompt with emails. She's a little scattered too, butshe's much better than Professor Stevens.",
    "The TA was very helpful.",
    "Thanks for the 7 million comments",
    "Kathleen was very helpful with her feedback and willingness to meet outside the classroom to talk about the final project.",
    "Kathleen was more than the TA - acted like the professor most of the time and was pretty helpful with feedback. However, the structure of the course made it seem like she was disorganized with lectures.",
    "The TA was accessible and encouraging.",
    "Though Kathleen was very invested in helping us with the evaluation process by giving a lot of feedback, I felt that her feedback was often unclear, or did not match with what we were learning in the course. I think one way to improve on this would be to require group or individual meetings with the TA well before paper drafts are due to ensure that what each group planned on doing based on the organizations needs or requests was in line with the course and well planned.",
    "The TA Kathleen, also didn't lecture verymuch during the semester. When she did it was often confusing, and didn't help with my overall understanding of the course. When I would ask for help outside of the class, she was often late to respond. When I did receive help, it was often helpful, but there were many times when both her and the primary instructor Denise would appear as if they didn't understand the questions that I asked. Or as if my questions didn't make much sense to them. I therefore had to get help from other members in the class who had more experience with the topic.",
    "The course did not include instruction by a TA, but the professor who co-taught the course, Kathleen O'Connor, was extremely helpful and very willing to provide helpful feedback throughout the evaluation process. Was very responsive via email.Again, would have been helpful to know the extent of the detail and quality of the final project that was expected of us from the beginning of the course."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for the skilss you gain even though the class itself was not very engaging",
    "Gives you the basics in evaluation. You need to be self-motivated and ask questions if you want support earlier on in your design (or be ready to do 90% of your work in the last 3 weeks of class).",
    "mostly based on outside readings, not a lot of attention to translating the outside readings into actual application.I would recommend taking this class as a first year so that you have time to carry out the evaluation that you develop, if you are interested in doing so.",
    "The tools for the class were useful, and I thought putting the evaluation project together was a lot of fun. However, I think the class needs to be re-structured. There's practically no work the first 2 months, and then the class load becomes pretty burdensome. Lectures are also a waste of time.",
    "Overall, it is a good course to take to introduce you to what it takes to do program evaluation.",
    "Definately do NOT NOT NOT take this course.",
    "It is definitely good to know how to design an evaluation plan but don't expect to learn much from lecture. The readings are helpful and the final project is interesting.",
    "Useful information. Not a great class.Take it to say that you took it or for the material, but unless the lectures and format of the course are changed substantially (updated and made more practical), I would say that you could probably get a better experience elsewhere.",
    "The class is not terribly useful--I think you could learn the same amount from just jumping into the second semester community health course. The lectures were not helpful or engaging, though I learned some things from completing the plan itself.",
    "It's an important class that I would recommend to those planning on working in community programs. It needs to be better presented and content updated.",
    "I would NOT recommend this class to another student.",
    "I would only recommend this course to students interested in working with outside organizations and who are interested in community health. In general, learning evaluation techniques is critical to anyone who wants to go into program development, research, or evaluation, so the skills are very useful.",
    "I would not recommend this course. This course has a lot of potential because the topic is very important, but the organization of the course, generalization of the course goals, and lack of adequate instruction created a large gap between the potential and the reality of the course.",
    "I would recommend this class to fellow students. It's very useful and practical, and helps foster skills that potential employers find to be desirable.I would also tell students that they should expect the final evaluations to require extensive time commitments."
