   "comments": [
    "how to approach a text, the idea of reading and interpretation as worthy of study in itself. i loved the selection of books too!",
    "The syllabus has a range of texts. In additon to the diversity of readings, the professors introduced the class to a range of literary themes and topics. It felt that at the end of the course, we students were empowered to chose the way of reading that interested us most.",
    "I read a lot of literature (Russian, Arabic, and South Asian) that I would not have otherwise, as my focus is on European languages. I also liked the emphasis on approaching each text as if we had no context, and doing this without a theoretical framework, which is out of the ordinary for a comparative literature class.",
    "This class gave me a new foundation for comparative literature, especially in examining how stories are told versus their chronological unfolding, gaps in meaning from translation, and the context from which works emerged from. Above all, the course gave me a renewed appreciation for the performing, written, spoken, and visual arts.",
    "I became much more comfortable approaching material with which I had absolutely no familiarity. Embracing this made me excited to tackle new works, rather than anxious about not having enough background information from the start.",
    "I gained insight towards improving the analytical frameworks through which I read. It is a bit strange that this course is recommended for juniors and seniors pursuing a Comparative Literature degree, who have almost all taken a slew of college-level lit classes prior. In any case, these frameworks were meant to carry over throughout a broad range of mediums, i.e. film, drama, etc., although within the scope of the class, our reading was almost exclusively limited to texts, with few exceptions. This was a bit surprising, as the goal of the courses (as laid out in the first few classes, at least) seemed to revolve around expanding students definitions of reading. But in practice, we mostly read texts, and as the semester progressed, I felt much more like I was in a How to Read Writing course than How to Read. The few times that we did explore other mediums seemed much more in tune with the priorities of the class (or, my interpretation of those priorities), and were highlights for me.",
    "You learn about some techniques to closely analyze three types of texts: poetry, theater, and narrative prose. You read many different types of texts across a variety of traditions.",
    "I learned a lot about reading and writing alternatively."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The class started out a bit confused, I think. However, as the semester went on it got more settled and was more enjoyable. Once the professors worked out more of the major bugs it ran pretty smoothly.",
    "The syllabus, on first glance, seems like a sort of grab bag of a huge variety of things, and definitely consists of far fewer \"canonical\" or \"famous\" works than I'd expected coming into a course called \"How to Read,\" but as the semester progressed the insights drawn from each work\/set of works unfolded pretty seamlessly into the next and created a uniquely cohesive and fluid experience, which was probably my favorite thing about the course. Not to mention the fact that I likely never would've even heard of authors like Girish Karnad, who I ended up enjoying immensely, had I not taken the course! Prof. Hodgkin and Prof. Ramachandran's dynamic was also something really special-- they're both so deeply knowledgeable and their teaching styles and personalities complemented each other well as they taught the course. Every so often they'd go back and forth for a bit and from listening to those conversations alone I gained a lot of insight on the kinds of thought processes required for engaging critically and thoughtfully with various different kinds of works.",
    "I wish more attention had been given to literary theory or at least some kind of scholarly reading outside of just the literature on the syllabus. At the end of the semester the professors explained that the course had been intentionally light on theory in order to give us a more creative and self-driven approach to comparative literature, however the course often felt a little wishy-washy and contentless. Often huge amounts of class time were dedicated to \"general impressions\" of the reading, which consisted in students sharing their feelings and reactions to different parts of what we had read. While there is some value to this, it often felt like a book club rather than a university class. The professors also warned us about being too focused on the necessity of outside knowledge in order to appreciate an isolated text, but we nevertheless spent a great deal of time discussing the particular context of our readings. I learned a lot of minutiae of near-Eastern poetic forms, publishing of serial novels, and translation of the Qu'ran and Bible. While these bits of information were interesting and I am glad to have learned them, they seemed to just appear as an afterthought to whatever reading was chosen for that week. I think more thought should be given to what the \"content\" of this class is supposed to be, and then actually pay attention to what percentage of class time is engaged with that content. I think the professors would be surprised if they realized how much time was dedicated to explaining the contextual information they insisted was so tangential.",
    "This introductory and mandatory course for the literature major is going through transformations\/trials. For a beginner course, it was too big. There were over 20 students and the course would have benefited from being capped at 15 students. This would have made discussions more lively and encourage more people to talk, especially underclassmen. There were only a handful of voices heard each week, which was probably due to the size. The range of readings is definitely a highlight of the course. But this range also came with some confusion. While the professors were clear they wanted students to focus on the text themselves, it would have been helpful to have mini lectures at the start of each course to situate the lesson's readings. Often class discussion was halted so that the professors could go back and explain the background to a text or author. This made for some confusing classes. For example, it when reading Anne Carson's translation of Bacchae, it would have been helpful to have some introductory information on who Anne Carson is and who Euripides was (when he wrote and who he's often placed in conversation with) before discussing the play. This would have prevented some misunderstanding and some moments of silence in the course. The syllabus was updated often throughout the semester. On the one hand, this made the class feel more tailored towards the students and the discussions emerging, but it also made for some confusion and assignments were hard to track. Also, each class included several handouts. It would have been helpful to have those posted on canvas as well as having a hard copy. A highlight of the course was definitely the poetry recitation. Professor Hodgkin and Professor Ramachandran organized an evening of poetry with homemade tea and cake. They also both provided great feedback on writing.",
    "Our class was very big, about 25 students, though it was still conducted in seminar-style. This made it difficult to be very engaged, and also meant that there were a lot of different levels in the class (first-years-seniors, majors and non-majors). Additionally, while I appreciated the many different texts we approached, it often felt like we only grazed the surface of some texts, while spending too much time on others. I also think co-taught classes are always a little risky, though Professors Ramachandran and Hodgkin did a pretty great job with this aspect. Finally, though I understand and appreciate why we didn't read a lot of theory, it was one of the aspects of the course that I was looking forward to, and I thought could have been included. I loved the additional assignments-- we completed a common log book, which required reading and memorizing of poetry, reviews of performances, and encouraged us to approach all of our reading more thoughtfully. I also loved how often we met at the Beinecke. Professors Ramachandran and Hodgkin did a lot to make the syllabus interesting and fun, both in their selection of texts and the design of the course (seeing plays, original copies, etc.)",
    "This course should have been capped at 18 or below. Having 20 plus people in a seminar style course is not conducive to a truly welcoming learning environment. It makes participation incredibly difficult, and the discussions are worn thin by so little time and so many people wanting to share. I also think this course would benefit from being limited mostly to majors and upperclassmen, because if youre a major required to take this course, it can be quite a taxing\/frustrating experience.",
    "This is a phenomenal course for the variety of works we covered. At the beginning of the semester, there was more reading assigned than we had time to discuss in class, which was addressed in the second half. I appreciated the flexibility of assignments in choosing what we could write about, and wish there was more structured support for reviewing essays with the professors - our conversations during office hours were very helpful but time was often lacking to look at the writing itself. Additionally, one great gap in global literature in the course is East Asia, which I would have loved to explore a bit more (perhaps with guest speakers if it is outside the expertise of the professors)?",
    "The class structure felt like a strange mixture between lecture and seminar, which made it difficult at times to have productive conversations.",
    "This course could be greatly benefited by minimizing the breadth of content. The sheer amount of reading required for How to Read made for rushed, vague seminar discussions. Any time we seemed to be getting somewhere, we would have to stop to make time for the clear insertion of curriculum into these seminars (professors interrupting lively discussion to distribute Comp Lit handouts, lengthy introductions to subjects\/terms\/strategies that seemed eerily similar to lectures, etc.). Why is this class a seminar at all? If the Comparative Literature department is so wed to the idea of this course and its content, why not make it a lecture instead of filling a seminar with so much material that it is impossible to have an actual discussion? And if the seminar aspect is indeed important, then there needs to be a serious rethinking of the course curriculum. Were this a productive seminar, one thinks the professors would start at a defined point, and then allow the students to shape the path of the discussion that follows. That was pretty much the opposite of what happened. At no time in the semester did we end a discussion in a different place than it was started, or where the professors intended. Aspects of the lesson would be continually inserted into our discussion, over and over again, interrupting the flow of the seminar, and discouraging students from participating (who got noticeably quieter as the semester went on). Then, classes would typically end with a professor saying something related to the lesson, bringing us back to where we began. If a seminar can end in the exact same place it started, what was the point of discussion in the first place?",
    "Strength- diversity of texts, commonplace book activity and visits outside of normal class setting Weakness- lack of in depth analysis, scattered class discussion",
    "I hated the syllabus. It felt a lot like the items on the reading list were designed to be obscure and self-selected by the professors, but for a required major course meant to make us better readers and thinkers, I believe that most of the assignments came quite short.",
    "I am not sure it worked well to have two instructors for this particular course. I think the course could be improved if it were taught by one person rather than two. At times I felt confused because the two instructors interrupted one another, which prevented the discussion from flowing well. That being said, both Professor Ramachandran and Professor Hodgkin were wonderful teachers individually."

    "I'd recommend this class to non-majors as well as majors. It's a requirement for majors, but I think it starts at a good point for anyone who's interested in knowing more about literatures around the world.",
    "If you are a Literature major, this course is required. Otherwise, I think there are more interesting humanities classes out there.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, for both lit majors who have to take it anyway and for those who have any sort of passing interest in literature--this course will do a lot for your ability to feel prepared to come to new works you may have been intimidated by before and make you think more seriously about the process of reading as you go forward.",
    "If you are taking this because you are a comp lit major, I will say not to expect too much in terms of theory out of this class. It is not especially rigorous, and mostly operates like a book club. The papers will seem quite short to any humanities major, and the reading is fairly light. I honestly didn't enjoy this class very much, and it has made me reconsider the comp lit major. I understand that the discipline of comparative literature is vague and constantly redefining itself, but this class seemed almost entirely contentless. Each class is not really different from other types of literature classes--you come in to discuss a particular reading--except there is almost no continuity between the readings for each class. The professors were obviously extremely competent and knew a lot about their areas of expertise, but I think this course could have been more carefully planned out. When they were discussing their particular areas of focus they were able to get into some pretty engaging lecture on some random topic in a particular regional or linguistic canon, but the overarching structure of the semester was disappointing and not especially generative. It often felt like a highs school English class where we recited poems and kept notebooks, and weren't really that sure what we were supposed to be learning.",
    "I would only recommend this to literature majors.",
    "If you are interested in Comparative Literature, take this class earlier. Though the department recommends it for juniors, it definitely feels like a first-year course. I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I had taken it earlier-- because I had already taken many literature classes, it felt a little repetitive and I was less engaged. You do read interesting literature, and it is good for a survey course.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone seeking to expand their horizon of literature and its overlaps with history, philosophy, geography, and sociology - I learned so much and became hungrier to explore all art forms after the course. Professors Ramachandran and Hodgkin are both gems, you dont want to miss the opportunity to learn from them.",
    "In the courses current state, no, I would not recommend it at all, although countless students will still have to take it due to its listing as a Comparative Literature requirement. This is sad. How to Read goes out of its way to mitigate any and all benefits that could be reaped from a seminar, and in a broader sense, from the Comparative Literature major itself. I was surprised how many people I talked to in the course that told me they had initially been interested in the major, and by the end of the semester, had decided not to pursue it. LITR130 does not necessarily have a responsibility to coerce people interested in the humanities to pursuing a Comp Lit degree, but it should, at the very least, display just how much profundity can be reaped from close reading and class discussion. The main questions posed by the course are interesting ones! How on earth do we read? How does reading inform our understanding on politics, on culture, on the world? What other reading do we do, knowingly or unknowingly? How might we hone that reading? How might the reading of text inform these other reading activities? This course has all the makings of a brilliant, and idiosyncratic seminar. Instead, it effectively sucks out all the fun and intrigue offered in its syllabus.",
    "I would recommend this course if you do not have a strong background in literature and want to learn about some techniques used to analyze literature. If you already have a strong background, I would not recommend this class as it was mostly not challenging in this regard.",
    "I wouldnt recommend this course to anyone who does not have to take it for the literature major. The reading was too scattered for anyone to feel like they made any proper progression.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course to another student. Although the readings were interesting, the class discussions were surface-level. I would also say that I found that having two instructors did not work so well for this particular course.",
    "This class is supposed to be an introduction to the comparative literature major, but professors made grand claims without delivering. Many of the questions posed at the beginning of the course are really interesting: what does it mean to read? What kind of mediums can and can't be read? How can one approach difficult or foreignness in texts? How can we interpret and compare translations? How many different lenses can we interpret readings through? We danced around these questions without going deep enough to feel satisfied or inspired."
