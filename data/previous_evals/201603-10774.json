   "comments": [
    "I learned how to read poems closely, and process abstract arguments.",
    "Close reading of poetry. Unfamiliar tasks with answering questions in class and paper writing because of Joe North's excellent question-asking abilities.",
    "This course helped me develop a method of approaching poetry in an organized and logical manner. Professor North always had us consider the \"gist\" of the poem first, then move on to line by line considerations of images and metaphors, then think about our own responses to the poem. This was really helpful to me, as I had always struggled with knowing how to think about poetry, particularly poetry that seemed at first opaque.",
    "I learned better frameworks with which to understand politics, as well as a more precise way of judging what, politically, I accept and what I reject. More confidence when it comes to verbalizing those things, too. We became accustomed to, as a class, making poems open up and reveal odd truths to us.",
    "Besides analyzing poetry, I think the course really helped me begin thinking critically about my own responses to poems as well as how emotions, habits of feelings, and tone can influence our responses to political ideas and arguments.",
    "Simply put, I was exposed to some great poetry! I also learned how to better detect political resonances in seemingly apolitical creative works. I enjoyed the opportunity to express both in writing and in discussion my own personal politics and how it relates to the course material."

   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed the unique perspective the course took to poetry, but by the end of the semester I still could not say what we meant by \"poetic feeling\" or \"poetic sensibility.\" The syllabus offered a wide range of poets, which was engaging, but we often focused only on a handful of the poets.",
    "Its strengths include the narrow focus on individual poems, the manageable workload, and the skill of the professors.",
    "Wonderful professor! A good selection of poems from the 20th century. It's good that its a seminar, its great to hear other students' contributions in class.",
    "I'd say there could have been a bit more of a range to the reading materialwe concentrated heavily on a couple select poets, which was nice, but I would have liked to see us read more widely and read more.",
    "The course does a great job of teaching you to read and understand what can be quite difficult poems. It also gets you thinking about them in unconventional ways as you try to decipher their political sensibilities, that is their habits of feeling toward political issues. This is such a unique endeavor, however, that it feels quite foreign. And it's not always clear what exactly you are looking for in the poems. That said, I think it's a successful course. Just be prepared to do something you've never done before."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes, I'd recommend it. Joe North is a brilliant professors, who really knows how to lead discussions. There's not much reading at all just a few short poems each week and the discussions allowed us to analyze all of that reading in depth.",
    "YES! Take this class with Joe.",
    "Absolutely. One of those classes that teaches you a new way to think.",
    "I recommend the course to anyone how is interested in the intersection between poetry and society, or emotion and politics. It's an intersection that doesn't get talked about much, so it can be very difficult to get your head around at times. But I think the class is quite rewarding for those who engage with it, and Professor North does a great job of leading classroom discussions.",
    "Take this course! The number of poets is large enough to keep the class highly interesting, and small enough for you to develop a familiarity with each of them. Plus, Professor North is just the best. He brings so much energy to all class discussions, and always does his best to help students develop their ideas.",
    "Yes! Professor North is an energetic discussion leader and cares a tremendous amount about student learning. The syllabus features several different works, and most students found at least a handful that they really connected to. The course can also give you a new and somewhat alternative vocabulary for reflecting on the relationship between political feelings and the creative arts. The workload is manageable, only readings and three five-page essays."
