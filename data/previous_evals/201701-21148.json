I learned a lot about Spain's history and the different groups that have lived in the Iberian Peninsula. Although this class did not particularly strengthen my spoken Spanish, I did finish the semester writing an 8 page final paper in Spanish!",

    "This course could be improved had there been more prep or check-ins regarding our final paper. 8-10 pages in Spanish can be pretty daunting, especially if that length of a paper is challenging even in English. Other than that, I really enjoyed the small lecture style of the class and material covered. I do wish bi-weekly quizzes let us drop our lowest grade.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing! It gave me a great overview of the history and cultures of Spain without being too dry or memorization-heavy. All the discussions were had were very interesting.",
    "Good L5 class, managing to be interesting\/engaging and cover a lot while keeping workload and readings to a minimum.",
    "The strength of this course were in its structure; we covered a lot of interesting topics that did not first come to mind when I think of Spain, and the class provided analysis about Spain's everchanging relationships with its ex-colonies as well as with Europe."

    "Yes, 100%. Best Spanish course at Yale.",
    "Yes, if looking for an interesting L5 class with manageable workload."
