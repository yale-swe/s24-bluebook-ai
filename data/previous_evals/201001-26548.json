   "comments": [
    "Borderlands is a good really interesting class. The subject matter is obviously very specific which is something to keep in mind when choosing the course, but it's really interesting and because of its specificity, the people who take it are pretty self-selecting. I think I learned a lot and was definitely very interested in the subject matter. The assignments are manageable. We had 4 reading responses, 1 film response, a take home midterm and a research paper.",
    "I would definitely recommend this seminar to anyone with an interest in the contemporary and historical issues surrounding the US-Mexico borderlands. Professor Gutierrez was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material, and selected a great mix of readings and film materials. The reading responses were on the longer side (1-2 single spaced pages) but they were spaced out pretty well throughout the semester. The mix of students in the seminar also ensured that discussions were engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student as a good comprehensive overview of the borderlands region, especially if you don't know anything about it and are interested. Workload is manageable and typically engaging, and as it's a seminar, good discussions are frequent and rewarding.",
    "A very good overview of the border. It's a good amount of work, only because you have four reading responses, which means you have to do all the reading. But you do learn a ton as a result, and what you learn in this class informs the way you read all the news about immigration and the border. You won't think about US-Mexico relations in the same way. That said, the professor is not such a great discussion leader, but if you have a good group of people who are opinionated and ready to contribute, it won't matter.",
    "I think this is an important class for anyone who has any opinion about immigration or transnational economics--and everyone should. It give you good insight into the history of the border region, as well as its current state. It also provides an understanding of the human element of issues surrounding the border, which is really important. A normal amount of reading and assignments."
