    "I learned a lot about the existing theory in normative ethics, and was able to really hash out and fine tune my opinions on the matter",
    "A dive into the complex field of normative ethics. I learned how to think on my feet, and to examine arguments and systems critically and philosophically.",
    "I improved my knowledge of different ethical theories, the way in which these theories match up to, and depart from our moral intuitions. I learnt to write better, and I hope that my method of reasoning, my clarity, and style improved over the course of the semester. The class certainly made me more aware of my own ethical beliefs, and what the strengths and weaknesses of theories and beliefs I hold have.",

    "No weaknesses",
    "Readings are engaging and interesting, and discussion in seminar was always fun and enlightening. I thought it would have been helpful\/cool to have some sort of formal system to discuss paper topics with a peer\/ peer edit (I did some discussion of my paper topic with peers from the class independently anyways). The opportunity to meet with Shelly and discuss before papers was helpful, but he's a very challenging audience. And since we got to know each other's views so well in seminar, I thought it would be an interesting extra step to get to engage with people about what they were writing about. And discussion always helps me fine-tune my points. Just a thought.",
    "It's basically sitting at a table with 20 people doing real philosophical inquiry. I think this is awesome, and the best way to learn philosophy. At the same time though, it's exhausting. At the end of two hours sometimes it can become hard to stay engaged. Also conversation moves quickly, and sometimes it's difficult to stay involved when there are always other people who want to make a comment.",
    "I enjoyed how engaging class discussions were. Very rarely did any of us refer to the reading assigned for the week, but I think in terms of engagement, discussion could not have been better. I enjoyed getting know other people in the class. Often you can leave a seminar not even knowing the names of other people you have worked with, and that was not the case in this class. I also enjoyed the assignments, although I often found it difficult to formulate a topic that had a manageable scope. Saying that, I think that my writing improved a lot over the course of the semester, and I enjoyed having to apply myself to the material. I would have liked to have had the chance to work on my papers again, after having received feedback, instead of moving on to another paper, and another topic, but I recognize that the class is not a writing class, and submitting multiple drafts would be very demanding on the instructor. It may work to submit papers to other people in the class, and have there be a kind of peer tutoring process.",
    "Prof. Kagan is sometimes of the most pleasant person to be interacting with, nonetheless he is a very good and dedicated teacher."

    "Absolutely take this. Discussion is fantastic, Shelly is a great teacher. His feedback on the essays is as long as the essay itself",
    "Yes! Shelly is wonderful! I probably got the worst grades of my Yale career in this class. However, Shelly gives the best feedback.",
    "Yes, but only if you're willing to dedicate significant energy to writing papers.",
    "This class will certainly not be easy. The essays are tough and class discussion is intense. But it makes you look critically at your moral foundations, and I think that can be really important. It's challenging and difficult, but I believe these are questions we need to face.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I am so glad that I chose to take it.",
    "Only if such topics interested the student",
