    "I learned a lot about the political landscape of Latin America during the 20th century and about conflicts that are often not included in literature courses focused on the region. I also gained visual insight into what these places looked like 50 years ago, which is rare considering that few Hollywood movies or TV programs accurately portray South America."

    "I loved the course. Moira is an excellent professor and even stayed after class to continue discussion with her students. I would have liked to learn more about the historical context of the films in class, as I often realized my Latin American political history was lacking. But overall, the class was excellent."
