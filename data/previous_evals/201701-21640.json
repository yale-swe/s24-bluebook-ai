   "comments": [
    "Solving basic economic models: setting up optimization problem, first order conditions, comparative statics. Good practice of multivariable calculus.",
    "I came to understand many, many models of labor decisions and labor markets, and was exposed to some fairly rigorous mathematics behind these models.",
    "I learned a lot of the basic models in labor econ, and I got a broad based grasp of empirical trends.",
    "good mix of empirical trends in labor markets and rigorous analysis of models explaining them.",
    "In this course, I learned a variety of approaches to analyzing labor market decisions. We studied a wide range of interesting topics in labor economics, learning different ways to model complex decisions. The course utilized multivariable calculus and provided ways to to analyze models using mathematical as well as economic arguments. I had never previously considered how complex the labor market is, but also did not realize how many useful models and ingenious empirical approaches there are to examining these issues.",
    "I gained a great deal of knowledge on contemporary issues in labor economics, from inequality to unemployment, as well as the theoretical models behind them. The course goes over key papers in the field and focuses one unit on examining Piketty's arguments from Capital in the 21st Century, which I found particularly valuable."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: broad coverage of topics Weakness: some of the more difficult material was covered superficially",
    "The curriculum was a little ambitious, in that it felt like we were always speeding through material as fast as we could. I would have appreciated spending a little more time to get comfortable with and practice concepts.",
    "I think a strength is the models. I think the empirical parts are not taught very well at all, and should be more clearly stated.",
    "The class was straightforward and seemed to focus on the right things; I definitely learned a lot from it, especially relating to current economic trends that have major social and political implications. It could be improved by spending more time going through the math on models in class.",
    "The course's strongest characteristics were Prof. Lindenlaub's excellent lecture slides that were well-organized and very clear, as well as her good mix of empirical and theoretical approaches to each topic. I appreciated how much of an effort she made to present the data that both supported and appeared to contradict the models we studied, as this demonstrated how useful they were to analyzing workplace decisions. The course itself was also carefully thought out, with the problem sets evenly spaced, practice exams posted in a timely fashion, and office hours at useful times. While Prof. Lindenlaub did quickly learn everyone's name, the main weakness of the course I think stems from the fact that there were only about a dozen students in the class, but it was still taught like a traditional lecture. I know it is a huge amount to ask a professor to change the format of the class during shopping week after a lower enrollment level seems likely, but it seemed like there many ways that student engagement could have been boosted more effectively in such a small class, and with the professor and TF at every lecture. It was just a bit frustrating that a class with a professor, TF, and less than 12 students, was taught exactly as it could have been taught for a class of 100.",
    "Strengths: Fascinating material that was well-presented overall, focus on reviewing papers and Piketty's Capital was enjoyable. Very intellectually rewarding and stimulating. Class format often takes on participatory format. Weaknesses: Limited opportunities for office hours\/extra help, solutions not posted for exams, excessive focus on algebra\/calculations on the problem sets that took away from uncovering economic insights. Would have appreciated more applications, if possible, to labor economics in developing countries. Likely a small class, so expect curves on tests to be harsh."

   "comments": [
    "Excellent introduction to labor economics. I am quite pleased with this class.",
    "Certainly a challenging course, and fairly mathematically rigorous. Very interesting and relevant material, but be prepared to do a lot of intense algebra\/calculus on problem sets!",
    "A very model-based class, with some discussion given to empirical trends. In some sense, it reminds me of an extension of intermediate micro.",
    "If you're interested in the material take the class, otherwise you probably won't get much out of it (although in my opinion it's a good topic to know about)",
    "Yeah it's fine. Tough problem sets but good class. Lindenlaub is nice",
    "100% yes. Very interesting, challenging (in a good way), and clear explanations",
    "Labor economics is a solid upper-level economics lecture. The material is interesting, the professor lectures well, and the workload is manageable. Overall, I would say that students interested in the material and willing to look analytically (mathematically) at topics in the labor market will enjoy the course. For those not particularly interested in the material, I would not recommend this class, but if you have a prior interest in the labor market, this class is engaging and provides a useful toolkit of strategies for examining labor issues from an economic perspective.",
    "I would recommend this course if you want to engage with labor and microeconomic issues in a serious and substantive manner...you definitely walk out of the course learning a great deal, and I feel convinced about delving further into researching issues in labor economics and public policy. Particularly enjoyed the emphasis on discussing economics papers (Card and Krueger, Autor and Dorn, etc.) as well as the pertinent and highly topical debates surrounding income inequality throughout the course (including an overview of Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century). However, this is definitely one of the hardest courses I've taken in the Economics Department (while less work than General Equilibrium Theory, the models presented and the problem sets\/exams were often considerably more difficult). The tests demand going beyond the material from class and applying it to novel, modified models; be prepared to work hard here, and perhaps not come out of the class with a particularly high grade, particularly if the rest of the class is strong (which it was this year). Problem sets are difficult, particularly in the algebra\/calculus\/computation they entail at times."
