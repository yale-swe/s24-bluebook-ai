    "Unless this class is writing credit optional, don't take it. I'm an EVST major and needed to take it as a core course, not because I need to fulfill a skills requirement, so the writing credit portion was a royal pain when combined with the amount of reading that needed to be done (although you can get away with only doing part of that), section requirements, and having a midterm + final.The material is fascinating, but Paul Sabin is a horrible lecturer \u0096 he's monotonous and sounds bored with what he's talking about. People fell asleep on a regular basis, and half the class never showed up.Environmental history is incredibly important to a wide range of disciplines, but I would not take the course again if given the choice if offered in its current iteration.",
    "didn't take it for the major, but had a lot of fun. would recommend",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT it's so good.",
    "very simple history class. easy to do well in without going",
    "I would definitely recommend the course, especially as a writing credit.",
    "Interesting material, good lectures, reasonable exams, high workload. Recommended.",
    "I found this to be a very interesting class and I enjoyed how there were major themes that we followed from colonial times to the present. The class seemed to jump around different eras because we would follow one topic and then go back a couple hundred years to start a new them, but it was still easy to follow once the TFs developed a timeline. Two short papers in the first month of the semester and then a 10 page research paper due at the end. I would recommend starting the paper early instead of waiting until the night before it is due to start...whoops. I would recommend the class to all majors and thought it wasn't too much work for a writing course. Midterm and Final were easy...gave you about 40 IDs the week before and then you had to pick 7 out of 12 for the test.",
    "If you are interested in the environment this class is pretty good. The material is very interesting and the readings are actually really good too. It is an easy writing credit (two 2 page papers that are really more like reading responses, and one 8-10 page research paper). The one drawback is that the lectures are pretty dull and long (75 minutes).",
    "I would recommend History 120 for any anyone who is interested in Environmentalism and considers himself to be an environmentalism. You learn to write from a different perspective in this course although there are not too many writing assignments. This is nice as one can really focusing on producing a interesting and polished term paper. Lectures are entertaining and informative, you will really learn a lot from this class. Very enjoyable and not overwhelming with work. In the beginnings there are quite a bi of readings (~150 pg a week) but these get shorter and shorter as the semester goes on.",
    "Don't take it for the WR credit\u0097the way the class is structured, you really won't learn how to improve your writing. Overall, this class was an engaging and interesting experience. I'm glad I took it. If this course continues to be offered, I hope that lectures will be more structured: historical timelines should be used to greater effect in creating the narrative of environmental history.",
    "Fantastic course, I learned a lot, I enjoyed the lectures, I went to the lectures because they were enjoyable and I wanted to, not because I was worried about missing material. I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding how we got to where we are today from an environmental perspective.",
    "Not the way to determine if you want to be an ES major, but a great class to help get you there.",
    "Excellent I love this class. Take it!",
    "This is a pretty standard intro to environmental history. I'd definitely recommend this class if you like either history of the environment. Especially for environmental studies majors (like me), it provides a great context for much of the current debates in the field. It also helps broaden the analysis to include political, social, and cultural factors that often get lost in environmental debates. Also, its not really that much work.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It is great for anyone interested in history, as it develops a new lens through which to view historical events.",
    "Yes, definitely. Especially if you are new to the subject.",
    "Take this class if you care about environmental issues or need yet another reason to dislike America.",
    "I would not recommend it.",
    "A great course to learn about the environmental history of the United States. It was not too much work for a writing credit, and you will learn a lot. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. However, go into it recognizing it is a writing credit and will be treated as such.",
    "There are better history classes out there. The material is interesting, but if you're really curious just read the better books from the syllabus\/some wikipedia articles. This class tried and failed spectacularly to be a WR credit: it will do nothing whatsoever to improve your writing. Section was awkward and unproductive, but that might depend on your TA.EVST 120 wasn't that hard, though, so if you're into that I guess I recommend it. You won't be challenged, and you will learn some cool things. But overall Bill Rankin's Catastrophes class (for example) will teach you far more about environmentalism and make you think, which this class basically never does.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone who thinks they might be remotely interested in current environmental issues. To understand where we are and where we're going, you have to know the past. And it's fascinating.",
    "Readings and content are really amazing and interesting, and not too difficult. The things we learn about are just fascinating. It's a lecture and a section, not too much work, but having both the research paper and the final was a little rough at the end of the semester.",
    "This course is mildly interesting if you are interested in the environmental movement. The beginning is a bit dull, but it picks up within the first couple weeks or so. There are a lot of readings, but you certainly don't need to do them all. The writing requirements for this course get annoying though, on top of the fact there is a midterm and a final. It wasn't a difficult course, but it felt like it was always keeping me busy one way or another. Overall, take it only if you're really interested in the material or if you are required to. Sabin's lecturing style can be a bit dry, so make sure that you're okay with that before you commit to this course.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to either anyone interested in the subject, or anyone looking for a WR. probably not the easiest WR, but if youre someone who goes to class just about all the time, then its a really interesting course that you'll get a lot out of.",
    "I would not recommend this class. The readings are great, but lecture is disjointed and sort of directionless.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are willing to do the reading, as the reading is maybe the best part of the course, but there is a lot of it. The class provides excellent and thorough context for environmentalism and all of its incarnations. Explores the themes of the environmental identity and the relationship between American culture and the environment.",
    "This class is not difficult, and pretty interesting as well. I would say I took a lot away from it.",
    "I enjoyed this class, but I think I would have enjoyed it more had the WR credit been optional, as it made for a lot more work and was frustrating for those of us who have already completed their WRs. (Or, I wish we'd had an option to choose between paper and final).This was a basic overview of enviro history in the USA. I wish we had spent longer on the post-1970s period -- we only worked on it right at the end. Lectures could admittedly drag sometimes -- it might have been better as a 50 minute course instead -- but Prof. Sabin is very clear about the main points he wants you take from each lecture and he uses lots of photo and sometimes interesting videos in the lectures. The concepts we learned did not on the whole \"blow my mind\" --- I often didnt find them to be too fascinating or surprising, but this was still a solid survey\/intro course."
