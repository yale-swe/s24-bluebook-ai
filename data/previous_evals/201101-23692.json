   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course, especially if you are interested in Marx beyond his contribution of sociology. Be prepared to read a lot (you don't have to understand it all, but it's good to do all the reading in order to make sense of it as a class with Professor Denning's help), and be prepared to spend a lot of time in the library and the archives, researching a couple of individual topics during the semester. You will get out of it what you put in!",
    "Take this class!!! Without a doubt among the top three I've ever taken here. Prof. Dening is one of the best professors and nicest people at Yale. This class also attracts some of the most bad a** students at Yale. Don't miss out on the opportunity to take this class! Unless, of course, you suck. In which case, we don't want you anyway.",
    "If you really want to engage Marx and social movements (this class tries to do both), then take it. Far more engaging than your DS week or two on him. But honestly, take it for Denning, he's really an incredible teacher. The readings though are incredibly long.",
    "A fantastic course. Professor Denning is wonderful. No other class at Yale has impacted me in the same way.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in getting a grounding on Marx and worldwide social movements. not only that, but you are able to write your papers about any social movement around the world that you want and pull in what you learn from class. they are very open ended and the class presentations are awesome and super helpful. great, great class-- learned a TON. but also a lot of reading!",
    "Great to put the theory next to the social movements, and I love the Michael Denning Way, which involves small independent projects and lots of smart things coming out of his mouth, and everyone in the class magically loving each other by the end.But it still didn't quite fit together--not quite enough room for both halves of the syllabus.",
    "solid introduction to marx, his thought, his legacy, and the accompanying social movements. a global class starting at the industrial revolution, driven with source materials from specific ones that students pick.",
    "This course was both illuminating and excitingly. It was a great introduction to the social movements associated with Marxism, Socialism, and Anarchism as well as the writings of some of their great thinkers. Professor Denning's near encyclopedic knowledge of global social movements boggles the mind. I couldn't imagine a better person to introduce this material. Take this class!",
    "This was my absolute favorite class i've taken at yale so far! it was at once an incredibly educational lecture, and an insightful seminar group. The Professor was everything you could ever ask for in a professor: knowledgable, enthusiastic, approachable. and you really leave feeling like you have an expanded understanding of marx and the early social movements.",
    "A really interesting, not typically AMST class about socialism and marxism in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Take it, it seems like a lot of daunting reading but as long as you do most of it you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend AMST 368 to anyone interested in the history and theory of the radical Left. The coursework is fascinating, and discussions in class were generally fairly strong. The class is frustratingly disjointed at times - there is a tremendous amount of material covered, from socialist theory to at least a sketch of the history of antisystemic social movements in the 19th and early 20th centuries - but nonethelessworthwhile."
