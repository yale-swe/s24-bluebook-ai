    "No weaknesses really. This is the type of class where the homework is really hard (but doable) and you can't find the answers online. It reminded me of Econ 350 in that way. I think this is ideal because if you do the homework you don't really need to study for the exam too much, i.e. you actually have to learn. The lectures are intimidating but don't let that scare you away!",
    "Strengths: Professor (Zhou Fan) really knows his material, and the course is very well-organized. If you follow the class, you will learn A LOT. Professor's really kind and supportive too. Weaknesses: The course is 100% lecture. In class, the professor pretty much copies his lecture notes onto the white\/black board. Although he does a fantastic job explaining the material, class was often too fast and many students including myself ended up busily copying down what was written on the board. It's not that the professor didn't care whether the students were following or not; it was more that the class was structured in a way that made it difficult for students to be fully engaged during the lecture. Last, I wish I'd gotten more feedback on homeworks. We had weekly homeworks (mostly proofs) that took well over 15 hours a week. But comments on the graded homeworks were often not very helpful. Also, it would have been helpful if they were returned more quickly, especially before exams."
