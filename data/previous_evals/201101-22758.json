   "comments": [
    "This class was great - Professor Butler is really awesome (and hilarious), and the material is very interesting. You read a lot of empirical studies and learn how to spot good methodology. You also learn how to design your own research proposal, which opens doors to pursue political science research in the future. Take this class if you want to see how political science can and should be grounded in empirics.",
    "I really didn't like this class, but that is because it was nothing like I expected it to be. I thought it would actually be about politics and the media in the US, rather than on how to evaluate different research techniques. In truth, the class really could have been about anything, since the media component of the class was so tiny. Also, way too early in the morning. Also, be forewarned about the final project...it's harder than it seems it will be.",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is very academia oriented. you really just read a lot of journal articles and dissect the methods. You don't really read widely or discuss more quantitative issues. It is pretty laid back though and the professor is a generally fun guy so it was an enjoyable experience but not my best class at Yale.",
    "This class is great! The grade consists of three 2-page analyses of a weekly reading of your choice, that you can do basically any time you want plus the final paper and a presentation on the final paper. Final paper is a 12-15 page research proposal. Besides the graded stuff, the discussion each day is pretty light, so as long as you have 1-2 things to say about the readings, you're good to go.",
    "Yes, Dan Butler is a great professor and seminar leader, and the research proposal portion of the class is definitely something that has improved the way I view political science and is a helpful skill to develop. The subject matter and readings were great and the workload was manageable.",
    "Each week, Professor Butler assigns a series of studies as reading. If you fear statistics, stay away from this class. Otherwise, take it! Professor Butler is great! He is passionate about what he does. He will teach you about scientific methodology as it pertains to Political Science without stressing you out too much.",
    "Pretty solid course, I learned a lot from it, especially about how to think about political science research. Focused a little too much on metholdology and critiquing how studies were carried out, whereas I would have prefered a bit more emphasis on the contents and issues brought up by the studies.",
    "Approach this one with optimism but shop carefully. This was the first year it was offered and it may well grow into a particularly appealing course. As it was this year, the syllabus nicely consisted of actual peer-reviewed poli sci literature, and the expected level of sophistication was fairly high, but not every topic was particularly interesting (do I really care if the politically inattentive seem to learn more about foreign policy when they watch \"soft\" news?) and conversations seemed a bit similar each week and not terribly interactive (i.e. people tended to make isolated points rather than respond to each other). Blame should be shared by the students and the professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Butler knows his stuff and if you like statistics, you'll do very well."
