He really took good care of us. His powerpoints had all of the most vital information. I feel like I REALLY REALLY Learned from this course.",

Professor Sussman put so much care and time into a class--the slides are amazingly comprehensive and his readings were always the most up to date best sources on the subjects one could find making every bit of the course and what we took away valuable.

Also, there must be another way to present the policies, because with the power point it was very very dry and dull, and these are interesting things! Is there a way to put less so we can do more?? Feel like I don't remember 80% of what was presented, and we only grazed the surface.",

    "The advantages were the opportunity to learn from my peers and their vast experiences. I loved talking through the topics and hearing their differing viewpoints. Our group did a good job of sticking together in many ways on the big picture and trying to keep everyone on the same page. the one disadvantage of this was that we didn't always have a clear line of say, a sector, that each person was in charge of which at first seemed like a good idea but in the end sort of led to a lack of accountability and writing a lot of the sections fell on just a few of us--but i'm still glad we didn't split it up into sectors in the beginning since I wouldn't have had the chance to get as great of a big picture."
