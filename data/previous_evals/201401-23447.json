    "ANTH 948 is a collaborative review course that examines a 25-year period in Nepali history from a wide-range of disciplinary perspectives. The course seeks to understand this period on its own terms, but to also situate it in the context of Nepal's broader history and the regional and global forces that helped to shape it.I would strongly recommend this course to another student, provided that the student has research interests related to Nepal's political transition. The course represents a unique opportunity to productively engage with a huge range of material and to understand how a scholar like Professor Shneiderman might address questions related to that material."

   "comments": [
    "The course did not focus on a single discipline, but it provided me with a depth of knowledge about scholarship on Nepal that I would not have otherwise been able to achieve on my own. The course was perfectly timed for my purposes as a graduate student and has profoundly shaped the way I anticipate approaching and situating my dissertation research."
