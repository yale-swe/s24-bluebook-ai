    "The AMTH senior seminar is great. Your project will take a ton of time, but you'll come to really be invested in it and proud of your work by the end. I think the seminar format is preferable to an independent project because Professor Barron stays on top of you about getting at least something done before the very end of the semester. He can be tough during presentations, but only to make sure you really, really understand your topic inside and out. All in all, it was a really positive way to end my senior year.",
    "I would not recommend this class in its current state. Just take the senior project as an independent project and avoid sitting through the seminar - we only had one guest lecture (by Professor Barron) and instead spent the entire time listening to students give presentations that were way to long and were drawn out even more by Professor Barron's incessant question asking.",
    "While I really enjoyed working on my senior project this semester,I think the AMTH 490 seminar was very poorly run. We just ended up sitting through presentations all semester. We each gave an initial presentation describing our proposals, which took several weeks. After a 2 week gap, midterm presentations began, which carried us literally up until 2 weeks before our final project presentations. Preparing 3 presentations over the course of the semester really takes away from time that could have been spent working on our projects. I would recommend that the professor scrap the midterm presentations and instead give students time to discuss and work collaboratively during class time. Additionally, I felt that the professor was fairly misguided in his requirements for the class. I do not believe a 30-100 page paper is appropriate for an applied math senior project. Unless you're doing a data analysis project and unnecessarily padding with plots and tables, you will end up spending a huge amount of time writing up background material to fill your report. While this can be a useful exercise, it was really frustrating - I would have preferred to spend my time working on my own ideas instead of writing an introductory text on the subject I was exploring. I would recommend doing your senior project independently in the fall - you will almost certainly get more done.",
    "yes",
    "You have to take it if you're a senior major, but it's very interesting to hear about other people's projects. Just try to tailor your presentations so the rest of the class can understand and it's more useful for everyone."
