I don't think she ever once cancelled her office hours, which seemed to be a common occurrence for other TAs and was very difficult on people who depended on them. She was great at explaining concepts that weren't clear in class.",

In my limited interactions with him, he rarely showed interest in advancing student understanding of the material, and was not particularly adept at clarifying questions.",

Leanne was patient, and always willing to go out of her way to explain difficult concepts in a way that was clear. I really appreciate her help this semester; she is a very patient tutor. I went to tutoring with Fjodor several times, and he was also helpful but significantly less engaging than Leanne. I never went to tutoring with Dan, so I cannot comment on his effectiveness.",

    "I was lost once we hit transformations\/logs\/etc., but overall felt the course was extremely helpful. The material is covered quickly and I found it difficult to keep up with the concepts, but the homework wasn't overly burdensome. I greatly appreciated the statistical concepts that I'll take away for the course even if I will always feel more comfortable calling a statistician than doing the stats myself!",
    "I honestly couldn't think of a way for Jonathan to be a better teacher. I was really not looking forward to taking a stats class, but Jonathan made this class so entertaining and engaging, and was able to explain everything in a way that students understood it. Great job!",
    "Dr. Reuning Scherer was a difficult teacher to follow in the classroom. He moved very quickly, and did not maintain a good balance between the tasks of advancing student understanding of the basic principles of statistics and equipping us to interpret outside expert analyses. I attribute some of this apparent ineptitude to the murky goals of the course at large, because Dr. Reuning Scherer was helpful and clearly committed to student learning outside of the classroom.",
    "It is essential to be familiar with statistical concepts and this was a great introduction course that focused more on applied statistics rather than the mathematics behind it.",
    "Jonathan has a tough job here! I'm sure it's not easy to teach statistics to a group of non-math majors, but he did a very good job of making the course engaging through the use of real world examples. Jonathan's humor also goes a long way in making the class engaging, which is something that I very much appreciate. I think Intro to Stats should be a requirement for all master's students. I took Intro to Environmental Science during my undergrad, but I still learned a great deal through this course.",
    "Question 4: Sometimes the way of professor on explaining the subject slightly on a high speed.",
    "The course would be improved by explaining when to use each type of statistical analysis. (This happens to some degree with the \"Incomplete Guide\" during the last week.) I recommend summarizing when and how different analyses are used. Class slides are cluttered and not useful for reviewing key concepts. If possible, make them cleaner and explicitly state which topic is being addressed."

    "Great balance of homeworks, take-home tests, and project. It puts less pressure on the grade and more on actually learning the material.",

    "Assignments were helpful in reviewing materials, and the instructor really does try his best to keep students engaged with what could be dry material. Concrete examples and demonstrations were very helpful.",

    "Helpful problem sets, funny instructor, good for understanding basic statistics.",
    "Clear lectures, hands-on assistance with homework in the flipped course.",
    "Professor Reuning-Scherer led an excellent class. He was energetic at every class meeting, patient with student questions, and found ways to make the material interesting. This is my third college or graduate level statistics class, and the teaching ability of Prof. Reuning-Scherer far exceeds tenured lecturers at Middlebury and Harvard. He was especially useful in a one-on-one or small group setting, and worked very hard to make himself available. He is the most accessible professor I know at Yale.",

That said, I would have benefitted from having a text book that the course was explicitly linked to. I did get a textbook for this course, but because the course followed a different outline it was difficult to know what to read beforehand (which I really need to do to understand fully what is going on in class). During the beginning of the course, sometimes it felt that there was not any space made for checking student comprehension or for questions. This improved later in the course though.",

    "the lecture notes are all over the place. I'd love to have the diagram you gave at the end of the semester on which test you use and when, couple that with a chart of the different formulas for sd, variance, mean, etc + minitab + other stats formulas to use them. It was quite hard to try and go back and decipher the lecture notes to find the specific formulas. (the lectures were great, but my notetaking was lackadaisical i guess). provide specific problem sets to students beyond the homework for extra practice. it was a lot of work to try and find useful ones in the various book options.",
    "Lecture could be much improved, either by gearing it more heavily towards teaching the fundamental mathematics behind statistics, or towards interpreting expert analyses. Presently, it is a hodgepodge that does not adequately serve either purpose.",
    "Sometimes it was hard to follow along with the textbook due to the speed of the class. I would read along but then we would move quickly in class - maybe an updated syllabus as the weeks go by.",
    "That's a tough question. Jonathan does a great job with this course, and Statistics is meant to be at least somewhat challenging. I struggled most during the probability section of the course, but I don't necessarily think we should have slowed down there more than we already did.",
    "The course was very fast-paced, with lots of information packed pretty tightly. I do feel that it was all well-presented, and the homework assignments helped for reviewing important concepts, but I do feel as though I will have to re-learn a lot of the material later in order to really have a grasp of what I'm doing.",

    "Critical for homework assignments.",

    "Do it!",
    "I think this would be a good one off course if you don't plan to take more statistical coursework, but if you do maybe look for something a bit more focused?",
    "- Go to Jonathan's office hour - Get the Cartoon Guide",
    "Not to miss the class as things gets messed even if you miss a class",
    "Go to every lecture and stay focused. If you drift off for a minute, you can get lost. Also, don't worry about doing the textbook readings before class. I only read the textbook after lecture if there was something that I was still confused about.",
    "if you're ever going to take stats, take this course with jonathan. go to office hours early and often, lose any inhibitions about asking dumb questions. Try and get extra problem sets for practice.",
    "This course is un-necessary if you have any prior background in statistics.",
    "Get one of the textbooks. The class moves quickly and it is easy to be \"inactive\" during class since the notes are provided for you. However, being \"inactive\" is not conducive to doing the homeworks, which really test your understanding, therefore get the textbook so you can be prepared for each class so it is more meaningful.",
    "Take it. I guarantee this class will make you feel more confident when you assess the validity of research papers, and it will certainly be needed if you plan to conduct your own research.",
    "Seek help early!",
    "Always try to keep up with the class and never procastinate.",
    "Submit the assignments and home works on time, Never miss classes.",
    "You should take this course, no matter what background do you have. It easy to understand and the professor also supplied us with the video in case you missed something in the class session.",
    "Take it! Borrow a book from the library as a reference, as there's no assigned textbook.",
    "Take it! Read the Cartoon Guide, and visit JDRS often and early to clarify lectures and get help on coursework.",
    "Take the class, even if you've hated statistics in the past!",
    "Data is increasing becoming a crucial tool in decision making and understanding its analysis could not be more valuable",
    "Great class, great & engaging lecturer, not a lot of work, learned a lot",
    "It's a very demanding course, don't take it in a semester with other demanding courses."
