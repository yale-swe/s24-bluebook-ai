    "It was an excellent overview class - for both people with a strong science background and for people with not as strong of a background. great job of combining epidemiology with biology, and not focusing on just one or the other.",
    "It's a lot of material to memorize. Might have been a bit more manageable to have bi-weekly quizzes testing us on the biology of the different diseases, and then have the exams remain in essay format, to serve as more of a synthesis of the conceptual aspects of the material. It is very hard to be tested on it all at once, there was just so much material.Make the textbook available at the book store. I didn't even know it was required, and then tried to buy it but it was too expensive. The med library only has one up-to-date copy. If we are going to have such expensive text books for required courses, can we have more copies on reserve for people who can't afford it?",
    "This was a great course. I really liked how the course focused not only on the biology of various pathogens, but also the public health implications of the pathogens. We learned to use what we knew of the biology in order to understand and explain the epidemiology of the resulting disease. A variety of pathogens were covered.",
    "excellent, well structured and covered most everything",
    "Great class that was more about memorization and instead focused on logistics of disease control.",
    "The course itself was great - I loved the setup of learning a different disease every class period and getting a broad overview of different infectious diseases. It would have been nice to have some final wrap-up of the course which brought everything together, but all of the individual sections were really interesting and well-taught!",
    "a great overview course of infectious agents with emphasis on the practical concerns to public health and implementing interventions.",
    "Lecture heavy course but material is interesting and tests are very fair.",
    "The class was super interesting! It was great to finally have a class that talked about diseases. However, I would rename it to \"epidemiology of microbial diseases.\"",
    "We covered many different pathogens and perhaps the course can structured in another way where we look at themes that links up diverse pathogens (e.g. antibiotic resistance, vaccine failure etc). The exam questions are pretty long, although time is sufficient, it's just a lot of writing at times.",
    "This is an excellent class! It was a very interesting introduction to a number of viruses, bacteria, and parasites; a very helpful and exciting class for EMD students.",
    "I enjoyed this class. I thought it covered many relevant topics in depth and focused on interesting points about their epidemiology, genetics, etc. As far as weaknesses, I thought the grading of tests seemed a bit ambiguous. We would often have points off for our answers but not really know why.",
    "It was a great course. I learned a great deal and thought it was a good survey of the major infectious diseases an MPH student should be expected to know about. The material was great. Perhaps the slides could be given more structure, ie use the same structure each class.",
    "A very interesting, informative course. Covers a very wide variety of infectious agents.",
    "The class was a great overall introduction to infectious agents common in the practice of public health within the United States and internationally.",
    "excellent, covered so much material. I feel like a gained an great foundation in infectious diseases and the associated issues.",
    "The course covered a lot of the general microbiology concepts, but it also included topics that the class was interested in learning about.",
    "I enjoyed this course more than any other courses I took this semester. The material was of great interest to me and I think it was presented in a way that made sense to me and helped me really learn and remember what I was taught."

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Very good! However, it would help if the instructor appeared to be more excited about teaching this course.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0amazing, very knowledgeable and caring",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She did a decent job presenting the information. Her explanations of complex processes were sometimes confusing, but overall her knowledge of the subject carried her through. Days that had a lot of class participation (all of the class, not just one person) were very good because it kept everyone alert.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Amazing job. Thumbs up",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great instructor! She had great concern for students and their interest in the class. She put a lot of time into the course which showed in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was a great instructor! She was always available for outside questions and was very sensitive to student needs. She was really knowledgeable about the subject matter, and would always go back to any information that she didn't have an immediate answer for.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0dry sense of humor and a very matter of fact way of teaching the subject matter. the expectations of the course are very straight forward. I wonder if a little differentiation within the course format might make it a little more exciting. presentations on a pathogen for one of the assignments perhaps?",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Lectures were fairly easy to understand and Dr. Pettigrew is very nice and approachable.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She was great. i really enjoyed the class and appreciated the effort she put in to it. i also liked the random news articles she would send us about microbial topics.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr Pettigrew is an excellent instructor and she's able to explain concepts clearly and concisely to students. Also appreciate the study guides she put out before mid-terms and final exam, as they were really helpful in focusing revision on the important topics.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is an excellent professor; definitely one of the best that I have had here at YSPH. She is engaged with students, explains things very well, makes class fun, and is always available if students have questions or concerns.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was an interesting and enjoyable lecture. I especially liked her ability to lighten topics that might otherwise not be things people normally talk about (ocular gonorrhea, etc).",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0The instructor was excellent. Very knowledgeable, confident, and clear.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Very well versed in infectious agents.",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Wonderful instructor. Notes were a little disorganized, but that's my one small complaint.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was excellent and clarified any questions students may have had, and tried to engage students during lecture.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0There was a lot of material to cover, and I thought she did an excellent job of choosing what was the important stuff to teach and what we could learn on our own."

    "She was never around (besides one review session that didn't go so well), so I can't really answer this question.",
    "Did we even have a TA?",
    "TA: Allison EhrlichAllison was not very helpful to the students as the teaching assistant for this course, but that may have been due to the nature of the course. There were only 3 short assignments, which she graded. She included comments on the graded homework, which was good feedback. For this course, the professor may have needed a TA, but the students did not necessarily benefit from having one.",
    "Non-existent, didn't show up to the class, not as helpful as I would have thought. Its a bummer.",
    "I don't understand why there was a TA for this course as she didn't do anything. It was pretty obvious from the one review she gave that she didn't know the information.",
    "The TA was very unprepared, unresponsive to feedback, and not involved in the course. She only did one TA session for the entire course. The one TA session she did hold was a disaster. She was extremely unprepared for topics that were discussed in lecture. However, because she does not attend class, she was unable to discuss the material with any of the students.",
    "The TA was not helpful and was not really apart of the class.",
    "i don't know the name of the ta because she only taught one review session before we asked Melinda to teach them instead. I think that hiring a ta that has more recently taken the class and remembers the material is better than having a ta who may be doing phd work on something similar but has forgotten the material of the course.",
    "We did not have much exposure to her.",
    "The TA only helped to lead one review session before the first exam, then didn't participate much in the class.",
    "Allison. I think we saw her once the entire semester. It felt like she wasn't really involved in anything and I'm not totally sure of what she did.",
    "The TA was not confident, nor did she prepare well for our review session. She did not attend class and had never seen an exam for the class, so it was difficult to use her as a resource.",
    "not really a presence as the TA of the class since she didn't conduct the review sessions (except the first on which didn't go too well) and she wasn't present in class either.",
    "Sorry, but the TA was useless.",
    "Allison was not available often, and when she was availale she was not very helpful and seemed to struggle explaining basic biology concepts.",
    "Our TA was not very helpful."

    "This class provides an introduction to infectious diseases, current attempts at vaccine development, and means of controlling these diseases.I would definitely recommend it to any student here at YSPH; it has been one of my favorite classes here!",
    "This course is an excellent review of a wide spread of infectious bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents and the epidemiological measures being taken to combat them. It is a required course for EMD. Work load is generally light, though tests cover quite a bit of material.",
    "This course gives you a great overview of major infectious diseases, their biology, pathogenesis, and the current and past public health measures used to combat the disease.I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. I learned a great deal.",
    "The course was a great review and introduction to some of the predominant infectious agents around the world which affect large numbers of people. The biology of the agents along with the political debates surrounding treatment are discussed.",
    "yes-very interesting material and prof. pettigrew is extremely approachable",
    "It's a required course, but I'd defintely give the course high remarks.",
    "This class is pretty science heavy but it also includes epidemiology concepts and discusses some of the policy issues behind public health interventions. Would recommend to students with a comfortable biology background.",
