    "Weekly assignments are a bit tedious and I personally think there are too many readings per lecture, but overall this is a great class for someone interested in food policy.",
    "A discussion section would be nice to talk abut the issues raised in lecture. Also, I wish that the guest lecturer from Hopkins talked more about current food litigation. I also wish there was more of a discussion of the environmental impacts of our food system and the policies that shape our current system. I thought we would get into the farm bill.That being said I think the course did a good job as a survey of food issues, particularly health issues related to food.",
    "It was an extremely interesting course that taught me a lot about topics that are not only relevant to me as a public health professional, but also in my general life",
    "This course not only taught me a lot, but it changed my lifestyle. I liked how it covered a broad range of topics, from biology to marketing, and I liked how it went over current controversies that are in the news today. I did not think there were any weaknesses in this course.",
    "Great course! Extremely interesting material.",
    "The greatest strength is Kelly. He is a dynamic professor with clear passion for the subject. The readings and lectures were well paired. The only weakness was the size of the class. This course would be amazing as a graduate seminar.",
    "I really loved the topics this course covered! I thought it was a great introduction into the major issues in food policy. It was a lot of fun to be taught by one of the leading researchers in the field!I might prefer a smaller, discussion-based seminar format, but I also appreciate that the current style allows you to offer the course to hundreds of students each year.",
    "The course really taught the issues with the food system and the consequential health problems. I thought the feedback on the assignments was not very specific or helpful.",
    "This is a fantastic course. As someone who has studied food policy, I learned new concepts in every class, and I can imagine that others who have no experience with it learned even more."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Kelly Brownell is the perfect professor for this course- as he really is the expert in the field.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0I thought Professor Brownell was very responsive and generally very good at presenting an unbiased view of all of the food issues, however I found the readings focusing on sugar-sweetened beverages and food equity issues lop-sided. The other view was not represented as heavily, and unlike with the science conducted by the beverage industry, I think there are valid arguments against a sugar sweetened beverage tax. For food equity issues, there wasn't any reading discussing WHY grocery stores are leaving areas, creating food deserts, etc.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Wonderful lectures, covered a lot of interesting and relevant material",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0I feel so lucky to have taken a course with Dr. Brownell. He was fair in presenting multiple sides of the arguments, but I enjoyed hearing about his expert opinions. It was great to have a professor who has real experience in the politics surrounding these issues. He spoke clearly and in an engaging way.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Great lecturer! Excellent speaker and I enjoyed his Powerpoints and use of radio& video clips.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Kelly was fantastic. He is well-spoken, clear, and eloquent. He provides deep thoughts on the topic. He is inspirational. The class could be improved if he sought more interaction with the students.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Dr. Brownell is a wonderful lecturer and such a great resource to Yale! We will definitely miss him next year as he continues his career at Duke next year!",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0He was an amazing lecturer and inspirational person.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0Great! But maybe could have involved students more.",
    "Instructor: Kelly Brownell \u00a0The instructor is a modest, engaging speaker who puts a lot of effort into making sure all competing perspectives are represented. I love that he puts comedy clips on at the end of class; it shows that he wants us to enjoy the class, and also that he can laugh at the humorous side of his own work. He is very approachable and open to talking to students."

    "Instructor: Erica Boothby \u00a0She was overall responsive and good. She could have given more detailed feedback on the concept sheets.",
    "Instructor: Jacqueline Sue Smith \u00a0I did not interact with Jackie in person, but she provided me with great feedback via email. Actually, many of the TFs answered my questions in a very thorough and helpful way throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Julia Rose Golomb \u00a0Strength: Quick feedback, positive attitudeWeakness: Feedback was brief and lacked detail",

    "Instructor: Kristin Lyn Leimgruber \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Peng Wang \u00a0Katie (Peng?) was very encouraging and personable in her emails. I would have liked to have the opportunity to meet her in the beginning of the semester so I would know who I was talking with. I also would have liked more feedback on my journals and projects, even when I received a good score.",
    "Instructor: Sara Emily Burke \u00a0Such prompt responses! Very helpful, and always provided insightful feedback on my weekly concept sheets.",
    "Instructor: Victoria Lynn Webb \u00a0Gave good feedback on assignments.",
    "Instructor: Victoria Lynn Webb \u00a0Victoria was very responsive to students and provided very kind, informative, timely feedback to students!The only thing that was a little bit frustrating was the midterm review- I think if TAs are given limited reign to answer questions, it might be best to do a structures review of some of the key concepts."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "Definitely would recommend this class, although with Kelly leaving I'm sure a new professor will revamp the class slightly.",
    "A good survey of health-related food issues and some current envirnomental issues with our food system.",
    "It is an undergrad course, so it has undergrad type work, but great course for anyone interested in this topic",
    "This course covers a broad range of topics related to food, from biology to politics, law, agriculture, etc. You have a chance to learn about and discuss current controversies in food and hear from experts in school nutrition, public health law, eating disorders, etc. You do response sheets throughout the semester, which force you to think about the issues, and you complete a final project which allows creativity and specialization in an area of interest. I would absolutely recommend this course to others.",
    "Fantastic intro course to food. Great way to think about a lot of the issues. Try not to be discouraged by the abundance of students clearly seeking an easy science class - the material is great.",
    "Great course and great introduction to the field taught by one of the leading names in the public health world!",
    "The course was an excellent way to learn about the food system without being too challenging or time-consuming.",
    "I would say take it, but it's the last year. Hopefully they have a similar class when Prof Brownell is gone.",
    "I would highly suggest taking it; relevant to anyone and going to become even more relevant as this topic gains focus in the media and politics."
