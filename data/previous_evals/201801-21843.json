   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I feel much more confident in approaching and utilizing archival material.",
    "Practice in dealing with archives, principally the real life experience of actually using them, and all the attendant challenges, disappointments and serendipitous elation. Some perspective on historiography, and on the purpose of archives.",
    "I really enjoyed this class's approach to the archives. Not only were we taught skills and tactics about entering the archives and organizing our research, but we also evaluated the composition of the archives. The class gave me a healthy skepticism of archival data, how did it get there and what might be missing.",
    "This course exposed me the practical skills of archival research -- how to access the archives, what you might expect to be there\/what might be missing, how to triangulate your research with the research of others, and how to use the tools available in the archives to improve your inference. It also exposed me to contemporary opportunities and challenges with archival work -- digitization, processing backlogs, etc.",
    "This class taught the principles of archival study. The coursework included readings about archival methods, examples of archival research (including debates among scholars reaching different conclusions based on the same evidence), and most importantly, significant amounts of assigned, hands-on archival research. I learned how to find archival material relevant to my interests, how to navigate archives, and what considerations should be made when thinking about the archival record.",
    "First-hand practice conducting rigorous archival research. Invaluable!",
    "I gained experience with archival research that I could not have imagined having without this course. The experience can be potentially helpful for my future projects."

   "comments": [
    "This was a wonderful course - my only recommendations would be to reverse the order of the assignments and to make it a longer course or one that met more frequently.",
    "I felt the early part, dealing with theoretical approaches to archives, could have been condensed and more cases of actually disputed historical research like the sessions on Goldhagen and Banerjee & Iyer could have filled the space. Those weeks were fascinating, because it was a chance to see how others had taken archives and turned them into research (or not) - it was as close to doing the actual archival research itself as possible. I feel it did more to conve the theory of archival research than the sections on theory that were disembodied. I also really liked that we all presented - I learned a lot from the different challenges we were all facing and the approaches other students were taking.",
    "The strength of this course was that it allowed students to actually get into the archives and conduct research firsthand. Some of the most enjoyable time I had this semester was conducting research in the archives. It also gave us experience in a structured setting the challenges of archival work. The only weakness I found in the course was the structuring of the assignments. Assignment 3 and the somewhat constrained topic would have been a great Assignment 1 for everyone to get a baseline familiarity with the archives at Yale. Then, making Assignment 2, the out of Yale assignment, the final project would have enabled a culminating project for the course.",
    "The strengths of this course were the practical skills for engaging with the archives and the numerous exemplars for how other scholars (including my peers have done so). We also concluded with a case study of Dahl's \"Who Governs?\" by triangulating his theories and evidence with the archival material available at Yale, which was helpful for considering how we might transport this exercise to other scholarly work. One thing that was missing for me was looking at how scholars cite archival material to better understand how we are providing readers with the evidence they need to a) buy our argument and b) be able to access the archives to corroborate or challenge the theory we've proposed.",
    "The greatest strength of this course was the level of engagement it allowed the students with the archives. All three major assignments involved research in the archives, which allowed me to actually apply what I had learned about conducting archival research. This was a bit dangerous, though, as it was very easy to get carried away and spend more time than I really could afford on these assignments. Some guidance on the appropriate amount of time for the research for these papers may have been helpful. I sincerely enjoyed the research and hearing about my classmates' findings, but they took up a lot of time. The class may have benefited from a smaller class size, to allow students to present their work in a bit more detail in a single class session.",
    "It might have been more useful to have the first assignment be the Dahl archives, as this would help acclimate us to doing targeted archival research. As the semester goes on, our ability to develop our own research questions based on our knowledge of doing archival research might improve as well.",
    "The syllabus was well organized although class discussions were not always fruitful. I learned more through hands-on experience in the archives than in class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! This is a critical methodological approach and a delightful course.",
    "Yes. It's a really valuable set of skills, especially if you see 'politics' with a horizon of several decades, rather than only being interested in what happened last week.",
    "I already have recommended this course to everyone else in the cohort. Fantastic course.",
    "Yes. Archives are not intuitive institutions and learning how to navigate them and find the necessary information is extremely valuable. I know I will use it in my future research.",
    "I think this class is vital for anyone hoping to do or evaluate archival research. Highly recommend."
