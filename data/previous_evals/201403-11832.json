    "Despite the name of the course, ARCG 172 is much more of an introduction to archaeology than a class about different hoaxes. Although we did discuss different examples of archeological hoaxes and frauds during the semester, much of the course was centered on learning about reliable archaeological procedures\/techniques.",
    "This was an amazing course. Hands down the best class outside my major that I've taken. It's not challenging, the worst parts are the two 10 page papers, which are annoying but manageable. Prof. Honeychurch is incredible. He's the best lecturer ever. He's a little crazy, but he's engaging, funny, and clearly a genius. DONT EAT THE CHEESE.",
    "I took this course Cr\/D. It was relatively easy, but I found it pretty boring. I wouldn't highly recommend it UNLESS you are interested in archaeology. I wasn't interested in archaeology to start with, and I thought the course would be entertaining and turn me on to archaeology, but I don't have any more interest than I started with.",
    "Absolutely take this class! If you want to learn what good archaeology is while also learning about crazy stories of pseudoarchaeology, then this class is a must-take. Lectures are engaging, fun, and the work load is so manageable. If you go to lecture, you simply have to skim the readings, since Honeychurch's lectures make you remember everything. Definitely a great course to take.",
    "This class is fun if you like the content. If you remember key dates and facts and attend most lectures you won't find this too difficult. The course is basically all within the Feder textbook. If you do that reading you are pretty much set. Having said that, the papers are much harder than the exams because we have to do independent research. Prof Honeychurch is so enthusiastic and engaging it's actually shocking at fist but I find it adorable.",
    "Not a gut in terms of workload, but it's very easy",
    "Take this course.",
    "My summary: A good survey of the realities of modern archaeology with a very energetic professor, but ultimately a course that feels a bit all over the place and lackluster.",
    "It's a good intro class for archaeology, very fun instructor, lecture is very active. There is a midterm and a final plus two ten page papers. You also have to attend to sections outside of class. Overall, it is very little work and worthwhile!",
    "If this is for your major take it. Otherwise, you might find a more interesting course elsewhere. Though it looks glamorous and the assignments doable with a full schedule, the readings are at times tedious and the motivation to attend lecture wains, especially on Friday afternoons.",
    "Honeychurch is fantastic- incredibly animated, and he makes lecture great. Material is interesting. Midterm, final, two easy 8-10 page papers, and two sections\/labs with questions. I had to take the make-up midterm, which was much harder apparently, and the grading ended up being very nit-picky on it- maybe they're trying to get rid of the gut label. Still by no means a difficult class, and the final was easy.",
    "This class is somewhat fun, although it isn't particularly interesting. Much of the material seems like common sense, and not a lot of time was spent on the truly interesting topics, such as how to date objects and assign chronologies to sites. Professor Honeychurch is an energetic lecturer, and he kept the lectures engaging enough to attend, but he didn't really seem to be in control of the class. One of the TAs seemed to be the only one keeping the class from falling apart at the seams. Overall, it was a fine class as a distribution requirement, but I don't recommend it if you want a truly interesting course.",
    "Yes! The class is very rewarding",
    "Great class, really engaging. It's an easy class as long as you don't treat it like a gut. There's enough practicums throughout the semester, just don't leave it til last minute.",
    "This class is a gut, but it also has a moderate amount of work in the form of the two 10 page papers (one due during reading period), midterm, final, and two lab section write ups. Professor Honeychurch's lectures are super entertaining, so you'll want to go to lecture (also necessary to do well in spite of guttiness). You'll get a solid intro to methods of archaeological research and analysis, and you'll learn about a bunch of cool hoaxes in archaeology and the labs are pretty interesting. I recommend it.",
    "Great social science, informative and fun. You don't have to do all the reading, but it might come back to haunt you on the final. The professor is engaging (and unusual), and really really excited about the material. Also Atlantis! And aliens! And great for Archaeologists and non-Archaeologists alike.",
    "Very freshman oriented intro to main methodologies and hoaxes in archaeology. If you're into archeology it's a good relatively simple course if you put the work in, but if you're not interested in archaeology at all I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in archaeology--if you try, you will learn a lot and have fun."
