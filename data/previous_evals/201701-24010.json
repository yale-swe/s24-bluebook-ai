    "This was an excellent survey of healthcare programs throughout the 20th century, which provided crucial context for our contemporary healthcare system. It is a must-take for any students who hope to understand healthcare in the U.S.!",
    "I've learned a tonne about the American healthcare system and how the history of healthcare in America has really shaped and given rise to the struggles\/challenges we see today.",
    "I loved this course. I learned so much about healthcare, inequality, and the evolution of healthcare. This knowledge is so critical, and everyone should take it!",
    "Better understanding of the healthcare system in the United States.",
    "Worked to understand the history behind the current state of healthcare in the United States. Learned a great deal about healthcare and ways of thinking about health that will be helpful regardless of what areas of study I pursue",
    "I learned to write an effective piece of historical analysis and how to think critically about the factors that influence health for the poor in the past, and how those factors are still influential today.",
    "I think this course was one of the few in History that I've taken that emphasized an awareness of chronology. Contributing to a timeline was one of our assignments, and we talked about chronology from week to week as well."

   "comments": [
    "Amazing syllabus and discussions! I wish the assignments had been slightly different (the less formal reading response was confusing, for example) but otherwise it was great.",
    "Strengths: Interesting class discussions with my classmates and mostly interesting readings. Weaknesses: Class did become quite monotonous, repetitive and therefore increasingly less engaging. It would have been nice to vary up things a bit. So instead of doing a tonne of readings every week, every so often watch a movie, or a tv show, or a ted talk, or read more newspaper articles or scientific journals. Just vary up the learning materials. But also vary up the class's structure. Do more small group work, debates, presentations, rather than just circulating questions and talking about the readings. There was a bit too much reading I would say given how dense the materials were. Less reading combined perhaps with some multimedia sources would have been a better balance. The first essay was far too short (3 pages) to be able to go into as much depth and analysis as Prof. Abedin was looking for. I would only have 2 essays and make both slightly longer, instead of having 3 but the first one be incredibly short.",
    "I loved this course. I learned so much about healthcare, inequality, and the evolution of healthcare. This knowledge is so critical, and everyone should take it! The reading amount is perfect, and the subject material is so interesting. I'm not entirely sure how the course could be improved.",
    "Sometimes Professor Abedin would allow long periods of silence and would ask questions that were very difficult to answer. Therefore, I wish she would give us a little bit of background on how the question or would guide us more to the answer.",
    "I think that the weakness could be that a general introduction to healthcare was never given (i.e. terms such as medicaid, etc.). However the course was very well organized with great readings. I also especially liked the creation of a timeline to organize the historic events we learned about",
    "Overall, the course was strong in that the readings were awesome and that Professor Abedin and is very kind and knowledgeable. I just wish there were other types of discussion (i.e. group debates, role plays, etc.)",
    "It could have been my particular group of classmates, but I kind of felt that we never really clicked as a group. Conversation was at times stilted, and there were some long pauses. Of course, this is true of any seminar. Some of the times that we worked together in groups helped the atmosphere a little."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely!! I loved it.",
    "Probably not, but take my answer with a grain of salt. The reason why I wouldn't recommend this class is because I personally didn't find the subject matter that interesting or engaging, which was totally my fault for taking it in the first place. I didn't know a lot about the American healthcare system and was keen to learn, however I don't think a high-level seminar was the best way to do this. And consequently I found the readings on the whole to be tiring, long and uninteresting, and the papers a struggle to write. If you are interested though in how healthcare for the poor has changed throughout the 20th century in the U.S then I would recommend this class. Just be prepared for a lot of reading.",
    "Yes, this course was very insightful and I think every student, especially those who want to go into health careers should take it! The discussions we had in class did a great job of relating historical information about the development of our healthcare system to current events. I learned so much!",
    "I loved this course. I learned so much about healthcare, inequality, and the evolution of healthcare. This knowledge is so critical, and everyone should take it! The reading amount is perfect, and the subject material is so interesting. Professor Abedin is incredibly sweet, brilliant, and excited about the material. Do yourself a favor and take it!",
    "Certainly -- the perspective given on the history of community and social medicine for the poor, for me, helped humanize my interest in medicine. Highly enjoyed this class!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in anything health-related. The course looks at the intersection of poverty and health, and delves deeper into other social issues that impact the health status of an individual. We also thought critically about how race and ethnicity play into this narrative. Definitely recommend if you're interested in discussing these topics.",
    "I'd recommend this course for the diversity of its readings (NYTimes articles, academic journal articles, history books, other primary sources) and the perspective of a physician-historian as an instructor."
