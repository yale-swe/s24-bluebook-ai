   "comments": [
    "I would summarize Chem 134L 01 as an intro course for learning basic lab techniques that is basically fine. It's a lot of work but it's manageable.",
    "Standard nonsense. Take only as a prereq, as everyone must needs do.",
    "It is a nice class to start learning chemistry lab techniques.",
    "Weekly quizzes and labs are stressful although it gets better.",
    "You will learn a lot from the class, but be prepared because it is very stressful if you do care about grades. You have to get 95% to get an A, and even if you did everything so well the whole semester and messed up a little bit with the final, you're doomed. The grading cutoffs are just horrible. Nevertheless, take the class if you want to have some practical skills, which will be extremely useful in the future.",
    "v v easy after ap chem",
    "This is a solid introductory lab that is informative if not enjoyable.",
    "The best you can do if this is a prereq is to just get through it, it is a lot of work but when you're done you're done.",
    "It was a general lab course used to supplement learning from Gen Chem 161.",
    "I would recommend scheme 134L to any student who wants to gain experience in working in a lab. I found the course to be very exiting and fun.",
    "I would tell a friend to avoid chem lab at all costs, even if that means changing majors",
    "I would say that it is a great effective start for someone who wishes to pursue the laboratory chemistry.",
    "CHEM 134L 01 is an important course for all STEM majors considering biological, or chemical research. The course goes into the instruction of chemical phenomenon which is useful for understanding the physical science. But is also teaches a lot about the important research\/lab environment, including experimental annotation, and lab reports which are highly relevant in biological, biomedical, and biochemical work. The course also helps to facilitate the lessons taught in CHEM 161. Overall, this is a very useful and important course for lab-prone students.",
    "Chem lab in general should be avoided if possible; it isn't fun and it a time suck. It isn't terrible, though, so if you must take it you'll survive.",
    "to summarize the class it is busy work. it is not really hard but it is very time consuming. I would not recommend this class to anyone who does not have to take it for their major, and if you do take it take it first semester when your course load is lighter and you will have the time to do well in the class.",
    "Unless you need to take this lab for your major, I would not recommend it. For me, it was more paperwork than real learning. That said, the labs were sometimes interesting, and the hands-on learning is a nice change of pace."
