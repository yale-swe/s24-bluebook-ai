   "comments": [
    "It's a great introductory course to integration and not terribly difficult.",
    "The course isn't impossible, but it's time consuming. Take it if you are interested in math, but don't stop yourself from taking it because it is difficult. As frustrating as it can be, it can be rewarding to realize that you survived it.",
    "Math 115 can be a challenging course. To do well, it will take quite a bit of effort and a good knowledge of the concepts, as exam questions can be complicated. However, if you have a good instructor, this class can be very informative and not too intimidating. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "standard math class... take it if you want\/need an understanding of integral calculus",
    "I have had a great time and learned a lot in Math 115 with Jim Rolf, but it has sometimes felt like I'll never agin use the things I learned unless I take another math class. That's just a fact about studying math though, and if you're reading this review it's probably because you're pretty set on taking a math class. Your call.",
    "Some concepts are similar to AP Calculus but to a deeper extent. Unless it is necessary for some academic major, I wouldn't take it.",
    "Take Math 115 only if it is required. It is not a scary class but be prepared to face material that is just plain hard to learn.",
    "It's a pretty good class! I really liked the structure of the class of watching the videos first to learn the concepts then doing practice problems in class. Definitely try to get in Rolf's section because he is the absolute greatest.",
    "It's a great course! I definitely recommend it to anyone that wants a challenging math course that is still doable.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student who has already taken a Calculus B\/C course. I cannot imagine taking this class without having any practice with the course. I took Calculus B\/C in senior year of high school and I found this class extremely challenging and demanding.",
    "Professor Rolf is the best! He does a great job of taking a subject that's pretty miserable and making it bearable (and surprisingly often, enjoyable).",
    "Its really hard, like harder than you would expect a mid level math class to be, so make sure you do the work throughout the semester. only take this class if you need it as a pre-req.",
    "It was a great class and you will learn a lot.",
    "An engaging class but needs a lot of time to get a good grade",
    "I would recommend this to any student who wants to learn Calculus or has taken the equivalent of this course in high school but didn't do as well as they would have liked.",
    "Good course but you need to keep up with video lectures.",
    "Quite a good Calculus class. Jim Rolf does a good job of making a dry math class quite fun. Even though prep problems are quite annoying, they are totally worth it. Video explanations are also way better than reading a textbook. Classes are also provide good practice."
