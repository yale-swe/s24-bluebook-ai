    "I would highy recommend this course to any other student, even if you are not an anthropology major. Socialisms and Postsocialisms was an amazing seminar with great readings, interesting students (graduate and undergraduate), and the best professor ever. Doug Rogers truly exceeded my expectations and made it well worth missing half of all my Mellon Forums and hiking up all the way to the anthropology building every Tuesday night after dark. Even though I didn't think that I had a particular interest in socialisms and postsocialisms going into the course, I finished the seminar with a profound appreciation of both anthropology as a discipline and the study of socialist\/postsocialist transitions. This course made me happy that Yale is a liberal arts institution that allows double majors like me to still take stimulating courses outside of my majors. The only weakness of the course is that it meets late at night.",
    "It's quite a bit of work (a book a week) but worth it, even for someone who is not an anthropology student.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are interested in all aspects of pos-socialist countries- we cover a lot of ground and it can be a times tedious if you are not 100% interested in the subject."
