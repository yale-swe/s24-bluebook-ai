   "comments": [
    "It's cool learning about arduino but I did not enjoy the class so I wouldn't recommend that you take the course unless you have to. It's not worth the stress.",
    "I enjoyed Digital Systems - the course is all about Arudinos, which I find to be fascinating! The course, however, is disorganized and lacks a clear syllabus. Professor Kuc is nice, but gets quickly defensive when you question him about this, or, particularly, the exams. Although the midterm was abysmal (Professor Kuc talked for 20-30 minutes to explain his poorly worded questions, which ultimately prevented me from finishing the exam), the final exam was much improved in clarity and saliency.",
    "Overall I thought it was a great course. I learned a ton about low level system commands and how to make devices work in ways you want them to. Lot of work at the end with the project reports. The form of the class seems to change a lot year to year, so it's hard to know what you're going to get.",
    "This course was not at all what I expected after reading the syllabus. If you choose to take it, be sure to ask what is going to be covered, and for CLEAR and SPECIFIC specs for the projects.",
    "You get to work with Arduino and do a 3 small hands on projects. I liked the material and learning about microcontrollers, but try to take this course with a different professor. You can get away with just reading the lectures and online resources to understand the material. Kuc's is fairly ambiguous and sexist.",
    "You'll go pretty far into the weeds in this class. Professor Kuc makes a point of you knowing the nitty gritty on how the hobbyist commands for the arduino really work. Overall, you'll do some cool projects and it's pretty fun. Make sure you go to class or you'll miss out.",
    "This course is a good introduction into microcontroller programming. I would recommend it, though it is a very introductory course; if you have significant prior experience with microcontrollers and it isn't a required course, it may not be for you.",
    "Good class whether you're an electrical engineer or not. If you enjoy tinkering with electronics and have a little bit of programming experience, you'll be fine! A good mix of interesting lectures and practical problems, ranging from color sensing to emulating the wireless protocol that powers Wifi."
