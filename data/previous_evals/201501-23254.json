    "take it if you have to for requirement reasons, otherwise a 5-day a week class and a waste of time",
    "It is a well-organized class that will improve your spanish. That said, you are probably only looking at these reviews because you need to take it. If you can take this class with Sonia Valle, do it. She goes very by the coursebook in terms of workload, but that means it is very evenly distributed. She is very understanding of things that go on in your life, and is more than willing to work with you on due dates and deadlines if something comes up. If you go talk to her about anything, she will help you at a lot.",
    "nope. but because of the language requirement maybe.",
    "A lot of busy work but improved your skills and you will do well if you put the time in",
    "This class is a lot of work and I only took it because it was required. I felt very overwhelmed with work especially after spring break.",
    "A great language course to take if you want to improve your speaking\/writing skills and feel prepared to take more advanced Spanish courses.",
    "Sonia is truly a lovely person. She cares about her students a lot, and is always willing to spend extra time explaining a confusing concept. She made everyone feel like they had the ability to speak Spanish, and corrected them after they were done speaking so they had the chance to get their thought out and correct themselves (surprisingly important to me). I think she could have done a better job fostering a more interesting discussion environment, but besides that she's a good teacher."
