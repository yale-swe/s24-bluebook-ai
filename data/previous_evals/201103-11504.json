    "I would definitely recommend the class to another student. I came with a very minimal knowledge of India and Pakistan history, and this class has been very enjoyable and informative. A great class if you actually want to learn about the topic. This is not a gut class, so don't take it if you aren't willing to put the work in for it!",
    "I would recommend this to students who have some experience learning about India or Pakistan - otherwise, it's a tough course.",
    "difficult but interesting.",
    "A good class on local Indian politics, but I would not recommend if seeking to truly gain a comparative understanding of the differences in the development of India and Pakistan since partition. In this regard the class does not live up to its description.",
    "Great class about an important region -- touches on all relevant issues facing the countries as they develop. Teachers are great, workload is not too bad.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It doesn't matter if you are not south asian and know nothing about India or Pakistan. If you are interested in the topic and are willing to take the time to do the reading then take it! Professor Wilkinson is amazing! The class is always fun, and you always leave having learned something new. The class is usually broken down into one hour of lecture and one hour of discussion. The reading load is pretty heavy (about 200-300 pgs per week) but they're really interesting articles and usually not too dense. Your grade is based on a short 5 page essay, a midterm and a final 15 page paper on a topic of your choice.",
    "Take it",
    "yes",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to a fellow student who wants to learn more about South Asia.",
    "Two highly knowledgeable, friendly, and eager professors discuss the complexities of post-partition India and Pakistan. Be warned, if the future class dynamic is anything like it was this year, the Indians and Pakistanis in the class will render discussion unintelligible to everyone else. If you don't know much about the subcontinent, check to see if Wilkinson\/Jaffrelot have devised ways of better bridging the gap between natives of the subcontinent and everyone else. The readings are always interesting though, again, require lots of wikipedia-ing if you don't know much about contemporary Indian politics.",
    "Great course on the subcontinent. Cover a wide variety of topical themes.",
    "Great in depth and broad class on central issue plaguing the two countries and their relationship."
