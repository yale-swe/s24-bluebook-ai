    "Yes. I'm not sure how it will change when Fink is gone, but this semester it was great. The reading actually isn't that bad in terms of length (it's fiction -- it goes fast!) and section, shockingly, was actually sensational. The papers are fairly short and the test is probably going to be easy.",
    "this is a wonderful class for anyone of any major. i think that everyone should read these masterpieces of dostoevsky. lectures are engaging and interesting and the books are brilliant- not only are they captivating stores, but they also get you thinking about faith and suffering and meaning in life and all kinds of other philosophical\/religious questions. especially for math\/science people, this is a perfect choice for a literature class to take- guaranteed to be a lot of fun and to also change your perspective on the world. there is a good amount of reading since the books are so big, but it's less than i expected it to be- definitely manageable.",
    "Yes. You'll be sick of Dostoevsky by the end (blah blah blah faith love rationality) but in a good way. You really get a feel for this incredible author and his most important works. Well-taught, lots of reading but reasonable essays and an extremely fair quotation-based final.",
    "Incredible class! Possibly the best class I have taken at Yale so far. take it! Hilary Fink is the best professor I've had here. If reading Dostoevsky is something you would do anyway, you love literature... this is your best bet!",
    "Absolutely. This is some of the best literature you can read, and you'll miss half of what's there if you don't read it in a class.",
    "The books are fantastic, really enlightening, thought-provoking stuff, and Hilary Fink is a very good lecturer. Readings are long but very enjoyable. Assignments are not too tough, but make sure you get a good section because mine was terrible.",
    "One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Made my semester amazing. My life was profoundly changed by the experience of this class.",
    "This is an inspiring class. The books are some of the best of all time, Professor Fink is a great person and her lectures are always stimulating. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who loves good literature.",
    "I recommend this class to whoever likes to read the Dos. novels, whoever loves the Russian literature. Yet, it is hard to read constantly due to its giant volume. Once you stop reading for the lecutres, you are lost for the rest of the novel.",
    "This course allows you to study Dostoyevsky's major works. The reading can be a bit heavy, but it is worth it. Professor Fink is amazing and I would recommend that any student interested in Russian Literature take a class with her.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone who has ever wanted to read Dostoevsky's greatest works. You will read Poor Folk, Notes from Underground, Crime and Punishment, and The Brothers Karamazov, along with a few short stories in the class. It's a lot of reading (especially during The Brothers K), but you can often get away without being totally caught up. The lectures are good, and Professor Fink is extremely warm and enthusiastic. Don't takethis course if you like discussion-based literature courses, though.",
    "You listen to Dostoevsky's works be analyzed in a fast-paced and exciting way. Lectures are a little preachy, but I have never learned so much from a lecture on books. It was so quick, and so accurate, and so insightful, that I really began to trust Professor Fink's analysis more than I have trusted any other professor's lectures at Yale. It's hard not to OVER-analyze literature, but this class never did.",
    "Dostoevsky's major works come to life in lectures and discussion sections leaving a deeply embedded understanding of them."
