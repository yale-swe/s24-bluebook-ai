    "Yes",

    "I had no knowledge of any topic being presented prior to this class. I still wish that we received some of the presentation files or relevant links by email after the course was over.",

    "The information presented was very useful and important to know, though without any given resources afterwards, I find that I'm not remembering anything in enough detail for it to have been very helpful. Perhaps taking notes in these lectures would have alleviated this problem or at least receiving some handouts of the main points.",
    "This course reinforced topics that were covered in previous ethics courses. The course provided exposure to the proper aspects necessary for responsible conduct of research and emphasized the manner in which dissertation research should be performed."
