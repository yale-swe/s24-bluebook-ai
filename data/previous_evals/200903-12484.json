   "comments": [
    "Poets' Landscapes looks at the landscapes used by American poets in their work. I would recommend it to anyone interested in studying the subject broadly over many subjects, but not to someone wanting to go into in-depth poetic analysis or in-depth architectural analysis. The class, because it tries to cover so many subject areas, tends to be broad-scoped.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. IT'S EASY AND INFORMATIVE",
    "Yes. Especially if you're interested in the subject matter and would like to delve into poetry from that angle, I would recommend it.",
    "I cannot recommend this class highly enough. Professor Hayden is a wonderful professor, and the subject matter is very enjoyable. The workshop portion of the class is also much more relaxed and kind-hearted than many of the other workshop classes in the English Department.",
    "I would recommend this as an 'alternative' poetry class. It's neither a poetry writing course or strict poetic analysis. I really enjoyed getting to engage poetry in an active way in a non-critical setting. Rather than just discuss style you get to experiment with it yourself through the exercises. It's a great way to really get a feel for poetry rather than just read and analyze it cold.",
    "I really enjoyed Poets' Landscapes. It was much more than just a class on poetry - Professor Hayden incorporated historical background, art history, and writing exercises into the class. Because few of us had experience talking about poetry, it was a bit tough to \"break the ice\" in the seminar at the beginning of the semester, but as the semester progressed the class became more lively.Professor Hayden was one of the best professors I've had at Yale and it was a privilege to take a seminar with her. She made the effort to know us each personally and provided very helpful feedback on our assignments.The workload is definitely manageable, although some of the writing assignments can be pretty tough (working with meter and rhyme).",
    "Yes I would recommend it to fellow students if their interests are towards a creative understanding and interpretation of the american landscape."
