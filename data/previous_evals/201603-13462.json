Not much guidance provided on cases so it felt like we were just stumbling our way through things at times."

    "Gorton is great, but he goes quickly so stay on top of things - especially since readings and homework are all optional so it's very easy to fall behind. Cases are pretty unstructured and you don't get much guidance on them so they can be rather frustrating. Exams are tough but everyone does poorly so it's probably fine. Probably take it Cr\/D and just go for the lectures."
