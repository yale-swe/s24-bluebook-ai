    "This class was a fantastic way to discuss the management of and theory behind museums, both in considering archaeological perspectives and in exploring ethical issues.",
    "This class taught me about theories regarding museums and issues they face in the 21st century. It was a great chance to get a behind-the-scenes look at the scholarly work that goes into making a museum exhibit. The final project was a chance to not just do research on a topic (which this involved), but to spend time thinking and reflecting on how a topic can best be presented to the public. This is an important skill even outside of museum curation that should benefit us going forward in life.",
    "This course made me more aware of the placing of objects in museums and has made me a more conscious museum-goer in general, as I consider the reason for different stories being told in museums. I also learned the origins of collecting and the complicated ethics behind that."

   "comments": [
    "This was a course that had a great idea and premise but suffered from poor execution. Premise was excellent: a study of museums and how they evolved (and are evolving!) through the lens of exhibits and collections of East Asian art. There was even an option for a really cool-sounding final project: to either design a museum exhibit in a group or design a podcast for the Freer|Sackler museum. Dr. Thomas Wide was a frequent guest of the class (how he commuted from DC for a 9:25am class so often I'll never know), which was an amazing privilege. There were visits to the YUAG and the Peabody to see conservation in action. But somehow I felt the class fell short. The readings were highly repetitive and either not terribly useful\/outdated. Without Dr. Wide I felt that there was never really any discussion. A large part of this was there were SO MANY PEOPLE allowed to audit this class who quite literally never said two words during any of the discussions. Why? Did they not do the readings? More people were allowed to join the class than the purported 12 person limit, and I think the overall course suffered as a result. Furthermore, other than the museum group, the people doing the Yale Voices project didn't get too much support or guidance from either Professor Underhill or Dr. Wide. There was some, of course, and Dr. Wide passed on some interesting information, but otherwise I had no idea what I was doing the entire time. In short, great premise with unfortunately dull execution.",
    "This class was a wonderful opportunity to discuss theory and ideas with my peers, and it allowed for us to steer the conversation as we saw fit. It was a bit difficult to keep continuity in the course, however, as only meeting once a week meant that quite a bit of time went between meetings.",
    "The strength of this course is the amazing people who came together to teach it. Professor Underhill is extremely knowledgeable about these topics, and the people she brought in, including Thomas Wide of the Smithsonian and Professor Chun, as well as various museum exhibit managers, conservators, and curators was incredible. For a seminar it was a very hands-on class and the field trips and discussions made it even better. It is very unique. It may be improved by some leadership or introductions to the discussions by the Professor, since I know that she should have much to say, in addition to letting us lead the discussions. Dr. Wide did a good job of this by probing us in discussion, and more of that would be nice. At the end of the class it was said that this course may not be continued in the future. It absolutely should continue, even if it has to evolve as it goes forward! There is not much like it at Yale.",
    "The course was strong in that it had a mixture of backgrounds and experience, allowed students to lead the discussion and bring up interesting topics, and had local museums and experts to incorporate in order to enrich the classroom experience. A weakness may have been that discussion leaders did not give summaries of the grad readings for those who did not do them, but this was up to the different groups."

    "Interesting premise, but you'll have to work a lot to get much out of the class. Readings aren't too long, but they're very repetitive from week to week. Possibilities for interesting final projects, but they'll only be as good as the effort you're willing to put into it.",
    "Loved the class. In particular, I loved visits by Dr.Wide and the visits to the museums. Was not a museum person when I walked into the class- I am one now!",
    "Yes I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in curating and east Asian artifacts. Professor Underhill, Professor Chun and Doctor Wide were all very accessible, encouraging and resourceful, and provided a lot of constructive comments to my paper, my final exhibit project and even my summer research. The readings were fun as well, and I learnt a lot through the curating process and the discussions from my peers.",
    "This class is really amazing if you're engaged with the topic and willing to put in the work with the readings. The opportunity to work with experts in the field of museum work was incredible - and the chance to do our own projects, with real exhibits being created at the end, was such an amazing experience. Great if you love archaeology\/art history\/museums in general, otherwise probably not so much.",
    "This is a very unique class which gave me an education in museum curation and theories even moreso than on the history and cultures of East Asia. There was a diversity of backgrounds in the class from art historians to archaeologists and even non-specialists and everyone found a niche. I hope we get more of the highly engaged people for this class going forward.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have an interest in museums. You learn their origin, the ethics behind them, and are taught to think critically every time you enter a museum. The readings are interesting and range from older to very current. Professor Underhill was also cool enough to incorporate readings by the people you meet during course field trips or guest lecturers, so that was really cool."
