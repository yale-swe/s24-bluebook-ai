    "Great class, left me hungry to come back to learn new techniques and keep refining the skills I've developed. Daryl is definitely one of the strengths of the class with a great sense of humor and attention to detail--a genius at what he does. I would have loved to know a little more about the scientific applications of what we were learning, and if there was more time it would have been super duper cool to do a project where we could design a piece of glassware with the techniques we learned, perhaps one for an experiment we wanted to do, and try to make it.",
    "All strength, no weakness. The only thing I would change would be to give Daryl a MUCH bigger lab. It's one of the most competitive classes to get into, and it only makes sense to devote more resources to it!"

    "Of course I would recommend it, this class was incredible and even though it was not hugely intellectually challenging*, I think that it will really change the way I think about research I do in the future and as such will be invaluable in my career. *this does not mean it wasn't CHALLENGING, some of the things were learned were as hard as anything I've learned in other classes, just in a different way.",
    "Of course--this class is the best thing I've done at Yale. I camped out to get in, and it was absolutely worth my while."
