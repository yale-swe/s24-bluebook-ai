    "This course charts the history and logics of welfare and welfare systems types from various perspective, including race\/ethnicity, sex\/gender, occupation, and social class.",
    "Welfare States is a terrific class with a terrific professor, Sigrun Kahl! She is as kind as any professor at Yale. Take her seminar!",
    "Yes! The material is very interesting and I think it's important that everyone should understand welfare systems. The class work is pretty easy-- 1 long paper and 2 short comments as well as reflection statements. It's very chill, and I feel I learned a lot. All the readings are supre interesting and not overwhelming.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Professor Kahl is very invested in the course and allows students to write papers on the things that interest them. It was a little disorganized at times, but only because she wanted class discussion to be driven by students' interests, so there wasn't always a really clear structure to each seminar. Overall I'd definitely recommend taking this - lots of reading but only a few other assignments, and I learned a ton about a really interesting topic.",
    "Worth a shot. The seminar is interesting in its own right, material is relevant, but I would classify it as a purely polsci rather than EP&E seminar - both in content and style. Take it if you like polsci things and seminars where a lot of people talk a lot but you don't learn much from the weekly meetings... Alternatively, take it but speak to Prof Kahl first about how she's going to structure the seminar this semester, and see if there are improvements from my semester.",
    "This class was very enlightening. You learn a lot about the development of the welfare state across different countries and settings. Professor Kahl is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, making for very compelling seminar sessions. However, it is important to realize that the course is on a very tight schedule and many of the assignments depend on cooperation and collaboration with other students, such as the comments on papers and reflections. That being said, if everyone in the class is responsible and turns in their assignments on time, it makes for a very engaging and enthralling class. Overall, it's a good course with reasonable amount of work and interesting readings. Take it if you are actually interested in comparing and contrasting welfare states and learning about the theory behind it all.",
    "I don't think I would suggest this class to people. You don't learn that much, and the seminar is long and very boring. The material is fascinating though, so even getting a glimpse of it can be fun, but you don't learn that much and it's very disorganized and all over the place.",
    "A great EPE\/ upper-level PoliSci seminar.",
    "This class is interesting and not a ton of work, but I don't know if I'd recommend it to another student. I think the crux of that decision is that the course reading list becomes pretty boring since we base almost all our discussions around one theoretical framework (Esping-Andersen). There are probably more probing classes with more diverse syllabi out there that will help you engage with similar topics.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. Semester workload was definitely a lot, especially because you're just writing all the time and on such tight deadlines, but (a) it was definitely worth it not to have a final exam\/paper, and (b) more importantly, never have I taken a course where I felt I had such a clear picture of what I thought about the issues, what my class thought about the issues, and what the main takeaways from each class and reading were. In addition to having my own notes, I LOVE that I also have access to everyone's research papers, comments on those research papers, and the weekly reflection memos--I plan to use this information in my daily life, my school work, and in my work far into the future. The only weakness I might identify is that sometimes I felt like class got a little bit off-track, that is, I was a little unclear on how our discussion was serving the big questions of the class. But in the big picture, this is a small critique of what was otherwise one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. Prof Kahl is an absolute joy to work with, she recognizes the importance of her work and how much her students care about it. I really enjoyed being able to interact in such a direct and hands-on way with her research--I've had other professors assign their papers for reading, but never have I gotten to actually contribute feedback on a manuscript in progress! And to complete the circle, Prof Kahl's feedback on our papers was always timely, eloquent, and extremely constructive (not to mention funny. and including dinosaur stickers.) I looked forward to class discussion every week and cannot speak more highly of her.",
    "A broad summary of the different welfare states across nations. This was an interesting seminar and a manageable amount of work. Good for an introduction to the material."
