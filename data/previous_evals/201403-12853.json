   "comments": [
    "French 160 goes into the cultural and societal values of contemporary France. It is a great course to take if you want to strengthen your oral skills since much of it is discussion-based. Be warned, however, this class has a lot of work, especially homework. Also, stay on top of the assigned vocabulary since that counts for 40% of each midterm. The class is really interesting and a great first L5 French course.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in french culture and current issues in France.",
    "Do not take this course. It was my biggest regret this semester. I just took it to keep my French from getting rusty but it was NOT worth it. Go to a French table, talk French with a friend or with a tutor if that's what you want. The amount of useless work and time expected of you by this course came nowhere close to balancing out the few benefits of it. For one, the class says it's about French culture, which means really delving into the nitty gritty of French politics, economics, etc. - more than you'd ever want to know about even your own culture. It assumes all kinds of background knowledge on these topics. The vocab quizzes don't even test your knowledge of what the vocab means, but rather your ability to recall which words were even on the list. The homework exercises were so shoddily made that they often don't have a right answer, so you're left staring frustratingly at the thing for hours. The amount of homework assigned was way too ambitious for the 50 minutes of class time available to discuss it. Unless you're genuinely interested in French policies and government, like debating in French in a classroom setting, and don't mind spending hours of your life on dumb little assignments, do not take take it. To keep up with the practically endless - and poorly, poorly organized - list of things to do for homework three nights a week caused me more stress than it was worth. This class killed my spirit for the French language.",
    "This class was a lot of work, but the vast majority of it was enjoyable. I would only take this course if you're interested in, or could see yourself being interested in, French culture and politics."
