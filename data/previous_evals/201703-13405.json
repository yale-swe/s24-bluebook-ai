   "comments": [
    "The professor is really knowledgable and very encouraging",
    "One strength is the concentration on a specific topic each week, making students read and discuss extensively on a single topic. One point that could be improved is that maybe the instructor can select some essential parts from several books for reading instead of making students read one or two whole books.",
    "Opportunity to discuss books and arguments at length. A shorter reading list and a common book\/reading requirements for the week would be great.",
    "This course covers many interesting topics in modern Chinese history. The readings are very interesting and thought-provoking."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it involves a lot of useful and good reading, and it invites the students to talk and engage in class and the professor is sooooo nice",
    "Yes. The material is interesting and the discussions are engaging.",
    "Yes, I will recommend. The course has a great selection of historical studies of late imperial Chinese history, and the instructor has comprehensive understandings of this period and different topics to help students navigate through those works.",
    "Go for it if you are looking to develop the skills needed to succeed in a graduate school context. Lots of focus on discussion, and requires a deep knowledge of the books being discussed to be meaningful -- you can coast, sure, but it will be a horrible experience if you're having to wing it in seminar discussions.",
    "Yes. The seminar is very thought-provoking. And a comparative perspective is always applied in discussion."
