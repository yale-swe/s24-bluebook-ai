   "comments": [
    "Take it if you want to go into finance, preferably before you do.",
    "Take the class if you want to be involved in business at any point in your life.",
    "The course and course work are set up such that you read a chapter and do a problem set the night before the class in which you learn that material... basically you have to teach yourself everything.If you like that, take it, if not, don't.Also, if you aren't going to be a CPA, this class might be a waste of your time.",
    "Yeah i guess take it. It has a nice curve. Maybe Credit D\/Fail it.",
    "it's accounting.",
    "Take it; its a very useful class if you want to go into banking\/consulting\/business. It helps prepare you for interviews, and you learn about how firm's operate.",
    "Accounting will be a useful skill in the business world. This class is probably more practical than most you will take at Yale. The material is dry and not presented in an interesting manner. I am happy I took it, but I'm also happy it's over.",
    "Definitely take it! Accounting is incredibly useful. It may sound like a boring topic but this class paves the path for corporate finance. You will gain a deeper understanding of the business world after this class. The professor summarizes the contents of the lecture during lectures very well. It's difficult to get up for 9am classes but it's definitely worth it to listen to what the Professor has got to say, even after you've done the reading. The class also requires us to hand in homework before the professor teaches the material, which encourages us to read the book thoroughly.",
    "Basic Accounting, T accounts, balance sheets, income statements, cash flows. Then some bonds and equity side accounting. Nothing too fancy. But there's a hw for every class. 22 in total.",
    "This is an extremely useful course if you're going into any business-type of career. Main weakness is that it's offered a 9 in the morning and the professor only teaches about a certain subject after the problem set on the same subject has already been due. Key strength: teaches you how to answer technical interviews for banking internships.",
    "I would recommend- very useful information\/skills learned.",
    "Good class to take. Hard, but you learn important stuff.",
    "There are a couple of things to consider. First, this is the only accounting course that you can get at Yale, and accounting is extremely practical and useful. Second, this class is simple and straightforward and you'll probably get a good grade without too much work, but it also will not be terribly interesting. To that end, take it only if you really want to learn accounting.",
    "This is definitely a useful course to take. You get a good idea about the basics of accounting that can be applied in many different settings. Sometimes, however, the material can be a bit dry. The problem sets can also be a bit frustrating since you have to do them before you've learned the material. Basically, if you want to know about accounting and can stay awake through 9am classes or learn the material on your own from the book, accounting is a helpful class.",
    "a survey course of everything financial, great business vocabulary course, easy homework system. i'd definitely recommend it if you're going into consulting, i-banking, or simply want to know how to calculate your mortgage. doesn't hurt.",
    "the material taught is useful",
    "i would recommend accounting 170 to econ majors (this class can count as an econ credit if you apply to the DUS). it is not simply a prep class for banking interviews. it actually helps you understand some concepts regarding national accounting and PV in your macro and finance classes.",
    "If you're going into finance, you'll find it very useful. Otherwise, don't bother. Also, don't think this is a gut course. You have to put in the time to study the material, otherwise this will seem very difficult. If you put in the time, however, the class will be no problem.",
    "It is a very fast paced introduction to financial accounting. I would recommend it to anybody who is interested in business because it offers the fundamentals.",
    "This material is practical, interesting, and great preparation for the real world. Take the class! You can learn a lot, especially if you do the reading and problem sets.",
    "Don't take it unless you absolutely have to.",
    "If you want to go into finance after your graduation, i would still recommend taking this class despite many negative feedback and reviews it receives, simply because accounting is the language spoke in the business world. Accounting is boring materials and Professor Schiffres certainly did not attempt to make it more interesting to learn. Most students in this class realized sooner or later in the semester that it isn't worth all the efforts and hassles to come to class at 9 in the morning to learn something that they could have learned equally well by reading books on their own.",
    "Unless you are really interested in accounting, or you need it for your career aspirations, the material is really dry. The professor is average at best in terms of teaching ability and doesn't help at all in making the boring material any more captivating or fascinating. The disparity between the way the problem sets are graded--pass\/fail--versus the way the tests are graded--point by point deductions--makes it difficult to learn the material well and do well on the exams. Prof. Schiffres is a hard grader on the tests.",
    "Very useful course to learn if you want a job in finance.",
    "This is a good course to take if you have any interest in business or investing. My one word of caution is that you will basically be teaching yourself the information out of the book. Classes are basically spent going over the problem sets which you will do before learning the material. Definitely take the class Credit\/D.",
    "If you want a solid introduction to accounting, this is the course to take. Not a thrilling course, but you will learn the material well if you read and attend lecture.",
    "This accounting class provided a useful excuse to study the subject, but beyond that, I did not find it a particularly strong course.First, the professor spent most classes simply reviewing answers to the homework exercises assigned--something that could've taken far less time than it did--rather than delving into new material or tackling some of the nuances of accounting. Second, the textbook did not strike me as very good. For a thirteenth edition, it was not very well-written and contained a surprising number of errors. Third, the course seemed rather sloppy in presentation. The professor said on numerous occasions that he had made a \"mistake\" in assigning the wrong homework; because most classes were devoted to explaining a homework exercise (which often covered only a small subset of the readings assigned), students were left with little idea of what to focus on in the book. Ultimately, I learned a lot, but only because I took the time to really delve into the material on my own.Bottom line, if you think you might need some accounting skills in the work you will pursue, then this course isn't a bad idea--just expect to have to motivate yourself to really get something out of this course.",
    "I would recommend it if you really want to go into finance. If not, take a great humanities course and you can teach yourself the text book over a break."
