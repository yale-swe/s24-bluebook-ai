    "This course is a lot of reading, but it's definitely worth it in the long run. Be aware that you will spend a great deal of time on this class.",
    "If you want an opportunity to read all I these books, this is a great way to do it. It's always helpful to har a course guiding you through.",
    "The reading was a lot but the pace was very manageable. I liked the class a lot.",
    "It's a great books course. Useful foundation for all lit, and worthwhile in its own right. I'd take it again.",
    "This course was definitely worth taking for the inherent value of reading the works on the syllabus. I always enjoyed doing the reading, but I found that sometimes the class discussions were very dry and sometimes lacking real substance or critical analysis. Instead, all real analysis happened in papers, which sometimes made the class sessions feel like a waste. This was also due to this particular professor's style of leading the discussion."
