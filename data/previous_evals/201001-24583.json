    "take it!",
    "Amazing seminar--must take. Professor Kaplan is a pro, and seminars include lots of interesting discussion and are quite edifying. Interesting material. Easily one of the best classes I took in four years at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take it! This class teaches you about and author and a period, but also about methods of research. No matter what you study, professor Kaplan will interest you and draw on your knowledge to benefit the rest of the class.",
    "FREN 355 addresses Postwar France through the lens of Albert Camus. This is explicit. By the end students not only understand the postwar era, but they start to sympathize with Camus as a person. It is slanted, but for good reason, since time has shown Camus to be largely correct. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in European History, Colonialism\/Anticolonialism, French Literature, the Cold War, 20th Century Philosophy, Race Relations, or Questions of Identity. This makes a perfect elective for anyone of any major."
