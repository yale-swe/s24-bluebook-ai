   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about how to do kinetic and structural analysis of biological molecules (usually proteins). One of the more math-based MB&B classes I've taken. Helped me think about how I can use math and physics to model biological systems and extract useful information about how these systems work.",
    "Somewhat more knowledge of kinetics Much more knowledge of crystallography - but still not enough to fully understand it",
    "I learned how to look at biological processes through physical principles. I also learned different experimental methods for studying biological systems with physics (ex: X-ray crystallograpy, cryo-EM).",
    "Wrestled with difficult concepts in this course but left feeling pretty good about what I learned.",
    "While I learned a lot about the field of biophysics (what is included in such as well as the actual components of it all), I believe the more beneficial and exciting part about it all was the ways in which I learned how to approach problems and expand information further to include a more complex model or system.",
    "I gained a much greater in-depth understanding of the physics behind biological systems. Specifically, x-ray crystallography was SUPER in depth and although I struggled through it, it's great to have some semblance of how it actually works. The first half of the class was great, and it was clear and very interesting. It was wonderful to know how to actually run experiments to very specifically study protein action.",
    "I developed an understanding of key biophysics experimental techniques and improved my problem solving and data analysis skills.",
    "This course taught me how we apply our physical knowledge to biological molecules.",
    "We covered biophysical principles of diffusion, kinetics, binding, single molecule techniques used in the lab, and diffraction\/spectroscopic methods (X-ray crystallography, Cryo-EM).",
    "I gained an intuition for how I would expect a biological system to behave at a particular set of conditions. In the second half of the course, I really feel like I gained a strong understanding of how X-Ray crystallography and other techniques to study biochemistry with worked, which I have never really understood before.",
    "I developed a much more practical knowledge of biophysics and its intricacies. I also learned a much better \"gut instinct\" of how certain biological systems work. It was very interesting to learn about the different experimental procedures used by biophysicists, because it was a great way to learn the theory behind objects I may end up using on-hands in the lab.",
    "Knowledge of biophysical techniques and the theory underlying them. Also trained me to think critically about techniques and any misguided assumptions we may have about them.",
    "I really enjoyed this course's focus on methods and on experimental\/practical applications of the methods. It was less about memorizing material and more about understanding principles and their implications for experiments."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I like that the course really focused on top-level overviews of the techniques at hands, without going too much in the weeds of the methods. Enrique especially did a great job of letting us know what techniques would be useful for what, without having us to do every little calculation and derivation involved. Some of the crystallography stuff got somewhat complicated, though I think that's probably just the nature of the method. I didn't love that the problem sets were weekly and heavily weighted, since during my senior spring I would have preferred to take a few tests and be over with it. With that being said, the problem sets never took too long and were mostly very fair.",
    "Problem sets need to be proofread MUCH better. At least three times this semester, the TAs made a correction midweek to a problem set that had been available since Thursday. I usually started them on Saturday or Sunday - which meant that on one notable occasion, I spent two days trying to see why I couldn't get an integral to converge before the problem was fixed. Not testing problem sets beforehand does students a disservice. Problems at times came out of nowhere on the problem sets (especially those for the second half of class). If it's part of the class that we solve these without having had a lecture related to them, problem sets should at least be shorter. First exam was much longer than it should have been for the time it was given. Better explanation of difference Patterson maps needed earlier. It took me until the TA session right before the final to understand them. Duck Fourier transform animation was actually pretty helpful. Section was sometimes more helpful than class - more time to ask questions. Feedback on problem sets was slow but generally had reasons points were taken off, which is important! And answer keys were on canvas and generally typed, which is great too. (Nothing like trying to figure out where you went wrong when you can't read the handwriting...) Please tell Curran that he does an excellent job. Clear explanations, makes students feel that their question & thinking are valuable.",
    "This course covers a lot of topics that I think are pretty important for understanding biological systems. The first half was more about describing systems while the second was about studying systems, which are both useful. The second half was definitely more difficult to understand as it built upon a physics foundation that not everyone necessarily felt comfortable with.",
    "Biophysics is difficult to understand. The professors did a pretty good job conveying what information was necessary but I wish the concepts could have been explained a little clearer.",
    "The lectures for Chuck's half the class were very unclear. They did not provide enough resources to look back on if you were lost in class. The material is very dense, but the lecture notes were too shallow. The first half was very clearly organized and taught.",
    "This was a nice, cohesive end of the MB&B major sequence. I felt that Enrique and Chuck were able to help me make sense of what I had previously learned in physical chemistry and I developed a solid grasp on concepts such as quantum mechanics, kinetics, and potential energy surfaces. I enjoyed the papers that we discussed in class and I really felt that they challenged me to become a faster and more critical reader. I liked that the midterm and final were non-cumulative, which allowed me to focus on the second half of the semester without worrying too much about the first. However, sometimes lectures were a bit too general and glossed over the details of the concepts involved, but I understand that diving deeply into these ideas requires advanced math skills, and MB&B students have wildly different degrees of math backgrounds. I also wished that we had spent some time in lecture doing problems together. Problem sets were often difficult to interpret and frustrating due to the lack of application during class time, and they required a lot of extra time spent with TFs to figure out.",
    "The strength of this course was that it did a great job explaining the many techniques we use to understand biological molecules. One weakness is that the class lacked the mathematical skills to appreciate x-ray crystallography. I suggest making differential equations a required course for MB&B.",
    "The second half of the course could have been made to be more engaging. More importantly, the lectures and slides for diffraction, X-ray crystallography, and cryo-EM could have been improved by starting from first principles (and explaining those principles thoroughly) and creating a narrative in the slides. It may have been assumed that students were already slightly familiar with crystallographic methods and techniques, which made the slides more difficult to follow (especially the first time through). If the slides were made to be more cohesive and less of a hodge podge of disparate facts (it took time to carefully read through the slides to figure out how to put the information together), that would have facilitated better and more efficient learning. Canvas also should have been used better as well, especially with regard to homeworks, which we didn't receive back until late (our original paper copies), so that we did not find out our grades until more than a week later (often at least 2 weeks). Canvas could have been easily used to at least upload those grades so that we could have been aware (the \"grades\" page was not used at all).",
    "The emphasis on learning through problem sets and working together as a class was a huge strength of MB&B 302. I got to know my classmates and the TAs really well by talking through things we were confused about or just talking through the lectures, and it made a huge difference in my understanding of the class. A weakness of the class (though not the fault of the class itself) is the level of math involved I think. Because 2 semesters of calculus is the only main math requirement for the major (which many of us placed out of from high school), I didn't feel like I had a proper math background to adequately appreciate some of the advanced math presented to us, like Fourier transforms. Though by the end I was able to understand things clearly, it took a long time, and everyone in the class was at different levels in terms of their understanding. I know the MB&B major is already a lot of credits, but it may be extremely beneficial (and many students in the class have agreed on this)to have a math requirement for the major that would teach us math specifically geared toward biophysics and biochemistry. This way, we would have been able to maybe do some more complex mathematics to better understand what we were learning.",
    "Prof. Enrique de la Cruz is one of the most engaging professors I have had at Yale and made the material, although difficult, extremely accessible.",
    "Its strength is its quality of material and instruction. The material was difficult at times, but the instructors and TF's would always be available to clarify any confusions. One weakness might be its organization of topics, because it appeared to jump between topics at times.",
    "Strengths: the material is all very interesting. TAs are very helpful. I also like how the syllabus is designed. A good mix of problem sets, journal papers, and exams. Enrique is a great professor. Weaknesses: Some of the problem sets were not very connected to the material or required TA help in order to complete. Also I think the final should be cumulative.",
    "Overall the class was very well taught, I'll offer my thoughts on the x-ray crystallography lectures-- -I think it all made sense by the end, but it was a bit piecemeal going through. Something like a flow-chart would really help, as might stronger organizational slides throughout each lecture. -Perhaps a more in-depth exploration of Fourier space would help with understanding of the Ewald sphere? I could imagine a 3-D \"model\" of a fourier map (with colors and brightnesses for amplitude and phase) being really helpful? Also I don't think the connection between Bragg's Law and the Ewald sphere was ever made in class, which to me seems like the fundamental breakthrough that makes the magic happen."

    "Good overview of kinetic and structural techniques that can be used to study biological molecules (mostly just proteins). I found it really neat to learn how this stuff is done, especially the crystallography and cryo-EM stuff. Enrique (who teaches the first half) is really funny and engaging, which was good since I found the kinetics part of the class a little more boring that the structural; Chuck is really nice and goes through everything really thoroughly, although he's not quite as good as Enrique at explaining concepts in a useful, jargon-free way. Take it to finish the MB&B major, or if you really want to learn about kinetics and structural biology.",
    "This is generally pretty interesting material, and everyone learns some things they haven't seen in class before. The first half of the class (kinetics, mostly) is easier to understand, and the second half (crystallography) is harder to understand but more interesting.",
    "This course is required for all MB&B majors, but I'd still recommend it. Enrique and Chuck really care about their students, and are thoughtful in their teaching. A lot of the material in this course was presented to me for the first time, since there aren't really any other biophysics classes, so it was interesting to learn about a new field of biology.",
    "I found the course to be engaging and enjoyable. However unless you are interested in biophysics or modeling the course would probably not have much use for you.",
    "Great course, very intellectually challenging. Would recommend taking it over CHEM 333.",
    "Probably taking this class because it's a requirement. Just buckle in and get through it. The TAs are super helpful so be their friend. The first half with Enrique was AMAZING. The second half not so much.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this class to another student.",
    "Most likely, the majority of students taking this course are taking it as a requirement for the MB&B major. That being said, the principles covered in the course are important for modern biological research, and the course does a decent job of going through those principles -- diffusion, kinetics, binding, single molecule techniques, X-ray crystallography. The lectures on diffraction and X-ray crystallography, however, were dense and not too well organized, and as a result take time to go through.",
    "If you are MB&B, you have a choice between this class and physical chem. semester 2. I had taken physical chem. (with chem applications) semester 1, and this class seemed to be a very good application of everything I had learned. If you have to choose between this class and the other physical chem course, I would say select this course if you would like a more biological approach.",
    "Here's an easy way to tell if you should take this course: If Sindelar is teaching any part of this course, avoid it at all costs.",
    "Obviously you have to take this for MBB, and you'll like it! If you're not MBB, I would say that you should only take this course if you're interested in knowing how to apply principles from chem\/physics\/math\/engineering in biology. Don't expect any paradigm shifts, any intense derivations, proofs, nor any sort of in-depth biochemical investigation of mechanisms or biological principles like in a genetics class or an evolution class. It's all about applying physics and math to biology, but at a pretty low level of physics\/math. You'll learn a lot about bio, but minimal about the topics on which the course is founded. That said, the optional readings go a bit more in depth if you want."
