   "comments": [
    "6 very tightly packed lab work, will definitely keep you busy and on your toes. Meets twice a week with a pset due every week. 10-15 page paper due at the end of the lab, continues with MCDB 343L.",
    "Take it if you want a manageable and interesting lab fulfillment for the MCDB major. Not that much work, but long hours in the lab are to be expected (usually expect to be in lab until 5 pm-5:30 with some days with less work leaving at about 3 pm).",
    "This is a great class. You should take it. Dr. Nelson was one of the best professors I have ever had and this is a great class. You learn wet lab techniques as well as how they work and how to troubleshoot. I really have nothing bad to say about this class. Twice a week is a bit much, but you can just take one half of the semester if you want. It is a great class. If you need a lab (or even if you don't) you should take it.",
    "Nucleic Acids lab is a great lab course. It meets twice a week, so be prepared to spend more time than average in the lab. But the class develops a sort of camaraderie from this, making it easy and enjoyable to be in lab. Aside from the paper at the end of the course, the lab does not require much work outside, which is also a huge plus. Overall, whether you need a lab for premed or your major, I highly recommend this one.",
    "I would recommend this lab. It is Tuesday and Thursday but only meets for half the semester (unless you take the second half too, in which case you get a full credit). You don't have to do much work out of lab because all the work is a few problem sets, your lab notebook, and a final paper. And lab itself isn't too painful, just a bit tedious at times with lots of pipetting. It's also okay if you don't get good results because you are working on a real research project. However, depending on the day, you could be in lab for a while. There is usually a lecture at 1:30 at the beginning of class. You could end at 4, 4:30, 5, 5:30, 6 depending on the day (6 only happened like once or twice I think). Professor Nelson is extremely caring and helpful! He encourages you to learn while helping out when things go wrong. I have no complaints about him - fantastic all around. He helps catch you up on nucleic acids knowledge if you are a bit unsure about things. Even if you are not an MCDB major and\/or don't feel very knowledgable about the subject, don't let that preclude you from taking the lab, as it isn't a huge deal. I think if you are premed and are looking for a lab, this is one of your best options at Yale.",
    "Definitely take it! My lab bench group had awesome people which made the experience even better. Professor Nelson is an awesome professor and very sweet. It seems like less work than the other MCDB labs. Problem sets aren't bad - just make sure you're listening during his lectures. Take it with MCDB 343 to get MCDB lab requirements out of the way.",
    "Nucleic Acids lab is a great way to fullfill a lab requirement and learn new techniques while working on an actual project from a research lab, which helps add purpose to the class. The first half 342L had a tendency to run over time during some class periods, but the second half 343L ran much more smoothly, ending on time. Overall, neither have too much commitment outside of class, with 3 problem sets for each class, a final paper for 342 and presentation for 343. Professor Nelson is extremely helpful and a great professor to have a class with.",
    "I would 100% recommend this lab to anyone, regardless of prior experience level. Professor Nelson is really helpful and helps us to actually think about the projects that we are working on. And the lab is really low stress, just because proffesor nelson maintains a low pressure atmosphere. Plus, we do some cool experiments towards actual research! One of the best lab classes I have taken\/heard of at Yale.",
    "It's a pretty chill bio lab. Professor Nelson is great! Sometimes class goes way over time, especially the first half of the semester, but there's very little work outside of class (pset once a week), so it's really not that bad. If you have to take bio lab, I would recommend this one.",
    "Definitely recommend. A good way to get the one year of bio lab for premed out of the way, and also an enjoyable lab."
