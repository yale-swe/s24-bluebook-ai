    "This course will teach you to think of biological systems in a more mathematical way, which will show you some of the important design principles in biology. The course is accessible the both mathematician and biologists, and I would highly recommend this course if it fits with your interests.",

    "As a biologists we don't usually place a lot of emphasis on the dynamical behavior of systems. As a matter of fact oftentimes we ignore the dynamics and grossly simplify our models. This course is a great stepping stone in thinking about noise and design principles in nature, or at the very least it raises awareness of the inherent noisiness in biology. Personally I aspire to go into synthetic biology, and for that this course has been extremely valuable.",
