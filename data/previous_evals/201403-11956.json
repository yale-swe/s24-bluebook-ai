    "This course will help you improve your spoken and written Spanish abilities. You will review several important grammar concepts (subjunctive, hypothetical clauses, passive voice, indirect discourse, uses of \"se\", prepositions) while also spending more than L3 reading short stories. This is definitely a manageable, straight-forward course that you can take to meet your language requirements!",
    "Although there are a few more projects and graded oral activities than L3, it is generally a bit more fun than the L3 class because the second half of the class involves reading a short novel rather than practicing grammar extensively.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the course to another student. Good opportunity to practice speaking every day.",
    "My skills definitely improved after taking this course and I would recommend it to other students."
