   "comments": [
    "If you like logical thinking and enjoy finding quirky ways to think about language, take this class. Professor Zanuttinni is brilliant and really cares about every student in her class, the textbook is very good, the workload is pretty light, and the subject material is really fascinating. I would recommend this class highly.",
    "LING 153 was enjoyable. Professor Zanutini was a very good instructor. Even with very little background in linguistics, I found the course to be enjoyable and the information easy to understand.",
    "I learned a lot hereI understood what I learnedIt was worth my time.Syntax can be funIf you do all the reading,You'll understand it.",
    "If you're interested in the subject, this is a good class. Professor Zanuttini is really nice and genuinely wants you to learn. It starts out slow, especially if you've taken linguistics classes before, but by the end concepts can be tough.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course, just not to someone with no background.",
    "Absolutely! Even if you aren't a linguistics student, the course is bound to raise interesting questions for you, regardless of background.",
    "Syntax I is an enjoyable and easy class. I found it absolutely fascinating at the beginning, probably because I had never taken any linguistics classes before. By the end of the semester, I was finding diagramming sentences a bit tedious, but I would still recommend the class because it's not much work and it's easy to do well. Also, Professor Zanuttini is so sweet!",
    "This class needs no recommendation. It will sell itself on two points:1. It's really fun.2. It's a prerequisite for a lot of other Ling. classes.",
    "Syntax I pretty much does what it sets out to do: explain what Syntax is and delve into some of the main topics and concepts therein. I'd love a little more focus on the generative aspects of Syntax later in the course; we seemed to get bogged down in specifics without being able to take a step back and discuss the developmental\/cultural\/even neurological implications of what we'd learned.",
    "This is a great course, and Professor Zanuttini is a great teacher. If you're a linguistics major and you have to take this course, don't worry; it's worth it. If you're not a linguistics major, the professor doesn't assume linguistics background, and she's very open to questions and giving extra help. There's one problem set per week, a take-home midterm, and a take-home final (or a project if you prefer to do one), and they're not too difficult. At the same time, you learn a lot about the basics of syntactic theory.",
    "If you think you can get into the material, then you should take this course. The course covers basic principles in syntax, focusing mostly on sentence structure. IF diagraming sentences doesn't sound like your thing, then you probably don't want to take this course. Prof. Zanuttini is a wonderful professor, and she is one of the nicest at Yale. Prof. Zanuttini does expect you to attend lecture (150 mins\/wk) and participate in class discussion, and there is and additional required section (50 mins\/wk). If you have an at least plausible reason to miss class, however, she is generally lenient. Otherwise, the workload was light and the grading fair."
