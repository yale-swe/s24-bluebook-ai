    "It's a great way to play chamber music and get coached by high-level professsors and grad students.",
    "Music 221 is the best course! I would definitely recommend it to another student! This course taught me how amazing chamber music is!",
    "Chamber music for credit. Great class and opportunity to play with some of the most talented undergraduate musicians in an intimate setting.",
    "You're grouped with other amazing musicians, taught by phenomenal coaches, with a low time commitment and a very, very good grade unless you epically ---- up. What's not to love about this class?",
    "Great class. You are matched with players at a similar skill level and have two hours of rehearsal a week and one hour of coaching. A great way to continue study of your instrument during school without too much pressure. I enjoyed working with my group and our two coaches were excellent. All the coaches are either faculty or music school grad students.",
    "Great class with a high level of musicianship",
    "Absolutely, if you're a talented musician looking for a group to work with.",
    "The quality of the experience depends on the coaches to whom your group is assigned, and your group's chemistry with them. But most of the coaches are worth working with, and the studio class time commitment is low enough to pick up the credit for something you'd want to do anyway. The class attracts a strong cohort of musicians.",
    "ABSOLUTELY! Nothing is better than playing chamber music and getting free credits.",
    "Definitely take this class for the upkeep of instrumental skills. It is a little bit limiting, because you are forced to play one piece the entire semester, but it is fun and worth the time!",
    "Yes, if you like the people in your group and the music you are playing.",
    "Chamber music is always an enriching experience to be a part of, and this class does a great job of bringing that out. I've taken this course for many many semesters now and highly recommend it if you have room in your schedule.",
    "Great class if you want to play chamber music at a high level and be coached. Wendy can be strict or set in what she wants, but you generally have some choice in what you play and with whom you play. Not all the coaches are excellent, but most are pretty good and some are great.",
    "I had a great time in this course. I think the quality of your experience depends on which group you end up in, and your coaches. That being said, I have been amazed at how talented everybody is, and how great all the coaches are. If you enjoy collaborative work, definitely take this class!",
    "This is a great class to take for any musician. If you want to take this class and you play a non-string instrument (or even if you do), it helps your chances to form a group BEFORE auditioning. The \"workload\" is pretty light. Just make sure to get together once (or twice) a week to rehearse and don't miss the performance classes and you should be good to go!But really, do NOT take this class if you're going to have problems making the performance classes. Otherwise, this is an awesome class to fill out a nearly full course-load.Also, note that you can re-take this class every semester formore credit but that you must take it in sets of 2 semesters!"
