    "If you are interested in the history of philosophy with a particular emphasis on epistemology you will really like this class.",
    "Please take a class with Professor Della Rocca. It is an amazing experience. Also, please take a class with graduate students. They really are smarter than us.I often left this class with a huge headache -- but that was a great thing. It forced me to really think about things that I never before thought would matter. I definitely recommend this, or any other class Professor Della Rocca teaches. You never feel that what you have to say is irrelevant. And even if you don't say anything, you learn so much from listening to everyone in the class.",
    "This is an excellent course for the right person.You have to 1) tolerate history of philosophy (some of it ends up being arguing the english translation of latin words) 2) tolerate reading one dude for a long time 3) be pretty good at thinking.The 1) comes with a little concession, which is that history of philosophy can be a really cool lens through which to view contemporary philosophical problems. So what can appear to be a really old-fashioned philosophical question e.g. the Cartesian circle can actually turn out to be a really fresh discussion on the relationship between reason and the external world for example.",
    "if you are interested in philosophy, absolutely!!! you can't go wrong with a a della rocca class. even if you are initially skeptical about taking a class on one thinker or have a deep abiding fear of secondary literature, you might, after a few classes and some reading, really find that descartes is awesome! or at least this was my experience. professor della rocca makes it a pleasure to get a lot out of the class and readings, but you do need to put in the work."
