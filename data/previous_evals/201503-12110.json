    "This class is great. Take it if you like talking about media. It's not hard at all and if you just stay on top of your weekly blog posts you will be more than ok at the end of the semester. The pace of the German isn't too fast and you definitely get used to a class completely in German. It's actually pretty amazing how much of Theresa you can understand after only a few weeks. Basically, the workload is minimal and manageable and if you get a good group, the class itself is enjoyable. Literally it was one of my only classes where I wasn't looking at the clock the whole time.",
    "German 162 with Professor Schenker is a fantastic upper level German class. The subject matter and discussion is good, and although the work is a steady commitment the assignments are interesting and will teach you a lot about German culture.",
    "This class covers contemporary German media, including books, newspapers, tv shows, blogs, chats, texting, and advertisements. Some units were more interesting than others, but all in all, this was an extremely enjoyable class. It is also a good way to maintain your German skills. I also have to mention that Theresa Schenker is the best German teacher ever. You will love her! You will be lucky to be in her class!",
    "A great class to keep up your German! We didn't talk about any new grammatical concepts and the main focus was not on correct language use. We talked about many areas of media (such as newspapers, podcasts, and TV shows), discussed intercultural differences, and emulated them. The class involves two weekly written blog posts, occasional worksheets, four small projects, and one final project. Theresa is an AMAZING teacher and makes the entire class worth it.",
    "I would NOT recommend this course to those who want to improve their German. And the material covered in this course is not very interesting. If you want to take this for L5, then that's fine. But be aware of the biased grading system. I felt like the grading was much of a \"feeling\" thing. I think there is a clear difference between grading based on \"feeling\" and \"individual improvement\", but in this class, it was mainly done through \"feelings\" of the instructor."
