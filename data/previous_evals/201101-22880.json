   "comments": [
    "I recommend it to you only if you truly enjoy this subject. Professor Fleury can be dry at times but I noticed most students tried to pay attention anyway because they were interested.",
    "It was a great class that really got me thinking in much more real ways about energy, its value to our society and way of life, and how challenging and important of a task it will be to maintain in the future. One of the most basic things was in understanding units of energy and orders of magnitude which helps immensely with whatever article you read or if you are a science major with any other science class. After this class I think I am going to explore a career in energy and recently took a trip to NYC with the Yale Undergraduate Energy Club to meet with a private equity firm, some consulting firms, a lobbying group and a government agency and throughout the day of meetings I felt like this class enabled me to meet with them on even-footing and therefore to guide our discussions with my questions and insights.Energy will certainly be a big deal in the future politically, technologically, socially, and economically so if you think you might be interested in it take this class. Professor Fleury is also extremely knowledgeable about anything under the sun having to do with science, although it should be said that, while his lectures contain all the relevant information one would need, they can be a little dry. The project is pretty enjoyable.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student; however, the student has to have a genuine interest in the energy field. The class was extraordinarily helpful and I enjoyed reading all of the material and attending the lectures; however, it was obvious that some of the other students did not share my same attitude towards the class, and I personally believe that they were not able to gain the full benefits of taking the class.",
    "The course was a great way to learn about the current energy situation and possible paths of the future, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in these areas. I would warn that it is less of a seminar than one might think, but we did go on a few field trips to the power plant and a wind turbine that were very educational. The class was overall very easy. There were only 6 psets due the entire year, and I spent at most 2 hours on each one.",
    "ETS is a very useful class for anyone interested in the problems facing our energy system and potential solutions. I feel that I gained a lot of practical knowledge from the beginning of the semester. The class is a lecture, and not a discussion based class, which sometimes can be wearing."
