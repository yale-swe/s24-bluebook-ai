   "comments": [
    "Not the best lecture I've taken in the poli sci department, but it nevertheless provides a sound theoretical background that can be used not only for future comp politics classes, but also for IR and american politics. Readings were good and exams were straightforward.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to students who are interested in topics like nationalism and ethnicity, civil wars, collective action, etc., as these seem to be the professor's specialty. Those interested in topics like state formation and democracy might be better suited in a course more about political theory.",
    "I loved the class, but know what your getting into. This is not an introduction to political issues around the world. This is an introduction to what leading academics are saying about those issues, and how they are saying it. You will learn about democracy, dictatorship, civil wars, etc. but not through a basic lecture that claims to know the solution. The emphasis here is on critiquing academic studies instead of looking for one end all answer to issues. This class is useful for learning how to analyze academic papers.",
    "I recommend 116 as an easy and straightforward class. Professor Lawrence is an excellent lecturer, and many of the topics are very interesting (especially if you keep up with the reading). It *is* an intro class in Political Science, though, so if abstract political theories or simplifications frustrate you, you may want to look elsewhere. Take 116 if you want or need basic exposure to the field, because it's probably the best (not terribly strenuous) way to get that.",
    "The material was interesting, though the class was rather boring. I recommend the class though if you can find something else to do with your time, I think it would be a wiser choice to take that other class instead. Comparative Politics wasn't very difficult though, so if you'd like to take an easier class, I suggest this one.",
    "This course can be quite dry at times. It's based on research by comparative politics theorists, who aren't very accessible. The lectures are just summaries of the readings. The tests and three page essays are pretty easy, but the grading is rather harsh. Don't take it if you don't have a strong interest in political science. Take intro to political philosophy instead.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in academia or policy as a career. This will either give you a glimpse of the structure of the field or provide a new perspective on how political problems can be approached and analyzed. The course revolves around the readings so make sure you're interested in the topics covered before you enroll. The cycle of reading, lecture, and writing can become tedious so again, make sure you're interested in what's being covered! I feel that if you invest the appropriate time for this class, the payoff will be worth it in the end.",
    "I would recommend this class. I took it seeking a social science credit, preferably taught in a lecture format, that had a history class feel. This class fit the bill. Professor Lawrence was quite good. She's the sort of professor who welcomes student questions and ideas."
