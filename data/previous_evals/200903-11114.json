    "Sure. It is really helpful to see others present and discuss.",
    "The research in progress course involves a 30 minute presentation by each graduate in their third year or beyond. They present the techniques they used as well as preliminary data. I would definitely recommend the course because I think it is vital for students to have an understanding of everything that is going on in the department in which they are enrolled. It is also great to see as a first year because it is then easy to know what is expected of you."

   "comments": [
    "It allows all of the students in the department to get a grasp of what their peers are studying. It not only deepens an understanding of various techniques that are used within the field, but it also enables students to understand what the other graduate students on working on. The graduate students presenting their projects gain a better understanding of what they are studying by getting faculty input on their research projects."
