    "This is a crazy class. Take it if you're interesting in rhythm- you'll be telling stories about it afterward!",
    "I really liked enjoyed the course. Professor Cohn has a very professional approach to teaching even in a small seminar setting, but he is certainly approachable and both very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the material. I really enjoyed doing the final paper because Professor Cohn allowed me to analyze a metal song, which is probably an unorthodox choice for a course like this. He was interested in all the genres of music we covered and didn't allow the amount of knowledge he had for the genre to keep him from doing a fairly solid job of at least exposing us to important issues of rhythm and meter that were pertinent to that style.",
    "This class will be engaging and rewarding for anyone with a remote interest in how rhythmic analysis complements tonal analysis in music. I didn't know how interested I'd be in it when I first added it to my schedule, but now I'm glad I did -- it's made me look at music in ways I never could before. Professor Cohn is one of the friendliest, personable professors I've had at Yale, and his willingness and flexibility in scheduling office hours really makes the class. The conversational feel of class sessions is very encouraging and engaging. Though no prior knowledge of metric theory is needed, some class sessions can get very technical and in-depth, and the final essay requires planning. However, Professor Cohn tries to focus on subjects that individual students are especially interested in, and the final essay is very open. Highly recommended for seniors and non-seniors alike!"
