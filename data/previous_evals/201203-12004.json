   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend it. Just stay on top of your work to avoid that awkward silence in class!",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone that is interested in French literature. There is a lot of richness to extract from the works that we study in class. However, if you are only looking to fulfill the language requirement, I don't think I would recommend it.",
    "I'm a STEM major and I thought this was a great class. Professor Sanjabi is AWESOME. I learned so much and had fun doing it!",
    "Great for people interested in exploring the French classics!",
    "I would recommend this if you are comfortable with reading. Many works are covered in this course and there is constant reading, but they are all great.",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you're interested in French literature - it is exactly as described, an intro course that gives a great overview of the major French authors without delving very deeply into any of them. Not a huge workload at all, and Professor Sanjabi is great.",
    "There is a lot of reading, but definitely worth it if you have the time and love French.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in exploring French literature and are very comfortable reading writing and speaking French. Not the best class to take as a 5th, decent amount of work.",
    "Good, solid introduction to French literature. Take it if you're scared to jump right into the higher-level lit classes, for sure. Be prepared for a decent amount of reading, three short, manageable (but difficult if you haven't had much practice writing papers in French) papers, and some fun moments. It's slow at the beginning (or it was for me) but it gets better.",
    "I really enjoyed the assigned readings, especially towards the second half of the semester (Baudelaire, Anouilh, Proust, Sartre, Duras). On average, we only spent one class on each work so we covered a lot of material (medieval poetry to contemporary authors) but weren't able to really follow up on class discussions or examine anything we read that closely. Usually the first half of class would be student presentations and Professor Sanjabi giving background information about the author and the work. Good for working on reading and writing, but how much you develop your speaking skills really depends on how much you speak up in class.Take for a great survey course on French lit but don't expect too much in-depth analysis, which is a shame because Professor Sanjabi has some really interesting insights."
