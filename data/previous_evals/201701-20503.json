    "This class taught me to think strategically.",
    "I learned to completely see the world in a different way. I now truly see auctions, negotiations, bets, finite games, cooperation, and communicating in a different light, and will apply this knowledge to my day-to-day activities.",
    "Learned to approach real life problems in a new way! This class completely changed the way I see a number of situations in my everyday life.",
    "How to think about life in a game theoretic way. How to achieve cooperation and compromises. Why some games have lousy equilibriums and how to get around those.",
    "It really gave me a new way of thinking.",
    "Skills on negotiation, pricing strategy, poker, signaling, credibility and commitment and many more.",
    "You learn a lot about game theory, some of which is pretty interesting.",
    "I learnt how to make decisions in real life and how to apply math to real-life situations. The concept of the Pie in Negotiation was the most useful in helping me to decide whether to collaborate and how much money I deserve. Signaling is also particularly useful in life, in making people do things that are expensive for a certain type of person but cheap for another type of person, and this will help me distinguish between people. I also enjoyed the application of mixed strategy in evolution and how it is possible to use it to explain group behavior.",
    "This course changed the way I think about pretty much everything. The main takeaway that Barry wants to impart to his students is to think about things allocentrically, meaning think about things almost strictly from how others would be thinking about them. This course taught me the best way to do so.",
    "I learned a lot of interesting behavioral economic theory and applicable practical skills in negotiation, Nash equilibria, and business.",
    "This class is the most useful I've taken at Yale. It changed the way I approach my life. Everything is now a game, everything has a strategy, and everything can be negotiated.",
    "Basic concepts in game theory. The class a more practical approach, rather than a more mathematical one, which has both advantages and disadvantages.",
    "I had no economics background when entering this course, and this taught me so much about fundamental concepts. It not only changed the way that I see negotiations, it also helps me see many day-to-day ideas through the lens of game theory.",
    "Analyze decision making in strategic contexts",
    "A new understanding of strategies to approach any decision or situation, both in the business world and in life.",
    "I learned how to make decisions based on others, and more generally, how to think critically.",
    "I liked the Shapley values and the ideas about negotiation. Otherwise, I don't think I really gained much from the course because most of the examples were constructed in narrow mathematical models that don't really translate to the real world.",
    "Introduced me to a cool way of thinking."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I loved pretty much everything in this course. I think the curve adjusts for how difficult the course is. The frequent problem sets ensure you are constantly thinking about game theory. Professor Nalebuff is one of the best teachers I have ever had.",
    "Strengths: -Engaging lectures -Pertinent readings -Very interesting problem sets Weaknesses: -Problem sets are sometimes due before we have learned the material -Midterm was extremely difficult",
    "Grading assignments was slightly disorganized and it was hard to get personal feedback.",
    "Taught a lot of theory that was immediately applicable to real life. Forced students to think insightfully and allocentrically.",
    "Barry rambles a little bit but it's a really well designed class with interesting material.",
    "The course is a giant skim of Game Theory. You kinda get in depth in random topics, but the lack of mathematical support for the logic presented in class made the explanations vague and hard to apply to other problems. We covered important topics, but it's hard to tell if I actually learned anything I could apply in an real world situation.",
    "I thought the course material was super interesting and worth thinking about. However, one thing that could be improved is Barry Nalebuff. First of all, he is often not a very clear lecturer. He doesn't do a good job of defining a lot of his terms\/problems, so you have to play a game I like to call \"guess which math problem Barry is actually asking you to solve and solve it\". He is also fairly rude to his students, although he is an entertaining lecturer at times. Also the homeworks seemed to be graded completely arbitrarily, with no feedback given.",
    "Strength: very engaging lectures Weakness: the PSETs were too tough when they tested things we never learnt and cannot be found in the assigned readings",
    "Fascinating material, very well-structured, very well-taught. No weaknesses come to mind.",
    "I appreciate that Professor Nalebuff doesn't try to win popularity contests, and made it clear on day 1 that the course would be difficult. That said, there are various ways that the course could be made easier without compromising any intellectual rigor. For example, nalebuff claims students don't need much math to keep up, but he regularly jumped 5 mathematical steps in his ppt lectures, which he sped through really quickly (without always writing down where each alphabetical variable came from). This style was dizzying for someone like me who only made it through single variable calc (which was the only prerequisite listed in the description) to spend several hours after each lecture walking myself through the material to re-teach myself. To summarize, making simple changes like making the pot slides lay out where each variable comes from, and having each step of the math listed, and perhaps going a little slower, would make the course SO much less painful. As a professor, he did a good job keeping each day interesting and I feel like I have learned things that will stick with me into life outside school.",
    "It goes very quickly. It takes some getting used to that you won't be able to digest all the information in a given slide before it passes. However, I didn't mind that the problem sets were based on the material for the next class rather than the previous one.",
    "This class is perfect except for the homeworks. I'd rather have one longer homework every week than two short ones",
    "The course is really interesting, but like many other economics courses it fluctuates between relying on mathematics and intuition. Professor Nalebuff would probe the class for the \"right\" answer, and when he finally explained what it was, I often felt like that was up for debate. Then again I'm not an economist.",
    "The main strength is also its weakness - Professor Nalebuff's teaching style is a very interesting hybrid between lecturing and seminar. This allows for high engagement in class, but sometimes it is hard to follow along when the professor is investigating a very specific concept. In addition, there seems to be almost too much time reviewing the homework, which is sometimes too difficult, because the concept has not yet been taught.",
    "Interesting content and good psets but not well structured",
    "The course is excellent. And fascinating. It would be helpful to do more problem walk-throughs in lecture so that the Problem Sets are more intuitive. It could also be better to have more explicitly stated step-by-steps for problems.",
    "Content was very interesting. Could be frustrating to have psets be on topics that we haven't learned about yet.",
    "The biggest weakness was the bad teaching, coupled with much of the material being irrelevant to everyday life.",
    "Strengths: Barry is an asshole. I love it. He is great at interacting with you during lecture. He takes time to explain things thoroughly during lecture. He cares about his students and takes time to help you understand. Section was helpful, but was honestly mandatory. Weaknesses: Barry often came unprepared to class. Please review the slides at home and have an idea of what you're gonna say before class. Problem sets were often given without any context or preparation. Didn't feel like problem solving. Just felt like being cheated. Pick one text to read and stick with it. Don't try and do all the reading or you'll end up doing none of the reading. Choose bonanno or Nalebuff. I should've chosen Nalebuff - I understand it much better. Make some materials that are handed out for people who miss section! Couldn't make it to every one and I always got absolutely rekt when I missed. Please also provide way more practice problems throughout the semester. I felt like I never did any math problems during the year but then was expected to do a bunch on the midterm and final which was confusing."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, this has probably been my favorite class I've taken at Yale. It requires a bit more work than a lot of classes, but nothing ever felt unmanageable. Some of the problem sets are tough, but the subject matter was always interesting, and I had fun doing them. Professor Nalebuff clearly loves the material and really makes the students love it to.",
    "Of course - it has been the most formative class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Game theory with Barry is a fantastic course, but it's not for everyone. His style is very particular (e.g. cold calling, which you'll read plenty about in the evaluations). Barry is a genius and lectures are very engaging, but he can be a bit hard to keep up with sometimes. He also really cares about his students, even if it doesn't seem that way at first (he learns people's names and goes to their shows, etc.) The prereq is intro micro but it's not enforced if you have a background in something like math or CS. I took it as a CS major with only an AP Econ background, and I felt well prepared. Workload is pretty manageable, but the PSets range somewhat widely in difficulty. Overall, I would definitely recommend. Barry says the goal of the course is to change the way you think, and it absolutely does.",
    "Definitely. Don't let Prof Nalebuff's asking questions deter you, it's not to put you on the spot, just to get people engaged in the discussion!",
    "Would highly recommend. Have not taken a course like this before.",
    "Yes, you learn a lot.",
    "If you want to really learn game theory, don't take this. If you want an introduction that is poorly guided and feels vague at best, this is probably exactly what you'll get out of this course. The content itself is interesting, don't get me wrong. It's just hard to appreciate when you're trying to solve problems you haven't been introduced to and when your professor doesn't understand why you don't know what you haven't been taught. He'll cold call you anyways, but it's not bad given by the end of the course everyone's used to it.",
    "It's hard to say. On the one hand, game theory is actually a super interesting and useful topic. On the other hand, Barry can be a bit much. Holy crap do I have complaints about this guy. He often words things ambiguously, or leaves out assumptions he is making, which makes the proofs or homeworks total nonsense. When I try to ask him to clarify, he was very rude to me, treating me like I'm an idiot. He also refused to let me turn in homework late several times when I had surgery, or was visiting grad schools. I do like that he makes you think and problem solve in class or on the homework, but other than that he really got on my nerves.",
    "It is a good Cr\/D\/Fail class because the lectures and professor are very engaging. However, if you want to take it for a letter grade, it is extremely difficult to predict how well you will do, because everything is curved and you can lose many marks on high-stakes questions on the exam.",
    "I absolutely would recommend this course. This course changed my life and how I think about everything.",
    "Beware if math is not your strong suit. I read previous reviews saying similar things, and thought I would be able to handle it. I did, but it requires a TON of extra work if your mind doesn't work like Barry's. Also, he's kind of an ass, but he's funny and he knows the subject well, so it's a good class overall. Reading his book before lecture helps you get the gist of the lesson.",
    "Yes, definitely!",
    "I would not recommend this course to another person. If you are going to take Game Theory, do not take it with Nalebuff!",
    "Take this class! The life skills you'll learn are invaluable. Wish I'd taken this class before doing consulting interviews. It helps a lot",
    "Really intellectually stimulating course with concepts that can be applied to real life. Nalebuff says at the beginning that his goal is to change how you think and this class indeed does that.",
    "Take this class for sure! The reviews from a few years ago for Professor Nalebuff aren't so great, but I can say that this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. He chooses topics in Game Theory that are interesting and engaging. Granted, he's not the best person in the world at explaining things to people who are confused. But he's such an interesting man and its fun to hear him talk about his life experiences and how game theory applies. You really get to know how he thinks, and that is more valuable to me than learning about topics that you could just google to learn from a UC Berkeley website.",
    "It's a really good class! I took it without the econ pre-reqs, which made it hard to do well on the tests, as that knowledge was assumed. Otherwise the course was really interesting and we actually learned things that were applicable to our lives. Don't be intimidated by the fact that he cold calls; it's okay to be wrong sometimes.",
    "I would recommend this class. However I would advise looking at the syllabus before taking the class as well as reading a bit of The Art if Strategy to get a better insight into the material covered in the class.",
    "A really wonderful course. You might see other reviews noting the unique teaching style of Professor Nalebuff - don't be scared off by it! I came from almost no econ background, but really loved all of the great ideas that Professor Nalebuff explores in this course, and the challenging ways of analyzing such games. My main complaint for this course is that it is not very math-rigorous, and early on, many of the concepts seemed almost arbitrary. However, as you go along, you get more familiar with the core ideas of negotiation, payoffs, etc, and you are better able to see the beauty of game theory.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting subject taught in an interesting way. Enjoyable and Useful.",
    "Yes. This is a great class. But make sure you do the reading and get everything out of it that you can get.",
    "Fantastic course, very interesting.",
    "Professor Nalebuff's teaching is often unclear, whether that is his slides or his lectures. So much of the lecture is devoted to asking students for answers and then he replies to the student answers. The other students would either give responses that are difficult to hear or responses that are not fully complete so it becomes very difficult to figure out what is the right information to be noting down. That could be mitigated if the lecture slides were clear, but they are not clear at all. For the war of attrition, I just watched the lectures that Ben Polak posted and I found Polak was much more clear. I honestly don't understand why Professor Nalebuff continues to throw questions at us that we are not expected to know the answer to. Other students have complained about it in the past and I think it's still a problem. Maybe it would work out better if the resources that Professor Nalebuff gives us were actually clear, but oftentimes, those resources can be much more mathematical than the class requires or those resources are very difficult to apply to the questions that he is giving us. At the end of the day, I didn't really gain much from this class.",
    "Yea, good course. Weird workload in that you're not given a lot of materials (context for problem sets or practice problems for both problem sets and tests) but problem sets don't take too long. If you start 3-4 days before it shouldn't take you more than two hours a day at the worst."
