    "TAKE IT",
    "Amazing class. My overall best seminar experience at Yale--and I've had some other really great ones. Part of this was because of the professor: Professor Chun is funny, incredibly smart, and thoughtful. But because he ran the seminar so well, mostly the students did the talking. So the second reason why the seminar was so great was because Professor Chun selects a group of really incredible seniors who actually have the background after four years to discuss an issue from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. I learned so much from them. I really valued my time with Professor Chun, but I also remembered again how great my fellow Yalies are. Try to get in if you can!",
    "I would totally recommend MBS to any student, regardless of major. The topics apply to everyday life, from sports concussions, to marijuana legalization, to neurobased court evidence. You will learn so much about society in general, and get to have some great discussions.",
    "Every week's discussion was so fascinating. I found myself loving the readings, even though they took 5+ hours, which almost never happens in any class! The class this year also had a really nice mix of students that contributed to the diversity of opinions in our discussions. Marvin isn't very involved in the course, and we entirely grade each other's papers. I don't know how I feel about this system since grades felt rather arbitrary and it seemed like a cop-out way for Marvin to do less work for the course.",
    "I would recommend it if you are interested in debating controversial and new topics in neuroscience that relate to all our lives. This is not a class where you sit back and learn. It is very very active. A lot of work. You do the reading, you write every week and you talk in class. Prof Chun frames and concludes discussion but it is all student led\/",
    "This seminar was great. The weekly debate structure was fun, and made the workload manageable. The only critique I have is that sometimes the questions we tried to tackle were so large and multi-perspectival that it was challenging to have a coherent and fluid discussion. But this was a thought-provoking class, and I really liked that there were students from all disciplines in it.",
    "INCREDIBLE seminar. If you're at all interested in the idea of how neuroscience and psychology can be (and is) applied to our legal system and our society, then this class is for you. It's a fair amount of work (weekly responses, lead class twice, and a final paper) but the class design is so incredibly fun and interesting. We learn about each subject through weekly readings, class leaders for that week do a 20 minute debate for pro or con, and then we all debate our viewpoints. Professor Chun is amazing and not only leads class discussions well, but is infectiously enthusiastic about the material and his students. If you can get in to this phenomenal seminar, you would be a fool not to take it.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend MBS. It is a truly special class, one that pulls from a variety of disciplines. It really felt like the culmination of my classes at Yale and was certainly one of my favorite classes in my four years. With weekly reading responses, two presentations, and a final paper, it does have a greater workload than an average seminar, but I thought it was worth it. Many of the readings were ones I would have wanted to read anyway.",
    "Lot of work, but super, super interesting!!! Read academic and popular press papers to see how neuroscience is influencing all sorts of domains in society: law, medicine, religion, sports. Professor Chun is excellent, and he's especially good at: (1) choosing an interesting class of students; (2) getting a lot out of students. Everyone participates during discussion, and it seemed like everyone really loved and engaged with the course. Good luck!!",
    "YES TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN GET IN!! Without a doubt my favorite class at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Each week is an absolute pleasure and the course material is incredibly interesting. One of my favorite classes at Yale and a great way to end senior year.",
    "PSYC413 was an illuminating class. I came into the course somewhat skeptical of the applications of fMRI, but came away believing in the potential of such technology to transform society in the near future. The structure of the course, which was organized as a weekly debate on a different application of neuroscience in society (e.g. using neuroscience in criminal law) led by two opposing teams of pairs (with others in the class then discussing afterwards), felt a bit contrived at times. However, leading those sections (which each student is assigned to two of during the semester) was a fun way to dive deeper into each topic. The various topics covered by the class were really interesting. It often felt though that we did not have enough time in class to give them sufficient time, such that we eventually reduced the topics to only two components: 1) considering the current scientific state of the neuroscience application and 2) considering the future ethical and societal implications of that application assuming that it the science would inevitably progress. While that was a useful framework to evaluate these technologies, I think we also missed some of the nuance in the science, as well as the societal utility as a result."
