    "This class is so wonderful. Take this just for Prof Alexandrov - she is THE BOMB. I sort of want her to be my mom. She is so so friendly and caring and approachable, and goes above and beyond to make sure you understand everything (like one day in class I was really confused by a certain grammar topic, and she noticed my confused face and that night sent me an email with lots of helpful links. who does that?!). The class is easy to keep up with, as long as you do all the work on time - in that way it sort of feels like a high school class: do the work, and you'll be fine (which I found really comforting). The final project was really fun; you can do whatever you want that improves your spanish in a way that is applicable to you personally (so for example, a lot of people were interested in policy and learned to use that formal rhetoric in spanish). Also, the people were so friendly, just speaking in spanish makes the environment seem really homey. Overall, this is such a great, low-stress language credit.",
    "YESSSSSS-- if you can take it, TAKE IT. PLEASE. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",
    "This was an excellent course that provided me with exactly what I was looking for. Instruction into the finer points of grammar, a chance to speak Spanish in a classroom setting, a small glimpse into past and contemporary Latin American literature and culture. For any heritage speaker looking to improve their relationship to Spanish, I highly recommend this course.",
    "If you're a Spanish Heritage Speaker who wishes to better their Spanish, take this class. You will be taught grammar, read entire Spanish novels, discuss the content of each novel, write escrituras (essays), and take tests to measure you're improvement all while learning more about your culture since Professor Sybil makes an effort to incorporate cultural material in her instruction. I had the opportunity to take both SPAN 132 and SPAN 142, and I don't regret having done so. I am now a more confident and objectively better speaker and writer of Spanish. Good luck in your decision, and if you decided to take this course, no that you'll be fine if you put in the work! Good luck!",
    "A great way to connect with other Heritage Speakers on campus. You can feel comfortable knowing many of the students in the class have similar difficulties with Spanish. Also you get to learn as much from your peers and their cultures as you do from the instructor.",
    "Great course!",
    "It's really Spanish for a heritage speaker in every sense of the word. Get ready to speak in Spanish from the start. It's as close to cultural immersion on campus that you will get. I would definitely recommend this class for those of Spanish or Hispanic descent looking to improve their Spanish.",
    "It's a fantastic Spanish course for heritage speakers. Professor Alexandrov is a great instructor. Take it."
