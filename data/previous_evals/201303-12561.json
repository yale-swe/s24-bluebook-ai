    "If you want to learn how your current learning is applied on clinical stuff, it is a good course for you.",
    "I would certainly recommend it, I would just forwarn students the HW can be challeneging and take some time- best to take the course with a friend so you have two heads trying to work the computations out.",
    "This course is a required course for the CBB program. It does a good job of introducing applications of statistical techniques, although the student will probably need to seek information elsewhere to understand the techniques themselves.",
    "It's a required course...",
    "I would recommend the class if a student is interested in pursuing research in either clinical or translational informatics. I think the information is very specific to these fields.",
    "I'm not sure if I would recommend the class to a clinical student, unless he\/she had a strong interest in genetics. There was way too much genetics focus to make the class \"interesting\" for many clinical people.",
    "This class is an overview of electronic health records and genomics. The course covers a lot of information and is not particularly interesting to take.I would not recommend this course to another student. I felt that it did not teach me material that I could not have quickly learned on my own. And that the assignments did not increase my knowledge either."
