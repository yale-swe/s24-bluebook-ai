    "While not immediately relevant to my key interests, the course offered an opportunity to become involved in one of the hottest areas of scholarship in my field, and should therefore prove useful going forward.",
    "It got me very much interested in sound in relation to cinema.",
    "This was the aspect about the course I found most helpful. Professor Connor assigned a large amount reading so that we could see not just what arguments are made but how they are constructed. He always urged us to see the bigger picture.We reflected regularly as a group on what is expected of us in our profession: how to write a high-stakes paper, different ways to approach academic writing, and how to structure an argument. Professor Connor's honesty and personal high standards (when not slightly daunting) were very inspiring."
