    "You must be prepared to write a great number of personal responses and essays. Each of them though has its own interesting subject for opinion. Take this class.",
    "Madness and Civilization was a great section of English 114. I would recommend it to any student. We read a lot of interesting material and the discussions really made you think. It definitely made me think about madness in a different light. Getting an A isn't easy but taking the class is definitely worth it because it will help you to learn how to write better and it will make you think.",
    "I would recommend taking this class only if you are truly interested in the subject matter, otherwise I would recommend taking a more gently introductory course. Do not take this class just because it is a seminar, there are other lectures with more interesting material that I would have rather taken. Also because of the teacher's requirement that an A paper must be eligible to submit to the departmental english awards, the grading in this glass is very harsh.",
    "This class is a good introductory English class. When choosing a section, make sure you are interested in the subject that is being discussed; doing so will make the class much more enjoyable."
