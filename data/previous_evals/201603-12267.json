   "comments": [
    "A review of classical statistical mechanics\/thermodynamics is always appreciated, as well as an understanding of the fluctuation dissipation theorem, Langevin equations, and the Fokker-Planck equation make this course invaluable for me as a biophysicist.",
    "I learned to look at thermodynamics from a different viewpoint than I had before. I think the focus on the microscopic perspective and the connection to the macroscopic led to a deeper and more lasting understanding. I also liked that the second half of the course went into more advanced topics that are central in research in this field.",
    "I learned about the laws of thermodynamics and applications to real world problems. Mathematical equations that I have seen and used were derived in this class, giving a better understanding of the application.",
    "I received a very good recap of classical statistical mechanics, with some additional focus on colligative properties and transport phenomena, and a (very brief) introduction to stochastic processes."

   "comments": [
    "The course was very well organized and flowed smoothly for the entire semester. The problem sets expanded upon the lectures, and Professor Wettlaufer is wonderful to listen to. I think maybe some computational questions in problem sets would be useful, especially at the end of the course (generating statistics of random processes, for example) I may be in the minority here, but more frequent problem sets could maybe improve the course (although I imagine having TA would be necessary for that to happen).",
    "The lectures were very clear and engaging. There was a pretty good flow from one lecture to the next, particularly in the first half of the course (pre-midterm). In the second half of the course, the topics felt a bit disjointed (but individual lectures were still great). It would have been helpful to have an outline at the beginning of the course to allow us to anticipate and prepare for the progression of topics. It would also have been helpful to suggest supplementary readings for the topics that weren't in Reif.",
    "I most thoroughly enjoyed taking this class. The lectures, and homeworks were meaningful and I felt that the class was very productive for me.",
    "The material covered in this class is solid and very interesting. Moreover, it is highly applicable to research topics in my domain. However, I did find that the content of the class was not distributed very evenly. In particular, the pace of content coverage accelerated significantly after the Fall break, and again after the Thanksgiving break. I feel that, in particular, more time could have been dedicated to stochastic processes."

   "comments": [
    "Yes. Even for a physics student who has taking Statistical Mechanics in the past, the review of the material in the first half of the semester is great and the introduction to time dependence in the second half is really enlightening.",
    "Yes, definitely! I really learned a lot from this course, and it was enjoyable too.",
    "Yes!",
    "Very much so!"
