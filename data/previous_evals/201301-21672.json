    "If you have a good lab partner or team up with a friend, it can be very enjoyable. If not, I mean it's lab - not enjoyable.",
    "Don't take this course unless it is required for your major or area of study. It requires more work than 0.5 credit course (as all labs do). If you do have to take it, try to get Claudia Lau as your TA. She's great.",
    "The second semester of physics lab you perform E&M experiments and write reports.",
    "This class was solid. However, much like I wrote on my evaluations from last semester, THE PRACTICAL EXAM IS AWFUL!!! Do we have to scream any louder for you to hear us?! The practical exam at the end of the semester is literally the worst thing. You will spend three hours with your heart racing and your mind exploding. There has to be a better way. Yale, you can do better. This class was so great! You actually did a good job (for once!), physics department! And yet you let us down once again with a terrible, horrific practical exam. All I have left are tears. What a way to end the semester. Good luck, future physics friends.",
    "Physics lab only requires a one page lab report, but it requires a lot of thought to fit everything in. There are things called \"insight\" points that are extremely vague and are super subjective depending on the TF. There is no rubric given, which would have been helpful. The actual lab time is quite manageable. Sometimes the concept is confusing because they try to combine both the material from PHYS 171 and 181.",
    "Yes, it was good if you have to take a physics lab.",
    "If you're taking this, you're probably pre-med. If not, definitely don't take it. It's boring and pretty useless on its own.",
    "I would recommend Physics 166L.",
    "Super chill lab. The final practical is really reasonable and so are the lab write-ups.",
    "Assuming you have some prior physics knowledge, this class can be enjoyable and relatively smooth (if you get the circuits and calculations down correctly the first time). However, any minor problems exponentially grow and cause great delays in lab. The reports also seem to get longer each week, with additional sections added per lab handout. Some consistency in length and pages to read\/references to look up would be nice.The final was terrible and confusing. Many student left dumb-founded, praying to the gods of partial credit. If the weekly labs were shorter so that students could pace themselves to better synthesize the new material and had time afterwards to ask their TAs specific questions, this pain could have been avoided.",
    "If you are taking the lecture course, also take this lab. It helped me visualize and understand the concepts covered in lecture. The semester of physics lab is also less tedious than first semester even though the material may be more difficult conceptually.",
    "ok lab. take if you need the credit or pre-med",
    "if you gotta take it, its not that bad",
    "It's rough, but it helps tremendously for lecture. Take it if you are taking lecture, which you probably have to do anyway if you are premed.",
    "Similar to first semester, though lab reports took a little less time. We tended to get out of lab on time, but not early very often. You could rush if you wanted, but then you'd probably get points off on the lab reports for lack of thoroughness.",
    "It's a lab so its annoying. But the instructors really do try to make it as painless as possible. No lab reports- just writeups.",
    "Yes. Do it if you have to",
    "It's not too bad as lab courses go. I still think it's more than 1\/2 credit's worth, but it's much closer to being that amount of time and work than many other lab classes.",
    "You're going to have to take it anyways... Just know that it's going to suck.",
    "Don't take this class if you can get away with it.",
    "Compared to the other premed labs, PHYS 166L is generally less stressful during the experiments, and definitely less work outside of lab. The quizzes are simple if you read the lab handout (even if only in the ten minutes leading up to lab that day). Occasionally, parts of the procedure are not well described and you'll need to ask your TA for help, so like any lab, having a TA you can interact with like another moderately well-socialized person is pretty crucial, so good luck. The practical, like first semester, is quite difficult, but keep a cool head. Definitely not a course to dread.",
    "You probably have to take it and are just looking at these. The lab is plenty of time\/week, but it helped me conceptualize the stuff we were doing in lecture.",
    "Yes",
    "An enjoyable lab course with a fantastic professors, a manageable work load, and a great supplement to the lecture course. I really learned so much and solidified content knowledge through the experiments in lab and wish I had taken the course along with the lab.",
    "Take it!!",
    "It's a really good way to visualize the content taught in 181. Especially the more abstract E&M concepts.",
    "You'll take it as a pre-med student not in 205.",
    "it you have to",
    "I generally enjoyed physics lab. This semester, the labs tended to come before the concepts were learned in lecture (PHYS 171) so I usually went into lab with only a vague idea of what I would be doing. There are quizzes (3-4 short questions) before almost every lab but as long as you read the handout, you would be okay. I'm pretty sure the handouts are written by Sidney Cahn - they have his sense of humor! Make sure you answer all the questions in the lab handout. There's no reason to lose points for that. I felt like I finished labs much more quickly than I did last semester - electromagnetism is much more interesting to experiment with than mechanics. In addition, error propagation isn't as big of a deal this time around. Your enjoyment of the class definitely depends a lot on your TA so make sure you shop around for a good one. The one-page lab report applies to this semester's lab as well. Know how to operate and read an oscilloscope before taking the practical. Learn to not be afraid of it. Talk to Sidney Cahn: he is knowledgeable and great. There was much less time pressure with this lab practical. You have time to read over the whole experiment before beginning. Make sure you do because it's easy to interpret data wrongly.",
    "If you're looking at this course you most likely took the PHYS165L too, so finish what you started and see it through! Unless for some reason you only needed to take the first semester, in which case it really depends on what else you want to do. The experiments are good learning experiences and help you to feel comfortable with using the equipment and computer programs. The instructors are nice and fun and it's not too much work. The final is pretty fair.",
    "Normal physics lab for Phys 171\/181. Take it if you need to, obviously",
    "Physics 166L was good as far as physics labs go. I definitely enjoyed it more than 205L due to a great TA (Cheong) and a syllabus that was more in harmony with the accompanying lecture course.",
    "I found 166 lab to be a lot better than 165 lab. I'm not sure if that's because I was more comfortable with the format or what, but I felt like the lab documents were better written and the practical was much more straight forward.",
    "The second semester of physics lab is surprisingly better than the first. Even though the electricity and magnetism concepts are trickier to get, this lab actually helps you understand the concepts better than just reading from the textbook.",
    "General physics lab, 2nd semester, focusing on electricity and magnetism. More enjoyable than the 1st semester, and most people who take this need to take it, so you probably don't have much choice if you're reading this.",
    "It was very good class and I enjoyed it.",
    "Take it only if you need it. It is not extremely demanding, but it is not a classI feel in which you would feel particularly stimulated. If you take it because you need it for your credits, I think you will find the class adjustable and rather doable. Stress is often most associated withthe final practical, which is something that I really hate doing but hopefully with the right preparation will turn out properly.",
    "It's required for a lot of things and is not that painful. reports are manageable.",
    "Physics lab normally is one of those classes that I probably wouldn't take if I wasn't a pre-med, but PHYS 166 isn't that way. The lab actually really helped me solidify the material and my understanding of the concepts. However, it is CRUCIAL that you get the right TA. If you don't have a good impression of your TA right away, switch IMMEDIATELY. Also, keep good notes during lab, it really minimizes the work you do outside of class.",
    "so much better than chem lab. only take if you have to though.",
    "Pretty painless. Sometimes even fun (gasp). Profs. Ramos and Cahn are both fantastic, and will do everything to make sure that this class is both instructive and engaging. All in all, a good experience inwhat I was sure was going to be the worst part of the pre-med curriculum.",
    "Yeah! It was actually pretty good! Be thorough in your reports and always ask your TA or Professor Ramos because they genuinely want to help. You learn a lot. Good luck!",
    "It was a fun as far as labs go, but still not super fun. It is necessary for the ABET accredited Mech E degree so that would be one reason why you take it, and it was kinda fun and pretty educational.",
    "For a lot of people, this will be a tedious course that is absolutely useless. That being said, it doesn't have to be. It is a great class for people who want to experience and goof around with physical concepts.",
    "I hated everything about this course and I'm glad I'm done with it forever.",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "If you need to finish taking lab, take this class.",
    "This lab is tough, not very enjoyable, and you'll get out late many times. The final practical is really hard too.",
    "Good intro lab, comprehensive and mostly straightforward",
    "Standard physics enm lab. More difficult but also more interesting than first term.",
    "Yes!",
    "You learn about some of the topics covered in 181, but the labs don't really line up with the stuff covered in class, so you might get a lab on something you learned the previous semester. It is pretty fun, though, and time always passes more quickly than I expect it to. I would recommend this to get a better understanding of the concepts covered in 181.",
    "Your experience depends pretty heavily on your TA. Disliked this course quite a bit at times, but overall ok.",
    "I learned most of my physics concepts through this lab course.",
    "Only only only take it if you have to. Very boring, despite professor Cahn's conscious effort to make the labs fun and funny. Also the final is ridiculously difficult compared to the labs throughout the year. So get prepared for that. You can't really study for it, it's a practical and involves completely novel experiments and completely novel setups. But it's ridiculous that they asked us to do such complicated problems in only one hour after asking us to do remarkably easier ones in three hours all semester. Also all of the concepts that you learn in this class you will also learn in lecture. Except that sometimes you will do experiments well before you learn things in lecture, like our experiment on capacitor circuits, which was very difficult since we did not know that material at all. You won't learn anything new in this course and you should NOT take it to learn material or skills.",
    "Physics 166 was a tolerable mandatory lab course. The instructors worked hard to make the material interesting, but the experiments themselves were often overly involved, not synced with the knowledge base of the lecture course, or required unnecessary busy work. Work hard in the 3 hour lab time slot and you'll be fine. Professor Cahn is very quirky and nice.",
    "Definitely. The lab matched up very well with the intro to physics courses and proved very helpful in understanding material on a deeper level.",
    "Take it if you have to",
    "Good course. You should try to understand the physics principle before coming into lab.",
    "A solid continuation of 165L. The structure and expectations are pretty much the same.",
    "If you have to take a physics laboratory for your premedical requirements, you can't go wrong here. In general I found this semester easier than last semester. Part of it may have been due to a much lesser influence on calculating experimental uncertainties. I came into this years' physics labs with the ability and experience to probably take 205\/206L for physical science majors, but I didn't want to add more stress to an already jam-packed year. While at face value the experiments performed in 205\/206L appear much more interesting, I have heard that the laboratory experience isn't all that exciting. Thus, if you'd rather put your efforts elsewhere, I wouldn't mind recommending the 165\/166L sequence if that is the only requirement you need.",
    "Yes, take the course. It will help you understand the basic concepts of physics and how to apply it in the real world.",
    "It's a good class. The instructors are nice and the material is genuinely interesting.",
    "If you're pre-med you have to take it.Think of the lab notes as practice for taking patient's charts as a doctor - they will suck, sorry, but hey. Hopefully while your scrambling for insight points you'll discover that you are unlocking parts of your brain that bring about deeper inquisitiveness than you usually employ.",
    "Much better than you'd expect! Helps explain the concepts in 171\/181 without being too challenging. I was only taking it because I had to, so I didn't like the class, but since I expected to hate it, I was pleasantly surprised.",
    "Yes--Take this only if you need to.",
    "Good class.",
    "Yes. It's a well-organized lab.",
    "I think this class was enjoyable, and I think it is important to conduct each experiment thoroughly and meticulously, trying to understand the physics and the practical concepts behind each experiment. While this might take some extra time in lab, it will definitely allow you to gather more insight into the experiments, and it will definitely pay off on the final exam. Also, take advantage of the video vignette and the other resources provided online by Dr. Cahn, they are very helpful!",
    "better than PHYS 165L. the experiments are definitely helpful for understanding PHYS 171. also, Claudia Lau is an awesome TA!",
    "This physics lab focuses on electronics - oscilloscopes, function generators, circuits - so if that sounds interesting to you then definitely give this lab a go.",
    "Not unless you have to",
    "Good luck taking this course. It is very difficult and time-consuming (I found it to be the hardest of pre-med labs), but if you're pre-med, you just need to suck it up and power through the semester. Compared to the first semester, the labs themselves are way more confusing and painful to get through. However, the lab write ups, quizzes, and practical are all the same level of difficulty, so it's not hard to do well if youjust put in the time.",
    "Your standard physics lab course. Not too much of a time-grinder for most labs, and not super stressful. Lab manuals are pretty clear to follow, and the write-ups are only 1 page long. Wouldn't say it's \"fun,\" but it wasn't a bad experience either",
    "Same as physics lab 1. Maybe better.",
    "This course is a lot like PHYS 165, but I found this class much more enjoyable. It's actually really helpful for understanding the material you learn in lecture.",
    "If you have to take a physics lab course for your major, then definitely take this course instead of physics 206. The workload is much more manageable and you still learn a lot in this course.",
    "Same as Phys 165.",
    "More so than any other part of the pre-med curriculum, Ibelieve physics lab is the most inherently useless course. Luckily though, the instructors have really really attempted to somehow make this class remotely close to worthwhile. I will admit that I learned some new concepts (especially ones that are relevant to daily life or medicine), even ones that I never learned about in any other physics classes. However, as a second semester senior, I just can't change my opinion that this class felt extremely boring, unenlightening, and like a waste of time. The labs still often ran slightly over the 3 hour time slots (luckily only slightly over). Also, it is pretty much too stressful and impossible to do the experiments fully and to understand everything (with time to discuss concepts and ask the TA questions), as well as write all your lab notes. My partner and I actually cared about the concepts and made sure we understand everything by talking to our TA; as a tradeoff though, we would not necessarily finish our entire lab notes during the lab session. This meant that sometimes I would have to write about half or more of my lab notes at home, taking up an additional 2 hours or so. The one page reports are reasonable though; the concept of only having one page to say all you need to say in wonderful. However, just like last semester, there is zero guidance about what you're actually supposed to put on there. Is it a summary? Is it my discussion? Do I need to have a discussion both in my lab notes and on here? Do I talk about errors and uncertainties in both my lab notes and my report? What the **** is \"insight\" (i.e. 6 out of 55 points awarded for \"insight\" in your report)? Also, this semester, my TA did not mark down what I lost points on for. Was this some strategy to make grading less transparent? I didn't know how to imp rove my grade. Also, the lab handouts need to have a more standardized format. You never knew exactly what to expect with each week, because the format of the handout (in terms of what was written, as well as what you were responsible for knowing, and what you were responsible for doing) was always not very well organized. Although the handouts were certainly an improvement from last semester (except for one week, when it was just horrible).",
    "I wouldn't take it for fun. Try to figure out who the good TAs are, it makes a huge difference.",
    "Chances are you have to take it! But it really really isn't that bad. Helps your understanding for lecture and isn't too horrible in terms of work. The final was easier than first semester. The labs are very long though",
    "If you're taking the 171 or 181 course, you'll most likely have to take the lab. That said, the lab was actually much more effective at teaching physics than the 171 lecture was...the hardest part was the final. It didn't exactly match the pace or content of the rest of the course particularly well.",
    "Exactly what you expect. Physics lab. It will be dry, you will get through it.",
    "Physics 166 is a necessary class for pre-med and physics majors. if you have to take a physics lab, take this one, because its hard to do extremely poorly in. That said, its not particularly interesting and\/or fun. but necessary!",
    "With Dr. Ramos and Dr. Cahn, Phys 166L was definitely one of the better introductory science course that I have taken. They are both very approachable and make efforts to help you understand the material both in person and in the handout. One weakness is that sometimes the lab work doesn't correspond with the lecture material which can lend itself to a steeper learning curve at times. Otherwise, expectations in the course were notably transparent for both each week and the exam. The TA, Robby Blum greatly helped facilitate learning in this course. He was alway engaged and very helpful. Lastly, the course made sure to include reference to real-world applications of physics!",
    "Similar structure and grading to PHYS 165L, with short 1 page lab reports, prelab quizzes, and a final practical exam. Sidney Cahn has a fun sense of humor and puts lots of jokes into the lab handouts\/videos, so they're enjoyable to read\/watch.",
    "Required lab course, especially if you are pre-med. Lab experience really depends on your TA, even though Professor Cahn and Rona are wonderful.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're taking Physics 171. I wouldn't say it's fun, but it did really help me understand the concepts we covered in lecture.",
    "I would recommend physics lab if you are required to take it for a major.",
    "Fairly straightforward and chances are that you need to take this class anyway. Don't worry, this class was straightforward and simple.",
    "A very simple and easy to understand introduction to physics concepts. It was relaxed, and summed up to exactly what a half credit course should be.",
    "PHYS 166L is definitely manageable and I would recommend it to another student. The instructors and TAs really care about the course and how well the student can understand the material.",
    "I had a lot of fun with the course, especially compared to the stress of PHYS 205L. I recommend the course to anyone who needs to complete a physics lab for their major.",
    "Basic overview of physics concepts.",
    "The course isa helpful supplement for Physics 171, and the workload is quite manageable.",
    "More difficult than Physics 165L.",
    "The lab course was a decent course which introduced us to applications of physical concepts relating to E&M. It was a helpful complement to the lecture course and helped to solidify many concepts covered in class.",
    "Probably the easiest physics lab, and with Sid Cahn especially YOU CANNOT GO WRONG.",
    "If you do not need to take this course than do not. But you probably have to. It is not too bad. It is about the same level of difficulty as Physics 165L.",
    "This lab is a physics lab which means it's inherently hard and awful. Sidney Cahn is really nice though and good at explaining things. The experiments are decently interesting. My TA Robby was quite helpful. The final was brutal. The labs were ok but also graded on things like 'insight' so it was impossible to get 100%. What else is there to say? It was physics lab.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it if a physics lab course is required."
