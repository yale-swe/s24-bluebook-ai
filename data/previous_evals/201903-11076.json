    "Mechanics of basic microeconomics",
    "A practical introduction to supply, demand, consumer behavior, profit maximization and production decisions. All oriented toward policymakers.",

    "Economic reasoning, non-competitive market behavior",

    "Although I am pretty sure I took at least some economics before, I definitely developed a whole new understanding of the basic concepts of the field in this course. Per Jim's recommendation, I also spent a considerable amount of time on the MIT OCW Microeconomics course over the summer (watched all the lectures, read all the readings, took notes, did some of the Problems Sets) - so between these two, I think I really improved my working knowledge in this field. This is one of the courses that, to me, really goes in the tool box - I think my ability to intuitively think through things as I run across economic principles in other courses, readings, or life greatly improved through the course.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Considering we are supposed to have taken introductory microeconomics coming into Jackson, this was almost entirely a repeat of what I spent time teaching myself over the previous summer. I do not feel that another microeconomics class should be touted as a requirement; if so, then this course should be more difficult or advanced. Perhaps it could be divided into two for those who feel more or less comfortable with the material.",
    "Strengths: - Jim had well thought out lessons plans - engaging real world examples - Jim used examples to steer us towards conclusions without stating them explicitly - problem sets were helpful Weaknesses: - reading should be more tailored to what we were studying (i.e. don't assign whole chapter if we only cover a small portion) - state expectations about mathematical concepts to know up front (derivatives, fractional exponents, etc.) - provide brief explanations for wrong answers on exams and give partial credit",
    "It was not always clear how the material would be relevant to us during our time at Jackson and\/or in our various careers post graduation I think we should have learned about market failures and externalities if this is supposed to be a class for policy makers I did not have the math background to understand what derivatives were so I was very lost for much of the semester when it came to problems that used derivatives; I wish we had been given even a short lesson about what taking a derivative meant and how to do it It was very long I don't understand why the final exam for this course and for the other required stats course for all first year MAs were back to back; it seems like it could've been easy enough to coordinate an exam schedule that offered more time to study for both Jim was happy to answer questions but was sometimes difficult to reach I don't understand why we learned about indifference curves",
    "The course was a basic microeconomics class. It suffered from a professor who was (legitimately) too busy running the Jackson Institute to be very engaged with our learning, which showed. He was pretty inaccessible. Furthermore, as many into micro courses do, this one was based on a series of assumptions, but in this case those assumptions were never explained (other than the two classes that were guest-taught. The sum was a set of tools that I don't feel very comfortable using, because they were taught so abstractly that they are nearly irrelevant.",
    "This course was a comprehensive introduction to microeconomics. The way it made the content for policymakers was a real strength. The main weakness of the course was that it needs to cater to students with different levels of previous preparation in economics. At times, I think some students who had taken economics before found the course moving too slowly, but others who hadn't found it moving too quickly.",
    "I think this class is not helpful for either those who know a lot of Econ or those who have never taken Econ.",
    "I appreciated the weekly problem sets to reinforce ideas from class and prepare students for the tests. I do not believe that the cold calling on students in the classroom was helpful in creating a safe learning space. In terms of class content, I wish that there had been more room to discuss externalities and how policy decisions by governments seek to address negative by-products of markets.",
    "Strengths of the course are that it is a good introduction to many topics in economics and microeconomics, with some applications relevant for policy students throughout the term. Weakness of the course is that it covers a wide breadth of topics and doesn't always allow opportunities for students to apply the concepts directly to real-world policy discussions. That said, some real examples were always given during lecture. It is difficult to design a course such as this with students coming from a wide range of experience in economics. If incoming students were required to take an introductory crash course in basic economics and supply and demand models (possibly over the summer) and came in with a better foundation of broad economics concepts and basic models, this course could be improved by having a larger emphasis on case studies. Ideally the course would each week be half dedicated to learning a new concept and the mathematical model, and half dedicated to a practical case study, for which students would have prepared something beforehand.",
    "Because it is a required course, it is taken by a very mixed level group of students which is sometimes a difficult environment to learn in. I'm not sure if there are any specific improvements other than allowing students to test out or choose an alternative course which is currently not encouraged.",
    "There was a lot of emphasis on economic reasoning applied to real life in exams, which I felt was a very important skill to have, but I didn't feel that I managed to translate what I learned in class into skills that help me apply economic reasoning to real life. I really enjoyed the problem sets, and thought they helped reinforce what I learned. I also found the lectures very helpful.",
    "Difficult to balance between levels of experience. As someone at lowest end of experience with econ (no prior coursework) I found it challenging but totally manageable.",
    "It's tailored more towards policy than other micro classes, but a basic calculus recap would be useful since I hadn't done any calculus in approximately 8 years and \"chain rule\" meant nothing to me.",
    "It feels like an impossible class to teach given the wide range of econ backgrounds in the course. Some thought it was too slow, some thought it was too fast. My recommendation would be to split it up into two cohorts so one half that has econ background and wants to fast track a bit can cover more, and those who don't have much background at all can get the foundation. Jim did as best as he could and I appreciate him taking the time out of his busy schedule to mentor us.",
    "The course was a standard course in economics, despite the instructor's emphasis that it would be strongly geared towards policy students in the Jackson MA program. For those with a background in economics, the class was a waste of time. Prior to enrollment, those who enquired about testing out of the requirement to do this course based on their undergraduate qualifications were met with resistance and a promise that it would be much more applied than any undergrad economics class they may have taken. This was not remotely true. The class was a run of the mill economics class, and arguably, didn't focus on the issues that would most benefit policy students. The learning relied on rote memorization and called for little creative thinking in applying economic thinking to policy problems. Grading was extremely counter-productive. Exams actively discouraged creativity. Numerous questions that ostensibly required applying economic reasoning to explain policy or market issues were graded so rigidly that unless your answer matched the instructor's singular reasoning that he placed in the answer key, you got zero credit even if your response was logical. Any attempts to contact the instructor to ask for an explanation were futile -- he was either not available, or the request was met with indifference or, worse still, scorn. There were no strengths worth noting.",
    "The professor shows deep knowledge about the subject, however, for someone who hasn't taken economics before, the course is too fast and can be hard to follow. I appreciated the weekly problem sets and would have like to have more problem sets the last few weeks, as well as practice problem sets before the exams. I think the main problem with the course is that there are people with all kinds of backgrounds, some who are economists and others who have never taken the subject before, creating an imbalance that is hard to solve.",
    "Pacing was initially a little slow, but picked up following the first ''mid\"-term exam. I think there is probably a healthy balance between getting through course materials\/examples and encouraging discussion\/questions\/etc. Sometimes, I think that some irrelevant or just argumentative questions derailed the direction we were heading in class. Either way, not a huge deal, we got through the material as needed. Big sustain on the Problem Sets. I am definitely one of those learners that needs the repetition to truly learn a subject - so I think the weekly Problem Sets are a good way to reinforce class principles - especially meeting only once a week as we did. Maybe for additional practice, the instructor could recommend which problems in the text were worth doing? When I did some problems out of the book for additional practice on my own, sometimes they would seem to be different in set up and intent than what we were doing in class.",
    "It was never clear who this class was designed for or what its objectives were. I think more case studies would be helpful. Perhaps this course should be divided into two: one option for students interested in a more vigorous quantitative economic education and a second option for students who just want to better understand economic policy as it plays out in the real world."

    "NA - Required",
    "We need to take it so... :) But do I think that all incoming Jacksonites should need to take econ? Yes, 100%.",

    "Yes, especially someone who doesn't necessarily have a strong background in the field. It is set up well to work you through the fundamentals.",
    "I would not recommend this course as it is currently taught. It offers little to students who already have an economics background, and leaves students without one with a very vague sense of basic microeconomic principles and no understanding of how to employ this vague knowledge in a professional context, nor enough of a grounding that one would feel confident taking higher level economics courses."
