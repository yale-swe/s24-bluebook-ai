    "Lots of phylogenetic information, theories of plant development, anatomy, the history of plant evolution, how plants both create the environment and are influenced by it as individuals. You gain an appreciation for plants that you might have ignored before",
    "I learned a lot of very specific information about which plants fall in which category and how they are related.",
    "Much more awareness of land plants, their function & phylogeny",
    "This course is a great survey of plant phylogeny and morphology. There is a lot of memorization involved, but it's worth it. You leave the class with a lot of knowledge.",
    "You learn a lot about the phylogenetic tree of plants, and you learn about the major evolutionary milestones that define plants as they are today",
    "Insights into the field of botany and natural science studies",
    "The diversity of plant world and why it is so diverse. Specifically, the course deepened my understanding about phylogeny, evolution, and systematics.",
    "Understanding of the huge spectrum of plant diversity and the phylogeny through a series of lectures walking through every major group. Traits and characteristics and life cycles of plants through the lens of their evolution. Fun lectures on CAM\/C4 photosynthesis, plants and climate, etc."

   "comments": [
    "I wasn't that engaged with this course but that was just because the course got into minutia that doesn't interest me and in the weeds (ha) of a lot of memorization that I will probably never need to know. The strengths of the course are definitely the enthusiasm of the professor and the incorporation of current papers and controversies Weakness: more memorization than analysis. I think the lab should be a requirement of the class since without it the class loses the tactility and physicality that is so cool. The first test was too long and it was unclear of what was being asked of us so most of the class did quite poorly",
    "A strength was that the atmosphere was very chill. A weakness was that much of the information seemed meaningless and we focused more on the details than on the larger trends and patterns until the last couple of weeks.",
    "Very fun course, great engagement with students and really interesting lectures. Final project was fun to do. Could be better organized and more clear what students have to know.",
    "This course's biggest strength is Professor Edwards' teaching style. She writes out all her notes and diagrams on the whiteboard instead of lecturing through powerpoint slides, which makes the lectures much more engaging and easy to follow. She legitimately cares about teaching and explains concepts thoroughly. She also has a wealth of knowledge about the subject and has many interesting examples to back up the theory. The biggest weakness of the course is the emphasis on memorizing the phylogenetic tree, which should be done primarily (or only) in the lab portion of the course. Going over the taxonomic groups in class takes up time that could be used to dive into large evolutionary concepts and trends.",
    "The class is a bit weak in that it focuses very heavily on memorizing phylogeny, and the names of clades and species. On the midterm exams, most of the exam is \"can you name x number of species within clade ____?\" \"Which of the species below is in ______?\", while minimally focusing on questions that demonstrate how a certain trait evolved and its subsequent impacts. I learned a lot in this class, but a lot of the things I learned were not the focus of the exams. I understand that memorizing the entire phylogeny is important to a scientist, but I feel it is more important that a student learn the \"hows\" and \"whys\" of the phylogeny instead.",
    "The most difficult course Ive taken at Yale - it was a great point of stress for me because I always felt lost and unable to grasp the material - Im not a science major and the expectations set in the course were incredibly high",
    "I really love the teaching method of writing on the white board. And at the same time I hope the slides can have more information and be more well-organised.",
    "Fantastically taught, which is hard to do when more than half of the course is just walking through the different groups of plants one by one. I found the expectations to be extremely well communicated and reasonable. Very few weaknesses come to mind - the Creature Cast projects were a LOT of work, but that was communicated adequately in the beginning."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! Definitely take the lab as well",
    "If you love plants, go for it! If you want to take the lab which is chill and awesome, also be prepared to endure a hellofalot of memorization",
    "I would not recommend this course unless you are very good at rote memorization. At first it appears low effort but they expect you to retain excessive details about the material. While there were interesting parts, it was not worth what felt like a Sisyphean task of memorization without purpose.",
    "Yes! Professor Edwards is very passionate about the material, an engaging lecturer, and super nice. You learn a lot about plants and how different families are related to each other. Basically no work for most of the semester but A LOT of memorization for the exams. Take the lab!",
    "This is a fantastic course if you are at all interested in plants and willing to put in some time memorizing plant orders\/families and their evolutionary relationships. It is absolutely worth it to take this class to learn from Professor Edwards. I would highly recommend taking the lab portion in addition to the lecture.",
    "Yes absolutely! This is a great, fun course. I would recommend a solid basis in biology (either BIOL 104 or a strong high school biology background) if you're thinking about taking it; the biology background will make the class more fruitful and easier to jump right in and understand. The exams are fair, even if they require a lot of memorization. You'll feel satisfied and impressed with how much you've learned after finishing the course. Also, make a creaturecast! It's a time-consuming, hard project, but it's also fun and worth it.",
    "This is not a class to take for a science credit. Let me repeat--this is not a class to take for a science credit. Prof was great, information covered was interesting, but this is nota class to take for your science requirement.",
    "If you are very into biology and don't mind memorizing lots of stuff, then yes. But if you are in some other kind of STEM or are not in STEM at all, I'm not sure if this class is worth the effort of memorizing things to pass exams.",
    "No. The course was exceedingly difficult for science majors and non-science majors alike - prof Edwards is an amazingly brilliant and kind woman who cares deeply about plant sciences but the course was challenging in respect to relating that material to the class",
    "Yes! Especially recommend to non-science students who might only know little about plant world.",
    "Amazing class - truly a joy and fundamentally changed the way that I look at plants and the world around me day-to-day. Professor Edwards is an inspiration, and Anri is an amazing TF. Be warned - this is not a gut, and it helps to have a fundamental, basic understanding of phylogenetics and evolution beforehand (if not, it's very do-able to learn, just be prepared to do so). Surprisingly high workload - tests were a lot of memorization and the Creature Cast aniamtion project takes a VERY long time, but it's a lot of fun to learn and not hard to do well if you put in the work. If possible, take the lab as well - fantastic complement to what you learn in lecture, and you get to know the professor and TF much better."
