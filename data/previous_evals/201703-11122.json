    "I developed knowledge about Haiti's culture, history, and environment. I developed my writing, listening, and presenting skills. I got an insight into what life in Haiti is really like through guest speakers which I thought was extremely helpful.",
    "Writing skills and knowledge about Haiti",
    "I learned about Haitis history, culture, environment, its current issues, and how the government and NGOs are working to correct the problems.",
    "In this class, you can learn about whatever you wish to learn about in the context of Haiti. This class gives you the power to decide what to learn and how much of it you want to learn. If you want to learn about Haiti's immigration policy, you can. If you want to lean about Haiti's education system, you can. It is very flexible. You get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Learned a lot about haiti and that there is more to it than what the media presents",
    "I learned a great deal about the country of Haiti, the proper\/improper use of foreign aid after natural disasters, and long term relief strategies.",
    "I learned to never accept information without doing your own research and to consider a plethora of sources before coming to a decision. I learned from other people's perspectives during discussions and I learned about Hispaniola and its history, information which I had previously lacked.",
    "This class covers a multitude of issues developing countries are dealing with and allows students to learn about the Haitian life and culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course allows you to think about topics at a deep level due to the fact that students lead one seminar each during the semester. The environment of the class is intimate which encourages deeper learning. However, sometimes seminars can be a little less engaging depending on what the student who is leading the class prepares. Experience in the class definitely depends on how you and your peers engage with the activities.",
    "Strengths-professor No weaknesses",
    "Each student taught a different topic rather than just the professor which is a strength in that you become very knowledgeable in the one topic you teach, but you dont learn much from the other students. It is a low workload and you dont have to read any of the articles.",
    "This course does a good job of giving you the power over your own education. If you choose to engage yourself, this class will be extremely beneficial for you. If you choose to not pay attention or not do the readings, this class will be a waste for you.",
    "Weakness: awkward sometimes, early morning Strength: passionate teacher",
    "I didnt come to class with enough information on that days topic sometimes.",
    "I loved the course and the only thing I would suggest would be to facilitate more debates and ways such as this for students to easily engage and collaborate."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is perfect for someone, like myself, who has not written papers and essays in a while but is looking to develop these skills around interesting topics. A great level of freedom is given in choosing topics for papers which means it is really difficult to become bored in this class. The readings and material are very interesting and classes are often engaging and interesting.",
    "Yes its awesome",
    "Definitely if you want a lift workload and a writing credit",
    "I would recommend this course because I believe it is important to understand how to take control over your own education. This class allows you the space to figure out how to handle time management and figure out what study skills work well for you during your time at Yale.",
    "Yes, but I think the grading of the class was very unfair",
    "Yes",
    "Most definitely, hidden gem",
    "Yes very interesting material.",
    "Yes because I loved the class and the professor and I came away with so much new knowledge.",
    "The professor is great and a good person. You will learn a lot about issues facing developing countries and more likely than not have fun doing it."
