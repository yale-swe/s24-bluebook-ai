    "I really enjoyed this course. I think this course should be a requirement for all public health students to take because it really exposes you to a basic backdrop regarding public health philosophy and ethics. That being said, I really liked the small class size we had because I felt it was a lot more engaging.",
    "I think it would have been useful to focus a larger percentage of the course on the applications of ethical theory to public health topics, and devote fewer classes to introduction to ethical theory. I liked the essay assignments (discussing ethics in relation to a novel).",
    "Interesting discussion on ethics and I learned a lot of material. It might help to have main points of the lectures on a slideshow. Sometimes it was hard to determine what was important in every lecture.",
    "Great class. Interesting to have a different way to think about public health!"

    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Dr. Jennings is amazing. He's really inspiration in all the work he does, and is a wonderful and engaging lecturer. I would have enjoyed more further development on some of the later topics, but also understood that we had a limited amount of time to go through a great amount of material this semester.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Dr. Jennings obviously knows quite a bit about ethics, especially as applied to public health. His lectures are very informal, which is good but can make it difficult to follow sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Bruce is a wonderfully knowledgeable, kind, and compassionate instructor. He is so wise and sincere. I really loved this course! It provides an important fundamental understanding of how public policies are structured and what is important to consider in any practical application. Classes like this, I believe, should be taken by all students.",
    "Instructor: Bruce Jennings \u00a0Fabulous teacher. I like having a teacher that isn't from a specifically public health\/science background because it's nice to have a different perspective. Also, it's nice to have a teacher that is actually working in the field."

    "Yes--take it! It is a wonderful introduction to public health ethics, and Dr.Jennings is brilliant!",
    "A decent, low work load class for anyone interested in ethics.",
    "Very interesting class. I believe it really rounds out the complete educational experience.",
    "Yes, I found that discussing the role of ethics in public health is not discussed often enough in the MPH program, and this course provided an opportunity to do so."
