    "It's plenty of busy work, but it's not hard to succeed if you work. So I would recommend it not if you're looking for \"that Yale experience\" but if you're looking to do well in a class, because the teachers look out for you and the level of coursework is reasonable.",
    "a load of work but its a good solid language class that increased my control of the french language",
    "Yes, french is fun.",
    "Required Langauge class, but definitely harder than spanish of some of the other languages. the homework requirements are absurd",
    "I would definitely recommend French 130 04 because of the quality of the instruction in that section and the overall quality of the French department in general.",
    "Great course. Review of present, p.c. and imparfait verbs, intensive study of subjuntif, conditionel, and plus-que-parfait. Fun books and two films. Each book\/film = one unit (one test). Great that it meets 5x a week - really reinforces concepts. Learn more french idioms and forms of expression via the books and films.",
    "good third year french course",
    "It's basically a repetition of everything you learned in high school\/levels I and II, going more in depth into some things. If you can skip it and go into L4, I would recommend doing that because I felt like I wasn't learning that much. The reading\/media material is generally ok, but the unit on Jules et Jim was a bit painful. I would take this class if you have to do so to keep going in French, but if you can skip it, I would opt for that option.",
    "It is useful if you want to learn french, and the reading is actually quite fun. I'm much happier that I decided to study french now because I'm learning about how interesting the culture is--so this doesn't feel like I'm merely fulfilling the language requirement."
