    "Take the course.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only after some serious work in formal logic. Even as a philosophy major having taken first order and mathematical logic, I found some of the formal proofs difficult to follow. Also, some set theory wouldn't hurt.But if you've got the prereqs, definitely take it.",
    "This coures provides a very thorough introduction to the philosophical questions raised by the fundamental mathematical results of the twentieth century - Russell's Paradox and Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. Professor Whittle is an engaging professor who gives clear explanations of the topics.",
    "If you're a math and philosophy major, you should definitely take this course; in fact, this course should probably be required for the major. You get the chance to critically examine your beliefs in mathematics, thinking about questions like \"what is a justifiable basis for the foundations of mathematics?\", or \"are we justified in thinking that there are multiple sizes of infinity?\" Bruno is also great and charming, and it's a lot of fun to have mini-debates in class about the readings. On the other hand, if you're not a math and philosophy major, this class probably won't be very fun for you...",
    "This seminar is a wonderful in-depth look at recent (and technical) contributions to the field of philosophy of mathematics. The course begins with a consideration of Russell\u0092s paradoxes (which sparked the \u0093modern\u0094 period of philosophy of math), then works its way through some philosophy of set theory, the significance of G\u00f6del\u0092s incompleteness theorems, and the implications of the existence of nonstandard models of arithmetic. If for nothing else, take this class for an examination of the nature of mathematical truth: In virtue of what are mathematical statements true? Are there abstract mathematical objects out there that our theorems refer to? It\u0092s quite awesome to ask probing questions about the foundations of what we consider to be our most certain science. The course readings do assume a solid grounding in logic and set theory, and the material is often dense, although Professor Whittle is astoundingly good at explaining even the most difficult concepts. I highly recommend this course, especially to students who are interested in logic and\/or who are majoring in math and\/or philosophy."
