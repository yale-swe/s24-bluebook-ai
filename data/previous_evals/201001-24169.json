   "comments": [
    "This course is an accessible introduction to scientific remote sensing. It is great for anthropology, archaeology, geology, epidemiology, and forestry students but would be a great course for anyone else (any major!) interested in remote sensing. I would whole-heartedly recommend this course to anyone who is willing to give it a shot. All it takes is motivation and good attendance.",
    "I thought this was a great course and would definitely recommend it to another student. It is a fairly quantitative class that does a great job of teaching you about how you can use the different wavelengths of light to detect many different land features from satellite and the ceo lab is really interesting to work with the vast amount of satellite imagery available on the web.",
    "You learn about satellites: the bands, orbits, types; the methods and functions of remote sensing and then the applications of remote sensing in research in geology, forestry, medicine, and policy. I would definitely recommend it to a student who is interested in any of these fields. Remote sensing will definitely be a big player in future research.",
    "This is an absolutely fascinating class with a great lab component. My one note of caution is that it can become a very significant time sink. The labs are relatively time-consuming and the final project can become very involved. That said, it is VERY MUCH worth it. I highly recommend this class. In particular, look forward to some really interesting application talks by guest lecturers at the end of the semester.",
    "This class is like no other class you've ever taken, you learn about satellite imagery in lectures and then put what you learn in practice in a state of the art computer lab (which is open 24\/7 and has a lot of really expensive software that runs super fast). There are weekly assigned labs which can be fun if a little tedious and are well designed to force you to learn the techniques. The lectures are decent because Ron Smith is the man and the material isn't too difficult if you have any science background. There's only one exam and it happens early in the semester which is nice to have it over with.The important point about this class is that there is an ENORMOUS TERM PROJECT that is really difficult and will take up TONS of your time at the end of the semester. You have to do a 15 minute presentation about it when you're done and write a long paper. It's worth it in the end because you really feel like you've done something substantive. It's one of the pieces of work I've completed at Yale that I'm most proud of.I highly recommend this class to anyone, especially if you are interested in nature, the environment, electromagnetic radiation, seeing stuff in detail from space, computers, Ron Smith, Geology, or geography.",
    "Remote Sensing is a great class, one where you definitely feel like you are learning something practical. We looked at the use of satellite imagery and its applications for land change detection, climate monitoring, etc. As a student in Public Health, the subject matter wasn't always geared towards my focus, but I generally found the different perspective to be very refreshing. Something students who want to take this should keep in mind is that it has a particularly high work load - a midterm exam, regular problem sets, weekly labs, and a large final project\/presentation. Also, the software we used, ENVI, is only available on campus at the CEO lab.",
    "Really, really fricking awesome course. For years, I have tried to like science research since I have an intense passion for science but most of the time I haven't been successful. Usually, when I try I encounter too many people in it just to discover the next plastic on the market or sub-atomic particle or medical breakthrough that allows people already at peace with death to gain one more year in life expectancy. Here, however, I found a field of research and a group of people that are truly concerned with getting to some form of truth and are not just in it for the next breakthrough. I'm glad I took this course before I graduated."
