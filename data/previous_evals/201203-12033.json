   "comments": [
    "super wonderfultho most people don't do the readings ever and if you study the class notes really carefully and do a study group you can get an A",
    "I loved this class. Loved, loved, loved. I learned so much from a brilliant professor and truly enjoyed learning about all the topics we covered. I think you have to be genuinely interested in the history of the Jews to love it as much as me, but it was one of my favorite classes that I've taken at yale.",
    "DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. EVER. \"Oh it looks interesting and light on work?\" NO. NO. NO.This is a class almost awesome in its badness. Why? The professor, Ivan Marcus.Professor Marcus speaks only in run-on sentences that blend his lectures into an incomprehensible cesspool of information. Want to ask him questions to clarify what you heard? Too bad - he'll cut you off mid-sentence. He is not a nice man.This class is a perversion, an abomination. What I thought would be an interesting and useful course soon becomes a stressful nightmare because this man is so stuck in his ways I cannot properly express it to you here.In short, if there was a planet somewhere whose civilization was based on the worst classes of all time, then History of the Jews and Ivan Marcus deserved a sacred place among their most holy artifacts.No matter what anyone else says in these reviews, please, I'm begging you, save yourself.",
    "ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS! It is actually one of the best classes at Yale!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. The lectures were interesting and the professor was very funny. I had no background in this time period at all which made it a tiny bit confusing at times, but not too bad. It's just a midterm, final, and final paper and the readings aren't really necessary. This is a great credit-D class but you do need to come to lecture.",
    "I think the course has magnificent material, but it would be better if Marcus gave us more varied assignments, rather than just three large ones.",
    "Long lectures, no section, 2 tests and a paper. Straightforward class and you will learn a lot",
    "A good introduction to Jewish history up to 1500. In summary, the first half of the class focuses on tracing the origins of the Jewish people, the second on their Diasporas and preservation of identity. If you follow the lectures, many of the readings are superfluous--but Scheindlin's book is highly recommended, even if it might be too concise. Very little outside work is required for this class during the semester. The final grade is determined entirely by 2 midterms and a primary source analysis, equally weighted. All are fairly straightforward and the paper is graded leniently, though a large portion of the class got shortchanged on the first midterm (perhaps Marcus was having a bad day), which dealt a pretty heavy blow to the grades. But overall the class proved enjoyable nonetheless.",
    "Without reservation I recommend this course to a fellow student. Marcus is both a brilliant lecturer and scholar, and you will learn immensely from him. The course nearly by definition has a massive scope, but Marcus does a great job in bringing it into one cohesive picture. Lectures are really engaging, and the course has just the right amount of work to invite you to do the reading without stressing you out. This should be the model of every Yale course. With a dynamic lecturer and manageable workload, you actually look forward to engaging with the class. I'm a hardcore science major and this easily one of my favorite classes at Yale.Seriously, not a single reason not to take it.One more recommendation: take Jews in Muslim Lands as well.",
    "If you have an interest in the material, take the course. The subject matter is obviously immeasurably important given today's political climate. Lectures are extremely difficult to follow. On the upside, very few assignments and little work.",
    "MEH, dull at time, interesting at times, not a ton of work. More stressful than it needed to be. Take it if you need Pre-industrial or rest of the world (double whammy!) because you don't have to do the reading.",
    "This class has a gut reputation--you will need to do the reading. But you should! It's interesting. This course is also a good way to get a cursory look at early Christianity and Islam.",
    "I would recommend this course only to people who are interested enough in the topic to do all the reading diligently. If you're not committed enough to do that, consider auditing. The lectures are fantastic, the reading less great. The first half of the class is mostly reading from the Bible, which is cool but which I found really hard to read as history. The second half was a lot better. Professor Marcus does a great job of questioning the conventional wisdom about Jewish history, and he is pretty funny!",
    "This is a great class: an old-school sort of lecture with no section, lots of reading, and a talented lecturer. Professor Marcus is a remarkable storyteller\/historian. He made texts like the Hebrew Bible come alive where they had before felt inaccessible and alien to me. I also appreciated the paper assignment (to tackle an ancient\/medieval primary document without supplement\/guidance from secondary sources--basically without historical context), which was a unique learning experience as a history student.A weakness: This was a lecture with no section, which is a good thing. I loved how grown-up it felt just having the students and the lecturer, no mediation. But it also meant we didn't really get to do any talking\/writing\/thinking or get any feedback until the midterms and paper. There were LONG stretches where students could fall behind without anyone noticing, without it mattering.",
    "It's not a gut so unless you're interested in the subject (and interested in cramming before exams) don't take it.",
    "Yes -- this is an interesting class that is a great \"fifth\" class with little work.",
    "Covered tons of material that was quite interesting so if the material sounds interesting definitely take it.",
    "Only take it if you are really, really interested in the history of the Jews. Otherwise, there are much more interesting history courses to take for fun\/ random knowledge."
