    "I do not recommend this to anyone. You should only this course if you absolutely need it for your major and even then, take engineering 155, which can replace Math 120. I shopped 155 and decided against it because it appeared more difficult than MATH 120. I thought I could handle 120 because I did great in MATH 115. I was horribly wrong.",
    "I think there are better ways to get a QR.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you really enjoy math. It's a tough class to get through if you're only looking to fulfill a QR requirement.",
    "A standard multivariable calculus course, Math 120 is taught in sections of around 12-15 students. The teaching quality varies significantly between instructors (all sections only meet together for exams, so you will taught by only your instructor but assessed in comparison with students from all instructors). Be sure to shop different instructors to find one with a teaching style you like. The class is taught in lecture format with standard weekly homework assignments of about 10 problems. Before covering actual multivariable calculus, the class focuses on three-dimensional space and space curves, followed by line integrals. Students learn to understand (and parametrize) curves, surfaces, and solids in three dimensions using Cartesian, polar, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates; techniques of partial differentiation; double and triple integrals; and several theorems that extend the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus into higher dimensions. If the course is necessary for your future plans, feel free to take it. If it didn't open up doors to other courses, though, I would ensure that you are really interested in the material before choosing it for a QR or just for fun.",
    "Math 120 is boring and not taught well. That being said, if you have to take it you have to take it. I've heard good things about ENAS 151, the engineering version of Math 120.",
