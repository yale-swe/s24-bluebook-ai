   "comments": [
    "This is an excellent course for anyone interested in theatre or creative writing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I learned a lot from my classmates, Professor Dorfman, and my own experimentations. I found it well-organized and constantly engaging \u00e2\u0080\u0093 visits from playwrights and the consistent opportunity to read each others' work in class were particular highlights for me.",
    "If you're inspired to write by true life events, this is absolutely a good class to take. It can be challenging, but you'll learn a lot and it'll stretch you as a writer.",
    "Biography into Drama is an interesting look at how playwrights adapt historic material into theater. It is a fascinating subject, albeit poorly executed. I do believe that the structure of the course will be improved in future years, so if that is true I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "You write a play and it is great. Such a wonderful course. I wrote and read material I never would have otherwise, and I think that is the best thing a Yale course can do for you. The class pushed me as a student and as a reader. I loved working with the other students in the class and Toni is a spectacular professor.",
    "Biography into Drama was an incredible class, with interesting reading assignments and inspiring writing assignments. By the end of the semester, you'll have written a full one-act play (think 50-70 pages, and I can't even express how accomplished you'll feel when you turn in the piece), as well as a number of shorter scenes. Professor Dorfman is an amazing discussion-leader, letting students direct conversation, and she's even more amazing in the extent to which she truly cares about her students and their work: she'll sit with you every week to discuss the progress of your play, and, by the end of the semester, you'll have picked up countless insights and improvement ideas for your writing. This class is a ton of work (seriously, A TON OF WORK), but it's so worth it: the learning you'll do by osmosis from your classmates and Professor Dorfman is certain to ignite a passion for playwriting.",
    "If you are more into the creative side of adapting biography into drama, then take this course. If you are really concerned with being factual, it is not the course for you.",
    "Absolutely take it, if you are at all interested in playwriting or reading plays for craft. I'm not sure but it may be kind of hard to get into the course. You'll have to make sure you apply before the semester starts (I always forget to do this) and you might not get the email if you are not a theater studies major, so look into it and send in a good writing sample. Take it even if you've never written a play before. You will become so much better just from hearing a few pages of your scenes read out loud in class and from hearing other peoples' scenes read out loud in class. Plus, it is very unlikely you'll ever write a play unless you have the structure of a course like this. Toni is so encouraging and incredible. She will actually read your play with a fine tooth and comb and listen to what you have to say. Sometimes it's a lot of reading to do in one week (like you may have to read an entire biography in one week) but it is not always necessary that you read the entire thing. You'll gain so much from disscussing the plays you've read with the classroom. We had some really fun discussions in class of the plays we read, and you will hear some great feedback both from Toni and from classmates about your own play. Sometimes its really interesting just to hear what other people feel your play is about. Take the course!"
