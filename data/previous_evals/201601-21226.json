    "Take this class if you're interested in the Professor and a high level of philosophy, I couldn't decide throughout whether he was mellow or austere... I really don't know my grade but I'm sure it won't be high because the paper was all about subject material that he's featured in",
    "Really smart, knowledgable, and incisive professor; really interesting readings; okay class discussions; final paper too long.",
    "Take it! It's a really great course. I really like the fact that Professor Pogge tries to include everyone in the discussion and not let a few dominate the discussion. I also really enjoyed the readings. Professor Pogge is so responsible, patient, and willing to help.",
    "Good course but only take it if you want to discuss abstract ideas at length.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Pogge is an expert in his field. If you are interested in political philosophy, especially issues of sovereignty and international governance, even if you don't agree with Pogge's politics, take this class.",
    "This is a great class for students who are already well versed in political philosophy and\/or ethics. I would say it is also good class for philosophers, but also EP&E, Econ, and Poly Sci students. It focuses on global justice and addresses very specific topics in the current literature."
