   "comments": [
    "Absolutely, Carreras is by far the most painless way to get your language credit",
    "The language requirement is an embarrassment to Yale College. If you have to take a class to fulfill it, take Spanish 140 with Mercedes. It'll be fun and you'll learn something, and you may not hate it - unlike my friends in other classes.",
    "A good preparation for L5 Spanish courses. There's a heavy emphasis on grammar topics such as the subjunctive and the conditional, but your conversational abilities should improve after this course. A fair amount of daily online homework (which is to be expected out of a language course), but as long as you don't procrastinate, you should be fine.",
    "SPAN 140 is a continuation of intermediate Spanish. Don't fret if you placed into it from the start. There are no surprises if you are simply moving on from L3. Taking Carreras is a good choice; she may seem cold at the beginning, but she will reward you for your persistence and loyalty. I recommend SPAN 140, when taught by Mercedes Carreras.",
    "The class is a very low-stress way to practice Spanish speaking and listening skills for 50 minutes every day. I definitely felt my comfort with the language improving over the semester. I also wrote a decent amount - two in class essays and short-response based tests. I would definitely recommend taking it with Mercedes as a way to finish the language requirement.",
    "A course nearly ruined by its subpar resources but redeemed by phenomenal instructors (especially Mercedes Carreras).",
    "It's a good course. Mercedes is really nice and is more relaxed than the other teachers, which is nice. You learn some more grammar that builds off of 130, and you also read a short novel.",
    "SPAN 140 is a great class for anyone who took Spanish in high school to the AP level but has not engaged with the language since then. There is some focus on grammar, which is helpful for students (like me) in that situation, but most of the curriculum is driven by stories, articles, a novel, and conversation.",
    "Definitely take this class with Seora Carreras! She is a terrific teacher who creates a nurturing class environment. Everyone always feels comfortable speaking and contributing to the class discussions. She is also an expert at explaining difficult concepts. If you are taking Spanish 140, look no further!"
