    "This class has a great reading list. I would recommend shopping it and seeing how you like Prof. Dimock's discussion style. There aren't a lot of opportunities to read a whole semester of war literature at Yale, and if it's a topic you're interested in, it's definitely worth checking out.",
    "I would recommend shopping the class to see how well your thinking style jives with Professor Dimock's--the reading list is great, and if the other students in the class get into it, then you can too. But the class dynamic is key, I wouldsay more so than in other seminars.",
    "This class was thoroughly disappointing. It's a pretty good syllabus, with some flaws (War Trash the most glaring among them), but Professor Dimock is very unimpressive. Class was often boring, we rarely discussed the most intriguing aspects of the books we read, and Professor Dimock taught me nothing. She's written books that are supposedly good, but she gave no indication of being terribly intelligent this semester. She often brushed off or ignored the most interesting and probing questions and observations people made in class. She sometimes seemed not to understand comments people made. She allowed some people in the class to say remarkably unintelligent things uncontrolled. Some of the books are really worth reading, and I enjoyed the class' two papers, but that's more because I made the papers fun than because Professor Dimock did--she basically told us to write about whatever we wanted. There are a few spectacular books on the syllabus (The Enormous Room, The Naked and the Dead, and Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close), but you should read themin another class or on your own rather than in this class. I gained nothing from the class besides the occasional insightful comment of another student. I kept going to class hoping it would be better, and I really wanted to like Professor Dimock, but she made that nigh impossible.",
    "Yes. The reading list is incredible, the workload isn't too intense, and Professor Dimock is caring and respectful, if somewhat unconventional in her comments.",
    "Excellent",
    "This course is lovely. Professor Dimock is wonderful in seminar. Discussions are thoughtful and the reading list is excellent. It gets a bit depressing at times, but that's to be expected in a class about war.",
    "If you're into war lit., take this class. It's not too much work and discussion can be pretty good. I wasn't a huge fan of the prof., but I'm not sure I would've picked up the books we read on my own, so in that respect, I'm glad I took the class.",
    "It was great, but I would definitely make sure to check out the reading list before committing to the course. It may not be what you expect.",
    "A great class. The reading material is wonderful - you will actually want to do all of the reading. The assignments are straight forward and Professor Dimock is more than willing to discuss ideas and read drafts.",
    "Take it. You get to read amazing texts from the relatively new canon of American war literature, from the Civil War to beyond. Unlike other classes on the topic (I see you, War in Lit&Film), there's no tradeoff between the allure of the reading list and the quality of instruction. You'll regret not taking a SEMINAR with Dimock before you graduate."
