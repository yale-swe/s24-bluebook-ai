   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it but I would caution against the workload. Don't be fooled -- the fact that the books are all enjoyable and you might have read some of them does not mean it's easy to accomplish. There's also theory, etc. But yes, I would recommend it. If your imagination still functions wildly, and you're nostalgic for your childhood and love spending time around children, you'll love this course.",
    "This was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Yale, if not THE favorite.",
    "Take it!!! It's the best second semester senior English course you can take, trust me.",
    "This class is exactly what you'd expect. You read children's books and then discuss them with other people interested in children's books. The books are awesome and a great way to re-visit childhood from a more grown-up perspective. The workload is manageable. Two short projects (one creative and one critical), a creative presentation, and a long projects (creative or critical). This class is FUN and actually rewarding. Take it.",
    "Take it!",
    "If you're interested in this kind of stuff it's awesome...it sort of is a little bit of work sometimes because instead of discussions you break up in to small groups and so you really have to do the majority of the reading.",
    "Not worth a Yale credit. Easy reading, but a lot of it. The class did next to nothing to change or inform my readings of these childhood texts.",
    "This class is a lot of fun! The books are so much fun to read, and the chance to do class presentations and creative projects is unique in college. The class attracts a group of interesting and creative people, which is a pleasure to go to. I didn't really feel like this class improved my understanding of these books, or will make me a better reader of children's literature. I am very glad I took this class because it was a lot of fun, but I don't know how much I learned from it.",
    "As the evaluation said last year, this course doesn't really work towards a specific theme\/point. However, all of the assignments are enjoyable, and you can't beat the reading list.",
    "I would recommend it, if you can get in. It's the perfect senior year course: great reading, fun assignments. (But not ridiculously easy--this isn't a total gut. It's just good.)",
    "Absolutely recommended for every single Yale student with an ounce of creativity or imagination. Easily the best course offered at Yale--and not irrelevant as some few might think! Contains an excellent portrait of child development as well as children's literature."
