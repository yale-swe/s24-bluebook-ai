    "Knowledge: Within just one semester, I learned a wide range of vocabulary, grammatical structures, expressions, and interesting facts about the Portuguese-speaking world, particularly Brazil! Skills: Speaking, writing, and listening to Portuguese. I am happy with the level of proficiency I have acquired to this point in all three facets, and look forward to learning more. Insights: Portuguese is NOT Spanish. It is unique, and beautiful in its own rightThat said, knowing Spanish certainly helps when learning Portuguese.",
    "I developed basic conversational and writing skills in Portuguese, and learned more about the culture in Portuguese-speaking countries.",
    "This is a great course and looking forward to L2.",
    "Having known Spanish it was not as challenging to learn Portuguese because the verb and grammar structure is very similar. Because of that, the class was not as challenging as it would've been without knowing Spanish, the most challenging thing was probably that Spanish and Portuguese are so similar that sometimes when you try to speak in Portuguese you end up speaking in Spanish."

    "Strengths: Really everything. Again, there is a good balance between speaking, reading, and writing, and everyday practice is good for building skills. Assignments in and out of class are helpful, and it is overall a highly enjoyable experience.",
    "The professor is very passionate about teaching Portuguese, and provides good supplementary material in addition to the textbook, which was helpful in strengthening students' language skills.",
    "It was a good course where I felt like I learned a lot about Portuguese and Brazil and improved my Portuguese greatly."

    "100%! I would recommend Portuguese to anyone who wants to learn another language. I happen to know Spanish, which helps in learning Portuguese but certainly is not necessary, as you will learn that the two are definitely not the same. In Port 110, you will learn a surprising amount of the language, and gain familiarity with the unique and vibrant culture of Brazil, as well as that of other parts of the Portuguese-speaking world. The work you do outside of class is not overwhelming in quantity, but it is very useful for building your skills.",
    "Port 110 is a great course for developing basic conversational skills. The workload is ok, and you learn a lot after one semester.",
    "yes.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes, you can learn Portuguese and learn about Brazil very well from this course.",
    "Amazing!"
