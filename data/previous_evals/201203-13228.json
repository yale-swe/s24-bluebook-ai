    "great survey of the genre.",
    "I would not take the class in its current format (lecture), but if it were ever a seminar I would be all over it. The reading is great and Prof. Guy is a special teacher.",
    "BEST ENGLISH CLASS EVER. Really, Professor Guy is a great lecturer, the TAs were awesome, and the reading list amazing. If you like sci-fi at all (and not just books - TV shows, movies, etc) - take this class. It was amazing, and I can only imagine that it will get better. Sections were awesome, because people who took the class were genuinely interested in the material, and not just taking it to fulfill major requirements.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class whether or not your like SciFi. In this course, you read all kinds of speculative fiction texts and learn about the cultural contexts in which they were written. Lecture twice a week with one section. Basically 3 papers. WR credit. Professor Guy is simply amazing. You shouldn't miss this course!",
    "Absolutely! Take this class!",
    "Definitely take it! id say credit D is no a terrible idea if youre not experienced at English course writing (im a cs major). I worked pretty hard at it and still found the grading somewhat erratic, which was frustrating.",
    "Take this class if you get a chance! The readings are great and the professor is even better! Even if you are not a science fiction fan, this is a really awesome class! You should definitely take this class because the novels and movies are fascinating (and engaging), Professor Guy is amazing, and your writing will improve!",
    "This class uses a series of science fiction texts to analyse how literature constructs human identity and how that identity changes relative to societies and cultures. The reading is a lot of fun, and it's really cool to use non-traditional texts to do this kind of analysis; there is an optional movie component that is really cool (Rocky Horror Picture Show!).",
    "Lots of reading, which I found very enjoyable, but might not appeal to you if you don't like Sci Fi. The essays were very manageable.",
    "Science Fiction is a great class to gain a broader understanding of the genre through literature and film. While the class isn't particularly hard, there is a LOT of reading and the papers have very specific requirements. It is difficult to catch up once you fall behind and it is hard to find the motivation to keep coming to lecture if you haven't read. Overall, I would recommend the course to students interested in gaining an academic perspective of science fiction.",
    "Take it!",
    "Spaceships and gender-bending.",
    "Great class if you like science fiction. Ehh class if you don't. Make sure you're as into as you think you are. Either way, Professor Guy is awesome. I wish the class was not a lecture though, and that we had more of an opportunity to interact with him. It would have been better if it stayed a seminar. LOTS of reading (I mean, a LOT), which is again OK if you like scifi, but I found myself becoming less interested in it as time went on and simply did not have time to read 400 page novels in a weekend. Also a good amount of writing (that is graded to a high standard), 4 long papers and 2 short responses.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE.Best course I've taken at Yale. I'd take it all over again. Professor Guy is the coolest guy ever, and this course completely changed the way I think about things. It's a course on scifi, which I admit I liked before hand, but you really get to appreciate just how powerful a genre it is. I honestly couldn't say enough good things about this class!One thing though- it was a lot of work. I had to work much harder because we were held to higher standards for our papers (at least compared to other Yale classes I've taken). There is also about a book a week of reading. So worth it though.",
    "English 132 is great if you aren't a huge fan of English but need an English credit. Be prepared to read a book a week however, which can be challenging to keep up on.",
    "Take it. Period.",
    "It's a lot of reading, a couple hundred pages per week, so I wouldn't recommend it unless you really love sci-fi. If you've never read it before, like myself....probably not a good idea to take the course without first reading some to get an idea. The essays are not that bad though and you get to watch some good movies.",
    "I would recommend the class if you have interest in reading science fiction. The lectures are super engaging and it's easy for a writing credit, but it's a lot of reading so if you don't like the books it's unfortunate",
    "Science Fiction is a great class - the books are fun to read, but are also complex and grapple with ideas about human nature. The course functions less as a strict literary analysis and more as a discussion of \"what it means to be human\", through the lens of the books we read (as well as a few movies, short stories, and critical essays\/texts). If you're at all interested in science fiction- probably even if you're not - I highly recommend the class.",
    "If you like scifi I would definitely take it. Also professor guy is amazing so I might recommend it regardless. It is a lot of reading though... About a book per week.",
    "It was ok. I liked most of the books, but I'm not sure I really learned a lot. Sometimes I wished I were taking a more standard literature course.",
    "Professor Guy is funny, engaging, honest, and unique. Lecture was always interesting and the reading list rocked. It's a steady stream of books, essays, and short stories, but it's not the end of the world if you don't make it through everything (although you will genuinely want to)! Papers were interesting, and Guy does a nice job of tying the course to life in general. Not an English major, haven't written about a book since high school, but I still loved it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. I (and probably most of the other students in the class) already enjoyed science fiction before coming in, but I did feel that the class gave me some new approaches and frameworks to apply to science fiction. I also really appreciated that we read some theoretical works alongside the books, which isn't always done in English classes. Lecture was very engaging, especially compared to other English lectures I've taken. Alfred Guy is great!",
    "GREAT class, great readings, great professor. Take this class! Do be waned, there are 5 papers, and essays 2-4 are rather challenging. But all in all a really fun class and not one to be missed.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. Its emphasis on writing skills is very useful to anyone, and the texts are very interesting. Professor Guy is also a great teacher.",
    "Maybe. Many of the books are excellent. Guy is a talented lecturer and allows the perfect balance of instruction, interaction, and digestion\/writing. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll learn some basic literary and philosophical ideas\u00e2\u0080\u0094post-structuralism, death of the subject, Freudian notions of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cuncanny\u00e2\u0080\u009d\u00e2\u0080\u0094but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect depth. Section was hit-or-miss; when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re shopping before sections begin, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect them to add tons to the experience. Your writing skills should improve somewhat, but I would say that you could choose better classes if that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your goal in an English class; take this if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re interested in the material, and think of it more as a Literature course. Prof. Guy subtitles the course \u00e2\u0080\u009cTechnologies of Identity\u00e2\u0080\u009d and the course engages in frequent discussion of human identity and how science fiction informs our thinking about the topic. Gender issues play a prominent role in the discussion (being the main topic for around 1\/3 of the course) and (at least) one essay was on the topic. One terrible novel on gender issues sort of soured that part of the course for me: hope that The Female Man is not on the syllabus next year. But with a long syllabus I suppose you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always enjoy them all. 2 very short assignments (300, 500 words), one at the beginning and one at the end, worth 5% each. 3 longer papers (5 pgs, 6-7 pgs, 7-8 pgs) worth a total of 80%. Weekly section worth 10%. If you can take a course with Guy at some point, I would recommend it. He is an interesting and intelligent man and being able to attend his office hours was an excellent bonus to the course.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class! It's such an interesting way to study English, and professor Guy is awesome!",
    "Class is recommended for anyone looking for a fun lecture class. Reading is fun. Professor Guy is passionate. It's an intro level class though, so sometimes material about how to write appears redundant to the perhaps more seasoned members in the room.",
    "Consider this class if you want to read excellent science fiction. The course gradually develops the concept of science fiction as an exploration of the question of what it means to be human.",
    "I would absolutely take this course. Don't be fooled - it's not a class where you write science fiction. It's a class where you study science fiction and write about it. That being said, Professor Guy is one of the greatest professors I've ever had and readings, although plentiful, are all really fun.",
    "Take this course if you like science fiction or want a fascinating introduction to the genre. The reading list is mostly very good, the expectations in terms of reading volume pretty reasonable, and the discussions and ideas presented in class very interesting. You'll come out with a greater appreciation for science fiction and the way it explains and explores our world.It is very much a writing class that aims to teach you to write well. As a senior who really just wanted to read and think about some cool books, I found the 5 essays and writing heavy focus too much for my interest.",
    "Don't be fooled - Science Fiction is a lot of work. You'll read 8 novels and a lot of short stories, and write three major papers. Alfred Guy is an absolute delight, but the TAs are a crapshoot. Bofang Li (Bo) runs a fun section butgrades pretty hard. I took it Credit\/D, and was glad I did. Shop SF and see if you like Professor Guy (you will!) and the syllabus, but if those don't interest you, it's not worth the work. If you like reading SF novels, though, you'll probably find the workload quite enjoyable!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Professor Guys is amazing and the course readings were phenomenal. The assignment due dates were a bit too close for comfort, but Professor Guy made efforts to shift the dates around. The films that we watched in class were also really great.",
    "This is a class taught by a very good professor who gets to share one of his favorite nerd specialties. It is not a blow-off class--take it if you want a legitimate writing class that lets you read science fiction for work.",
    "As far as a summary goes, it's exactly what it says on the tin. I would very definitely recommend this class--the readings are great, and Professor Guy's enthusiasm and expertise are awesome.",
    "Take it, though be warned that unless you have a strong background in literature you will probably want to take it Credit\/D. The class is a decent amount of reading and also a decent amount of writing, so it will take up a good bit of your time. That said, harsh grading and all, the class is exceptionally worth it - the books you get to read alone are worth the price of admission and Alfred Guy's lectures are amazing. The papers are thought-provoking and fun to write. Best of all, Professor Guy takes the time to get to know as much of the class as he can. If nothing else, credit\/d this wonderful class just for the pleasure of his presence.",
    "This class will change the way you think about science fiction as a genre and pleasure reading as a pursuit. Professor Guy's lectures address broad issues of SF's propensity toward tropes and why we should read as well as nitty gritty analysis of each week's novel or short stories\/movie. He made an effort to engage us in class to make up for the lecture format, which was successful and made it more worthwhile to go.Although many of us claimed to be \"taking this class for fun,\" don't expect it to be all fun and little work. The work is immensely fun, but it is a lot. Many of the senior English majors in this class claimed the 7-9 page paper analyzing 4-5 texts was one of the most challenging papers they'd ever had, though Professor Guy and the TFs provided ample assistance to those that sought it out.Don't skip the movie showings; if Rocky Horror is on the list again, you're in for a treat!",
    "I *loved* this class! True, it was a lot of reading material (particularly in the latter half of the semester), but most of it is interesting enough that it doesn't feel like work to read it, and Professor Guy's enthusiasm for the subject is infectious. If you have any interest at all in speculative fiction, you owe it to yourself to take this course!",
    "Take this class! The readings are different and interesting and Professor Guy formats the class in a way that will help you strengthen your writing.",
    "YES. The material is great. Be warned however, there is a lot more reading than you might think. Paper topics are incredibly vague and open-ended so you might have trouble with that if you appreciate more direction in that area.",
    "English 132 explores the unique ways science fiction is able to explore deeper truths about humanity.Yes I would recommend English 132 to another student. The books are all fun reads, but heavy enough to mine for analysis, and Professor Guy is amazing. His class is both entertaining and enlightening."
