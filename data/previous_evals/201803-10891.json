    "In this class, I learned how an institutional investor like Yale thinks about their investment portfolio, asset allocation, and manager selection. I learned about the different asset classes, the different issues that institutional investors might face, and the tools that institutional investors use to choose and evaluate their investments.",
    "Asset allocation and how to evaluate investment managers.",
    "This was the best course I've taken at Yale. The guest speakers were top caliber and David & Dean provided a comprehensive and detailed approach to investing across asset classes.",
    "I learned about different asset classes, investment techniques, and how to evaluate asset managers.",
    "Econ 450 offers an opportunity to learn about the core elements of any good investment as well as investment strategies in every asset class. The class also covers alignment of interests, asset allocation and ethics.",
    "Best class at Yale!",
    "Amazing class, Incredible and super interesting talks with Swensen\/Takahashi and the guest speakers, Learned about different types of investment strategies and the power of diversification",
    "I learned David and Deans investing philosophy, and gained insight into various investors strategies across a range of asset classes. I practiced writing succinct memos that evaluate an investment firms strategy and explored one topic in-depth for the final paper."

   "comments": [
    "The professors were amazing, insightful, and it was such a great experience to learn about this topic from the experts in the field. In addition, the exercises and the manager visits were so interesting and exciting! No weaknesses that I can think of. It was definitely a lot of work (six analytical papers, two presentations that required preparation) but I learned so much from the assignments.",
    "The teaching in this course is superb - it would be hard to see how that could be improved. In terms of logistics, the instructors could consider moving the student presentations to an earlier point in the semester.",
    "There are many strengths, such as guest speakers, interactive activities and presentations, well-planned lectures, and responsible TA. Best course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Amazing class!",
    "Best class at Yale!",
    "Great class, The guest speakers were super interesting and learned a lot from them, Maybe could have gotten more guidance\/office hours for the final paper, Otherwise great class",
    "The course is well taught, the guest speakers are extremely knowledgeable and interesting, and the five short papers give students a chance to practice writing concisely to evaluate an investment strategy. An in-class debate and student presentations were both interesting and good learning experiences. No weaknesses to speak of."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely - if you get in, you should not think twice about taking this class! Learning from David Swensen and Dean Takahashi is such an incredible experience and I learned so much from the assignments, classes, guest presenters, and in-class exercises.",
    "Yes, if you get into the class, you should definitely take it.",
    "Certainly - if you can take this course, for the love of God please do",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, even if you have never taken an economics course before. The level of engagement from Dean and David and the guest speakers is amazingly high, and it is surprising how much insights they are willing to share about investment and the Endowment. It is a great course to learn about investment and to learn from gurus of the investment world.",
    "You should 100 percent take this class. It is an incredible opportunity to learn about the core elements of any good investment from David and Dean, two leaders in the endowment industry. You get to learn about investment strategies from premier investment managers in different asset classes. Overall the workload is super manageable: 2 page report (around every other week) discussing strategies for every visiting manager, a final paper and a presentation. Definitely take it! You will enjoy the discussions in this seminar and getting to be taught by David and Dean!",
    "Best class at Yale! If you can take it, do take it. It's very difficult to get into and even harder to do well.",
    "Yes. David and Dean are amazing professors and we had interesting talks during class, The guest speakers were all incredible and learned a lot from them",
    "Absolutely. The discussions are very interesting, the students are committed, and its a special opportunity to learn from David and Dean and the speakers who visit. Apply even if you dont know anything about investingthis class is the best place to start. Youll learn a ton if you put in the work.",
    "100 percent. This was the most engaging course I have taken at Yale so far. It was unlike any other course, in that we had unique exposure to managers of the endowment which allowed for close engagement with different vehicles of investment analysis. I felt that David and Dean were deeply involved in our progress, and learnt a lot from the students around me as well."
