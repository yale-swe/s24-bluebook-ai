    "great course. take it with Schultheiss. hes really nice, understanding, and approachable. he'll definitely help you if you dont understand a concept, so make use of his office hours!!!",
    "Schultheiss is a solid teacher. He's done this for years and knows what he's doing.Take it with a friend for psets",
    "It's a basic introductory course to Linear Algebra. It's pretty easy, but the book is absolute garbage. The book's author, Strang, actually gave a bunch of Linear Algebra lectures you can find on MIT's OpenCourseWare, and he's a great lecturer, but the book just presents everything in the wrong order and rarely offers examples.",
    "This class is great for establishing a good understanding of linear algebra.",
    "Lecture isn't very helpful (the professor has poor handwriting, and sometimes it isn't clear why one step leads to another). But the material can be learned from other sources, such as the textbook or YouTube.",
    "Schultheiss is a darling old man who has been teaching this course the exact same way for about 60 years. His office hours were not very flexible (and not very helpful, either). The TFs played hooky from their discussion sections and Schultheiss did nothing to stop it.",
    "Typical math class; homework assigned during each class and self-building",
    "Great class which provides the basis for a lot of other math classes. The material isn't extremely difficult but it's definitely useful if you plan on going into math or science.",
    "When I first came in I figured this class was gonna be a joke. But we actually covered a lot of material I wasn't expecting: Fourier Series, Hermitian Matrices, Jordan Form, Markov processes etc. The beginning part moves slowly, but don't let it lull you into a sense of security, the second half has some tricky material in it. That said, pretty good, informative class. Schultheiss is alright in lecture, ut I moslty learned from the book",
    "Although it wasn't the best of courses, it's not very hard and is also cool material. But I think in order to get a really good grade you have to take a lot of the learning into your own hands and go get a tutor. With a tutor, the class is fun and interesting. The problem sets are broken up into smaller sets due every day in class, which makes the work a lot easier. Overall, I really enjoyed this class!",
    "This class had awful lectures, which a lot of people didn't attend. The professor didn't give you time to both copy down what he was writing and understand the concept. I had to go online to the MIT website and watch a lot of the videos, which communicated the material much more clearly. During lecture the professor goes for rigorous proofs over intuitive understanding, but as a first course in linear algebra, I think the intuition should have been emphasized more. Some problem sets still have not been returned. The redeeming quality of the class is that once I understood the course content, I thought the concepts were actually pretty cool and useful practically if you're going into a math-related field. Also the professor was clearly brilliant and enthusiastic about the subject, and had lots of office hours. Unfortunately, I think linear algebra just comes so naturally to him that he just doesn't know what it's like to not understand the concepts. Also, he doesn't really reply to email. After taking this class, I've learned how to teach myself.",
    "Complicated topics, confusing class, but easy exams.",
    "Take it if you must, don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "If you need it, take it with Schultheiss. It's not bad. P-sets are usually fairly simple and short, and they're assigned every class but it makes sure you're on top of things.",
    "It's not a class that's easy to get passionate about, but for the most part it was a pleasant experience. I definitely put a lot of work in to studying, but it all paid off.",
    "222 is a decent amount of work (small problemsets due every day of class) but overall the material isn't that bad. The book we used is kind of confusing, but once you get the basics down it makes much more sense and seems very clear.",
    "I genuinely enjoyed linear algebra w\/ professor schultheiss. The material is interesting and there is a bunch of enjoyable problem solving. At the same time, the class could have been better about conceptual explanation and applications. If you need this for your major definitely take it with Schultheiss, and even if you don't need the class I would still recommend shopping it. The workload is pretty good and the tests are extremely fair.",
    "Linear algebra definitely isn't too difficult, and the exams were fairly straightforward. You are allowed to bring 1 page of notes to the midterms (and 2 to the final), which really brought the stress level down. I would recommend this course, but the lectures are monotonous and it is sometimes easy to stop paying attention in class. The workload isn't too bad (1 problem set assigned per class, but they are short ones) and they are due a week after they are assigned.",
    "An average math class where the material is not hard to understand, but the lectures are difficult to follow.",
    "If you're thinking of taking it, it's probably because you need it for your major. If that is the case, don't worry, it's very painless.",
    "If you need to take Linear Algebra, take it with Schultheiss. He covers much more material and moves at a very reasonable pace. He also has a more energetic teaching style. The topics are applicable for many math and science classes, and I found it a useful and rewarding course. Also good to know: The tests are usually quite easy, so most of the class does really well. Schultheiss doesn't curve tests, so what you earn numerically is the grade you keep. This is much better than the other section that was curved (cutoff for an A- was a 98 on their first test, supposedly).There are three problem sets a week, but they're short (3-4 problems) and not bad at all. This does mean you'll be working on math pretty regularly though, and can't put assignments off for a week.",
    "This is a pretty good course. Professor Schultheiss teaches it very well. Most of the time, I could follow everything he did in class, but he did sometimes say certain things which were difficult to grasp at first. Though this is linear algebra with applications, the proofs of the theorems we used were made very accessible.The book is, however, sometimes less than straightforward. Strang writes in an entertaining, sort of lighthearted tone, and he at times takes for granted the reader's understanding.The daily problem sets are pretty good at making the student keep up with the material. One can at most get three problem sets behind. They're pretty short, though, and fairly easy usually (if one pays attention in class), so knocking them all out in a single weekend isn't too bad.The first test was extremely easy. The second midterm was pretty easy. The final was easy to moderate (a sort of fun level). The notes sheets are probably unnecessary. If a person actually understands the material, he shouldn't need the notes sheets.If you pay attention and do the homework and read the book, this class will be pretty fun, instructive, and relatively easy.",
    "This was a pretty easy class but also pretty boring. Prof Shulteiss is like the nicest guy ever but not a great lecturer. The lectures are boring but most of the info is in the book.",
    "I found the class to be pretty boring, and I'm not sure how useful it is. However, it is a prerequisite for many majors, so take it if you have to. It definitely is not unbearable, and it is not overly difficult. Definitely take it with Schultheiss over Lee if you have the choice.",
    "Never take this class - it's a waste of your time.",
    "I mean, it's an important class to know to have a grasp of upper level math. I would not recommend you take it with Schultheiss unless you are good at self-teaching.",
    "Definitely take Math222. It is a fantastic way to learn linear algebra if you are on track for applied science or engineering. The workload is manageable but you learn a lot. Great math experience.",
    "Unless you need to take this class for your major do not take it. It says its not proof based, but thats not really true. There are problem sets due every class which seems like a good idea at first but gets annoying after a while. There is no curve whatsoever which makes the class all the more stressful. The other section works the same way so unless you need linear algebra, do not bother taking it.",
    "If you want to take linear algebra, make sure you take it with Professor Schultheiss. The class is interesting and you will learn way more if you take it with Schultheiss than any other professor. I highly recommend it if you enjoy math.",
    "To be honest, I never went to class. However, Schultheiss seemed like a very jovial and enthusiastic professor, and the course material was a decent survey of linear algebra topics.",
    "It is not an extremely hard course but I think that it not the most well taught class. Be careful who you take it with! Also, I think that looking at other resources like the MIT Open classes will be helpful. Also, a pset every class gets tiresome although it does most definitely help you keep abreast of the material in class.",
    "Take this class over the other Linear Algebra class. You will learn more and it will not be as boring.",
    "Be prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material (the Strang lectures on MIT courseware are particularly helpful). Although there are three problem sets per week, they are not due until a week after they are assigned so it is hard to stay on top of the current material, which makes the lectures even harder to follow. Regardless, I would recommend this course to a student interested in math, or physics, because linear algebra is a quintessential subject that appears in many other places!",
    "Prof. Schultheiss covered way more material than the other class, and I definitely learned a lot. That said, his lectures are pretty dull and I rarely went to class. Psets due three times a week get to be kind of annoying (though it was probably helpful in learning the material).",
    "I would recommend taking this class over the other section taught by the other professor for this class because in the end you will learn so much more. The material covered in the other class is literally (not joking) 1\/3 of the material in our class. There is a lot of math in this class obviously, so take this class only if you are interested in this field.",
    "The material seemed fairly relevant to math and science, and Schultheiss is certainly better than any other linear algebra professor at Yale, from what I've heard. However, be prepared to work with the worst textbook you will ever use in your life. Strang is a useless piece of garbage. It's poorly organized and horribly articulated. The three problem sets a week are, while pretty manageable, kind of a nuisance.",
    "Math 222 is very different then calculus classes and math learned in other classes is not useful in helping you to learn linear algebra. It is a completely different course than calculus. That being said I would not recommend taking this class. Neither teacher is very good but if you had to pick I would pick Schultheiss because he's a better teacher but the book that he wants you to buy is terrible. If you plan on just teaching the class to yourself, I would recommend the other class.",
    "This is basically your standard Linear Algebra course. If you need Linear Algebra, then I would recommend this class. It is helpful that there are 3 problem sets a week (with 3-4 questions on each) because it keeps you up with the material. However, the tests got progressively harder. Also, a lot of time in class is spent on proofs which is somewhat discouraging, and the problem sets were only returned sporadically, and sometimes not at all.",
    "Tests are harder and more proof-based than expected. Dry lectures and too many proofs that feel unnecessary. I learned more from the Strang lectures on MIT opencourseware than from Schultheiss.",
    "Lots of problem sets with very little application or ultimate payoff.",
    "Many people take this large math class because they have to. If you're like me and you don't have to, you should probably have a genuine interest in math if you decide to take this class. Anyone taking Math 22, especially with Schultheiss, needs to be committed to learning a large amount of it on their own. Lectures were really confusing and often overwhelming, and the book isn't a huge help. The good news is that Schultheiss, despite OVERWHELMING you with information during class, is INCREDIBLY reasonable about how much of that you actually need to know. He makes practice exams (for both midterms and the final) available, and they are very good approximations of what you'll need to know. He's also very accessible and holds a lot of office hours. One huge downside to this class was the problem sets--one due every class. I thought that that would be a good thing and that it would keep me on top of the material. NO. It's just REALLY annoying.",
    "Even though this class is named Linear Algebra with Applications, there were actually not much focus on the application side. I would recommend this course because it is necessary and important when one goes into higher math or science courses.",
    "Hey you! Listen to me! Don't take this class! You are going to shop it and think that Professor Schultheiss is cute. (He actually is). But this class turned out to be one of thebiggest mistakes of my Yale career. EVERYBODY is lost during the whole semester. There are 3 problems sets per week, which you think it is ok because they only have 3 or 4 problems. It is not ok! They are not easy and some of them involve proofs. There are no TAs and the lecture had over 100 students. Professor Schultheiss is not very good at answering questions. He thinks you know too much when you have no clue about the subject. The midterms are easy but the final is BAD! Professor made it too hard. I will probably get a C in the class though I got a A in Math 120. Take this class with another Professor. Please, do it for you! I am giving up on the Math Major because this is a hard class.",
    "This is a fairly straightforward math class, but the pace is pretty quick and you'll have to rely pretty heavily on the textbook.",
    "I would recommend Math 222, especially for science and econ students (and other quantitative sorts of people). It was the first higher-level math class I took that didn't involve a ton of calculus - it's mind-boggling. Everything you ever wanted to know about matrices. Even a bit of differential equations at the end. It's crazy how applicable this stuff is to real life (or at least to science, as Prof. Schultheiss shows), which pretty impressive for a math class.",
    "This class is not hard at all. You basically teach yourself the material because you don't learn anything in lecture. If you are thinking of taking linear algebra, take it with Schultheiss, because I hear 225 is terrible and the other section of 222 is bad. The exams are just like previous exams and are not difficult. There's a short pset due each class, which becomes tedious after a while. It was basically the only thing that kept me going to lecture - to turn in the problem set.",
    "So now that I'm done, I can look back and say that MATH 222 with Schultheiss was very helpful and thorough course. The structure is very close to that of the textbook \"Linear Algebra and its Applications\" by Gilbert Strang, and covers everything from basic multiplication to eigenvalues and eigenvectors. You'll use it later if you're doing anything remotely quantitative.The teaching is decent, and I believe, better than the other section. Otherwise, the material is gone through quickly, so one tip: do the reading assignments BEFORE class! You'll be totally lost without them.",
    "MATH 222 gives you a practical approach to Linear Algebra. The subject can be interesting, and it has many useful applications, especially in the social sciences.However, Prof. Schultheiss is simply too old to be teaching this course. I didn't understand him when he was talking, and his writing was illegible.Furthermore, the book was awful. The grammar errors made it difficult to understand, and the example problems rarely had solutions or even guidance.In order to deal with this class, I watched the lectures by Professor Strang at MIT. He wrote the textbook, so his curriculum closely followed ours; however, there were a few differences (mostly when it came to fourier series and a bit on SVD). Strang is an awful writer, but he's a gifted lecturer, and his open course on MIT's website was very helpful.",
    "I would recommend this class. We learned so much and the applications were quite interesting. I suggest getting his review notes from an upperclassman and also attending his review sessions before final\/ midterm. They summarized the entire course really well. Allowing one note sheet on the midterms was also AMAZING. It took all the pressure off memorizing things and just allowed us to focus on understanding the concepts.Great class. Take it.",
    "I thought this course was a thorough overview of the basics of Linear Algebra. Towards the end it got a little unclear what we were supposed to know for the final and what was just his interest, but all in all it was a well-structured course. Getting homework back was a bit slow (I don't think I got all of mine back), but Prof. Schultheiss is quite good and still sharp after so many years of teaching this course. Most people in the class were taking it for something else--I was just taking it for fun after a brief introduction to it in high school and had a generally good experience. Not too much work, very easy at the beginning, harder at the end, fair tests.",
    "Lin alg is certainly useful, and 222 will make you more comfortable with the material. It starts out super, super easy, and gets a bit harder. Schultheiss is very old, adorable, and hard to understand. That said, none of the material is that hard, so it's easy to find in other books\/ online references. Don't take this if you don't have to; it's not that it's a super hard class, it's just not that interesting.",
    "It is easier than Math 120 and if you have a genuine interest in what you can do with matrices, go for it. It opens up a whole new world for you if you've never been exposed to linear algebra before.",
    "MATH 222 is a good, relatively easy class on linear algebra. The lectures contain some proofs and applications (almost none of which you will be expected to remember and they won't be tested) which gives a nice and relaxed introduction to proofs. The class is extremely structured and ordered and the textbook (Strang) was very clear.You can learn as much as you want to. If you just want to learn the formulas, you'll be able to pass the simple tests. If you want to really go in depth and understand the concepts, Schultheiss' proofs and applications are pretty cool and worthwhile to go through. The professor is really good and the pace of the class is fast enough to keep it interesting but understandable.That being said, if you are a math major, check out MATH 225 (from what I've heard, it's a lot harder and proof-based.)",
    "It's not as easy as it seems. Workload is slight above average (problem sets every day of class). Midterms were deceptively easy until the final when he really ramped it up (definitely more difficult than last year's) Don't make my mistake of thinking it'd be the same standard as multivariable. Linear algebra is definitely tougher despite what the first midterm might make you think. Shop the class, if you can't follow his teaching don't take it. It didn't work for me, I sort of needed it for a req, so I had to stick with it.",
    "Take it only if you need it for a major req.",
    "Professor Schulteiss is very cute, and it is enjoyable to listen to his lectures every other day. I liked that the problem sets were broken up into a few questions every day; it helped keep us honest and keep up with the material.",
    "Good to take after 120. Be prepared to rely on those with prior linear algebra experience, or work extra hard to make up for this.",
    "Good introductory course in linear algebra. Will teach you all the fundamentals. Also, it's kind of nice to have three mini problem sets per week - I prefer several, shorter assignments as opposed to one long assignment. Schultheiss is incredibly approachable, and he is passionate and enthusiastic when it comes to teaching. The class is on the easier side, too, if you're looking for an easier class to round out your schedule - you get to bring a sheet of notes to both in-class midterms and the final exam.",
    "A solid basic intro course to linear algebra. Good for someone who's never had any exposure to it before, and the class gives you a pretty solid foundation. Good for engineers, econ, and stats people especially since you also get introduced to the applications of the concepts. Linear Algebra does take getting used to though because it's likely to be very different from anything you've done before. It was harder than I expected it to be and I spent quite a bit of time on the course. Professor Schultheiss moves fast, and you'll learn best if you keep up with the problems he assigns at the end of each class. That said, I learned a lot and the material is fairly interesting; I just don't know if I'll ever use the knowledge since I'm not intending to major in any of the above three fields. So I would take this course if you're thinking about going into something like engineering or economics or statistics. If not, you might find the course more tedious since it's harder when you don't see a purpose in what you're learning.",
    "A good survey a linear algebra from an application oriented perspective. If you're looking for a way to learn linear algebra that's not too hard and want a good professor, take it with Schultheiss.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. Seriously. It is NOT a class to take for any reason. The material is uninteresting, and doesn't even make a whole lot of sense. It's only applications (as far as I can gather) are in manual analysis of scientific data (WHY would you ever do that?!). If this material has any use whatsoever, Professor Schultheiss did not teach it to us.That said, it actually doesn't require that much work. You DEFINITELY need to learn the material before the final exam, but if you're the type of person who can teach the material to yourself (through the textbook or maybe through the online MITlectures), you will be fine. Take a look at the textbook and see if you think you'll be able to teach it to yourself, and if you can, you'll have a pretty easy time.Professor Schultheiss doesn't explain things very well, but he's old and cute, which makes it slightly enjoyable.",
    "Math 222 is not a great class. You will learn linear algebra. The tests are fair. Professor Schultheis is adorable. However, he is not a great teacher, and while the way that linear algebra enables you to deal with lots of data and large systemsof equations is pretty cool, the class is entirely computation based, which can be fairly tedious.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if they already have background in either statistics or matricies.",
    "Take this class. If you're too lost in lectures, watch the mit online lectures and get solutions of previous homework assignments which are on reserve when you prepare for midterms and the final.",
    "I would definitely recommend Math 222 to students interested in pursuing higher level math courses! It was very well taught and the practical applications make it very interesting and relatable.",
    "Math 222 follows it's description and syllabus entirely. The concepts aren't too difficult and there aren't so many proofs. So if you need to take linear algebra, take this class. The Professor's really nice (even if his handwriting can be a bit of pain) and the problem set, though numerous, aren't tough.",
    "Straight forward class. Take it if you need to. Otherwise, don't bother.",
    "Math 222 was a good class that taught all the basics of linear algebra. It teaches all of the basic topics that are necessary for an education in math or science. The professor was extremely good and very excited about math. He was always there to help his students. It was a lot of work (problem sets due every time class met- 3 times a week), but definitely worth it."
