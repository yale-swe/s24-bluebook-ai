   "comments": [
    "No, it is a TON of work, don't be fooled by the \"3 short exercise\" description.",
    "Take as a good intro course or fifth course.",
    "This class was sort of a mess, and I would not reccomend it to another student unless he\/she really wanted another sociology class to take and had a solid background in sociology. A different professor would come to talk every week or two, which meant there was no continuity or overall organization to the class. Also, we did not get a chance to properly learn the fundamentals of sociology or American society, since each professor lectured on their specific filed of concentration.There were a few good lectures and readings along the way, but overall it was a TON of reading and a lot of work for a not so fulfilling class.",
    "Yes, a good survey course of various aspects of modern sociology.",
    "No. In order for this course to be marketable, they need to TOTALLY revamp it. It should be taught by 1 lecturer - they can bring in GUEST lecturers (the experts) to give ONE lecture every so often, but this class lacks cohesion, and that TOTALLY undermined everything about it. The course material is interesting, but interesting material DESERVES a better base than this course offers (in its current, disjointed form).",
    "dont take it. boring.",
    "Contemporary American Society, as you can imagine, covers a really broad range of topics including religion, gender, race, education, and inequality in America. The readings were usually really interesting and manageable. There are 6 different professors, so sometimes the course seemed a little discontinuous, but it was a good way to get introduced to many of the sociology professors and their different areas of research. I would definitely recommend this class to someone considering sociology as a major.",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "The course provided and interesting overview, and was fun for someone who finds the subject at least mildly engaging. Yes I'd recommend it. It is not terribly taxing, and I was glad to have exposure to a number of the readings we were assigned.",
    "This class is a mixed bag. On the one hand, you get exposed to a wide variety of sources and thinkers in the field of sociology. On the other hand, the lectures vary greatly in quality and are often frustrating and hard to engage in. Patricia Maloney is a fantastic TA who made the class worth it for me. The work is not that difficult, although if you don't do the reading the course can be almost impossible to find exciting. Overall, this is not the perfect introductory class, although there are some good qualities.",
    "If offered again, this course would be strikingly different as you wouldn't have the TA (she's done with TAing), Professor Mayer wouldn't be organizing it (he's left to be the director of science in Germany), and potentially, you won't be able to coordinate all of the lecturer's schedules again. Look carefully at the syllabus and ask if the final is cumulative. It's not impossible to get a good grade in the course if you work hard, but the course overall is frustrating because of the multitude of professors and the inconsistencies between them (no one knows what the other person taught). You're introduced to many distinguished members of the sociology faculty (which means it's a great intro course!), however the survey course is taught with way too much depth in some areas and students are assessed slightly unfairly."
