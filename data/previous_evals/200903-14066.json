    "This is a really interesting art history course. It covers a lot of material in a short time. It is great to get an non-western perspective of art.",
    "The class is a survey of Islamic art from the 1300's to the modern day, although you sort of skip over most of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. I'd recommend the class to people interested in non-western art.",
    "It's a good course, if you're interested in the material. The artwork is GORGEOUS, sometimes totally startling. Take it if you want to learn!"
