   "comments": [
    "Great way to get a ROW\/pre-industrial in an enjoyable and laid back class. There was no section and the grading policy is very favorable.",
    "This class is very interesting, people should learn more about the middle ages. I high;y recommend this class. Just two midterms and a 12 page paper, no final, no section. Readings are interesting but essentially optional; they are not necessary for the tests and are not used in the paper.",
    "It is very easy to do well in this class. If you go to lecture and study a bit before the tests you will do well even if you don't touch the readings. The people who did poorly actively did nothing. That said, this class wasn't particularly great. The material before the first test was reasonably interesting but after that, the class devolved into vague ramblings\/rants for the rest of the semester. If you are looking for essentially a gut, I'd recommend it. Otherwise no.",
    "This course has a reputation as a gut, and it is pretty easy and not too heavy on the workload, but I also thought the material was really interesting and very well taught. It was the first class I've taken at Yale that actually forced me to think critically about the primary sources (Prof. Marcus stresses primary texts) and not rely solely on scholarly interpretations of history. If you have any interest in Jewish history or in Jewish-Muslim relations, take it. If not, then you won't enjoy it too much.",
    "The material isn't very interesting, but most everything else about the class is great.",
    "Yes",
    "This class is great. The entire grade is based on a midterm, a final (taken before finals though), and a paper. Of those three, whichever is your lowest gets raised by a full letter grade. The material on the two tests come solely from class lecture, so all of the reading is totally optional. All you really need to do is come to class and you'll get at least an A-.",
    "Take this class if you need a ROW credit for history. It's two midterms, a 12 page paper and they're all worth the same and he also raises you're lowest grade a full letter grade. No need to do the reading at all, just go to every class and take good notes and as long as you get at least a B on the tests, you'll probably get an A- or A in the class.",
    "Yes",
    "This class was interesting, decently taught, and very forgivingly graded. I learned some cool things, but am still fuzzy on a lot of important details. I probably would have learned much more if the grading had been not quite so forgiving; on the other hand, I might not have taken it if it had been actually hard. These are the paradoxes of picking up the last non-western credit (and be warned, a good 2\/3 of the class is there for that purpose)."
