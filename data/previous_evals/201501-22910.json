    "I would not recommend any class from Fresen to another student. It's not that they're difficult - in fact they're very little work - it's that he doesn't care about his teaching and you probably will only learn what you teach yourself.",
    "Functional analysis is a lovely payoff to measure theory with some important results. Indeed, I would generically encourage those interested to skip measure theory and take functional instead, as 305 measure theory is absolutely more than enough for most conceivable forms of 325. It is likely you will not take this course with Dan Fresen, so there's not much more that'd be helpful for me to say.",
    "Math 325 covers great material, but definitely make sure to talk to the professor and shop the class before you commit to it. Professor Fresen will be leaving this year, so you will probably have a better experience. The only work I did for the class was one homework (which was never graded) and learning the material myself before exams, where I would copy proofs that I had memorized. I have never given - and hope to never again give - a class such a poor review."
