    "This is really a fun class and QFT is just beautiful. Even though students may not use QFT for their research, not taking class implies that you will graduate with missing some fun parts of physics.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student- if taught by Tom.",
    "This is the first course in quantum field theory which introduces the basic ideas of the subject. It is something every student working in the particle physics should take. Also, every theorist.",
    "I would recommend this to anyone studying theoretical or experimental particle theory because it gives a good foundation to understanding the problems studied in this field.",
    "Yes, Prof. Appelquist was a pleasure to listen to.",
    "This course was largely a derivation of QFT. Every student should take it in order to understand where the formalism comes from."

    "This is the first course in the quantum field theory so it is more or less required for anyone who wants to do physics.",
    "It was important to know for my research.",
    "An understanding of quantum field theory will be essential for my research."
