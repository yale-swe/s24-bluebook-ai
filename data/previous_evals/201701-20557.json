   "comments": [
    "During colloquium I learned a ton! I developed the skill of listening to my peers and helping them guide and edit their research. I practiced the skill of planning. To write a thesis with the assistance of an advisor, one must hone the skill of maintaining contact and meetings independent of any schedule. The skill of presentation was needed at the end of the semester during the final weeks of classes. During the presentation, one learns how to clearly and concisely provide information about a year's worth of work. And due to the anthropological and ethnographic nature of my paper, I got to harness the skill of interviewing.",
    "I gained insight on conducting a literature review, as well as using the results of my project to make some policy suggestions. I also learned about other fields in Environmental Studies through the theses of my peers.",
    "EVST Senior Colloquium is incredible! It was the perfect conclusion to my liberal arts education at Yale. It reinforced all of the material I had learned in my previous three years and thought me how to conduct a long term and research project. I learned the importance of time management and planning, communicating with advisors, as well as thinking critically to craft new and detailed arguments.",
    "I wrote a year-long senior thesis and this class helped facilitate that process.",
    "The second semester of colloquium was more focused on editing and career advice, which I appreciated! I learned good strategies for pursuing a career after college and got to hear some interesting speakers.",
    "An incredibly valuable course for structuring the thesis process, as well as providing students with helpful tools, writing advice, critique, and group interaction.",
    "This course taught me how to conduct original research and turn it into a long-form thesis essay. It helped keep me on track to finish the senior essay by early april through staggered deadlines. I found the advising very helpful as well as the different workshops we attended.",
    "This course sequence offers an incredible opportunity for significant independent research in a collaborative environment that benefits hugely from from the attention of the EVST faculty. Whatever the area of the individual's research focus, the course offers incredible learning in completing an independent project, developing effective evidence, and communicating effectively in writing.",
    "The Senior Research project was the most fulfilling part of Yale. It allowed for an exercise in skills of in-depth exploration of a specific topic.",
    "This course guided me through writing a massive research paper, from coming up with a research question, to conducting research, refining my question, and through the actual writing process.",
    "I wrote a thesis, which was really fulfilling personally. Through that process, I learned a lot about time management, research skills, and writing."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Unlike many other college majors, EVST has this colloquium in place to ensure you stay on track with your thesis. It's truly a godsend. Though at times the process of writing a thesis feels frustrating, the support of your peers, their editing advice and guidance boosts ones confidence and maintains momentum. Having this course in place is a true strength. EVST becomes a family by the end of the year.",
    "With the high number of B.S. students coming into the EVST major, I would recommend that essay-writing guidance be adapted to also fit more science-focused projects. Scientific papers are typically much shorter (a few pages) and don't range too far from a direct discussion of the results. I do appreciate that I was pushed into writing a longer essay and make more policy suggestions. While it was unusual, I feel that I learned from it. Still, in retrospect, I wish I had written sections of my essay in a different sequence. First, I think students should commit to having their results. Then, they should write the results and discussion section. The introduction, or literature review, should be written afterward. I understand that prior to conducting one's project, one should be familiar with the literature. However, the background is written for the benefit for the reader. As such, I think one should develop the conclusions of the essay before writing the background that leads up to them. In the first semester, I struggled with writing my introduction and felt it was unfocused. At the start of the second semester I finished analyzing my results and wrote my discussion, which I am much happier with. I edited my introduction to try to fix it, but I think it needed to be rewritten from scratch after I solidified my conclusions.",
    "The course is helpful in providing guidance throughout the senior thesis process. It could have perhaps met less frequently, but overall I thought it was beneficial. The student-teacher ratio is really great.",
    "The EVST faculty and support are wonderful.",
    "I like colloquium as is! Maybe we could have had a bit more group work with our thesis drafts, but in general, I thought we had a good amount of feedback and it was a great structure.",
    "Incredibly helpful - every major should have this",
    "The course is very structured which forces you to keep on top of your work, however some of the assignments at the beginning are not very helpful. The small group setting is also helpful.",
    "This seems to be one of the best set-ups for a department's senior essay that I know of. You are able to write about pretty much whatever you want, but there is still a ton of guidance and support. We became really close as a colloquium class and I definitely bonded with the other seniors in my major! Only weakness would be that it might have been nice to learn some of the research skills before the summer in which a lot of us did our field work.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is the allocation of time to small group meetings. Feedback from faculty and peers in that intimate space was especially useful throughout the project. The emphasis on writing quality stood out as much as the research process in this latter half of the year, and it helped ensure a high quality final product.",
    "HAving a small colloquium was supremely helpful in sticking to deadlines.",
    "Keep groups small! The large group meetings were much less helpful than than the one-on-ones or the smaller groups.",
    "This course was hugely helpful for me in keeping me on track in writing the thesis - having intermittent deadlines made it so that I wasn't stuck doing all of the work last minute. I also appreciated the small group meetings for workshopping different parts. While the visiting speakers were interesting, there were some weeks close to deadlines that it would have been helpful to have more time specifically designated to the thesis.",
    "I think the colloquium does a great job of forcing us to be working on our theses and making progress week to week. However, I would have liked there to have been more of a focus on peer editing. It seemed like not all the students took giving feedback seriously, and I think our time would have been better spent if people put effort into peer edits and feedback."

   "comments": [
    "Obviously, this course is mandatory. It was an extremely helpful way to stay on top of one's thesis. It would have been much harder to break down thesis writing into manageable chunks without this course.",
    "Absolutely! EVST Senior Colloquium was my favorite class at Yale. I would highly recommend taking the full year course even if you are a double major and have the option to write a one semester thesis. The full year experience is incredible and you will be proud of the quality of work generated after a full year of research and writing.",
    "Yes, it is mandatory.",
    "Yes, absolutely!",
    "This is a requirement for EVST, but I think it's a great part of the major.",
    "You have to take it for the Major, but trust me you want to take it. This class further confirmed my love of environmental studies. I benefitted greatly from exploring a topic of my choice in intense depth, as well as learning about other evst topics from fellow students.",
    "You have to take this if you are an EVST senior. So yes if that is you haha.",
    "For those undecided on a major, the EVST senior colloquium is one of the strongest selling points of the program. You will have the opportunity to work closely with faculty and peers to make sure that your research process is moving forward in a meaningful way that is likely to set you up for success. Few other majors emphasize such a collaborative environment and make so many resources available, most notably the resources of faculty time.",
    "Well you have to take this course, but it will be one of the most satisfying things you do at Yale.",
    "Even though this course is required, I'm so grateful for its existence. Watching my friends in other majors struggle through their theses with little guidance only made this more true. Sara was absolutely amazing as both an adviser and support system.",
    "You have to write a thesis!"
