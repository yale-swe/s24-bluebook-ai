    "Definitely. If you have room in your course schedule junior or senior year, I definitely recommend it.",
    "Awesome class. No lectures, no note-taking, just coming into lab to memorize different parts of the bones 2x a week. 4 non-cumulative PRACTICAL tests, no papers, no homework. Make sure you know your stuff for the tests! They're not a cake-walk, and if you're not prepared for them it can be very stressful. The tests are set up with pieces of bone at different stations, usually 2 questions per station, and you have a minute to identify the part, the muscle attached to it, etc. I would definitely recommend the class, but the class is capped at 25 students or so because the lab room is so small. If you can get a spot, take it! The class is a high level course, but it ended up being my easiest class\/least amount of stress.",
    "This is probably the best class that I have taken at Yale. Definitely a gem and if you are a PreMed this is right up your alley. There's no other undergrad course that is as cool as this one.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale. It was fun, interesting, and so relaxed. It never added to my stress load and the exercise of simply naming things was actually relaxing. Definitely take this! You won't regret it. Besides, the take-home skeleton was just fun!",
    "This class is a very cool introduction to the human skeleton. As someone who didn't know anything at all about the different bones and muscles in the body, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about them. Studying for the tests may take some time, but with lab time and some hard work, there is no reason why you should not enjoy and do well in the class. I highly recommend it!",
    "Go to class, look at bones for 75 minutes.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Great for anyone regardless of major. There is minimal work, class is so fun, and assessments are extremely straight-forward. You may not be able to get in if you're a sophomore or freshman, but it's definitely worth showing up during shopping period. This was one of my favorite class at Yale!",
    "Chill class with a chill professor. There are only a few lectures given during the entire semester. The vast majority of the class time is spent looking at real human bones and learning their features in a self-guided manner. You also learn how to determine ancestry and sex. The tests pretty much test memorization of features, but you're given enough time with the bones and we're given a disarticulated skeleton to study with at home. Definitely take if you have any interest in human anatomy.",
    "A pretty good course - gives you a real appreciation for our skeletons. However, there is a lot of rote memorization which can get boring after a while.",
    "It's memorization and tactile handling. If that's your jam, it's the best class ever.",
    "Touch real bones, work at your own pace. Loved it.",
    "Great social science class. It's pretty neat to learn about all the bones and features in the body. I would recommend this class to anyway, both medical majors and otherwise.",
    "Definitely take it. A lot of memorizing but well worth it. Sargis is great and the material is interesting to learn.",
    "Human Osteology is a hands-on class where you basically look at real human bone specimens all day in order to identify their features and learn more about the individuals they came from. No prior knowledge of osteology is needed; the course is divided into four segments corresponding to two quizzes and two tests (no final), which are essentially practical exams requiring you to identify a part of a bone, which side of the body it'd be on, and its muscle attachments, and you can do most of your studying in class with real specimens before going home to use the plastic skeleton they let you borrow. Professor Sargis is also amazing and really knowledgeable and will make sure you have the answers you need. Going to class was honestly sometimes the highlight of my day -- this has literally been the only class I've had where every day the first time I look at the clock it's already almost time to leave. If you have the chance to take this class (although it's nearly impossible if you're not an upperclassman), you definitely should!",
    "This is truly a fantastic course, one of the many hidden gems at Yale. Don't miss it if you can get in! Prof. Sargis is wonderfully helpful and always ready to explain the trickier bits in greater detail. Also a very nice and personable man."
