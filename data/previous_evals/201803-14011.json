    "This class taught me five different techniques to creative nonfiction writing through each of the five essays in the course. Through class discussions, I learned how to think about a text and dissect it for it's literary value as well as content. English 120 breaks you out of your shell of the standard 5-paragraph essay. Although the majority of the writing you may do in other classes will be heavily research-oriented and academic, the idea of constructing a narrative about whatever topic you are writing on, even if it's academic, applies everywhere. You learn how to take any topic and make it interesting, engaging, and have a deeper meaning to your targeted audience.",
    "I learned how to write coherently....a little bit?",
    "I saw great improvement in my writing by taking the class. I began to think about writing with an audience in mind and ways to keep them engaged. In order to do this I improved my concision as well as using other techniques learned in the course. It also has improved my analysis of reading others work.",
    "I learned how to express my voice and tone in my writing. Also, I learned how to write an academic research paper.",
    "In English 120 I learned how to write engaging, necessary essays and how to enjoy writing them. I learned how to edit with more precision and deliberation than I had ever committed myself to before taking English 120. But beyond that, I learned how to support my peers and help them hone their craft through workshops and in class discussion.",
    "Improved greatly on my writing skills and this course really helped me prepare myself for writing up to take standards.",
    "I learned a lot about essay structuring, and how to make my writing clear, effective, and engaging, feed back on others', participate in lively conversation about creative nonfiction, and read with a critical eye, building on past skills that I had acquired in high school.",
    "Thinking from a writer's point of view. The skills of reading essays for crafts. Applying the techniques to our own essay, and learned about our strengths and weaknesses through feedbacks."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think that to keep us prepared for class discussions, we could do more brief responses, or be assigned to email\/submit a few literary devices we noticed in the pieces we read for each class. I would also have liked some more focus in class discussions; while they were very entertaining and generally on topic, they were sometimes dominated by only one voice or targeting other people in the class, and the instructor could have done more to guide and redirect conversation when necessary.",
    "Discussion wasn't that engaging or profound, and I wish that we could have talked about more things instead of running in circles around a small number of topics.",
    "Strengths- There is a good classroom environment to discuss ideas about pieces of writing which really encourages interest. -Reading other students and authors writing was great for learning new ideas to incorporate into my own writing. Weaknesses- Readings can take quite a long time and they need to be done in detail, however most of these are relatively interesting.",
    "Overall, the interaction and feedback is the best aspect of this course. That said, the interaction between peers can be improved upon.",
    "The strengths and weaknesses of English 120 are related in that it allows you to have a lot of independence in your writing, but if you do not take the task seriously, you will not get a lot out of it. The essays we were assigned to read were really great, and I they directly contributed to my writing's improvement.",
    "The course was strong in rigorous focus on improving one's writing, and focusing on personal strengths and weaknesses. It could be improved by optimising the syllabus so we have time to fully discuss all the texts, instead of only having a few that we peripherally touched on.",
    "Overall it's a really great course. The only thing I can think of is to have the concepts taught in class gathered on a few pages of lecture note."

    "I would recommend this course. I took it for my last writing credit and it was definitely a different perspective being in a room full of first-years and sophomores. I feel like I would have been more focused on it had I done it earlier in my Yale career, but with other challenging courses, it was hard to invest more than what was necessary like I did in English 114 freshman fall. I think that this is a fantastic course for anyone's second writing credit, but English 114 is an even better course to teach you the academic writing you need to do for the rest of your time in college. However, the things you learn about creative writing will make you a better writer even in research writing for example, and therefore everyone should take this class at some point in his or her time at Yale. Be prepared to not only write first drafts, but often rewrite\/restructure your essay entirely for second drafts though.",
    "This course is highly teacher-dependent, but if you have Professor Baynes-Ross, I'd recommend it for someone who is looking to read a good number of essays and generally have a good time.",
    "Yes definitely, it gave me a greater interest in writing and will have helped my writing for other subjects.",
    "Yes! Professor Baynes-Ross is an excellent instructor who really helps you develop as a writer.",
    "I would recommend that everyone take English 120 if not to learn how to write many different types of argumentative essays, to have a quintessential Yale experience. It is a rare opportunity to hear what your peers are thinking about on a biweekly basis and to engage in their ideas as both a personal and academic pursuit. An English 120 class becomes a community because of the intimacies of writing these essays.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. It was very engaging and I enjoyed that we get to read professional essays as well as read and review peer work.",
    "Absolutely, it's a great (if sometimes frustrating) introduction to creative nonfiction, and writing more generally, and I could tangibly measure my improvement from the start of the course to the end. Our class became close and supportive, and it was a great environment to be in.",
    "Yes, I would. Even if you are not aspiring to be a writer or doing an English major, this is still a great course to take. I not only learned about writing but started to apply the skills learned to other academic areas and other aspects of my life. The skills learned is very transferrable."
