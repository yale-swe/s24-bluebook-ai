    "HSAR 252 is an overview of Roman architecture from the beginnings of the Empire to the time of Constantine. It mostly focuses on Rome (and rightfully so), though there are a few excursions to the provinces later in the course. Kleiner is an engaging lecturer, though she tends to run long. If you're thinking about taking the course, do it. The work load is very manageable, and for the most part the readings are interesting, and add to the lectures. The online postings for section can be a bother to keep up with, though.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class. Even though it can be difficult to get up for the 9am lectures they are certainly worth it. Professor Kleiner is very engaging and nice. There are only two exams that are very easy if you put the time into memorizing the material.",
    "If you do not want to do a lot of homework outside of the classroom, then this is the course for you. It's a minimal workload, with two exams and a paper of 8 pages. That being said, studying for the exams takes a LOT of time, and students should definitely start using the online flashcards early. Though you don't necessarily need to do the readings, there is a lot of information. However, if you take good notes and study hard, you will have no problems with this class.",
    "Yes!",
    "great class!",
    "Good credit\/d class. Watch the lectures on Open Yale Courses.",
    "If you have the slightest interest in any of the following: the Romans (who are supremely badass), finding out where and how most of Western cultural and architectural traditions originated, understanding both modern and ancient buildings, appreciating beautiful works of art and architecture, or enhancing your appreciation of Yale's campus and architecture around the world, then you have to take this course. It might seem like a niche subject (and ok it is), but as a non-classics, non-art history, non-history major, I can say with confidence that this is the best class I ever took at Yale. Professor Kleiner is AWESOME (she's funny, she deeply cares about the subject and about her students, and she spends about 5-10 minutes each class recommending gelaterias and restaurants in Italy). The material is also fascinating and has really enriched my life and my appreciation of architecture as an art form. We also learn cool things like how the first ever indoor shopping mall and the first ever stone athletic stadium were built. The course also is basically zero work for most of the term (the readings are supplementary and do not show up on the exams) save for one (fun) paper and two exams. The exams require TONS of memorization, but they are fair and you will do fine if you plan ahead. Again, I cannot recommend this course more strongly. Not only am I now fully equipped to impress people at cocktail parties, I have developed and deep love for Roman history and for studying architecture as an art form and as a symbol of politics and culture. Take it, and make sure you engage with (and wake up for) every lecture to ensure a meaningful experience in the course.",
    "WORST CLASS I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE. DO NOT TAKE IT. I have taken many ancient history courses and history of art classes, and this was by far the worst. If you like extremely dry boring lectures and memorizing over 200 images for each midterm this is the class for you. If not save yourself and don't do it.",
    "Prof Kleiner is amazing and makes the class worthwhile. The topic could be pretty dull but she makes it relevant and engaging. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Great class! Took it crd to avoid memorizing nitpicky dates. The design your own city final project is fun for those with a creative bent (though a traditional paper option is still available).",
    "I would recommend this class if you like architecture or if you like studying Roman buildings. If you don't like history, don't take the class.",
    "Roman architecture is a WONDERFUL class. As a Classics major, I came into this class loving Rome--but I love Rome even more now. Each lecture is like a movie, and Professor Kleiner does a great job of making each class interesting and exciting. The class really has very little work; if you go to class and take good notes, the reading isn't even essential. Plus, it was so fun to design my own Roman city! Take this class!!",
    "Take it! You even learn some ancient Roman history along the way.",
    "Great class. Truly an enjoyable lecture if you like looking at pretty pictures of Roman buildings.",
    "Definitely take it especially to get a taste of art history while in college.",
    "If you're interest in historical architecture - take it, otherwise its not needed.",
    "Yes! I would highly recommend it. It is a very interesting class and the buildings and topics we discuss are great!",
    "Definitely would recommend",
    "Absolutely - this course is very well taught, straightforward, and well structured. It is accessible to everyone (I'm a bio major myself and I thoroughly enjoyed it). You learn SO MUCH just by going to lecture and even though the courses are on OpenYale Courses online, Professor Kleiner makes attending class early in the morning fun and enjoyable. The \"Design your own City\" project was challenging but really fun - I'd never drawn any architectural plans beforehand but quickly learned for my project!",
    "Great course to take regardless of major! The class is extremely interesting and will change the way you look at buildings in New Haven and your hometowns. One of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Yale so far. Also, a lot of people never even went to lecture - the sections are online through a forum and every lecture is posted on the web.",
    "This class was hard -- I don't know anyone who was pleased with his or her grade at the end of the semester. I took this class Cr\/D, as I'm not an art history person at all and it was still a nightmare. The midterms, although non cumulative, covered an obscene amount of material. We had to know over 150 buildings\/monuments for each test and be able to identify\/describe them (also very picky about specific dates). I worked my ass off in this class to memorize terms, IDs\/photos etc and I barely scraped by getting credit in this class.",
    "This course was fantastic! Although the amount of information could be a bit overwhelming at times, the class is like a travel guide to Italy and other places the Roman Empire touched. It causes you to look at many buildings, especially those on Yale's campus, in a completely different way. I would definitely recommend it, especially as a good class to Credit\/D if you aren't studying art.",
    "Class is filled with a lot of excessive details, many of which I found intriguing and important however I felt the grading was too \"checklist\" based where answers had to be word for word correct. As a science student who wanted to just dabble in architecture as a completely new experience, this was a bit frustrating and it sometimes hindered my enjoyment of the class. However, you learned a LOT and in the end when I look back on it, it was a helpful class that really made me appreciate the architecture that surrounds us day by day (many of which have Roman arch origins..)"
