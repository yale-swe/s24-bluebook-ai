   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't suggest that you choose this course. If you like novels, they'll be ruined for you. If you're interested in narrative, it isn't really addressed thoroughly. Overall, I wish I'd chosen something else.",
    "Definitely take a look into it if you are considering the Lit major. It is a nice intro course, not much work and nice instructors. Maxwell is also a very funny and nice guy. Sections were a lot of fun, he really pointed out some eye-opening things.",
    "Yes. I took it for the lit major requirement, but I actually enjoyed it a lot. It has some really great professors, you get to see a wide array of material, and the theme of studying narrative is pretty interesting. Weaknesses: It can be a little introductory at times, and again, unfortunately students don't always do all of the reading for seminar. Also, you really don't get enough time to spend on the things we read, but I suppose that is the trade-off for scope.",
    "In Literature 120 01 you will read a wide variety of texts in order to understand narrative in different mediums. I would definitely recommend this course to another student, because, while it is very general, it is a great way to improve your writing and to learn about narrative in many different types of works.",
    "Well, if you're a Lit Major, you need to take it, so oh well. But if not-the reading can seem a little heavy at times, but there are only three papers spread out very evenly over the semester, and no final, and good books, so if you're looking for a writing credit, take it!",
    "AWESOME CLASS--TAKE IT",
    "Overall, this was a good course and definitely worth taking. It introduced me to a lot of great works that I otherwise would never have read. Also, you only have to write 3 papers for this class- there is no final, which was DEFINITELY a relief come reading period. However, you have to read at a pretty fast pace (the class covers a book a week) and not all of the books are interesting, but thankfully you really can get away with skipping a few. Just don't skip too many, because the essays would be pretty hard to do if you haven't read anything, and the vast majority of the assigned texts really are worth reading.",
    "Unexpectedly enjoyable. I took this course because it's a prerequisite for the literature major, but I really liked it. You read one book a week, and it's usually a pretty good one at that, attend a lecture by a professor in the Literature Department, and then go to section with one of those professors. Good structure, not too much work, interesting. I would recommend it even if you're not in the department."
