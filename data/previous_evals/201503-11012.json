    "MB&B 635 is a good course for students interested in taking a survey course on important mathematical concepts and their applications in biophysics. I would recommend the course to another student.",
    "Disorganized sampling of math-type stuffs. Homework can be annoying and confusing.",
    "Make sure that you have a pretty good calculus background before you take this class. Also, although the class says you don't need any programming background, it does help to have some. The class is organized so that there is not many lectures covering each topic, so each class moves quickly and you have to learn fast. I feel like Julien, in particular, assumes that you are quite familiar with programming and calculus.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who has prior coding experience and a mathematical background. The statistics module which is covered in this course is especially important to anyone in the sciences!",
    "The course was overall subpar, so I would not recommend it to another student for credit. Yong and Nikhils lectures were excellent, and I would advise attending them purely for the educational benefit. Unfortunately, Juliens lectures were a majority of the course material, and were deeply frustrating. His teaching is in dire need of dramatic improvement, and until his behavior changes or he is replaced, I would not recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Its a good course but not something I would ranks as really good or amazing. So if anyone's research involves mathematical modeling, I'll recommend it to them.",
    "I would say this class is good for people with good backgrounds in these subjects but want to learn about their application in a biochem field. If you have no experience at all in a subject, it will require much more work on your part to catch-up.",
    "It covers the basics of FT, linear algebra, differential equations and statistical analysis. However, if you have a strong math background, this course could be too easy for you. I would recommend this course to another student because it is important to learn math in modern-day biology."

    "Can get around matlab and fourier transforms now.",
    "I plan on joining a biochemical lab, so I don't think the material I learned here will be as helpful compared to if I was joining a biophysics lab. However, Nikhil's statistics portion is helpful for everyone.",
    "It made me think about statistical significance a lot and made me question papers I was reading at the time . I learned about how matlab can be used to solve biological questions and I will find someone in my future lab to do the coding for me.",
    "The statistics and Fourier transform lectures were helpful, but Julien's lectures were useless.",
    "I never really understood statistics s this course was really helpful for me in that respect.",
    "I did come away from the class knowing more about MATLAB, FT, and statistics."
