    "You don't learn as much as the first semester. Your experience very much depends on your Marshall Group and your topic. My topic was one of the bigger issues of the day, and thus proved exciting throughout. However, I know people in other groups had less positive experiences.",
    "Second semester of GS is much stronger than the first. Working in teams is a rare opportunity in a Yale class, and GS does it really well. I learned a TON from my marshall brief preparation, and by the end I felt like I actually really had a handle on the issue. I also bonded a lot with the other members of my team, who were awesome. It's funny, you come into GS thinking that all the other kids are d-bags, but by the end of the year you have real affection for them. I felt this especially during the simulation, which was actually a lot of fun, and again, a unique experience at Yale and beyond.",
