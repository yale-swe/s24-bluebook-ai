    "As someone who has taken classical-language courses here at Yale, I found this course to be incredibly gratifying and well-taught. First, reading both classical and modern texts with an eye to the questions of how the \"classics\" are represented is incredibly interesting, even if the texts themselves are dry every once in a while (but the vast majority of them are really interesting). There was considerable latitude in final paper topics, which made the application of the questions and methods we had picked up in the course all the more fascinating. This course I thought was really the cure to anybody who blindly worships classical texts prior to a strong understanding of what they are about. Second, Prof. Peirano is a strong, no-nonsense professor who is still incredibly approachable and friendly. She controls discussions well, often pushing poorly-forumlated answer-givers to be more clear, and she really makes a strong effort to help her students write better papers. I really learned a lot this semester, and if questions about the ways in which our culture looks at its past are interesting to you, you would like it a lot too."
