   "comments": [
    "Take it if you like logic, or if you are a philosophy major and mathy.",
    "Amazing material, amazing professor. Very very challenging, but (usually) not frustrating. Take it iff theres a logician inside you. The class is only 7 problem sets, the last few weigh more, the last one being 30% of the grade.",
    "To be honest, it was pretty hard for me. I'm not a philosophy major, and I haven't taken many logical\/quantitative-type courses in a while. I took First Order Logic and thought it was okay, so I thought this might be an adequate follow-up. MISTAKE. This was much harder! Be warned.",
    "A very unique classthe fact that the class is solely psets was an interesting change. The psets were pretty hard and grading was pretty strict, but it was pretty low stress because there weren't midterms or finals. How much you get out of he class really depends on how much you put in.",
    "It's a pretty good class. Not terribly hard, but definitely challenging. You probably don't need the book- just make sure you know someone who has one so you can get the homework questions out of it. The problem sets can take a little while to complete, and often need to be rewritten in order to be made more precise, but it's a good experience. Challenging QR",
    "Your only grades come from homework, which has its sets of merits and disadvantages. Weigh those. But I would recommend the course.",
    "I'm definitely more of a math person than a philosophy person, and I found this class very doable and interesting. I did not take the prerequisite logic class, but I definitely had a sufficient base knowledge of logic from my math classes. I enjoyed that there were no quizzes or tests - the only grades in the class are from seven problem sets (but some of these problem sets take a long time to complete - using LaTeX might be a good idea). Going to Office Hours or asking the TFs for help on difficult problems was a very useful strategy for the homeworks. Sun-Joo does a great job explaining the information and gives great handouts that are very important in doing the problem sets (so go to class!). In addition, the material was interesting - even though the last few classes did not contain information needed on any of the problem classes, everyone still went to class in order to see the exciting conclusion to our proof of the Completeness theorem, which we had been proving for the entire second half of the semester! Overall, this is a good, interesting class, especially for the mathematically-oriented.",
    "This is a hard class!!! (Except for math majors, who seem pretty well aware of what they're doing.) There are so many details you have to be careful with when doing the psets, which is where you get all the points taken off. That being said, it's still a pretty interesting continuation of PHIL 115...don't think that taking 115 will make this any easier, though.",
    "Math Logic is an extension of the \"First Order Logic\" course; whereas FOL course focussed on deducing various conclusions from various premises, Math Logic focussed on proving the completeness\/soundness the framework that is FOL. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Math\/set theory, Logic, or Semantics.",
    "Mathematical logic is a bit of a disappointment. Sun-Joo is excited about the material but that's it. Sloppy board work and hard to follow in lectures. The homework is easy enough, but it can be hard to be motivated to do it. I wouldn't take it again if I had the choice.",
    "Very interesting material especially for students interested in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of logic.",
    "Mathematical Logic was a fabulous course! I'm an anthropology student and had not taken the pre-reqs (or any math class in college, for that matter), but I really enjoyed it. It's a great chance to learn how to do basic proofs without having to do any algebra or arithmetic. The p-sets were not onerous (actually my favorite homework to do!) and TFs were always available to help in office hours. As a student not taking any other STEM courses, I got a lot out of learning to think in another way.",
    "Yes! See my responses to the other questions.",
    "Definitely recommend if you're interested in logic; the professor is absolutely great and really passionate about the topic in an infectious way, and the results we get to prove are pretty cool. Some of the homeworks can be tedious, but overall, a manageable workload. I'd recommend you go to professor Shin's office hours over the TA's, as she'll be able to explain her expectations on the homework and the nuances of the problems with much more clarity than the TA's will often be able to.",
    "Not immediately relevant to most other philosophy but potentially useful for math and comp sci majors.",
    "For a mathematical mind, most of the homework is based on syntax, that is, the visual squiggly-wigglies you draw on paper. There, the TA's become crucial, since they should (but might not) teach clearly what they demand for their grading. The workload would have been muh less if I didn't spend hours figuring out what particular notation they might expect. An online Q&A forum might help with the notational questions that arise. Professor Shin was very helpful, caring, and humorous. The structure of the class was insightful. I realized too late that the Professor's office hours should have been the way to go, instead of the unhelpful sections."
