    "Similar format to CHNS 130 without the weekly recordings... necessary if you want to continue learning Chinese.",
    "It's intermediate Chinese. You're going to have to do homework every night. If you can't do that, don't take the class.",
    "Chinese 140 is a continuation of 130. I felt that by taking 130 I got a great sense of the format of the class and was much more prepared to excel in 140. 140 has dictation exercises instead of recordings which I liked. There is also an oral skit project which is fun and not too much extra work. Still expect homework every night and tests every couple lessons.",
    "Chinese 140 is the continuation of a standard second-year Chinese class. Because Chinese is a somewhat challenging language to learn, this class is by definition somewhat challenging. There is a lot to learn in each semester, but the good news is that all of that knowledge is spread out nicely, so as long as you work a little bit every day, you'll make great cumulative leaps. I loved this class as a transition of my Chinese studies from high school into college. Take it!",
    "Chinese 140 is basically the same as Chinese 130. Unless you were having major difficulty in 130, I'd continue on with 140. The workload is not too intense, you learn many useful vocab and phrases, and Liang laoshi and Mu laoshi are both great, fun teachers.",
    "Really great course. Very straightforward and guided. Take it since the teachers are great and the work is really manageable. Made great friends in this class as well.",
    "If you have already taken Chinese 130, definitely continue on to Chinese 140. It is a seamless transition from one semester to the other, and it really feels like a unified year-long course, so it would defeat the purpose to stop halfway. Both professors are very friendly and accessible. The wonderful thing about 140 is that at this point you have developed some confidence in speaking, so class runs more smoothly and there is more chance to polish certain skills.",
    "Chinese 140 is a wonderful class. It is appropriately challenging, but the workload is only from 20 min-max an hour each night, which is really nice. It makes a nice fourth or fifth class, and you really learn a lot of Chinese coming out of it! It is the continuation of CHNS 130, with the only difference between the two being a written online dictation for homework instead of recording your voice, and a small oral memorization at the end of the semester. Liang Laoshi and Mu Laoshi are actually the best--both excellent teachers and kind, understanding friends. Take it!",
    "Chinese 140 is a lot of work and memorization, but your chinese becomes remarkably improved. I would recommend Chinese 140 to another student. The teachers and section TAs are great!",
    "Absolutely take this class if you want to learn chinese. A great continuation of Chinese 130. Your chinese continues to improve very quickly.",
    "I would recommend this course because it is challenging, but every day is fun. Since the class is so small, you become good friends with the other people in your section.",
    "Absolutely. No questions asked. Just do it.",
    "Chinese 140 is a continuation of Chinese 130. Same workload as CHNS 130, so it shouldn't be that difficult!",
    "highly recommended",
    "I would recommend L4 to a student if or he she has also done L3 because L4 is a strong continuation of L3, using the second part of the textbook. Unfortunately, both L3 and L4 both rely too much on text and too little on developing an individual's ability to string together sentences on his or her own. I would strongly suggest, if possible, for a student to do L3 and L4 through Light and skip straight to L5.",
    "I would 100% recommend this course. It maintains the same format of CHNS 130. Although this format can get a bit repetitive, it is undeniably effective. From the beginning of the year to the end of the year, my Chinese listening, speaking, reading and writing abilities have all improved immensely. Mu laoshi and Liang laoshi are very pleasant people and are very devoted to each student's improvement.",
    "Chinese 140 is a class that you have to take in order to advance to future levels, so you don't have a lot of choice in this...but given that, this class is great. The structure is identical to 130, so there will be no surprises.I love the structure and felt that I thrived in the class under that structure. Some people didn't love it.Regardless, its a class that you will need to take if you are a nonnative speaker who wants to become more fluent.",
    "Excellent. I would highly recommend this course to another student. I have learned so much over the past year (having taken CHNS 130 last semester)."
