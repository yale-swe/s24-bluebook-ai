    "I would definitely recommend the class to anyone interested in South Asian religions. It exposed to me to a wide variety of methods and scholarship that I would not have encountered otherwise.",
    "I would recommend this class to a student interested in the topic.",
    "This course is a great way to learn about ancient Gandharan art and history from a master in the field. Each class is filled with images and art theories that shed fascinating light on our knowledge of the religion, politics, and economy of this important place and time period. This class is a good fit for students interested in early Indian religions and histories and for art history students curious about this time period of great exchange among ancient Greece\/Rome, Persia, and South Asia."

   "comments": [
    "The course helped expose to methods I had never encountered before - specifically, archaeology and art history - and forced me to engage with materials related to these disciplines and incorporate them into my broader understanding of religious studies.",
    "As I study the religions of South Asia, and this class focused on such a formative time period and location for these traditions, it was absolutely essential that I gain an understanding of what was happening in Central Asia during this time period, and this course did give me a basic understanding.",
    "This course provided an extraordinary foundation in understanding early Buddhist artwork, practice, and teaching which I am confident will greatly inform all further work I do on Buddhist traditions."
