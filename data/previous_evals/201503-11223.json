   "comments": [
    "Take it! Truly an engaging and important discussion of the way media and documentary work in our society.",
    "I would definitely 100% recommend this class to a fellow student. TAKE IT! It will broaden your perspective on every medium. It will be a class you look forward to every week. The professor is incredible. The discussions are fascinating. It's amazing.",
    "There was never a moment I didn't look forward to going to class. There was never a moment I checked the time to see if class would be over soon. If you ever get a chance to take this class, especially with Jacobson, please do. It really shapes how you think about documentary work, the idea of \"truth,\" what it means to ethically represent subjects, and so many other important aspects of life. The guests are really amazing and share lots of great stuff about doing documentary work professionally. We also watched and analyzed many clips\/films\/photos together as a class, and that was really great. Assignments are small, reading is a lot but I don't think anyone did all of it, and you get to do a documentary project (interpret how you will and it can be as big or small as you like) for the final. Take it!!!!!!",
    "If Prof Jacobson and\/or Rebecca offer this course again you have to go check it out, if you are at all interested in documentary, ethics of working with people, recording stories in various formats. This was an amazing class. It related to so many things like ethnographic work, historiography, philosophy, truth, epistemology, TV, culture production and more. the readings were great. The seminar leaders were amazing and the class was such a great mix of people who had variety of interests and experience with documentary making. We had some wonderful conversations in class.This was the kind of class where you would walk in, sit next to anyone and check in with each other every week before class actually started. then once class ended we would walk in groups of 3-4 to keep talking about whatever that week's seminar was about. After all the sections were over we had a farewell lunch together. We started a class blog. I wish more classes were set up this way where people were excited and invested in the work rather than see it as a means to an end. This is the kind of intellectual experience I came to college for. Take it for great conversation please don't take it if you are the kind of person who has to impress your professor and want to rule the world post graduation... This class won't help you and you will ruin it for everyone else.",
    "Yes yes yes take this! You will learn everything about the ethics of radio, photography, and film. It got a bit wishy washy at times with everyone just debating what makes documentary work ethical, but made me think about everything (even social media, news coverage, fiction) with a totally new framework.",
    "Absolutely! Even if you are interested in one kind of documentary work, this class will broaden your understanding of kinds of documentaries and give you an appreciation for all of them. It will also provide the skills and thinking for you to make your own piece of documentary work with a lot of guidance. Really a one of a kind class!",
    "A fantastic introduction to social documentary, exploring different ways that people communicate about important social issues. Lots of reading, but fun and creative assignments. One of the best classes I've taken so far.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Jacobson is incredible, Rebecca Jacobs is incredible, the material is fascinating and it will, without a doubt, be your favorite course.",
    "If you're at all interested in art, photography, film or history, take this class. If you're not, this class is still worth looking into; the topics covered bleed into questions of morality, humanity and truth. It's the best class I've taken at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this course. It's the best and most collaborative seminar I've ever taken, and the discussions we had on the ethics, aesthetics, and practice of documentary (video, radio, and photography) were challenging and fascinating. The readings and screenings are great, and the discussion is the kind of seminar discussion you get once in four years. If you can take any class with Professor Jacobson, you should and this one is a great choice. If you're at all interested in telling the stories of other people, this is a must-take."
