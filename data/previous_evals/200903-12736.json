   "comments": [
    "The course falls in a good sequence in the curriculum, after Professor Forster's survey of Modern Architecture and after a year of experience at the School of Architecture.",
    "This course is too heavy to take first year. I think it occurs at the right time in the architecture program.",
    "It's better to be a requirement class not only for MArch1 but also post-pros.",
    "I believe that the origin and basis of architectural theory is a good subject to dive into during your first semester second year. That said, I took the second semester of theory last semester, and I would strongly discourage any student to do so.",
    "This course occurred where it seems it should have.",
    "Yes, having it here is fine.",
    "The course occurred in a proper place.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes. This course built up previous courses very well.",
    "Yes, this course occurred in proper sequence within the school's educational program.",
    "yes",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, the 3rd semester it the right time for this.",
    "This course seems to be in the appropriate part of the sequence, although could possibly be offered as part of first year.",
    "This course would be more appropriate in the first year of the program, if a way could be found to fit it there. It provides a broad foundation in the theory of the discipline, which should be given before students are asked to develop and pursue more specific interests in both electives and core courses.",
    "Yes it occured an an appropriaate time.",
    "this course was well placed.",
    "Although this course was not required by my program, I would still encourage the school to make it mandatory or strongly suggested for the Post-Pro agenda.",
    "yes.",
    "I think it is well placed in the School's program.",
    "This course should come earlier in the Core sequence. It is a shame that there is no theory course offered to first year students.",
    "yes",
    "I wish it occurred earlier, as many of the names and topics were so key to architectural discussions early on in the curriculum.",
    "I believe that this course occurred in the proper sequence but should be scheduled to allow for the possibility of taking this as part of the first year sequence. Personally, I enjoyed taking the Theory II elective earlier in the curriculum because even as an architecture major in undergrad it provided a richer foundation and new set of people and projects to consider. I would not suggest a restructuring but rather scheduling the courses to allow for this if possible. I ended up taking the courses out of sequence (Theory II before Theory I) which was not detrimental in any way."

   "question_text": "Comment on the body of material presented and the content of the course: sequence, syllabus, and assignments.",
   "comments": [
    "The course covered material from the 18th century until the 1960's. Sequencing was more or less chronological, with certain theorists grouped together who shared a common philosophy. Assignments consisted of two presentations and a final paper. The presentations were informal and generally straighforward. Papers were written on a topic of choice, and were standard term papers.",
    "The material presented is vast and intimidating. Each week is its own thorough survey of a theoretical idea or movement, and though connections and transitions are conveyed, there is simply a lot of information to process each week, which is obviously the nature of the subject matter.",
    "The lectures and readings build on appropriately on each other.",
    "Lectures were excellent. Readings were good overall.",
    "These were clear and easy to understand.",
    "This course covers a lot of material, and the content, at times is completely out of date and boring. Yet, Emmanuel did a good job of contacting the current wherever possible, and I appreciated those attempts.",
    "I thought the course was presented extremely well, and that the sequencing was fine. My only critique would be that I think that if there were more milestones for the paper instead of just a topic proposal and the final deadline, students would end up with better final products because their work would be more diffused and they would be forced to put more thought into their ideas instead of just rushing to do the final. However I thought that presenting the ideas basically chronologically and then jumping around based on the original set of theories that we discussed worked very well.",
    "We should have been able to choose which reading we used to write our final paper. Instead, we had to write about the reading we signed up to present on the first day of class. Hardly any of us were actually interested in our topics (it depended on where you happened to sit in class on that first day and which way around the circle the clipboard was passed).",
    "This class was excellent and was very well presented. Having the paper indexed to the reading presentation was a bit problematic in my case because the reading a chose were very difficult. In general i think this is a good idea, it just needs a bit more fine tuning. Also, it would be helpful if the lectures were recorded and posted online, and the presentation power points made available.",
    "The lecture - discussion format was very effective.The lectures in particular did a great job of indexing and comparing-contrasting the lines of thought we would discuss later in the day.It was very informative yet engaging.",
    "In terms of the content covered in this course and the sequence in which it was presented, I cannot suggest any improvements.",
    "I found this class very valuable, well structured and well taught.",
    "Well thought-out lectures. Appropriate subject matter and organization. Paper was of appropriate length and topic. Readings were valuable.",
    "Emmanuel clearly gave a lot of time and thought to the readings he selected, and I especially appreciate that we read only primary sources, and then used the contemporary writers (secondary sources) as supplementary material - NOT the other way around. Additionally, I hope Emmanuel knows how much we appreciate that he writes in all the names, dates, locations, book titles, etc. right in his powerpoints - you have no idea what a treat it is to not be turning to the person next to you every 10 seconds asking if he or she caught that name that was just mentioned. The lectures, both graphically and verbally, were well-orchestrated and easy to follow.Regarding the assignments, I think that the one paper was both reasonable and suitable. I would suggest that in the future, if he is going to give us that much time to submit a paper topic (which I actually don't think is necessary, and might in fact be somewhat dangerous), that he instead asks us for the first 1-3 pages of our draft. Granted, I know this is my problem, not his, but it's a lot easier than you might think to write an abstract and a bibliography without the slightest idea what you're actually writing about. I thought I had a solidified concept and I think my paper turned out a bit like a disaster because it wasn't until writing the paper and not the abstract that I realized how loose of a topic it was. Again, this is my problem and not Emmanuel's, but I would consider asking for the abstract earlier or asking for a draft instead.",
    "The sequence of the content of the course made sense and was well presented by Petit in his lectures. It was also interesting because he made an attempt to connect various thinkers on a regular basis and always provided us with a general background for the thinkers.",
    "The strict chronological sequencing makes for a clear presentation of the individual theorists\/theories. However, more discussion of the development of specific theories and modes of criticism, irrespective of their place in time, would strengthen the course and help students to better understand the significant theoretical approaches that persist over time.",
    "very good and comprehensive theory course, found the subject matter very interstring and helpful to establish a strong grounding in arch theory",
    "I was satisfied with this aspect of the course.",
    "interesting subject matter, I hope with next semester's theory course that we will get to present day and be able to reflect on the material Emanuel taught us.",
    "I wish the process of the final paper had started earlier. Students could turn in the proposal, then a brief rough draft, and then the final paper. Theory papers are difficult, especially when you have never written one before. More guidance would have been helpful.",
    "The content of the class was very extensive and the semester had the right timing to absorb it.",
    "The material was fascinating, relevant, and well-paced. It was a pleasure to have the chance to talk more about philosophy than architecture at certain moments during the semester.",
    "good, a little lacking in american architectural history.",
    "Fantastic. the course is structured and the progression cohesive.",
    "The course material was very well structured and presented. The sequence was roughly chronological which was helpful to show a development of ideas through the span of time covered.I think that the structure of the readings and discussions was productive and should be emphasized more. There should be greater pressure on innovative ways to show the material and images for reference and discussion by that week\u0092s presenters. The only logistics would be to provide an adequate venue for the discussion to take place with a projector. Personally, the discussion time directly following the course was handicapped toward a greater level of engagement but was still very useful in peeling back a deeper layer from the readings."

   "question_text": "What were your expectations for this course and how well were they met?",
   "comments": [
    "Having only a modest background in architectural theory, I did not have clear expectations for the course. Overall, the course was informative and the lectures were extremely well delivered and enjoyable. Sections were interesting, but sometimes became little more than a summary of the readings with the section leader's own commentary.",
    "This course is intellectually heavy, and extremely interesting. Emmanuel and Marta both do a great job keeping the material interesting and understandable.",
    "I expected to learn architectural theory with historical background and philosophy. This course encouraged to learn many ideas from various points of view.",
    "Expectations were high, and they were met.",
    "My expectations of the course were met perfectly well; the only disappointment was that sometimes the discussion sections were not as lively as they could have been. I'm not sure how to do it, but itwould be nice if more students took positions and real discussions or debates could form.",
    "I still don't remember the difference between many architectural theorists. I remember them after I do the readings and I remember them during lecture....but nothing sticks permanently. That could be because there are no tests, etc. where we have to imprint the information onto our minds.",
    "Better than expected.",
    "I expected a survey of architectural thought and I got it!",
    "I was hoping to learn more about theory. Emmanuel certainly delivered on this very basic aspiration. The class was a real pleasure, and a wonderful learning opportunity. Emmanuel has an extraordinary ability as a professor to convey information with both an academic and intellectual rigor, but also a rare sense of paradox, humor, and wit.I think that one of his greatest strengths is that he aims to dismantle traditional categories and chronologies of theory and history. The Romantic period, for example, did not take place between years x and y, but instead has its own lineage and life that reverberates in contemporary discourse as strongly as it did in the past. I really think that this is fascinating for two reasons. On the one hand, it makes theory and history so much more tangible and appetizing. Gone are the days of reading dried up texts by Hitchcock that you can't even guess how to translate to a modern audience. Secondly, I think at a very pedagogical and epistemological model, this opens new opportunities to challenge what has happened in the past and what happens today. By removing conventional categories of theory for us, Emmanuel has afforded us the opportunity to think independently and make connections that may not be already be present in contemporary discourse.",
    "I didn't have any particular expectations for the course, but Petit did an excellent job of keeping the course interesting.",
    "My expectations were to develop a broad understanding of the major theories put forward in the discipline's history. This general expectation was met. As stated previously, a greater focus on persistent forms of criticism, as opposed to individual theorists, would better serve the students in establishing a foundation from which to develop their own critical positions.",
    "very good and well met",
    "Yes.",
    "This is what I expected, I heard good things about Emanuel and was satisfied by my own findings.",
    "I had great expectations I just wish I ha more time to review the final paper. 15 pages seemed to be very demanding considering the amount of work for other classes. Maybe if the deadline time was longer it could have helped.",
    "My expectations for the course were high, and indeed they were met.",
    "introduction to theory. i have a good grasp of the basics now.",
    "My expectations were in line with the material covered in the course. I think that the paper topic could have been better served by a longer development period and should not be required to align with the readings one covered in discussion."

   "question_text": "Comment on the value of this course to you.",
   "comments": [
    "The course is incredibly valuable. Studio work today is often devoid of any historical or contextual appreciation, often expressing conceptual or formal ideas that are inherent only to current trends in architecture. The course is helpful, not only in informing our design work, but also for developing the basic understanding of the history of architectural expression and thinking that is necessary for any student to comprehend in order to speak intelligently about his or her profession.",
    "Historical theory in architecture is extremely important to developing consistent conceptual ideas within ones own architectural work. Emmanuel's ability to portray the information to us makes the course the interesting and valuable class that it is.",
    "As a supplement to the undergraduate curriculum sorely lacking in history\/theory, this was by far the most valuable course I've taken to help understand a critical approach to architecture. It was a good complement to previous courses, such as Scully and Harries' takes on history\/theory\/philosophy, and developed some topics I'd touched on in some of the Studio readings as well as in courseslike Literary Theory.",
    "It is important for all architects to understand the origins of the pool they are being thrown into. Therefore, the value is incredibly high, and the course is taken seriously by all students.",
    "This course was absolutely valuable to me. It made me think more than any course I've taken at Yale so far, and compelled me to work on the final paper as a project that was more than just the fulfillment of the course requirements. That, for me, is the mark of a successful course.",
    "This course did not have a lot of value to me. I was not interested in theory before I went into the class nor am I interested in it after. This has nothing to do with the teacher (Emmanuel was great), it is simply the subject matter.",
    "It was a good and intense overview of theory and also appropriate for someone like me who is not entirely familiar with theory.",
    "This class was very valuable, i only wish i had more time to work on the assignments. 18 credits means that you don't have time to do anything well.",
    "It was incredibly valuable in providing not only a refresher from undergrad, but a very different and more contemporary take on the subject matter.It should provide a good foundation for later courses.",
    "Valuable. The best course of this semester, for sure.",
    "This course was valuable to me because I must admit that I approached it with a certain skepticism; I had previously taken an Architectural Theory (Enlightenment-1968) course and wasn't sure how much new material I was going to learn. I couldn't have been more wrong - this course was a challenge and a reward to anyone interested in theory.",
    "The lectures were interesting and well structure. The sections were not.",
    "This course was of great value to me, and will provide lasting benefits as I pursue my education and future practice. Theory--a critical investigation of the history of the discipline and one's own practice--cannot be separated from practice, or the discipline more broadly construed, and should be treated as such in the curriculum. This course's value would increase if moved into the first year.",
    "high and very helpful to develop an undertanding in the basis of theory, wish it could somehow be applied in a design exercise in some way",
    "This course was extremely valuable to me, not only in terms of opening up new areas of personal interest but also developing those interests which I already had. I have very little negative criticism to offer and this evaluation will consequently be very unhelpful. But this was a great course.",
    "Very valuable.",
    "This course, the group sessions, the paper and all the readings will be of tremendous value for my career.",
    "This course was deeply valuable to me. I always looked forward to lecture as well as to our section meetings, which were spirited and engaging. I would like to find a way apply the lessons of this course to my studio work.",
    "great",
    "great, this course provided the much needed information to think more deeply about what it is we do.",
    "This course was most valuable in terms of the lectures and final paper. The engaging lectures put a new light on this deeper history of modernism that I had not understood before. The individual research topic was exciting to discuss with Marta and her guiding support helped me to pursue and digest many sources that I had wanted to understand."

   "question_text": "Comment on the effectiveness of the teaching by the courses's instructor",
   "comments": [
    "Emmanuel Petit is a very engaging lecturer and overall did a verygood job of presenting material. Marta is very knowledgeable on the subject matter, if a bit unapproachable.",
    "The instructor is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the subject matter. Lectures were delivered with incredible clarity and made attending class more than enjoyable. The section leader is equally as passionate and knowledgeable on the subject matter. Discussions were often helpful in refining the concepts of the lectures, but occasionally fell into merely summarizing the assigned readings for the week, though the students are equally at fault for this. Overall, lectures and discussion sections were very beneficial in presenting an ambitious overview of the history of architectural theory.",
    "Emmanuel and Marta are both extremely effective at teaching the subject matter because they are both enthusiastic about the subject matter.",
    "Petit's lectures were consistently excellent. Sections with Marta were generally good, although conversations were not always as productive as they could have been.",
    "I thought both Emmanuel Petit and Marta Caldera were extremely knowledgeable, qualified and engaging. That said, I believe that Marta (who I had for section) was unable to generate discussions between the students. She would make comments or statements, but expected the students to guide their own questions and flow. I think that this is a mistake, and, at times, made the section sessions extremely awkward. The students would simply present an outline of the reading and then we would leave.",
    "Emmanuel was an extremely good lecturer and discussion leader. He explained difficult material more lucidly than I have ever encountered it, and provoked discussion that exceeded any expectations I could have for a course like this.",
    "I did not like how one person was responsible for \"summarizing\" the reading every week. More often than not, it resulted in a line-for-line summary of the reading from beginning to end. The assignment should be more specific, like: find the 3 most relevant lines in the text that express the main idea of the writing. Also, each student presenter should be responsible for writing questions about the reading. That way, the student can get right to the point and discussion can being.",
    "Marta was a good sectional leader. I think she could be a bit more open to allowing the discussion to take its own course. She seems to interject after every student comment, which tends to keep a discussion between the students from developing, it turns into more of an undergraduate resuscitation. Overall she did a good job.",
    "The lectures were stronger than the discussions. While the professor was extremely knowledgeable, it was difficult to explore topics in discussion due to a level of theoretical decorum and knowledge seemingly expected.If we could have discussed topic in a looser, yet still rigorous manner then I feel like the student body as a whole would have been more engaging instead of a few individuals dominating discussion.",
    "I have never considered myself to be a \"theory\" person, but Emanuel managed to make this class enjoyable and interesting. Emmanuel is one of the most passionate, knowledgeable, and entertaining professors I have ever had, and his class is a joy. The class slideshows are full of amazing images and videos, and Emmanuel's excellent lectures make this class a truly memorable experience.",
    "A great course, well organized, well taught. Petit\u0092s lectures were engaging and Marta\u0092s discussion groups were well-led, if more subdued.",
    "Emmanuel's lectures and his discussion section were outstanding. I think that's all I need to write.",
    "Petit is a great lecturer and really knows the material well. His lectures are clear and thoughtfully constructed. He made the material understable and easy to follow.Marta's section were less than inspiring. She was never able to get a discussion going and the sections were rather painful to sit through. We had Petit for the last section and in that one section we had more of an interesting discussion than we did over the whole semester.",
    "The instructor's lectures were clear and informative. A format for the course that encouraged more interaction would be beneficial.The TA was knowledgeable and well-prepared. However she too often stifled discussion when she meant to encourage it, by asking specific questions, rather than allowing students to pose their own questions and discuss their interests.",
    "very good and knowlegeable of the materials",
    "Marta Caldeira was a very encouraging instructor and has an enormous knowledge on the subject. Undoubtedly, she will have an impressive career.",
    "Emmanuel is an energetic and intense teacher -- someone who inspires hard work and careful thought. It was a privilege to have him teach section and fuel discussion in a more intimate setting. I'd like to see him try to lecture without powerpoint, however -- or at least to experiment with showing fewer and thus more meaningful slides. It's less interesting to see portraits of Wolfflin or Giedeon -- better to see a few architectural images that could be the subject of a close reading using the lessons of the various theories Emmanuel presents.",
    "great, the discussions should maybe be a little more structured to encourage non talkers to talk",
    "Emmanuel is one of the best professors I have encountered. His charisma is very infectious; i am thankful that it does not interfere with the clarity and direction of the presentations. Emmanuel is very good at mediating discussions and in the lecture hall, presents complex theories and ideas in a method that is easily accessible to the layman.",
    "Emanuel was a wonderful instructor, offering engaging lectures and carefully structuring the material.Marta as a discussion leader was very effective. I appreciated the concise summaries that she gave at the start of each session and carefully guided the discussion. I think the sections could be enhanced further by more developed responses and reinstating the requirement for question responses emailed the night before.There could have been greater organization by the TA to make sure the readings were posted in ample time before the next week\u0092s discussion. A new aspect of the position could be an email introduction to the readings and references to give context and links between writers."

   "comments": [
    "Discussion sections should be more focused on clarifying or debating the concepts presented in lecture. This will require demanding of the students more than presenting a summary of the readings, and will benefit the students even greater. Overall the class was informative and enjoyable.",
    "The can not think of anything to make this course better.",
    "-The discussion sections were rarely discussions. It seems that they should be re-worked to encourage discussion through more creative orinnovate approaches to teaching. While lecture was always excellent, the discussions were lacking. (Especially given that many students are less skilled at discussing theory than they are at producing for studio).",
    "I think the course should not be altered at all.",
    "My only recommendation for improvements would be a more intense sequence of deadlines or assignments leading up to the final paper, such as a topic proposal, a bibliography, then an outline, abstract, or the first few pages, and then the final paper. Not only would this make students' lives at the end of the semester easier, it would make the final papers much better.",
    "A slideshow presentation requirement for the student to present the reading discussion could be effective for both the presenter and the audience.",
    "Less readings are always helpful to ensure that they are actually done.",
    "The reading was extensive and at times too much. The reading presentations were an effective way to 'split' the work in some sense. What would have been helpful is if students who were presenting also created a summaryof the reading and gave it out to the other students. Summaries like that may seem like reductive cheat sheets, but they really help recall the main points of the topics week to week",
    "Record and post the lectures, rethink the paper, otherwise good job.",
    "See question 7.",
    "This class was great - I do not have any suggestions for improvements.",
    "A scheduling request: For the sake of the second years next year, PLEASE do not place this course right after another required course--Garvin's Intro to Planning--such that we are stuck in freezing Hastings Hall from 11:30am to 3:00pm with only a ten minute break to scarf down lunch and thaw out! Brutal.",
    "I have only one suggestion, and it is because I have already taken Theory II with Ariane last spring. I have some reservations with the transition between the two courses. I certainly understand that they are taught by two distinct and excellent instructors, and I think it\u0092s wonderful to have multiple perspectives on theory, but I wonder if the classes could be made even by Emmanuel and Ariane revisiting their respective syllabi and seeing how they could make this transition smoother. The reason is that Ariane\u0092s class is VERY contemporary, both chronologically and thematically (we barely touched on 1968, but did discuss late capitalism, ecosophy, posthumans, etc.). Meanwhile, Emmanuel\u0092s class didn\u0092t get close to 1968 besides the last week when we looked at Banham, Rowe, and Tafuri \u0096 they are all writing well after this date but neither they nor we ever addressed the events and significant changes to theory spawned by the riots. His class focused a lot more on the big names in continental philosophy, which in itself is quite different from Ariane\u0092s class. I think that more could be done to bridge the two courses. Te fussiness of my criticism reflects how outstanding both of these classes are.",
    "more varied sections",
    "This course should be moved to the first year. Perhaps it could be switched with Alan Plattus's Introduction to Urban Design, which would make a good compliment to Alexander Garvin's class in third semester--in preparation for the fourth semester studio.",
    "Require a paper draft or outline due after Thanksgiving break.",
    "More focused discussion of the readings in section; perhaps the chance to ask questions at the end of lecture.It might also be nice to be forced to turn in a draft of our papers prior to submitting the final -- the paper topic submission could be due earlier, and for the second half of the semester at least we could be working on crafting our papers -- this might allow the course to take on the form of a workshop, where we are testing ideas in writing and are forced to react and respond in a more sustained way.",
    "Keep it the way it is.",
    "My main suggestion would be restructuring of development of the paper. I think that there should be at least a second checkpoint with the paper topic with a developed annotated bibliography or full outline. Another possible direction could be toward what the MIT graduate students pursue in their theory course, focusing on an approved project or theoretical exploration instead of an explicit page limit. This could involve drawing or comparative analysis and provide a deeper understanding of one\u0092s focus."
