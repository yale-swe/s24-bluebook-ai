   "comments": [
    "It gets very repetitive by the end and you only do line drawings and value drawings. The professor is a harsher grader than you'd expect. Take it Credit D and only if you're interested in improving your drawing skills through repetition.",
    "If you want to become better at drawing, take ART 114. I didn't have much previous experienced and noticed a huge improvement over the course of the semester. You'll be forced to step out of your comfort zone, you'll use materials you've never heard of, and you'll begin to see the world in a slightly different way. The work is also refreshingly different from that of most other courses. Nonetheless, be warned that the class is a considerable amount of homework. Will states that the workload is 6-8 hours per week, which is about right. Homework usually consists of 2-3 drawings in a sketchbook and 2 larger, more substantial drawings each week. The workload, at times, can be stressful. In class, you'll typically draw a still-life. It's great practice but it can get a little repetitive. Finally, the grading can be a little bit harsh. Expect to work really hard and to consistently produce high quality work in order to receive a good grade. Overall, if you're willing to put in the time and effort, go for it!",
    "If you want a cool class that will teach you a ton, this is it. You will learn so much, and Prof. Villalongo is really cool. If you have the chance, you should take drawing with him. It's definitely not a gut, though. And you should expect your hands to be stained with charcoal for the majority of the semester.",
    "You get out of it what you put in.",
    "Art 114 is a great class if you are looking to expand your artistic vocabulary and skills. I would recommend the class, since many people who have asked have a natural affinity for art, and the people can most certainly enjoy growing by taking the class.",
    "Art 114 is a great class to take if you're interested in exploring drawing. In my experience the class was less focused on technical skills and more focused on developing an artistic sense of style. We explored a variety of different media and by the end I could say that I had improved greatly.",
    "Enjoyable class, it was my first art class and found it fun. Just a lot of charcoal though.",
    "Basic Drawing is not a uniform experience across professors, in Villalongo's class you can expect to work 'big' with large projects and plenty of homework. Most of the days you'll have time drawing on 24x36in papers and each week turn in two or three large drawings with three smaller sketchbook drawings. The amount of critique you receive with each assignment will vary week by week from extensive to none."
