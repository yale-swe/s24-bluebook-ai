    "A really good understanding of the transatlantic slave trade and how societies were formed as a result.",
    "Gained considerable amount of knowledge about the Atlantic slave trade and abolition across the Atlantic world.",
    "This class did a good job emphasizing the scope of the slave trade internationally, and how individual events had huge ripple effects.",
    "I gained a better understanding of not only the Middle Passage, but of its effects on the rest of the Atlantic World and of the conditions that ultimately lead to its formation and proliferation.",
    "Really great survey of slavery beyond the context of the United States alone, great Caribbean history.",
    "History of slavery, how to write a history paper using primary and secondary documents",
    "Historical facts and a deeper understanding of transatlantic slavery in the modern world.",
    "I gained incredible insights into how Slavery functioned as an economic, social, and political institution in the Atlantic world, and a deeper understanding of the factors that shaped Atlantic slaverys origins, and led to its end. There was a self-directed, primary source based final research assignment that gave a fascinating look into the archives and scholarship around slavery.",
    "Very helpful foundation for the African-American Studies major; emphasis on primary sources in the readings also developed research skills",
    "a good overview of Atlantic history.",
    "I learned how to connect the past with the present and valuable skills with primary sources",
    "Straightforward history of the rise and fall of Atlantic slavery, and the roots of modern antiblackness from the 1400s to late 1800s.",
    "A better grasp of Atlantic slavery",
    "Taking this course really helped give me insight on the black experience, especially in America.",
    "I learned to recognize enslaved people as resistant and not passive.",
    "i learned how to broaden my scope of understanding of the diaspora from just north america and africa but to the europe, the caribbean, and south america.",
    "The history of Atlantic slavery.",
    "I learned how to do a history research paper and look at the same event from many different historical contexts",
    "I gained a good understanding of the way slavery started and developed in the Atlantic world. In addition, since this was my first history class, I was thrust into an understanding of research and historical argument composition."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strengths- lecture was very engaging and the readings were the perfect length and applied to the course material well.",
    "Strengths: lectures, readings Weaknesses: discussion sections",
    "The essay timeline and the final exam were kind of weirdly structured. I wish we had the deadline moved up a bit on the essay, and the take-home aspect of the exam was a lot more than most students expected. Professor Rugemer did change the prompt and length of the take-home essay, which helped, and I appreciate that students were actually listened to.",
    "Of all the prerequisite classes I've had to take at Yale so far, this was one of the most enjoyable. You do have a good amount of work for the class (more-so at the end of the year than at any other point -- the rest is manageable), but you really do come away learning a lot about the slave trade, what it meant for who was involved, and what effect it had on the Atlantic world while it existed and well after. The one suggestion I might offer for improvement would be to have either written exam or a take home exam during finals, not both of them.",
    "Strengths were Professor Rugemer's lectures, they were always very interesting and captivating. The readings were definitely a weakness of the class, they were often lengthy and had little to do with that week's material, they felt like unnecessary extra work.",
    "The readings\/discussion sections and the lectures did not really interact.",
    "The weakness is definitely that we had 3 assignments due during reading and finals period.",
    "Strengths: Professor Rugemer is the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far! He is super engaging and extremely knowledgable about the topic. The class passes so fast; some classes you keep checking the time to see when it ends but I never did that once for this class. Learning about the history of slavery is so important and I think is something everyone should get exposure to. Weaknesses: A lot of terms to study for the exams and take-home essay was not clearly indicated in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester so I had a surprise essay to write on top of the 4 I already had due during reading week, but I dealt with it fine",
    "Strengths: amazing lecturer. Weaknesses: TAs.",
    "Professor Rugemers lectures are very rich and informative, and its a bad idea to miss one. It helps to take good notes. I had a great TF, and it made the discussion sections very engaging. There was a pretty heavy workload.",
    "no weaknesses of course; lecture format was very structured, and the handouts with key terms was helpful without making it about teaching for the test",
    "Professor Rugemer's lectures were often very formulaic and he was not prepared to answer questions regarding his claims, even though he routinely opened the floor for questions.",
    "The lectures are very in-depth and imformative but the section was not too helpful in its structure.",
    "It is really well organized chronology and lectures are very captivating",
    "Strengths: ? Some of the readings toward the end of the semester were interesting. Weaknesses: The class was interesting at times, but there was no real way to engage students so I was bored for the majority of the semester.",
    "Strengths; great info, super great storytelling Weaknesses: reading wasnt always useful or fully necessary",
    "This course is very second half heavy which made the later half of the semester far more stressful.",
    "The lectures were interesting but the readings were often dry and the powerpoints could have been more captivating.",
    "strengths: covers wide amount of information, interesting readings, structure of the midterm weaknesses: finals schedule was unorganized and too much work for both the TAs and the students, feedback\/guidance for paper assignments was a little unclear",
    "there were no grades given before the cred\/d\/fail deadline and that was very unfair",
    "The course material is interesting and while Rugemuer is a good lecturer, the style of learning does not coincide with the teaching style. The assessments all seem half-baked as if the Professor and TA could not decide if they wanted us to learn the course through memorization of key facts, (which becomes incredibly difficult as there are no actual lecture slides and Rugemuer talks incredibly fast) or through analysis of the events and their significance. My biggest complaint with this class is the test\/essays as they are unfair to the teaching style and the fact that it is an introductory course into the major. The professor seems to be teaching the class as an homage to the 60s style teaching if only to make the point, \"this class used to be taught in a racist way I will teach it exactly the same except not racist.\" The Discussion sections are similarly under cooked. Throughout the course the mixture of repeating incredibly basic knowledge, and performing higher levels of analysis is so unbalanced that the often vague questions of the assessments leave you without any sense of where to go or what is expected of you as a student. The last half of the course is incredibly messy as the professor and TA all seemed out of their depth and expertise, yet again we as students were expected to maintain in the same limbo of participation of the first half. When there are no lecture slides, a messy lecture and messier discussion sections make for an impossible final assessment. The material of this course is cool and incredibly necessary if one hopes to be an african american studies major. It could be taught and facilitated much better.",
    "Strengths are the lecture handouts and the section structure. The weaknesses are the lack of notes on the power point, this could be improved",
    "I really appreciated the narrative style of the class, as I felt like it made the course more engaging. The only thing I would suggest is to maybe have sections incorporate the Research Paper process more, as I felt like the course, as currently constructed, is segmented into 3 relatively separate components: lecture, section, research paper."

   "comments": [
    "yes",
    "Yes, but be prepared for a CONSIDERABLE amount of work at the end of the semester.",
    "I would recommend it if you are looking for a survey-level course on the slave trade.",
    "I would recommend the class to other students. Ultimately, I think that learning about the slave trade and its implications is important regardless of whether you are interested in the field of study or not. This course lays out the entire progression of this narrative from beginning to end in a way that is straightforward and clear. No matter what one's area of study or interest is, I think this class has something to teach them.",
    "Yes! Great HU credit, easy A, and you'll look forward to going to lecture! The final research paper isn't too bad, just pace yourself and don't leave it all to the last minute.",
    "It was a good way to get a very broad overview of slavery in all the Americas.",
    "Definitely. Professor's lectures are engaging and tell a story about an awful part of history that everyone should learn about.",
    "Yes! I shopped this class with no intention to take it but ended up being riveted by Professor Rugemer's lecturing style and obviously the topic of slavery itself. Prof Rugemer is the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far - he is super engaging and extremely knowledgable about the topic. The class passes so fast; some classes you keep checking the time to see when it ends but I never did that once for this class. Learning about the history of slavery is so important and I think is something everyone should get exposure to. The workload is decently low (one research paper, 2 exams) -- but be warned that the final exam is split into a test and another take home 3-4page essay. That was pretty annoying because it was unexpected but other than that it was really a great class.",
    "Only take this if you are an AFAM major. Otherwise, this class is not worth 1 of your 36 Yale credits.",
    "Yep, super interesting content.",
    "This is a great course that allows you to learn about a subject that many people know the sparknotes on. Taking a much more in depth look into this subject is eye opening and, like a good History course should, it helped to explain why the things that happened long ago resulted in other events and eventually more contemporary relevant issues. The course work was not overbearing during the semester, but many people felt blindsided by the final exam, because it included its own take home paper. This of course followed the original final paper due for the course as well. So just be prepared for that as you plan out your finals period.",
    "Yes! Absolutely. I would suggest this course to anyone interested in a rigorous historical survey that assigns a lot of work. Obviously the subject matter can be emotionally difficult; were talking about some of the worst atrocities in history. People should know that going in.",
    "Yes; if Yale were to make a required course for all undergraduates this would be an appropriate one given the centrality of the content to every aspect of American history",
    "it is a required course for the Afam major, so inevitably some must take it, but my TF Alycia was a far better instructor than Professor Rugemer.",
    "Yes, it is a great course on a very important, relevant topic.",
    "It's a requirement for the AfAm major, but if you're a nonmajor without a strong passion for history, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Yes! Absolutely imperative information about race, capitalism, and the roots of modern society",
    "Probably not. The lectures were very interesting and engaging but the out of class reading and sections didnt really add much. Also very little direction is given on the research paper.",
    "I would because the class taught slavery and its consequences much different than traditional courses.",
    "i would recommend taking it sooner rather than later for african american studies majors. but, for people outside of the major, i would hesitate to recommend it because of all the work thrown at you by the end.",
    "This material is very important for african american studies major. If you are not in the major, I still think it is an untalked about history that is important to know. I wish that it was taught better.",
    "Yes, it helps you understand slavery from perspectives I never considered before",
    "Yes, as I feel it offers a very good background to the existence of slavery in the Atlantic world."
