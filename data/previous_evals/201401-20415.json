   "comments": [
    "Yes, super interesting and really contextualizes the structures we all see but need to understand.",
    "ANTH 110 is an introductory course, so expect a broad spectrum of theories and views on cultural anthropology without going very deep in any of them. I would recommend the class.",
    "I would give 5 stars to this class. I learned a ton, it was super interesting, and gave me a radically new perspective of what it means to be human. I did most of the readings for fun, just because it was really interesting. I would say, though, most of the readings are really longer than they need to be, and what you really need for the class is to extract the thesis of each reading along with the author, place, and people being studied. If you can do that, it would save you a lot of time! Most of the reading is unnecessary, its just there to \"pull you in\" and give you flavor. Probably the best class I've ever taken at Yale. You get to study Yale and Yalies, and your papers are basically opeds about Yale life. SO MUCH FUN. Section is also super fun as its a bunch of Yalies (mostly freshmen, though) debating the touchy subjects of race, power, money and sex, in (at least in my section) a healthy productive well monitored way. Its not rigorous like a philosophy or psychology class, you get to write your papers as a story about Yale and Yalies, and theorize at will about why they're doing what they're doing.",
    "Take this if you're interested in Anthropology. As a non-anthro major, this seemed too much based on theory and jargon for me to appreciate it. I loved the days when we talked about specific cultures, but overall learning about what anthropology is and all the terms was uninteresting to me.",
    "I thought this course was a great introduction to cultural anthropology in that it got me excited about the subject. The class gave me the opportunity to think critically about being at Yale (something I had not had time to do since coming to Yale). I'd like to think that the critical mindset of the anthropologist rubbed off on me while I was in the class and that I now look around me and, rather than taking the world at face value, I am curious about why is the way it is.",
    "This class is a good introduction to the field of anthropology and interesting ways of studying\/thinking about how people live and view the world. I would recommend it because the class is fun and interesting and forces you to think outside of your own preconceptions.",
    "ANTH 110 is a background to cultural anthropology that introduces you to different topics in the field and introduces you to a new and interesting way of thinking. Definitely take it.",
    "The readings are really amazing, the homeworks are fascinating. The midterm is weirdly challenging, but it'll be okay. Erik Harms is fantastic. This class is really great.",
    "I would not recommend it to another student because the concepts learned are self-explanatory and the rest in between is not worth an entire semester.",
    "ANTH 110 is a course which provides you with the tools to understand and construct your own anthropological arguments. Through the study of ritual, religion, worldview, kinship, and more you come to understand the world in a really powerful way. The readings are fascinating and lectures are enjoyable, but do note that this course is a significant time commitment. You get to write your own ethnography of Yale for the final paper which is also a really great experience. Whether you're an anthro major or not, I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "ANTH 110 is an interesting course that gives you a broad overview of many important concepts in anthropology. I thought lectures and readings were decently interesting, but often the course dove too deep into abstract terms and concepts for me to understand what was going on, or appreciate its real-life applications. There was also way too much reading. Truth be told, I probably could've learned the lecture content in four to five weeks of more succinct, concrete lectures, but the ethnography assignments were so interesting and ended up being really fun (it's almost worth taking the class just to do those ethnographies). If you have a choice in TAs, Aina Begim is incredible and really helps you understand why the course content is relevant. Overall a good course, but definitely not a must-take.",
    "Take it! It is super interesting and really drives you to think about your own world and Yale as a cultural entity. The readings are interesting, the lectures are fun, and the workload isn't bad.",
    "Would recommend",
    "I would recommend the class for students who are interested in anthropology. they should know that it is not an easy class. You should only take his class if you actually intend in engaging with the material.",
    "Good survey course of Anthropology. Yes, especially if you are planning on majoring in ANTH or a similar social science.",
    "JUST TAKE IT FOR THE ULTIMATE ANTHRO\/YALE EXPERIENCE.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! As an anthro major it's a must because you get a short introduction to all the anthropologists quoted in the intro's and theory bits of every other anthro book you'll ever read. You learn the basics, which is key. AND it gets you thinking. Prof Harms is great at getting you to think about your own culture and the ways it fits into the framework of all these other great anthropologists studies. The reading is a little bit random, but I think most of them are cool. wish I had read more, honestly, but it was great.",
    "This class contains lots of really interesting concepts and the readings are great, but it's all presented in sort of a jumble. The assignments can feel a little like they are babying you, but that can be a nice alternative to other college assignments. Take it if you want to learn about anthropology, but expect that you'll have to do some processing if you want anything mind-blowing to happen. Also, shop sections, because I have heard that experience is really variable depending on the teaching fellow (Ryan is the greatest!).",
    "A very basic introduction to Anthropological thought and theory. This class really makes you think about the things that you see and experience in everyday life and encourages you to evaluate them in a completely different light. The readings are really engaging and Professor Harms is a great lecturer."
