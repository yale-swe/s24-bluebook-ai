    "The course is tough and time consuming but then you do learn a valuable skill. Without the TA's help (Ross Bernet) I think I would have given up the course because while we do learn some things in class, actually doing it in the lab was very stressful.",
    "Question 8: I found the instructor's explanations too convoluted and theoretical. I understand his approach to GIS but it was not something I particularly found useful when working on the labs.",
    "Question 8 Dana's effectiveness at explaining the concepts of GIS and the course material is unparalleled. He is a really excellent teacher in that way. HOWEVER. He spent about 80 of our course meeting time rambling on about confusing assignments that would have been more effectively communicated with concise written instructions. The first few lectures of the course were very good. Then instruction went massively downhill. Class time was not well spent and instruction was often more confusing than helpful.",
    "Occasionally there was confusion over what was actually due for assignments, but things were generally cleared up on Piazza.",
    "Great instructor for a very practical course. The material is relevant to almost any degree, and Dana really makes it accessible and understandable.",
    "Question 3: The workload is WAY heavier than any other course. The course could easily count as a four or five credit course.",
    "I felt the homework was usually a very challenging way of approaching the concepts learned during the lecture and at times, the homework did not provide work that would reflect real world uses of GIS in an environmental field. I would have preferred to learn Raster GIS in a computer lab where we would be able to immediately try out the tools learned in class. I felt this was a major disadvantage to students who were not able to get ArcGIS on their laptops (myself included). I also feel like learning this software in a computer lab would have alleviated the time that was required from the TA for office hours. The instructor was extremely knowledgeable but at times the concepts were not communicated clearly and were very abstract. I spent far more out of class time on this course than any class I have taken at the School of Forestry thus far.",
    "The assignments were most useful for learning. The classroom lecture format was largely not useful for teaching the software. It seems like a computer lab would be a better setting for this class.",
    "There was no text book. There were course hand outs that needed to be downloaded and opened individually which is tedious. Especially when the word documents don't load right due to different versions of word, or different computers. It would have been helpful to have the option to order a 'class reader' of sorts with all the handouts in one place as a hard copy. Or at least a digital version of this. The assignments routinely took 15-20 hours to complete which was a bit arduous. The TA for this class went above and beyond to help students, but it would have been nice to have a lab section of some sort in addition to TA office hours where the professor is present to help. Office hours turned into lab hours de facto, but that seems an unfair burden to place on one TA for the amount of students that utilized office hours. The professor did have excellent response time on piazza. However, his responses were always more like koans or riddles than helpful answers to the student's questions. Sometimes the professor singles out students in class, as examples in inappropriate uncomfortable ways.",
    "Dana Tomlin is a great professor, with a real passion for teaching. He really goes the extra mile to make sure that his students get something out of the class. While I might not agree with all of my marks over the course of the semester I think that I learned more in this class than I did in any other.",
    "The professor was incredible good at explaining the complexities of the material , however he was intentionally vague and troublesome we asked clarification. This felt unnecessary and very frustrating. I think the course is valuable but wonder how relevant GIS will remain with Google maps taking over. Caution putting too much time into learning it when new tech will make it irrelevant shortly"

    "best aspects were learning how to think in a different way, which raster forces you to do. it shifted the way i would think about solving problems. that was what most useful to me about the course. you can learn to mess with software on your own, but learning how to think like dana encourages us to was really useful.",
    "Understanding Raster GIS",
    "The assignments really helped me learn the material. I also really liked the handouts and tutorials on each raster concept. The class was very self directed and I think students get out of it what they put in. When you have all of the tutorials available to you, you are really able to work at your own pace and on your own time - which I found helpful. Dana and Ross were both VERY attentive and great at responding promptly to emails and questions about HW, etc.",
    "Both the Professor and the TA happen to be so passionate about the course that even if its hard, you tend to love GIS",
    "The thorough handouts were wonderful; the lectures were clear and engaging and didn't move too quickly; and the assignments were a great application of the material and the most valuable component of the learning process.",
    "The labs were very useful",
    "Having access to the shared online platform for asking questions. Being given open-ended, challenging questions with more than one right answer. Being provided with precisely the right amount of support to develop answers to those types of questions.",
    "final project",
    "Practicality, working through assignments,",
    "The course handouts, online homework support, and in-person homework support were absolutely the best aspects of the course. The handouts and continued support are invaluable resources after the course as well. Dr. Tomlin is a kind teacher and an incomparable resource.",
    "Handouts were great.",
    "Finishing assignments.",
    "The best aspect of the course is having the skills to use ArcGIS now. It was also very interesting to think about the diverse ways that you could spatial analysis to examine change, time, risk, distribution etc. I learned that the software can offer so much more than information about geographical references. Ross was an amazing resource and supported all of the students continuously throughout the semester. Dana was very motivational in pushing us to think about big picture ideas and Ross helped us tease apart the difficulties in bringing those ideas to reality.",
    "Getting you know well about GIS applying in professional area.",
    "The homework assignments were challenging but brought our learning together effectively.",
    "The Professor is very experienced and adept at explaining the sometimes challenging concepts and operations. Raster GIS can be a very different way of thinking. You can tell the professor is enthusiastic about the topic and teaching students how to understand the raster GIS approach to spatial data and problem solving.",
    "The TA Ross was by far the best aspect to the course. He provided one on one help in a kind, compassionate, friendly manner which the professor did not.",
    "There were two things in particular that made this class exceptional. First, the instructor's teaching style was effective and engaging. He used very interesting descriptions, analogies, and demonstrations to illustrate the concepts that are integral to spatial modeling. Second, the homework was very challenging, but it resulted in a deep understanding of the use of GIS tools to solve spatial problems and questions. In addition, the instructor used the Piazza website in order for students to ask questions and receive prompt feedback--either from the instructor, the TF, or other students. This was extremely effective. I wish more instructors were using Piazza in their classes.",
    "The 'trial by fire' approach to this course made it worthwhile. The material was very difficult, not something that can really be learned in a book but something that must be experimented with repeatedly.",
    "I very much enjoyed learning about the program and the instructor's unique teaching style and enthusiasm were both refreshing and engaging.",

   "comments": [
    "Dana needs to be more clear about assignments. Specifically, what he wants, and how to go about accomplishing the task. He seemed to focused on not giving away too much in terms of strategy for these assignments, but I feel that there is a sweet spot where he can be more clear while still challenging students. Also, assignments should be written down somewhere. Whether on the weekly agenda or in an email, etc., students should not have to guess at his intent. If at all possible, do not change assignments once they are issued, this happened a couple of times this semester and it is incredibly frustrating. The latter half of the class really seemed to taper off. We did not really acquire new skills, and instead spent class time speaking generally about modeling and siting strategies. It needed more specific examples, or something to help this knowledge stick.",
    "Too much work for 3 credits. Totally unreasonable. Class should be 6 credits for this amount of work.",
    "Clarity of what exactly is expected for each assignment. Sometimes explanations were confusing and contradictory.",
    "The assignments were really uneven over the course of the semester, so if that could be evened out, that would be great.",
    "I think as we got later into the semester, the assignments and class time became more lax. During class I felt like we were just talking about next week's assignment and not getting much new information (granted - at the beginning, we were overloaded with info!). So I would recommend pacing the semester more so that the information is spread out more evenly.",
    "The homework assignments were entirely too time intensive. The learning stopped hours before the work did. This was exacerbated by Dana deliberately giving vague instructions to \"challenge\" us. I appreciate that approach, but when students are learning new material with a finicky software program that they don't even get a chance to touch during class, vague instructions are just not helpful.",
    "My only commentary on the class was that I wish more time had been spent during class discussing the previous homework assignments and getting more specific commentary on our assignments. While everyone's answers were posted online and Dana was very responsive to any questions, at the beginning of the semester I didn't even know what questions to be asking because I had no idea what I had done wrong. I'm not sure if we didn't go over them because Dana did not want to make it seems as though there was only a set number of ways to go about answering each, but I would've appreciated going through some of the strategies at the beginning of class.",
    "The way the course is graded, although creating an environment the promotes more effort in assignments, can sometimes be deflating to novices at GIS. Many in the class come in with some experience, making the task of being awarded for their acumen on the homework a bit easier than for those that are farther back on the learning curve. That being said, if you can get past the competition, the material in the class (despite its rigor) is made accessible to any level GIS'er.",
    "Additional tutorials with the weekly agendas would be helpful",
    "The 3 hour lecture! Personally I think GIS is a very hands-on tool that one can only experience by actually using it. Having the professor speak for three hours (see my comments on instructor) on aspects and tools of GIS without actually having the program in front of you (as you'd have in a lab) is not a good learning technique. Overall, I found maybe one hour of the lecture to be useful. I would redesign the class to be a one hour lecture and a two-hour lab course with the instructor and TA available for questions. Similarly, having only one TA for over 70 students is not practical. He was rarely available to answer questions during his office hours because there were so many students in need of help.",
    "Nothing. Maybe cookies at break like Shimi's class:)",
    "The grading scheme",
    "Sometimes Dr. Tomlin's expectations for the homework assignments can feel like a moving target - firm, clear, written guidelines would reduce needless frustration and allow students to focus on more educationally valuable homework-related problem-solving. Lecture often feels longer than it needs to be given the relatively denser educational value of the homework assignments paired with handouts, online support, and office hours support.",
    "Would have liked to learn more basic GIS skills for use outside of class. Felt more theoretical at times and workload time did not always feel useful if I was not interested in becoming the GIS person. Would have liked more of a professional skills module type class extended over a semester.",
    "Need more TA hours available.",
    "Professor Tomlin's lectures are either awe-inspiringly helpful or mind-bogglingly unhelpful.",
    "As mentioned above, I think holding the class in a computer lab would reduce the amount of time students have to spend outside of class figuring out the way the tools work. More applicable homework assignments would be better for students who are looking to apply them in work scenarios.",
    "The grading system should be separated from individual work and group work.",
    "The workload was too time-intensive, and as i result, i felt that even though I learned the tools, I didn't have time each week to create products that were of the caliber expected by Prof Tomlin.",
    "Assignment requirements should be more clearly stated and communicated.",
    "There was some lack of clarity for the structure and schedule of the last few assignments as the requirements would change from week to week. However, the professor did carefully explain the changes and answer questions about them. The changes also did result in a much more reasonable time frame for the work load of the final assignment.",
    "The intensity of homework assignments in the amount of time they take -- OR offer the class for more credits, since it elicits more hours than other classes. Adding a lab component where the professor is present. A text book or manual.",
    "If there was anything that needed improvement, it was in the support available to students. The TF was extremely helpful, but it would have helped to have had at least one or two other assistants that could offer help. The assignments--while helpful--took up a tremendous amount of time (12+ hours\/wk for most weeks).",
    "I'd be hard pressed to say. It's difficult and I think it probably needs to be.",
    "Beig ivasive when answering questions is not helpful. If it is not a question you feel comfortable answering then say that - its outside of what I will answer. Otherwise don't waste my time and actually answer the question. Especially if you are going to be so attentive to the online question forum."

GIS is a crucial tool for environmental professionals and I am discouraged to take another GIS course at Yale from this professor. It's a shame that Stacey Mapels left, and that there aren't any other options for GIS professors or classes other than Professor Tomlin. I know several other students who refuse to take another class with him after taking one of his classes. They either felt shamed, or incredibly frustrated with having to essentially learn the material themselves. I feel it is a disservice to FES students to not have more GIS instructor options, as this is such a crucial skill to have in our field.",

    "The advantages of working in a group for assignments were very large, being able to bounce ideas and brainstorm with someone else allows you both to arrive at solutions faster and more efficiently. However working in a group for the final project presented many problems as the distribution of the work load was very uneven and I ended up doing much more work than my partner.",
    "Learned more working in a group then by myself.",
    "Group work allows more to be accomplished in a shorter period of time by distributing work load. It also encouraged more discussion and perspectives on challenging problems. As a challenge, there is also a minimum amount of time that must be allotted for the process to schedule meetings and combine work. The two week schedule for the group project made that effective. If there was only one week, it would have been much more difficult.",
    "It was more helpful than the professor was. The other students helped each other and taught each other more than the professor did.",
    "The group work in this class was very helpful. Because each person in the group had different skills and experiences, we were each able to contribute meaningfully. Ultimately, we developed solutions that I never would have been able to come up with on my own. The group work was also helpful because it provided an immediate \"support group.\" GIS can be extremely challenging, and the camaraderie of the group proved to be essential.",
    "I worked with another anthropologist as a work group. Dr. Tomlin allowed us to pursue our own interests and apply methodology learned in the course and from outside the course to our work.",
    "It was good to have someone to discuss with, but occasionally I had a better grasp on the material and my grade might have been better if I worked alone.",
    "Learned things other people had figured out and the way they were thinking the through things. Helpful"

   "comments": [
    "It is time intensive, so make sure you can set aside an average of 10 hours a week for it. Otherwise, there's no point in taking the class.",
    "Definitely a course worth taking, but be sure to budget enough time in your schedule for it. Homeworks took anywhere from 6-30 hours\/week, depending on the assignment.",
    "encourage to take the course",
    "Be willing to spend hours in the GIS lab! But you won't even notice that 5 hours have gone by until you see that it's dark outside... you get sucked in. Also, if you have a conflict with another class, don't worry. You can take GIS anyway as it really is very self directed. Use Dana and the TA as much as possible, and your fellow students via Piazza. I loved how collaborative it all was - and you get a lot of helpful feedback very quickly.",
    "Do not take this course if you have other time-intensive courses in your semester schedule.",
    "This course is invaluable; you learn a lot both conceptually and practically. However, the course can be VERY time consuming. Thus, if your new to GIS parring the course with other less intense classes is advantageous.",
    "Don't think twice. DO IT!!!",
    "put aside a good 6 - 10 hours for weekly homework assignments.",
    "Dana is amazing, but a hard professor to connect to. He's as dedicated to you as you are to him. I learned a number of important skills that I will be able to implement in future projects, but I wish we had learned the skills in a more real-world manner. Make sure you have time to dedicate to it! And this means time where you'll be near a PC with GIS capabilities. It's really not functional on a laptop. Each homework takes on average 10 hours, so just make sure you can set that aside.",
    "Taking the time for office hours is pretty critical.",
    "Do it, but make sure you aren't taking too many other crazy time intensive classes at the same time or it will be more stress than fun.",
    "Read all the handouts! And don't hesitate to post questions to Piazza - just take the time to fully explain and include screenshots.",
    "Know that the workload is large enough that you might, like me, feel that you lost time for other courses. Consider vector as I have heard that is less of a time commitment and might be more applicable if you just want basic GIS understanding and skills.",
    "Use TA hours, start your assignments early.",
    "Do not take this course unless your other courses are easy and laid back. Unless you find that you love GIS (not like, but LOVE), GIS will consume your weekends and your soul. Personally, I value both of them. This course should not be a 3 credit course, it should at least count for four and possibly even five credits. Also, Dana told me that I could skip lectures since another course I had coincided with the first half of lecture. This was an absurd falsehood. Granted, the tutorials and handouts are helpful, but Dana's in-person lectures are MUCH more helpful (most of the time). Do not skip lectures if you can avoid it.",
    "If you want to get very familiar with ArcGIS software and its capabilities this is a great class for that. If you want to work on projects that speak to your interest as a student it is not likely that this will happen. However, if you invest a large amount of time outside of class you will come away from the class with skills that will allow you to approach problems in your own field in an applied way.",
    "If you don't have much time and want to enjoy your weekend. Its a not wise choice to take GIS. But you can learn a lot from this course!",
    "Having ArcGIS on your computer is a must, otherwise lectures are largely useless.",
    "This is hard work but extremely fulfilling.",
    "Take vector if you just want to know how to build functional maps",
    "Some of the assignments can be time consuming. Review the concepts and basic steps for each assignment early so that you can ask questions early. Take full advantage of the teaching assistant office hours.",
    "Dont.",
    "I would urge almost anyone at F&ES to take this course because of both the concrete skills that are developed and because of the way the course challenges the thought process. However, I would also warn students not to take this course in conjunction with another course that is very demanding in terms of time. I think that students will get the most out of the course when they genuinely have the time to devote to it.",
    "This course is not for the faint of heart. You must be prepared to spend anywhere from 5-20hrs a week OUTSIDE of class on this course if you want to get it.",
    "Think like a worm.",
    "If you are really serious take a more advanced course for newer tech"
