   "comments": [
    "Economics is a great class. However, the way Larry Samuelson teaches it is awful. We learn formulas during class time and are forced to struggle after to try and figure out what the hell Larry Samuelson was talking about.",
    "Thorough understanding of how modeling individual behavior can be used to assess real economic issues",
    "I learned so much from this class! I think I learned more in this class than I have in any other class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I found this course really satisfying because it showed me that there's an interesting relationship between math and econ. I felt that intro micro was a very hand-wavy course in that we were introduced to theories and models that didn't feel very grounded in quantitative reasoning. Intermediate micro was more developed mathematically, and it was also nice to be able to make sense of the math by using our economic intuition.",
    "I actually feel like I learned so much this semester. This class is soooo hard but at the end you really get a grasp for the material.",
    "I feel like I am leaving ECON 121 with a firm grasp of more advanced economic concepts that built upon the earlier concepts of introductory courses. I enjoyed learning the conceptual\/theoretical pieces of the course, but feel like the class turned out to be more math-heavy than it initially let on in the first week or so.",
    "Utility functions, competitive equilibrium, game theory, what's not to love? I enjoyed how the class focused on econ intuition at it's core, though it was pretty math heavy as far as most social science classes at Yale go. For all our corner solutions - as someone who hasn't taken optimization - I found myself relying on econ-style thinking rather than, say, a method from math class, which was new and welcome.",
    "Ability to solve for profit and utility maximization situations involving one or various agent, competitive markets and monopolies, as well as find competitive equilibria, risk behavior, and more.",
    "I greatly developed my understanding of microeconomics during this course, and learned many new techniques and topics that more rigorously addressed themes I had heard qualitatively mentioned in other classes. By the end of the class, I could mathematically approach many of the possible optimization scenarios at the micro scale of markets.",
    "This was my first course that took a quantitative approach to economics and specifically, microeconomics. The course provided a quantitative view of many concepts taught in Introductory economics and made certain topics more rigorous and precise.",
    "In intermediate microeconomics, I learned how to use economic and mathematical models to represent and solve both real-world and abstract dilemmas. I have relied on quantitative reasoning to examine issues ranging from formal insurance programs and financial market reform to income and excise taxes. The math used to substantiate normative claims in both of these classes has set the necessary groundwork for empirical policy analysis, which I hope to do in my future as an EP&E major.",
    "Learnt math",
    "Very basic econ concepts (that actually, for the most part, don't hold in the real world), and then a lot of practice doing algebra and sort of finicky math.",
    "I learned about the basic theory behind models, and how they were mathematically constructed; I gave critical thought to models, understanding criticisms and mathematical implications while working through problems.",
    "Learned a lot about micro economics, good course to learn some mathematical methods after a micro foundation",
    "Learned the same things as in intro micro, but in more detail and with more math, plus a few new concepts. Profit maximization, market forces, monopoly, oligopoly, clearing markets, market failure, externalities, risk, etc. Lectures are extremely rote, so you don't actually learn methods to solve the pset and exam problems in class, and if you don't get it right away, you must rely on the TA's who try their best but aren't really dependable for helping you gain a solid understanding of the material.",
    "I developed strategic thinking and the formulas and theory that goes with intermediate microeconomics.",
    "Basic economic thought, with a little mathematics",
    "I learned more in-depth models and equations associated with microeconomics, ranging from moral hazard to oligopolies.",
    "I learned how to apply class knowledge in a way i never did before.",
    "I learned a lot about the mathematical aspect of microeconomics. I learned more about what it would be like to study economics at a graduate level.",
    "I learned many basic models of microeconomic analysis.",
    "I learned a lot about optimization under many different scenarios in microeconomics. I learned about individual behavior, which expanded to firms, markets, and examples of market failure. I definitely expanded my critical thinking skills through the various problems, and found lots of insights in policy implications (i.e. taxation) or in other areas.",
    "This class teaches you how to handle long, confusing problem sets with stubborn determination. It covers microeconomic theory, with lots of math-heavy equations and approaches to maximization of profits and determination of efficiency. It did not teach me how to apply these approaches to the real world, but if you stretch yourself and imagine the examples' larger pertinence and did the suggested reading, I imagine it could.",
    "I got better at framing problems and modeling them mathematically",
    "I learned a lot about the mathematics behind micro economics.",
    "How to use calculus to mathematically solve economics problems Most of the concepts covered in this course I had already learned in Intro Micro",
    "My understanding of general economic concepts really excelled.",
    "In this course, I learned quite a few microeconomic models including how to model personal utility, corporate profit, and an exchange economy. Mostly, the skills learned in this course involved a mix of intuitive reasoning and more high level math. Ultimately, whenever we completed a more abstract and theoretical unit, we would apply that knowledge to gain insight on modern day political\/economic issues such as taxing and government spending. Overall, even though many aspects of the course did go over my head, I felt like I learned a fair amount.",
    "I learned and applied fundamental concepts of microeconomics. This course challenged me to develop quantitative and problem solving skills.",
    "This course helped me to develop some good economic intuitions using simple models to understand how people make decisions. I really enjoyed this class, particularly towards the end, when we discussed signaling and market failure.",
    "Honestly, this class applies basic calculous skills into economics. While that is helpful for understanding the rationale for decision making, it makes for a tedious course.",
    "When I started Microeconomics this fall, I simply expected it to be a stepping stone as a prerequisite for higher-level economics courses. The semester has shown me very interesting things, and I now think that I learned more than the course description provides. For me, the most important thing I gained from this course was the sense of economics as a subject with both complex and fundamental ends, which I experienced through the incredible opportunity to see Professor Samuelson's lectures in person (or at least, the lectures that I woke up in time for). Even though I maintain my interest in various areas of economics, I come out the other side with a deeper understanding of how things like adverse selection, duopoly production decisions, and signalling are described in mathematical ways. Even though for the most part it seemed that the models were the most straightforward we could make them (and thus almost trivial), it was interesting that they could describe accurately the kinds of relationships that actually exist in the real world, and I would be interested in learning about the motivations and consequences of these assumptions in future semesters. Finally, I learned a little about organizing and studying, especially towards finals period. It was good.",
    "Genearl microeconomic decision making and things related to markets on a person to person\/micro level. Pretty much learned how to do the calculations and the basic intuition for certain microeconomic topics.",
    "I learned a lot of in depth microeconomics and the math behind it in a way I didn't know before.",
    "I gained a pretty basic array of skills to evaluate economic problems, using single variable calculus (for the most part).",
    "This course is extremely hard, and sometimes rewarding as well. It's good for being able to manipulate rigorous mathematical models and that's about it.",
    "I learned how to approach econ questions from a more quantitative grounding, as opposed to the more theoretical perspective pushed in the intro classes.",
    "Learned more of the math behind the concepts from into micro",
    "Knowledge 1. Utility maximisation 2. Profit maximisation Skills 1. Constrained optimisation 2. General equilibrium 3. Game theory Insights 1. Methodological individualism",
    "ECON 121 took the concepts from introductory microeconomics (plus a few more) and delved deeper, enabling a more thorough understanding of economic concepts and behavior. It's no coincidence that this course is part of the core of the economics major--it helps students gain a strong understanding of microeconomics, and, in a way, teaches students how to turn intuition into mathematical description.",
    "An intermediate understanding of micro-economics and the methodologies to approach it.",
    "I developed some knowledge of basic economics models and how math plays a major role in economics.",
    "I learned how to model microeconomic theory and how to evaluate algebraic solutions to to economic problems."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Get a better teacher.",
    "This was a fantastic course.",
    "This course is incredibly organized. The lectures are interesting. Problem sets are incredibly hard, and can be really stressful because while the problem sets are released a full week before they're due, you don't learn most of the stuff you need to do the entire problem set until the weekend before the due date. Overall, this class is pretty fair; I felt like I was getting the results that I expected given how much work I was putting in.",
    "9 am lecture is DEATH but Larry is always out there smiling and in a good mood so he makes it more bearable. He is a wonderful lecturer and really explains the materials in a way that is clear and engaging. Exams are really hard, occasionally tricky, but at the end of the day pretty fair.",
    "Strength is the course's organization and thematic material. I liked the way the slides for each lecture dealt with an overarching topic (e.g. adverse selection, production economies, etc.), and how the problem sets that week then built upon those understandings. Overall, I found the conceptual interesting engaging and intriguing. The teaching of the mathematical mechanics, however, I think fell short, namely in that they would be rushed through at the end of the lecture. I felt like I left each lecture with a firm grasp of the concepts taught that day, but not necessarily the mechanics I needed to properly evaluate those concepts, especially when called to on problem sets and assessments.",
    "Strengths: number of topics covered; the lectures and Samuelson. Weaknesses: sometimes the homework problems would be worded in confusing ways, but these would get addressed in Piazza so it works out when you're not the first person to look at the pset",
    "The fact that this class was only offered so early this semester was a tremendous hurdle. Waking up in time was difficult and full engagement in lectures was even more so. Samuelson is a good lecturer, but there's only so much a lecture can do. The course lectures deliver one understanding of the material and then the problem sets expect students to totally attack a long set of complex, mathematically-based questions, with only some lecture slides (which are difficult to follow) as reference. The result for me was spending most of my Monday afternoons seeking TA and peer tutor assistance for questions I could not have otherwise figured out on my own. The tests, as well, I felt tried to trick us and throw us off, rather than test that which we had acquired. The tests could surely be easier, giving more basic problems that are similar to what we've seen, and in turn would need less of a grading curve.",
    "Except for the exams, I think every part of this course was excellent. Lectures and sections were interesting and well-taught, the lack of readings minimized workload and confusion, and the problem sets were very reasonable. However, exams did not seem to test knowledge and understanding from the course, but rather the ability to rapidly navigate confusing and tricky recombinations of topics we had studied before. Because of this weird structure, I scored in the high 90s on the first midterm and the mid 60's on the second, despite being equally prepared for both and fully understanding the course material, solely because I had a little less sleep for the second one. Thus, I think this course would be improved if the exams were more straightforward and not actively trying to trip students up, thereby testing their actual understanding of the class and not merely their ability to think on their feet.",
    "They need to find someone who knows how to write questions in clear English. Conceptually not super onerous, but on occasion they delighted in making simple questions complex due to their verbiage.",
    "The course is very strong in how self-contained it is. All the tools needed to address the various applications of the topics covered on exams were either laid out in the lectures or covered in the psets. One point of difficulty, though, was that psets often seemed like lectures in themselves. This observation stems from comparisons of lecture and pset content; to succeed on exams, you needed to study both the lectures AND the psets. I don't mean to imply that this is a weakness of the course--I don't think it is--I just would note that this divergence made doing the psets very difficult. If it weren't for the instruction of my TA, Matt Hom, during sections I would've had a much harder time doing so well on the psets.",
    "Intro to micro is by no means enough preparation for this class. A lot of it was just literal math that I had not done since I was in high school. A major weakness of this course was that we were not told we'd need a pretty rigorous math background to do well in it. I like how the lecture notes etc were posted clearly on the course website, but it would be nice if the answer schemes we're checked for typos (and in the case of the practice finals, if the correct mark scheme was even up). studying was made a thousand times more difficult when you spend hours thinking you were wrong about a question, when actually there is a typo in the answers",
    "This class unfortunately doesn't have many strengths -- perhaps one good part was that it was a reasonable amount of work, and Larry Samuelson seems like a nice, good-humored guy. Also, there was one wonderful peer tutor -- Edward She -- who made the class do-able for me and was truly incredible, so going to office hours with him was wonderful! Besides that, though, most of this class could be improved. The lectures feel only tangentially related to the psets, the tests are tough, and the material just isn't that engaging - you learn a few simple concepts that don't really translate to real-life situations, then spend all semester working through the nitty-gritty math of it.",
    "I thought Larry was a kind and interesting professor who made the course interesting and seem simple--the PSets were interesting and the tests always included interesting questions. The grading curve was friendly (although a little confusing sometimes) and the course was fun! Unfortunately, many of the problems were annoying mathy, having answers that resembled Physics, which threw off a couple of my friends. The course is definitely worth taking though!",
    "Very well organized, learned a lot in a semester, but tests are too harr",
    "This class is like a weekly marathon of confusion. You leave each lecture with a rough understanding of a concept, but feeling confused and hoping that your TA can make things clearer and more concrete. The lectures present mathematical equations and some real life applications, but don't really help you to understand methods for solving pset or exam problems, and Samuelson wasn't that great at explaining complicated concepts. If you find a good TA, she\/he will make a huge difference for you. But, if you don't have a good TA, things will be tough (so shop the TA's!). Samuelson was great at answering students' questions on Piazza though, which I appreciated. The course is based on rote-style learning and doesn't teach you critical\/logical thinking for how to approach economic problems or to think like an economist. So if you don't get how to do the problems right away, you'll have to work hard by going to office hours to understand the material. This course needs to be reimagined. Ideally it should be taught as a seminar or in a flipped classroom style. It would be so much more engaging if the focus was on teaching students how to solve economic problems, rather than just telling students about the concepts in lecture and leaving us on our own to figure out ways to solve the problems and get help from the TA's.",
    "Ridiculous exams that integrated concepts in a convoluted and confusing ways - wording was extremely confusing for exams and problem sets. I feel that I learned nothing valuable from this class, and to be honest, this class was what made my semester here at Yale so miserable. I was honestly disappointed with the teaching and work for the class. First 40 minutes of class was spent to discuss over obvious ideas or about what was happening in the economics news in the world, which is good to know but not when the most important ideas are squished into the last 15 minutes of class.",
    "this course was great. I think if there were more practical examples with numbers during class that wouldve increased my learning. I had trouble learning the concepts in class and only understood them after doing practice problems in final exam practice tests and midterm practice tests.",
    "Professor Samuelson is a great instructor. He is very passionate and is very willing to help students. Classes are interesting and fun.",
    "Professor Samuelson did a good job getting the material across in lecture but the homework and tests were always much harder than what was discussed in lecture. I think the course could be improved if there were more examples and working through problems we would see on tests when lessons are originally taught.",
    "Larry Samuelson is a great lecturer!",
    "This class was very well taught, and between the lectures and Piazza, you could always find help when you needed it. The only thing I would say is that sometimes, much of lecture was conducted off of diagrams drawn on the board, which were not on the slides. It would be helpful if those were on the slides.",
    "Strengths: good overview of microeconomics, professor was generally good Weaknesses: p-sets are far too long (crazy, actually), lectures were boring and sometimes hard to follow, tests were quite strange, and although the grading system is quite lenient, it is unfortunate that how well you do depends completely on how others do",
    "More standardized instructions for teaching fellows. My TA was not very helpful, but others evidently prepared slides and taught their students how to do homework problems. This would have been hugely helpful to me.",
    "Strength: a good overview course for classical microeconomic theories Weakness: not concrete and rigorous enough, can put in more mathematical expressions to support eonomic interpretations",
    "The professor is amazing, the problem sets are good, and my TA (Hom) was very good. I know the professor tries to make it this way, but I wish we had more time on exams. I could do much better if I had time to think about questions rather than rely more on memorization of previous questions.",
    "Excellent instructor.",
    "The course is fairly well organized and well paced. Larry is a good instructor who is very clear. My TA was also great. Unfortunately, the course is quite difficult and I wish the course did not cover so much material - it felt a bit dizzying at times.",
    "Most of the math is difficult to grasp the first time around, and Larry is not the most exciting lecturer, and sometimes makes errors that can throw you off. He does stop for questions in a way that is very effective. Some of the TA's are miles better than others, which can be challenging. If all the TA's were like Matt Hom, I imagine the course would be a lot better for everyone. For the exams and midterms, it would also be helpful to highlight to the entire class - not just verbally in review sessions - which parts of the material are the most essential to review.",
    "I would require readings somehow so lectures don't stand alone as all source material for course",
    "This course is very well taught-- the professor is very organized and on top of a schedule, and the problem sets are challenging. However, I don't feel that the TFs are particularly engaging and although section is sometimes helpful, my TF was not very accessible.",
    "More focus on real world application of concepts learned (e.g. looking at more research\/data). Less focus on material that students will not be responsible for when preparing for exams.",
    "Honestly, having such an early class that is 1.25 hours is really tough and discouraged me from going often.",
    "The professor was an exceptional teacher and lecturer. He also provided a positive and enjoyable classroom environment. He especially did a great job of demonstrating how the mathematical techniques connected with the larger conceptual topics. The testing was fair and the material was appropriately challenging. It would be helpful to have more thorough feedback for each problem set. The grading for the problem sets seemed to be a little ambiguous.",
    "Strengths - interesting material. Weaknesses - overly pedantic teaching, unclear wording on problem sets.",
    "The Course's strengths are that after a lot of the foundation is built in the first few weeks that the material seems to for the most part make intuitive sense (it's all about applying the skills we learned in the first few weeks to more complicated models in the next few months). In terms of weakness, I found that there were some aspects of the course that went completely over my head that we spent a lecture on and then were never tested on (consumer surplus or moral hazard would be an example of this). I just don't understand why we covered those topics, instead it would have been more beneficial to take more time to cover the important topics (at times Professor Samuelson went quite fast). Overall, I find the overarching material of the course to be fascinating, but there were various mini-units that I found to be complicated, boring, and fruitless.",
    "Great course, I don't have any suggestions for improvement",
    "This class was solidly taught and fairly graded. Its one weakness might be that many of the problem sets seemed to have unnecessarily tedious calculations that tested arithmetic rather than concept knowledge. That seems pretty unneeded, but other than that, well done.",
    "This class should not be taught at 9:00am.",
    "The core strength of this course, I believe, is the professor himself, and without him, the course would be entirely different. In lecture, Prof. Samuelson went above and beyond the slides, posing questions and then answering them so that we could think about the models in ways that wouldn't immediately occur to most students. (\"What happens if we do *this*? \") I'm sorry that I didn't spend more time in the TA sessions.",
    "Strengths: The professor was very enthusiastic and made all students feel cared for. Psets were not too difficult and there was plenty of aid through TA sessions, section, and Piazza through which the professor directly answered questions. And the availability of the lecture slides online for printing was a plus. Weaknesses: Class was pretty big and didn't allow for too much individual help. Discussions sections and review sessions all seemed to happen too early and didn't allow for most people who wanted last minute help.",
    "It's a good course for what it is. I don't like p-sets but you need to do them, and Samuelson is a good lecturer.",
    "I thought that the course was strong in that the support for the class was very strong. TA's, Peer tutors, and the instructor (via piazza) were all very useful as resources. When it comes to weaknesses, be aware that the course is offered in a lecture format, which prevents much of the learning from asking questions as you might expect from a seminar-based course.",
    "The problem sets are the foundation of this class, which actually drill the concepts into you well, without which you can't really hope to have mastered the application of any model you learn in class. The cons however are that they're very very ambiguously worded, which means that you actually spend too high an amount of time actually deciphering what the question wants. Have a group of friends to tackle this class with, because it's 70% Econ and 30% cryptography. The class resources are a bit of an issue too. God forbid if you like taking your own notes and you need to miss a class for any reason, the slides only have the basic definitions of each model and the variables involved. The intricacies of Prof Samuelson's teaching, like his graphics and examples are all on the blackboard.",
    "Thought professor Samuelson was AMAZING",
    "Strengths 1. Engaging and pertinent content 2. Lectures are mind-blowing Weaknesses 1. Material given like lecture slides can be confusing 2. Problem set questions have typos or are badly written - leading to more confusion than necessary. Some answers are even wrong.",
    "From a workload perspective, the class is tough. The problem sets themselves are reasonable, but the workload is deceptive in that the course requires a lot of extra time investment to really learn the concepts taught in class. However, this might just be an inevitable consequence of the nature of the essential material taught in the course.",
    "felt that this course was focusing on abstract theoretical concepts too much, especially in the first part of semester. Closer to the end of the semester, with topics such as signaling, adverse selection, monopoly\/duopoly, the course became very engaging and more applicable. I wish the whole course was just as engaging as its third part (between the second midterm and the final) I felt that the slides were lacking of necessary information. I wish there were more practical applications of the formulas and concepts presented.",
    "I could not stay awake, although I tried my hardest.",
    "Professor Samuelson is fantastic. Problem sets were well written and exams were fair. Would have appreciated more help from TAs.",
    "This class really elevates my understanding of microeconomics to a higher level compared to when I took intro. However, the materials of the course are very dense and sometimes the pace of the course is too fast and we don't have time to digest all of them.",
    "Strengths: The concepts and information taught in class are interesting and relevant to the world today. The instructor is enthusiastic and knowledgeable. Weaknesses: The Powerpoint slides are not instructive and are impossible to study off of because nothing is explained and equations are just randomly written down in the middle of the slide with absolutely no idea how they got there. Because the Powerpoint slides were confusing, frustrating, and not useful, I attempted to use the textbook to study the material (it was not required, just suggested as an available resource) but the information in the textbook did not line up with what we were learning in class (different notation, equations, ways of solving problems, organization, emphasis on different concepts) so that it was extremely difficult to try to use as a resource when I didn't understand what was being taught in class. The textbook also covered much more complicated examples and models, which I was not sure if we needed to learn for the class, which then created uncertainty in my studies. The problem sets were not helpful in practicing the information we'd learned and often took us on random tangents into different concepts that never came up again (additionally increasing my confusion over what information I should study). Help available for the problem sets was not sufficient: TA and tutor office hours were always extremely crowded (help sometimes came only every 15 or 20 minutes for each person) and on several occasions these resources actually taught me an incorrect solution to problems. I used all the resources the course had available (peer tutor, TA, office hours, personal tutor) and still did not feel I was being adequately taught the material. Mathematical concepts were brushed over far too quickly for the fact that multivariable calculus was not a prerequisite.",
    "The class is very theoretical with a lot of algebra and equations. The tests were fair, and the problem sets did a good job of preparing students for the exams. The lecture was sometimes hard to follow and some lectures were not covered on the exams. The material at times felt like it didn't have much relevance to anything outside of microeconomic theory in a academic setting which made it hard to engaged in something that was so intangible."

   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Just go into it forewarned: this class is hard. You will spend hours and hours on the p-sets. That said, Larry Samuelson does an excellent job condensing difficult topics into bite-sized pieces. The course is logically organized and each model almost always builds on the next. While this was one of the most challenging and demanding courses I've taken at Yale, it has been one of the most rewarding as well. I'm confident that economics really is my \"thing\" after taking this course. This course is definitely type two fun, but it is all worth it in the end.",
    "I would recommend taking this course with Prof Samuelson if you are a math oriented student or interested in learning more math, but if not and its a requirement for your major then maybe wait until the Spring.",
    "No. Not if Larry Samuelson is teaching it.",
    "Samuelson is extremely thorough and his class is structured very transparently; his emails are clear and you never feel as though you don't know how you are being assessed or what is expected of you. The problem sets take about 5-10 hours a week, depending on how comfortable you are with the material. The hardest part about the course is that Samuelson does a fantastic job of introducing general theories and ideas, but generally leaves it up to you to figure out how to apply them and how to confront and complete the types of problems that you will be asked on problem sets and exams. He rarely does walkthroughs of problems and spends more time speaking to the theory and conceptual understanding of the material. The class is certainly hard, but in all honesty its' pretty over-hyped regarding difficulty level.",
    "Absolutely! -- but only if you like economics. This course is very economics heavy, and if you know you dislike economics, you should not take this course. If you like economics, this is a great course and you should definitely take it! Especially with Professor Samuelson!",
    "It's required. It's dry and the psets take forever, but the exams are fair. Super generous curve, so just take it. If it's not required for you, don't.",
    "This is a wonderful course if you found intro micro interesting but unsatisfying. Take it with Samuelson because his organization of this course is incredible!",
    "No.",
    "Yes. Necessary for the econ major and interesting overall.",
    "I would recommend this course for a student who perhaps enjoys quantitative analysis more so than qualitative analysis. I feel like those students are more well-equipped to answer the types of questions that appear most in the course. That said, I did enjoy the conceptual parts of the course, and think they have merit in themselves.",
    "As a non-Econ, non-anything-requiring-Econ major in this class, there was many a time when someone would ask, \"Why are you taking intermediate microeconomics?\" and I asked myself this a lot as well! The workload is a constant 4-ish hours a week, the lectures are at 9 a.m. (Samuelson is great, but like... do you want to see Lagrange multipliers at 9 freaking a.m. unless you have to?), and sometimes you just don't feel like taking 10+ practice exams in one night. You also learn to be real cynical and think about the utility or signals in pretty much everything, but on the bright side, it's a new perspective of looking at the world, and what a world it is. And for anyone who says, \"I want to take Econ at some point because it's useful,\" 1) lol take an SOM class if you're looking for useful because this ain't it - I repeat, MICROECONOMICS IS NOT FINANCE, 2) find a different class if you want exposure to Econ-style thinking without slogging through all of the math, and 3) if you're neither of those things, try it out, you may like it.",
    "It's a lot of work, it's pretty difficult, and is definitely not worth the trouble if this class is not a requirement for you.",
    "Although you are most likely taking this class as a requirement, I would nonetheless recommend it. The exams are more trick problems than an honest analysis of understanding of the material, but besides this issue the class is pretty good. Workload is minimal (no readings and one 3-5 hour pset per week) and lectures and section are both interesting and well-taught. At the end of the course, you will definitely feel a sense of progress and accomplishment.",
    "Only for the major!",
    "This course is part of the economics and any economic related major, so many are required to take it regardless. I would also recommend this course to those who are interested in economics or those who want explore the field. It provides a good introduction to various concepts in microeconomics through a quantitative lens, which is important in gaining an understanding the various topics taught in the class; although many of the same topics were also covered in the introductory course, the problem sets and more mathematical approach helped me understand the concepts better.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, if the course is required for their major. While I think that the skills taught in this class are valuable on their own, it seems to me that higher levels of economics would help address the over-simplifications of problems we were exposed to here.",
    "This course is just math. Make sure you're refreshed on your calculus!",
    "If you have to take this class, you'll be okay -- it's not fun or intellectually engaging, but the psets aren't awful, and the tests are hard but graded on a curve. It's just a bit of a grind. Find someone good (a good TA or a good peer tutor -- esp. Edward She, if he's still tutoring, is absurdly excellent at teaching and explaining in office hours) who can actually explain the material that you need to know for psets and for tests, because Samuelson's lectures aren't actually that helpful in preparing for tests. If you don't have to take this class, though, steer clear - no more people than necessary need to be in Davies at 9am doing this class.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend the course to anyone who wants to know if Economics is for them, and especially with Larry. Be prepared to deal with ugly numbers, and if you don't have a strong theoretical foundation, the math behind the models will require more time to learn! But still, worth learning.",
    "Yes, not too much work but it is hard to get an A. I really like how we have so many practice tests",
    "If you really love econ and are great at math, or if you want to Credit\/D this course, then I would recommend it. Otherwise, not worth the headache. Advice: Strongly recommend shopping the TA's to find the best one for you, because it really makes a difference. If Matt Hom is still a TA, get him! He's very clear and helps you understand the big picture. Also, go to office hours for help on clarifying things you don't understand. And READ ALL THE PSET SOLUTIONS after they return each of your psets. Even if you get a 10 on a pset, you still may have gotten things wrong, and they hold you to a much higher standard on exams than in psets, so make sure to check the answer keys so you know you're doing things correctly and have the right thinking. Lastly, do all of the practice exams. It's a lot of work, but it helps a lot! You can plan ahead and do one per day the week leading up to the exam.",
    "Please do yourself a favor and find a study group and go to office hours every week to get the problem set done. It easily took me 8-10 hours each week to go over the problem set. Professor Samuelson is amazing, cares about his students, and obviously knows his stuff very well. But it still didn't take away from the fact that this is a very tough class. It made me reconsider if I wanted to major in Economics at all.",
    "NO, if you need to take intermediate, take it in the Spring - that was my mistake.",
    "No if you don't have to take it. Yes, if you do have to take it take it with Samuelson. Ride the curve the best you can. The information is cool but its just so so so so hard.",
    "Only take this course if you need to.",
    "This is a great course though sometimes the materials are tough to understand. It involves a fair bit of maths. P-sets are long. All the TAs were awesome and very helpful. Professor Samuelson is a great instructor. I would recommend taking this class with him.",
    "Do not take this class unless it is required by your major.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Easily one of my favorite classes this semester, in no small part because of Prof. Samuelson. He is an excellent lecturer, and EXTREMELY nice and responsive and cares about his students. The material is interesting, and not hard. It is microecon all over again but with a more mathematical approach. You do not need multivariable calc to pass this class, you don't have to be insanely good at math. It is the same optimization process over and over again - much more important to understand the economic context behind the method.",
    "To be frank, I really did not enjoy this course. Unfortunately, this course is unavoidable for economics, EPE, and applied math (concentration in econ) majors. Although Samuelson is a dedicated professor who definitely knows the material, 9am lectures with a monotonous and slightly boring professor did not facilitate the process of learning this rather difficult material. The p-sets are extremely long (often not necessary), and the calculations are often tedious. There are also always some vague question on the p-set in which someone will ask Samuelson on piazza, to which he usually applies promptly, but also vaguely (which doesn't help). The tests are even worse. I dreaded these tests because I felt like what I studied usually did not reflect on the test, and even worse, although there is a lenient curve, how you do in the class is completely dependent on how well others do. Overall, although I learned the material, I would not recommend this course to those who do not need to take it or to those who just want to \"try it out.\"",
    "Yes, if you are interested in econ.",
    "I would recommend a harder course like ECON 125 if you can handle maths",
    "I was not sure whether I would double major with economics before taking this course but now I am sure that I want to. It was both quantitative and intellectually stimulating, and I learned a lot without excessive work (although plan enough time to do the p-sets!). The final was rather difficult, but do not be intimidated by people who consider this a \"weed-out\" course. They may not go to lecture or not pay attention the whole time; lectures are amazing and directly related to the p-sets and the exams (there is no reading), and if you take good notes in lecture getting an A should not be beyond reach with the typical econ curve in place (despite a difficult question here and there). Overall, I would definitely recommend this course!",
    "A necessary course for many prospective economics majors or interested students. Take it with Larry, he's a great guy and an engaging instructor.",
    "I would recommend it if you don't have too many other heavy courses. I wish I had more time to dedicate to the course so that I would better understand the material.",
    "Unless this is a required class, take this class only if you're really, really into economics. I would not recommend it as a fun exploration of economic concepts. Very time consuming if you want to actually master the material.",
    "only take it if you are considering economics or epe or global affairs, very abstruse \/ not incredibly relevant information",
    "Yes, but I would warn them that it is hard.",
    "Only only only if it's required to complete your major",
    "Only take this course if it is required for your major. Not particularly rewarding.",
    "This is a requisite course, so many have to take it, but actually learn quite a bit.",
    "I would recommend it if it is helpful\/required for your major or as a prerequisite for another class. However, as for general education, I do not think that this class is helpful to people who are not planning future studies in economics (beyond introductory classes).",
    "Unless you plan to major in Econ or some other major that has this course as a requirement, do not take this class.",
    "This is a course that has a bad rep as being an incredibly difficult course and a sort of weed out course in the econ major. I would affirm that this course is quite difficult and I would also affirm that this weeds people out of the econ major. I would probably agree that I would not take this unless it were a part of the major I was pursuing (EP and E). However, I still found the material of the course to be quite interesting and Professor Samuelson to be quite engaging. There are by all means better courses to take at Yale, but if you are looking for a comprehensive overview of microeconomic theory that relates well to some policy questions (such as government tax policy or health insurance policy), I would recommend taking this class. Otherwise, it's not something I would take unless you had to for your major.",
    "This course is mostly taken by students who are required to take it. I would say that it does a good job at getting you to think about big policies through the lens of economics. It is heavily quantitative so pay attention and try to keep up. Go to office hours and you will be alright.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class to someone who is interested in economics and has solid math fundamentals. If someone doesn't fit these two categories, I think they would find this class to be a fairly miserable experience. But yah! I liked it, and I think others would find it pretty interesting too. Really, it is a required course, and I'm sure there a plenty more interesting ones, but it is bearable or even enjoyable if you are prepared for plenty of arithmetic and a few long problem sets.",
    "No. Do not take this class unless you absolutely have to. This course is beyond challenging and, in my opinion, is not satisfying.",
    "Yes, take this course.",
    "Only if it is required for major or requirement, the class is interesting if you find general microeconomics interesting, but most of the work in problem and sets and tests, test how well you can react to different scenarios and can be fairly frustrating. If you don't mind the math and some confusing concepts then this course will be fine.",
    "This class is requirement for many majors. So if you have to take it, Professor Samuelson is great!",
    "If you need to take intermediate micro, I think Samuelson is a great person to take it with. He's an engaging lecturer and good about soliciting student questions.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you have a strong basis in, or feel very comfortable with, mathematics.",
    "I mean, this class had its ups and downs. But anyone taking it is doing so because they have to, either for the Econ major or EPE. So I think you just need to brace yourself and go for it.",
    "Probably don't take it if you don't have to, but if you have to and are willing to commit the time Prof. Samuelson is amazing",
    "Yes, only if you are an economics related major. Course material 1. Very mathematical approach to economics, found I was doing more math than economic intuition 2. Interesting way of approaching how the world works Instructor 1. Responsive on piazza, even the day before the Final 2. Good lecturer who blows your mind 3. But problems with time management: some content left untouched in lectures",
    "Although ECON 121 is a tough, tough class, it is a solid course that introduces students to \"actual economics\" very well. Learning about the way economists describe and quantify behavior is really interesting. However, many concepts may be hard to grasp intuitively, so I would recommend this class only if you're super interested in microeconomics and really want a more mathematical approach to introductory microeconomics, or if your major requires it.",
    "Well, take it only if you absolutely have to. If you are not an Econ major, there are plenty of other courses that are more practical and engaging than this one. Overall, this is a classic Intermediate Micro course with lectures and psets. I felt that this course was focusing on abstract theoretical concepts too much, especially in the first part of semester. Closer to the end of the semester, with topics such as signaling, adverse selection, monopoly\/duopoly, the course became very engaging and more applicable. Be sure that you go to all sections because they are the most helpful. You can skip a couple of lectures, but remember that the slides lack of necessary information.",
    "sure, if you need to take it don't be afraid of it.",
    "If it is a not a prerequisite to your major, I would not necessarily recommend you to take it. Personally I would prefer to take a seminar where we can talk about some of the complex ideas in the course to gain a better understanding of the materials.",
    "This course is difficult. I spent so much time on it, with very little results in the way of actually understanding the material. The way the class is organized and taught makes it difficult to get a good grasp of the concepts and the math side is often brushed over way too quickly. But the concepts and information taught in class are interesting, necessary for any further economics study, and relevant to the world today.",
    "If you are really interested in the specifics of economic models or how situations can be synthesized into equations, I would recommend this course. Otherwise only take it if it is required for your major. Problem sets are difficult as are the tests if math and algebra don't come easy to you. Having taken this class twice, with both Samuelson and Chalioti, I would definitely recommend taking it with Samuelson if you have the option. His teaching is easier to follow."
