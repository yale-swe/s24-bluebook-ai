   "comments": [
    "I think that CHNS 110 is an excellent introduction to learning Chinese. However, I would say that before someone takes it they should be prepared to commit to it because the complexity of the language makes for a very demanding course. If someone, however, is truly interested in learning to speak Chinese the progress that you will make in this class is unbelievable!",
    "CHNS 110 is a very rewarding class; though the courseload is quite heavy, it is all very much worth the 1.5 credits and excellent instruction that you will receive. The material is interesting, the class is well paced (given its intensity) and resources are abundant. If you are considering taking Chinese at all, Yale is the place to be.",
    "Chinese 110 is a lot of work. A lot of work. But I'm going to put it this way. A lot of people expect teachers at Yale to all be phenomenal. This is often not the case, especially when it comes to lectures. When people think of a Half course, in a lot of ways they are envisioning all that is Chinese and the 110: a course that is challenging, rigorous, but incredibly rewarding. It isn't the kind of class that gives As to the smartest\/the prodigies, but the kind of class that rewards the student willing to put in a lot of time. It isn't a difficult class unless you aren't committed, in which case you will definitely flounder. But the fact that in 1 semester I have achieved the proficiency in Chinese that I have is remarkable. Chinese 110 is an incredibly worthwhile class in this way with fantastic teachers and I can wholly recommend it.",
    "CHNS 110 is at first the biggest struggle. Tones make no sense. Characters are lines and dots with no structure. An the sentences don't seem to piece together in just the right way. Yet, as time goes on, the course begins to reward you for the work you put into it. Learning another language is a key to another culture and way of thought.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student if you are willing to put in the 2-3 hours of homework each night. You will learn the language if you do the work. Otherwise, pick a different language.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is will to challenge themselves and receive a huge reward in learning the language of Chinese",
    "Very intense but you learn a lot.",
    "I would only recommend this class if the student has the time and is willing to dedicate 1.5-2 hours everyday on this course.",
    "Chns 110 is an extremely intensive beginning language. You learn about 350 characters and many basic grammar structures. I would recommend that the class should be taken alongside less demanding classes so that your attention can be focused on Chinese.",
    "I would recommend to another student . A lot of work but truly effective to learn language.",
    "There are many language courses at Yale, and Chinese is not an easy pick for a first year student. the students has to be passionate and committed to this course. I would not recommend it to someone who is simply looking to fulfill their language requirement. I would only recommend it to those who have a full interest in learning the language."
