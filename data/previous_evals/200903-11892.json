   "comments": [
    "YES. I mean you have to do it and it's loads of work BUT it's so interesting.",
    "It's music history and you have to take it for the major but luckily the class makes the topic as interesting (and I'm not a fan of music from that period) as it could possible be and even if Haydn makes you fall asleep you still will like the class. Find people to study with before the listening tests and you will do well if you put the work into it. You will love the professor and I'm excited for 352!",
    "Overall, I liked this class more than I expected to, given that I'm not particularly interesting in Baroque and Classical music. But everyone (especially music majors) should have a basic knowledge of this stuff. The reading was a little dull, but lectures were generally very good. If you're good at memorizing tons of facts, you'll be good at the tests. The listening quizzes are a little tougher.",
    "If you think you know anything about Baroque or early classical music, think again. This course offers an intense survey from Monteverdi to Mozart which ties together all aspects of history during this time period. The analyses and historical narratives delivered by Professor Hepokoski are always very well explained and the musical selections highlight the best of the time period. Beware, however, the course moves quickly and the three factual exams and three listening quizzes require a complete understanding of the material. The class also includes a large essay right before thanksgiving break.",
    "This is a great class because Professor Hepokoski is a genius. Take it whether or not you're a music major.",
    "Ifyou're a music major, you have to take it, and it's probably good that you do. If not, you have to have a deep and serious love of Baroque and Classical music to warrant taking the class. It's hard, often dry, and totally exhausting, but rewarding to those who want the information. Not an easy survey class.",
    "351 was a great class. Hepokoski is always thoughtful and entertaining, and although perhaps his real expertise lies in 352, he is still in his element here. Take it!",
    "Absolutely take this class if you have an interest at all in Baroque or Classical music. If you are not a music major and are not comfortable with listening quizzes (or simply don't have much time to study) consider taking it Cr\/D\/F. Hepokoski's lectures are all amazing and I learned a ton.",
    "Even if you are not a music major, this is a class you will not regret taking. Professor Hepokoski is the best lecturer I've had at Yale. You will come out with a deep understanding of the music that we all love to love but usually don't know enough about.",
    "If you like music history, this course is a must. I love music history although I did not know much about these eras going into the course. That is no most definitely changed! I feel my knowledge and understanding of early opera, opera in general, and the evolution of might canonical classical ensembles (string quartet, orchestra, concerto) is vastly improved, not to mention a more fluent understanding of the lives of Mozart, Bach, Haydn, Monteverdi, and many others.Hepo is probably the best professor I've had at Yale. He's just as good in this course as in 352 (although I get the feeling he's a bit more passionate towards the subject matter in 352).Granted, there's a lot of work (three factual exams, three listening tests, one 10-page paper) but it all just makes you that much more knowledgeable in the subject matter! Score.",
    "I'd only take this course as a music major or as someone fairly committed to music, as it involves a lot of dedication to really get what you need out of it. That being said, for those who take it, it's a great survey of some really important composers, and super useful. Hepokoski's passion comes through in his lectures, and you get into the swing of the course and even enjoy listening to the hundreds of songs you'll be tested on.",
    "For a required class, it was really cool. I learned a lot, and I definitely appreciate baroque\/classical music much more now than I used to. I would recommend it to anther student. Though, if they're not a music major, I might tell them to audit it. I don't know how effective the tests and listening quizzes are in building long term knowledge.",
    "Baroque and Classical Music History is a thorough study of the progression of Western music from Monteverdi through Mozart. It covers an extraordinary amount of material and requires substantial mastery of musical and factual material. Hepo is brilliant and an incredibly engaging lecturer. If you're not really interested in the material, the class is not worth it, because you will need to immerse yourself in it to do even passably well. But if you are interested in Western classical music of the Baroque and Classical periods in depth, take the class, because Hepo makes it come alive. If you're a music major, you don't have a choice, but be thankful for Hepo.",
    "Music 351 is a really well-structured, informative, intellectually engaging course. Professor Hepokoski is incredibly intelligent and knowledgeable and engaging. He uses a great balance between musical analysis (in an accessible, non-technical way) and cultural\/contextual analysis. This is one of those rare courses where everything makes sense, and you hardly ever feel like you're lost or doing pointless work. You learn so much both about the music of the period and, more importantly, about its significance and the way music interacts with the larger historical picture. You will leave the course as a more intelligent, more musical, and more meta-historically aware person. Even if I weren't a music major, I would want this to be part of my Yale education. You really can't go wrong with Hepokoski.",
    "This class was OK.It lacked any kind of visual aids and had virtually no class participation. Even Craig Wright would occasionally put together a powerpoint or have students sing and play instruments in class. Dry, dry, dry.The only lecture I really enjoyed was the last one, about the Mozart Dissonance quartet. That was amazing.",
    "MUSI 351 is an amazing class. Initially, the workload seems overwhelming, but the material is so interesting, and Prof. Hepokoski's lectures are so engaging that the work actually becomes enjoyable because you want to learn the information so badly. (At least, that's what happened in my case). Although I was on the verge of not taking this class (since it was my 7th class this term), I am so glad I decided to stay in the class because it is definitely one of my favorite classes at Yale."
