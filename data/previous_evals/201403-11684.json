   "comments": [
    "Chill professor, interesting material, laid back environment, however a few students with strong opinions may dominate the class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students. It's interesting material, taught in a very laid back setting. Professor Conway is an incredibly kind, engaged, knowledgable professor. I wish more of my professors were as understanding and approachable as him.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to any fan of hip hop. I loved having an opportunity to discuss anything and everything hip hop-related. I came in as a fan of hip hop music and left with a better understanding of hip hop culture. Nick is the man and makes the class a great experience. Class consisted of some lecture\/audio\/video component and then plenty of time for discussion. Workload consisted of a review paper and a final creative project, both of which were a lot of fun to work on. If you can get in, definitely take it! You won't regret it.",
    "YES! Nick Conway is amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS, DON'T THINK TWICE, JUST TAKE IT.",
    "Take this class if you want an opportunity to learn about the complexities of hip hop culture, a subject that isn't given nearly enough emphasis at an elite institution like yale.",
    "Chillest and funnest seminar you'll ever take. Don't take the class if you don't intend to fully contribute to the discussion though. Not fair to the many people who can't get in or to fellow classmates.",
    "One of the most fun classes you can take at Yale. Nick is a great professor and person, and you will have a lot of interesting and engaging conversations on music, race, and art.",
    "TAKE IT. Nick is wonderful. Hip hop is such an important subject of study. It can say so much about society, race, and gender. One of the best classes I've had at Yale. The projects were really fun and very personal. Learned so much.",
    "The best. I'll remember it always. THat being said, only take this class if you really care about hip hop. This is not a \"Omg Crooked Smile is my absolutely fave\" type of class. Foh wit that banana bread fakeness.",
    "ABSOLUTELY take this class. Nick is a saint. Not only will you learn so much about hip hop but you will develop a group of really cool friends. Class is so so so chill (I dare you to find a chiller class than this one) but not in a gimmicky gutty kind of chill. I truly looked forward to going to class and having deep but also fun discussions about music and social issues. Nick is one of the most kindhearted and loving people I've ever met. I swear he's enlightened and do yourself a favor and get to know him!",
    "This is a very laid back class. Nick Conway is incredibly knowledgeable, and you will learn a great deal about hip-hop's history and cultural influence. The discussions you have in that class will force you to think about the culture in a number of intriguing ways. I would recommend this class highly whether you are a die-hard hip-hop fan or brand new to the culture. There was certainly a good mix when I took the class, and there was a place for everyone.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anybody who has a general love for music, particularly hip hop, and wants to learn more about the many different aspects of the subject.",
    "100% take it if you can get in! Even though the Friday afternoon timeslot seems a little rough, it definitely is worth it. I went to class off an all-nighter on Friday and walked in to discover we were watching a film and all the lights were dimmed for two hours and ended up more awake than I had been before the class...it's THAT good. I learned so much from it and Professor Conway is the chillest person you will ever meet - so funny and knows SO much about hip-hop. I learned so much about all the different aspects of hip-hop (DJs, breakdancing) and its history. Such a great class and unlike anything else Yale has!",
    "Hip Hop Music and Culture is an excellent course. Nick does a great job of balancing the plan laid out in the syllabus with the interests of the class, and the class sessions touch upon a lot of aspects of hip hop music, the culture, other associated arts (break dancing, graffiti, etc), the hip hop aesthetic, and issues such as cultural appropriation. In one of the first few sessions he will give you a thorough rundown of the history of the beginnings of hip hop, but outside of that, it is a highly interactive course. It's simply amazing how knowledgeable Nick is about the topics we discussed. We began most sessions by going around in circle and sharing anything we wanted to: something interesting we did the past week, news related to hip hop, or anything we wanted to touch on from the readings before class discussion began. This was a good way to ease into the class discussion each week. We had a lot of leeway in terms of what we wanted to do for our final creative project and Nick made himself very available to provide feedback along the way, and everyone in the class put together something amazing. Definitely a must take course.",
    "For those who love hip hop and even for those who don't, I strongly recommend taking the course. You will be challenged to see the genre in different ways, and as a form of cultural expression."
