    "It was great course. Prof. Brooks has a very interesting way of combining a class in thought with formal methods, and he is one of the best teachers I ever had. He keeps formalizations accessible to law students, has lots of original insights and is very responsive to students' comments.",
    "Prof. Brooks is a brilliant thinker and a wonderful human being, but he was very difficult to reach outside of class, making logistics difficult. That aside, the course went over fascinating material and has given me new ways of thinking about both law and economics. Some prior economics training would be very helpful, although Prof. Brooks tried to make the class accessible to all.",
    "Professor Brooks is a kind and brilliant professor, and if you have an interest in reading some of the classics of law and economics and gaining a deep theoretical understanding of law and economics, this is a great class. You should know, however, that the class involves a lot of calculus. Even though the calculus is basic, if you haven't done math in a few years, the second half of the course can be challenging.",
    "Professor Brooks is a great professor, very responsive to his students and clear when teaching complicated subjects. The course material was interesting and expectations were clear."
