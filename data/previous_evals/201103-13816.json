   "comments": [
    "This class is best if writing is something you enjoy and have a genuine interest interest in becoming better at.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this section to another student. Fehrman provides great feedback on your papers and leads very good in-class discussions. It's a class that really encourages student involvement; you therefore end up learning a lot and having quite a bit of fun at the same time.",
    "English 120 is a course designed to help you improve your writing style by emulating successful writers and studying their technique. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Excellent way to improve your writing skills if you're concerned about writing in college.",
    "Highly recommended as a class that teaches you how to write effective nonfiction as well as how to read nonfiction critically. It exposes you to some of the best literary nonfiction of the past century and the reading is more of a joy than a burden.",
    "English 120 was good. Essays are easier to write since they are more personal than literary. The draft and final structure was good for producing good work.",
    "ENGL 120 is a great skills-focused class. You read several essays in six different genres and write six original essays in those genres. Each week, you either have a draft or revised final due but it is not hard to keep up with as only the finals are graded. You get all back with comments. At least once, you pass your draft out to everyone in the class and they will comment in class and on paper.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who can fit in their schedule or who would not otherwise have a chance to develop essay writing skills.",
    "I'd recommend 120 to anyone interested in longform journalism or quality non-fiction, or anyone who wants to write literary non-fiction at Yale or beyond. I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't willing to put serious time and effort in; you probably won't do particularly well or enjoy it much.If you're shopping various sections, I'd highly recommend Craig. He selects great readings, leads entertaining discussions, and will give you detailed, helpful comments on your writing. One of the best professors I've had at Yale."
