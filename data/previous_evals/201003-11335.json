    "Pharm 528 gives an overview of cell signaling with details on some of the major pathways and mechanisms. The class size was really small, which facilitated group studying. I might recommend this course with the warning that the exams are long and require a lot of studying.",

    "Being aware of the different signaling mechanisms and pathways is useful since they play a role in a number of processes. My thesis work is related to signaling, so it was helpful in that respect, but we never directly discussed what I work on.",
    "This course gave me a more thorough understanding of much of the research in my discipline; both in terms of what is currently known as well as experimental approaches used to study these topics."
