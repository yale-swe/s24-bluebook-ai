   "comments": [
    "This is a course that teaches you to read primary texts. For better or worse, there is no secondary literature; this means you have to wrestle with these texts all by yourself. The course is designed, of course, to introduce you to the 16th-c., but it is much more about learning to face an old work and seeing what it has to say. Professor Duval does a good job of helping you acquire certain reading techniques in the first few weeks when you read a number short essays by Montaigne. Later the essays get unwieldy and daunting, and you have to apply what you learned to wade through them. I would recommend this course to anybody who is interested in learning how to establish a meaningful contact with older works."
