    "Yes. One of the best language classes at Yale.",
    "If you're thinking of taking Portuguese, DO IT. I hadn't even considered it before coming to college, but it's definitely one of the best decisions I've made at Yale. The language is really chill compared to many others, yet people still manage to learn the language pretty well. Everyone in my class is capable of basic conversation at this point.Take the class with Marta if you can. She's hilarious and makes getting through a daily class so easy. She'll call you out for messing up and make fun of you, but it's all in good humor. One of my favorite parts of this class was telling great Marta stories to my suitemates over lunch immediately afterwards.Be warned - a big part of the reason that this class is so easy is that essentially everyone knew Spanish or French before coming into the class. The couple of kids who did not know either language struggled tremendously. So if you don't know Spanish or French (but preferably Spanish), you might not want to take this course. It's taught on the assumption that you know one of those languages.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "A very relaxed language class, especially nice to take if you have a very heavy workload otherwise. I wouldn't recommend taking it if you have no prior knowledge of any romance languages though, unless you're willing to put in extra effort. The pace and style of the class would make it hard to keep up otherwise. Generally a good, fun language class.",
    "Fun class! Very little english for an introductory language course, so if that's not your thing look elsewhere. I enjoyed it quite a bit. Try to take it with Marta.",
    "I would highly recommend Portuguese 110 06 to another student. I learned a lot this semester and I plan on continuing with the next level of Portuguese in the spring.",
    "I would recommend this class wholeheartedly. Portuguese is a beautiful language. The class is not alot of work yet you still learn so much. Marta is amazing, but the whole department is really fantastic too. If you know Spanish, it is especially fun to learn. You can see the differences and similarities between the languages and also the pronunciation differences.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course, particularly for students who are unsure of what language to pursue at Yale. Portuguese is a great option, particularly with Marta. It's manageable, but fulfilling.",
    "I would recommend this class to any Yale student as a great way to fulfill your language requirement. However, if you have not had previous exposure to Spanish or another Romance language, there will be a steeper learning curve than for those who can already navigate their way through a passage solely based on similarities to Spanish words. If you do take Portuguese, take it with Marta because she assigns a minimal workload and is very forgiving in grading.",
    "I would only take this class (with Marta as teacher) if you are a fluent Spanish speaker. Neither the class nor the textbook are targeted at actually teaching someone to speak Portuguese. If you do decide to take this class, I would recommend buying a different textbook and being prepared to use Google Translate and other web resources extensively."
