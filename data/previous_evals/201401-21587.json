   "comments": [
    "Awesome class, you learn a lot about actual economics in a very interesting way and from a different angle than the one we got used to. Prof. Wallis is engaging and explains the material in an interesting way. You'll learn so much about many different topics.",
    "This class covered some literature and perspectives on early American history, from around 1780 to the 1840s. It was interesting, sometimes engaging. The essays with Professor Wallis covered interesting material.",
    "It's an easy writing credit but it's pretty rough to have to sit through.",
    "Great Econ\/WR Credit.",
    "It was very focused on the period from 1800 to 1840, so if you are looking for a survey course this is not the course for you. It gives a new perspective that you would have never seen before though.",
    "no",
    "This is a pretty straight-forward, boring lecture class. I really wouldn't take it unless you are looking for a class that you won't really need to go to. If you go, you will kind of regret it. Pretty simple writing credit, though.",
    "Really boring class and the final 30 page paper turns out to be quite some work. You'll have to use references for basically every statement you make, so my paper had about 130 references in the footnotes in the end. There's definitely an easier and more enjoyable way to get a writing credit as an econ major.",
    "Yes-- if you're looking for a relatively easy writing credit... 3 5-10 page papers that get combined into one large final paper.",
    "Don't take this class unless you have to. It's easy and a writing credit, but if Prof. Wallis is teaching it stay away.",
    "Highly recommend for an easy econ or writing credit.",
    "Take it if you need a WR (and want an easy final)",
    "Don't take this class (at least, not with Prof. Wallis)\u2014it's the biggest gut I've ever seen!!!",
    "Do not take this class.",
    "Take it with Wallis. You learn a lot, you work a fair amount but not too much, and you get a good grade in return.",
    "Fascinating overview of U.S. economic history that traces American development from the Revolution to 1840. It offers compelling explanations for America\u2019s transformation into a modern economy. Lecture is fun, but the papers take a fair bit of work.",
    "TAKE IT. Graded very fair and easily. Final was absolute joke. Essays were graded a bit harder, guess it depends on who your TF was, but you should be able to make it up no problem on the final. No one really went to class, which was also nice.",
    "Super easy, take it, excellent writing credit! 20pg paper written 6 pages at a time + simple final (content is extremely easy to understand and study for)",
    "A simple, straightforward, and gutty history or economics class that includes a WR credit.",
    "Depends on who's teaching it and how it's taught. Professor Wallis was great.",
    "it was ok",
    "Its a good class, there is a lot of interesting reading but you do not need to read too much to write the papers. Do well on the papers and you'll do well in the class.",
    "This is not a mentally difficult class. Waliis's lectures and readings layout the papers very nicely (only have to do maybe 5-7 of all the readings, mostly the ones Wallis authored or co-authored and they are very well written and easy to read). The papers are more tedious than difficult (three 10 pages papers and one 9000 word essay at the end that combines and edits the previous papers). And the final is an absolute joke.",
    "would summarize ECON 182 as an excellent, interesting, potentially challenging but ultimately very manageable course. I would definitely recommend it to students majoring in economics, history, or anyone else.",
    "straightforward course, great writing credit. lectures are often boring but there's usually no need to go because the slides are posted online.",
    "Good econ and writing credit. My writing improved from the class but you get what you put in from the class.",
    "I highly recommend American Economic History to econ majors who want a solid background in the history of the growth of the American economy and a writing credit.",
    "Great class, great professor. Too bad he was visiting, and y'all will just have to pray that econ department gets a good replacement. Will curse of 182 continue..?",
    "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! I don't have any specific advice since Professor Wallis won't be teaching the class next time around, but I would take this class if I were you. I'm a history major and I was worried that I wouldn't understand the economic aspects of this class, but it wasn't too hard and I learned a lot. Seriously, I have a better grasp of how economics works now than I did after my intro economics class. And I now understand early 19th century America better, too! It was a part my teachers had skipped over in high school, that gap in named presidents between Jackson and Lincoln, but I now know that a lot of really interesting things were going on during that period of history.",
    "Good WR for econ majors. Extremely easy to get an A as the final is a total joke. The papers take a while to write but are also graded pretty easily. The class was extremely specific--we learned only learned about a 50 year period, but you come away knowing that period quite well. There was no need to go to lecture which was nice.",
    "This course wasn't very difficult in terms of grading, but I did feel that I learned a lot about the United States economy, especially in the 1800s.",
    "I really disliked this class until about Spring Break (because I didn't enjoy lecture, hadn't done most of the readings, and hadn't learned much), but the papers changed my opinion about the course completely- I loved the last month and half of class. The papers were a pain to write, because they were due in rapid succession, but I learned a lot while writing them. If you're an Econ major looking for a solid, non-mathematical Econ credit, go ahead and take this class.",
    "I wil recommend this class to any student that likes history! It is a great class, professor is a good lecturer, and it is not hard. The power points of the class are also great, just in case you miss lecture. The only downside is that the title of the class is not entirely correct, since you do not cover all American Economic History but cover only from 1790 to 1850. That said, it is a pretty interesting period of time and crucial for what the country is today, so no harm in taking the class. It is also a writing credit!",
    "Lectures are good but class is very disorganized. Take something else if you can.",
    "Yes. Its a great writing credit",
    "This course was very enjoyable, particularly for a writing course. I think that the time period that the course focused on was a bit narrow and I wish we got to explore a broader range of American Economic History. Professor Wallis was great and he was very approachable, knowledgable, and funny. He made lecture worth attending.",
    "Absolutely. A great course for anyone interested in history of the US or in Econ",
    "This is the best course I ever took at Yale but only because of the instructor, John Wallis, who was a visiting professor from the University of Maryland in Spring, 2014. I have no idea what the course would be like with a different instructor.",
    "An in depth exploration of the relationship between politics and economics in America from 1800-1840. Don't expect this to be a discussion of the industrial revolution or any recent events. However, it is interested to understand the foundations upon which our countries economy was built so I would recommend the class.",
    "Econ 182 is a great course to understand the foundations of the American economic growth into the modern economy. Though at first the material may not seem as intriguing, in the end everything ties together well and the papers allow one to have a clear, strong foundation regarding how American came to modernize to the modern economy.",
    "yes, recommend. but N\/A.",
    "This is hands down the biggest gut at Yale, but not in terms of workload. The entire semester consists of 3 papers and 1 cumulative paper, each 5-10 pages long. If you're serious about these, they can take quite a while. On the other hand, Wallis specifically makes these NOT research papers, so 0 reading is necessary for the entire class - all you have to do is read the lecture notes. Papers are mainly just a synthesis of what we went over in class, aka rehashing what was on the slides. The TAs are instructed to grade very easily, so one could pass with minimal (1 hr\/week) effort. This is where the gut aspect kicks in. An A in the class is 80% or higher, and the rubric for getting an A on a paper is to include everything Wallis says to include (oh, forgot to mention that he had a guideline on exactly what to include for each paper). The final is a complete joke: 35 points of multiple choice, true and false, and comically easy fill in the blank. Most students finished in less than 15 minutes. I think at least 95% of the class got an A, which really magnifies Yale's reputation for severe grade inflation. Seriously, in a class of ~200 students, the professor gives 190 of them an A? Ridiculous.",
    "The course tends to vary due to the difference in visiting professors, yet I would recommend this class to people. I know most people would not, but I found the class enriching. Also, the papers improved my writing, and the final assignment - a compilation of the papers - was a good exercise to finish with.",
    "I took this class because I needed an American history distribution credit for my history major. I learned a lot from this class, because the professor (who won't be teaching next year) did a wonderful job of spinning a narrative and incorporating economic trends into historical events. Just be aware that the class has an extremely narrow scope (it only goes from about 1776 - 1840) and at least the way Professor Wallis taught it, it was almost completely based on his research and included basically no dissenting viewpoints.",
    "Learn about how the US states realized transportation and banking investments in the first half of the 19th century.",
    "It's a highly focused class: we looked mostly at state investments in the 19th century. That said, it's a very interesting and well taught focused class: Professor Wallis is a great lecturer, and I learned a lot about topics I hadn't heard of before. I would recommend this class.",
    "Definitely recommend it as it provided students with significant knowledge of how economics played a role in the country's history. Important for any Yale student to understand.",
    "Econ 182 01 is not a survey of American economic history, but a class focused on the writings of Professor John Wallis. Nevertheless, it is highly interesting and you develop an opinion on the nature of American economic growth in early America. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it is interesting and a good writing credit.",
    "ECON 182 with Professor Wallis was an in depth study of the interaction between politics and economics in a period in the US between 1800 and 1850. What is so great about this class is that it applies to all politics and economics today. It was an incredible learning experience, and the workload was managable although a Little heavier at the end of the semester.",
    "ECON 182 looks at the origins of Economic growth in America (1790-1850). Unfortunately, the course is very specific to the professor that offered it. Prof. Wallis is a visiting Prof from Maryland so I think that it is difficult to answer this question given that he will not be the one teaching it next time the class is offered.",
    "Sweet lecture, no work ever except the papers. And you learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this course to all of my friends.",
    "Highly recommended. But it wouldn't be as easy as the last semester, as Professor Wallis was extremely chill."
