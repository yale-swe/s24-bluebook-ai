   "comments": [
    "I didn't particularly enjoy the structure of the seminar - partly because of the make up of the class, partly because of the questions that were asked, and partly because of the way Professor Davis directed discussion (and responded to questions). That said, the reading was great, and the resources and methodology we were exposed to seem absolutely essential to any Sinologist\/sociologist, or in fact anyone who wants to do serious social science research.Most importantly for anyone who is studying modern China, this course will give you a chance to interact with Deborah Davis. She is the most incredibly supportive professor I've met at Yale thus far, and really believes that her students can produce worthwhile work. She is also a rigorous researcher with a massive wealth of knowledge about China - she has been studying China for something like 45 years, and will introduce you to the people, databases, and methods you need to do worthwhile reading and research on the country.",
    "Overall a great class. Some of the readings were slightly tedious but gives an overall great perspective regarding social inequity in China.",
    "Take it if you're interested in China-- maybe don't if you're not.",
    "I don't think I would recommend this class to students who only have a mild interest in China or have never personally been to China. I feel like this class is tailored to people who have a commitment to China and a good bit of personal experience there. If you fit that description, you'd probably enjoy the class.",
    "Yes. I would recommend sociology 395 to students interested in taking a class with Professor Davis (which students who are interested in China should) and are up for the challenge of participating in Chinese language only sections (also tremendously helpful!).",
    "This course gives you a solid background to some of the most important issues regarding poverty and wealth in Modern China. We read numerous articles from Prof Davis's book, on topics ranging from education to healthcare to the structure of the class system.",
    "Poverty and Wealth in Modern China provides a sound introduction to the changing economy and society in China, particularly with respect to changing distributions of opportunities and outcomes from communism to state-led capitalism. The course studies what people get in China (consumption, distribution); it does not study, or not as extensively, the means by which people could get more or different amounts than they have now (production, redistribution). So, it is better as a sociology class than as an economics or policy class. The best feature of the course are the written assignments. Each assignment emphasizes a slightly different skill\u0097film review, data analysis, poverty policy\u0097and comes with sufficient frequency to keep students working with the readings. The weakness of the course was discussion. Participation was limited, and the depth of discussion on some days could have been greater. Ideally this will be corrected by next year--and you'll be a part of the reason why. Also, as for evaluating the course during shopping period: this year, the second week\u0092s reading (the first readings most students got to) was devoted to narration that was, by declaration of the professor herself, completely unlike anything that would follow after.So, if this is still the case for your year, you will have to judge how you and your peers will relate to the material without benefit of actually seeing and working with it in discussion. To this end, I would recommend getting the syllabus, reading the first assignment that is listed from a sociology source (this year, and seeing if you\u0092d enjoy reading and talking about that sort of thing.",
    "A strange course. On one hand, you learn a lot about the structural challenges and problems inherent in Chinese society and read some interesting and important papers. On the other hand, assignments were strange and badly-timed, and discussion often revolved around minor theoretical details of the readings or abstract bs spouted by people who have only been to China for a summer and know little about the culture. Deborah Davis is great, and the Chinese discussion sections were awesome, but I'm not really sure how I feel about the seminar itself.",
    "The reading is quite statistics and economics heavy, so a sound understanding of those subjects can be very helpful. I often found myself at odds with the professor and the rest of the class about what I found interesting in the reading. I think more humanities-oriented students might feel the same way. Nevertheless, I feel like I learned a lot in the class, even if I couldn't always make the most helpful contributions.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class because it provides data behind the stories you see about poverty in China. (Though the course is called Wealth and Poverty, it's mostly about poverty.) Davis is very thorough and absolutely knows her stuff. You should take the class just to be in the room with her."
