    "Great class. Take it.",
    "If you can take it, take it. I really learned a lot and loved every moment in this class. That being said, you should really only be in here if you're interested in the subject.",
    "This is a must take if you are at all interested in the field of conservation! You'll make paper, analyze paintings with UV light, learn about the Old Master painters, and so, so, much more. For me at least, every class was a joy to go to and I feel like I learned so much over the course of the semester. The papers are also a wonderful writing experience.",
    "Introduction to conservation and conservation practice as well as materials analysis, especially good for art history majors, insight into art analysis, chance to learn more about Yale art and rare book collections.",
    "I would recommend this class with all of my heart!",
    "This is a great class to learn a lot without doing a ton of work. You learn a lot in the lectures and by writing the papers, but not all of the readings are always necessary to understand the class. It is a great class to take for art history majors.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. It will be an experience unlike any other in terms of classes at Yale. Prof Fairbanks is amazing and the other guest lecturers are experts in their fields. Take this class; it will be what you look forward to in your week.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class! I think an appreciation of conservation techniques and art processes is invaluable for anyone with an interest in any aspect of art history or art-making. I feelas though many areas of my knowledge that felt a little vague before have been clarified (how long did I spend reading the word 'aquatint' on a regular basis, having no idea what it was?). I was blown away by how much hands-on experience in observing objects in the lab we had. The workload was totally manageable, and classes were always fascinating and often totally relaxing(paper-making and making terracotta figures were highlights!). One of the most enjoyable and informative classes I've taken in 4 years at Yale!",
    "History of Art 403 is an indepth view and introduction to conservation of works of art on paper. The class covers artistic techniques, materials used in creation of works of art, current issues and research in conservation. I would, without hesitation, recommend this course.",
    "This course provides an excellent overview on a variety of connoisseurial and conservation issues and techniques in a range of media. I would highly recommend it to students looking to better understand material art history.",
    "Take it.",
    "Connoisseurship& Conservation is a delightful class. It was not a very taxing class, and yet I learned a great deal and see art objects from a new perspective. You get an interesting glimpse at the behind-the-scenes world of art conservation, touring various facilities on campus and talking to conservators. Along with that, you get to experience the materials you discuss hands on\u00e2\u0080\u0094scribbling with chalk, moulding terra cotta, even making paper. And on top of it all, I now know how to spell connoisseurship!",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to students, and I think it should be a requirement for undergrads and even graduate students. Art History students need more training in close observation - this course equips you with an essential, but rarely-taught, set of questions to use when approaching any object."
