   "comments": [
    "Formal Foundations is an interesting way to explore the math underlying linguistic theories (mostly in syntax but some in phonology). I enjoyed and looked forward to all of the classes, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in linguistics, cognitive science, or language in general.However, be aware that this class is not an easy QR. Its goal is to answer big questions about how to represent language and cognition formally, and this requires some serious math. I often spent 8-10 hours on problem sets, and much more than that on the midterm and final (I am a linguistics major with little math background).",
    "Take it if you are into linguistic theory or enjoy proving things with mathematical proofs. Although this course has no prerequisites, I strongly caution you to think twice before enrolling in this class without having first taken a course in semantics - or at least, that is what they told me shortly after midterms had come around. For that reason, it is not the best QR that a student can take to fulfill a requirement.",
    "This course had two parts: the first half focused on presenting the set-theoretic formalism needed to discuss algebraic structures rigorously, while the second half focused primarily on grammars and automata. I would recommend this if you have little to no experience with formal mathematics or are interested in learning how axiomatic set theory is applied in linguistics. An aside: Prof. Frank required that all problem sets be typeset (e.g. with LaTeX). This certainly added to the time spent on the weekly problem sets, but it was good practice, if you're looking for that.",
    "Very intelligent, invested professor. Basically weekly problem sets, which require a good amount of work (to do and to typeset) but which are really interesting and satisfying in the end. No tests or quizzes or anything, which is really nice -- midterm and final are each just a slightly more extensive problem set.Class was very interesting. Lets you see the intersection of math and linguistics. Probably the class will be more work if you aren't particularly mathematically-minded, but still interesting and worth the work. Definitely recommended, unless you really don't like math.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in a formal approach to linguistics."
