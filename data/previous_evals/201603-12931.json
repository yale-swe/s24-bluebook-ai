    "Not much",
    "I learned to think about quantum mechanics in a whole new way and to derive things I had previously taken for granted. I was exposed to concepts with which I had no familiarity in a way that was very accessible. I learned how to think more abstractly about operators and kets, moving away from coordinate-space and vector\/matrix representations.",
    "I feel that I gained a very solid understanding of the geometric aspects of quantum mechanics from this course, and that the course covered Sakurai effectively.",
    "I furthered my knowledge of quantum mechanics. This course is specially helpful to get used to Sakurai's notation.",
    "Reviewed the basics of quantum mechanics in a more formal manner",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course depends heavily on students having been adequately taught quantum mechanics as undergraduates. The students who did not have a strong undergraduate background in QM tended to struggle with the material, and little could be done to help them. Additional preliminary review sessions early in the course could have helped with this. Students with a strong QM background tended to learn very little, while students without such a background tended to become lost early in the semester.",
    "Good course",
    "The instructor is what made this course so good. I'll write more below. In terms of weaknesses, my one criticism is that I wish we had gone over more examples of the Feynman path integral formulation. The course could be improved by changing how homework problems are assigned. A lot of the problems involved a great deal of rather time-consuming algebra that didn't teach me that much. Clearer guidelines on when we could use computational tools to reduce this kind of effort would have made my learning more efficient.",
    "The course was strong for its emphasis on the role of symmetry and geometry in quantum mechanics. Instead of only covering a \"shut-up-and-calculate\" approach, which would largely have been covered in any undergraduate course, the course laid a solid groundwork in stating the assumptions from which quantum mechanics is built. A weakness was the lack discussion of what was important enough to go on an exam, as opposed to what was not. It would have been easier to prepare for exams if we had more clearly discussed the exam scope. For instance, I had heard that the midterm exam would cover the WKB approximation (which is seldom used in modern quantum mechanics research contexts; I am unlikely to use it in a research setting), but the WKB method was not on the midterm, and it was just a short answer question on the final.",
    "The level of the homework could be more similar to the level of the exams.",
    "I think the class could be improved with more TA sessions to revise the material throughout the semester (but the TA was super helpful in any case). It was also a little weird when we got to the WKB approximation, the Wigner-Eckart theorem, and SO(4) symmetry. Maybe explaining these topics in better detail or having an extra TA session about it would have helped. Otherwise, I think the course was solid.",
    "It was often very hard to follow since there weren't many examples worked into lectures, and the homework problems were often not very insightful for the material as a whole.",
    "The lectures were fairly redundant with the textbook."

   "comments": [
    "Yes in theory it is a good course.",
    "Yes. I found it challenging but also extremely interesting.",
    "Yes so you can really learn about quantum mechanics",
    "If you need to take it, yes (I mean, you don't have much of a choice). If you don't, it depends on what you want to get out of it. If you want to build on your skills in quantum and learn some new material, it should be helpful.",
    "If you're a math major, be careful, physicists don't state the math at the beginning. The math comes after the examples, or sometimes not at all. If you're ok with working out the math as you go, quantum mechanics is an incredibly interesting subject."
