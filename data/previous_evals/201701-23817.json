   "comments": [
    "Lots of things! My brain is too tired to list them. But I learned. Definitely.",
    "I learned a great, great deal about reporting AND editing, writing AND reading. I hoped to exit the class a better journalist, and I think I will leave a better artist, in a sense, more prepared and confident to tell stories that don't just educate but also entertain.",
    "I learned how to craft a long form and short form journalistic piece by sythesizing both structural and stylistic components. I learned how to craft a lede and nut graf and how to find a story a flesh it out. I learned what questions to ask and what makes for a good story.",
    "Learned how to write narrative journalism, plain and simple. Great class.",
    "Learned about how to research, interview, and craft a narrative journalism. A really interesting class in that it forces you to be accountable to someone outside of Yalethe subject of your pieces. Made me look at and read narrative journalism in new ways, which was cool. Got to hear firsthand what careers in journalism can look like, from two who are actively working in the field.",
    "A real-world journalism experience in a classroom setting--the format of the course allowed us to discuss practical challenges and demands in the career of a journalist as well as principles and techniques used in the field. We later got to apply our knowledge in the pieces we wrote.",
    "I learned how to think like a journalist, how to figure out what the story behind a piece really is, and how to give and receive feedback on reported pieces. I got to step out of my comfort zone when interviewing people, and the class helped give me more confidence. Practically speaking, I learned a lot about the industry of magazine journalism from Annie and Jake. Each had a unique and fascinating perspective as well as lots of stories about their work.",
    "Working with two professional journalists gave me a better idea of what it's actually like to work in the field. I think I improved in how I conduct interviews, how I organize my notes, and especially how I go about actually writing and editing a long-form narrative piece."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strength: I like that we spent the semester working on 2 pieces, and that we got to workshop both of them. It really gave us the opportunity to make something really good, rather than just dashing it off to meet a deadline. I also generally liked the readings, and appreciated the opportunity to learn from two highly qualified journalists. Weakness\/room for improvement: I think the discussions of the readings could have been a little more structured at times. It would've been cool to have a clearer picture of what each one was supposed to teach us (ex: this one is really good at ____. This one is an example of ____). With any piece, there will be lots of other things to discuss besides those themes (and I enjoyed those discussions still). However, I think there were some moments where the instructors could have narrowed down the focus more to distill the lesson a little more neatly.",
    "Strengths: amazing reading list, amazing syllabus structure and assignments, and taught by two amazing amazing professionals Weaknesses: the fact-checking assignment was interesting, but did pose problems for a lot of folks. Could have been worse, certainly. Also, though I love Jake and his truly wonderful stories, sometimes I felt bad that Annie asked most of the questions and didn't share nearly as many of her own stories. That's probably as much a reflection on their personalities (Annie the consummate interrogator and Jake the preferred storyteller) but sometimes the imbalance seemed a tad conspicuous",
    "Strengths are the incredible professors and their ability to push the students to get out and truly report on the world around them. Weaknesses are that the readings could be better.",
    "Annie and Jake are great co-teachers and they make sure that each session teaches you practical skills and also includes more abstract conversations about journalistic ethics and the ins and outs of storytelling. The group editing is great. I liked the variety of assignments, but it might almost have been better if we spent the whole term working on one assignment, fact-checked it ourselves, and then tried to publish it in a Yale publication.",
    "I thought it was a really perfect workload, with a ton of support and individualized attention. It was one of the best classes I've taken in four years of Yale. Only critique is that I felt like the weekly feedback format could have been varied. I found the two questions to be a little narrow, and there was often more I wanted to say. It was also weird to rewrite other people's writing, and I found it wasn't that helpful when I had to do it myself, or for my own writing.",
    "Strengths only I would say--and that is the professors. Annie and Jake are so honest, approachable and helpful.",
    "The best parts of the class involved receiving feedback one-on-one from Annie and Jake, getting feedback from classmates, and listening to all of Annie's and Jake's stories. What really makes the class what it is is how dedicated Annie and Jake are. They make sure you feel like you're being supported throughout the process of writing an article. The readings are all fascinating, but I felt like we didn't discuss them all as thoroughly as we could have. Maybe it would be better to just have one class session dedicated to workshop, one session dedicated to readings, etc.",
    "I wish it met twice a week instead of once a week. Jake and Annie are amazing at what they do, so it was a privilege to hear them talk about their work. All of the readings were interesting, and by the end of the course I had two articles that I felt proud of and enjoyed writing."

    "Absolutely. A class if you want to read good writing, write good feedback, and practice journalistic craft at a pace that gives you room to actually think about and improve on your writing without killing yourself in the process.",
    "Absolute must-take. Better, more fun, more engaging, and more rewarding than \"Journalism\" in the English department. All around, a great great class. You will become not just a better writer, but a better reader; not just a better journalist, but a better editor. This is an awesome class for anyone who reads The Washington Post or The New Yorker, who loves telling stories or loves writing. Annie and Jake are consummate professionals. You'll never have the opportunity to learn as much as quickly in as comfortable an environment as you will in this class. In short, take take take!",
    "Absolutely. Amazing opportunity and great class. Jake is brilliant-a bit crazy, a few odd behaviors-but really a good journalism teacher. Annie is lovely. The two compliment one another, except that Jake has a certain \"machismo\" that sometimes is overbearing and drowns out Annie, who is a fabulous professor--Jake, you don't need to sit at the front of the classroom each time (for instance). He's an awesome, caring professor though and I think the class is one of the best I have taken at Yale.",
    "Great intro to magazine journalism writing and great reading list.",
    "A truly terrific writing course, with a ton of individual attention but not so much work that you will die. Great, especially in comparison to other writing courses, which are full of the best writers at Yale. Because this is a college seminar, people are at varying levels of experience, so it's a really open place to learn, and you can really shine if you're at that level.",
    "YES! You will learn so much from Annie and Jake--they are so amazing. If journalism ever is\/was\/will be on the charts for you or even if you are an avid reader of the New Yorker, this class will expose you to the field in the most interesting and and engaging manner.",
    "A great, great class to take if you have any interest in journalism or just want to write better. Annie and Jake are so helpful in leading you through the process of writing an article and they give great feedback. They're incredibly dedicated and kind instructors, and it feels like they give it their all. The workload is pretty low, which is good, because the reporting you do can take a while. I felt like I learned an incredible amount about the journalism industry, how to tell stories, and how to structure stories. It's interesting to have both Annie and Jake teach because each has a unique perspective on things. Also interesting because their teaching dynamic is a lot of Jake loving to tell stories about his work and Annie loving to ask questions about Jake's work and there wasn't always balance. Still, a great duo of awesome teachers. Readings felt kind of optional too (good thing or bad thing, you decide)."
