    "PHIL 703 was an exploration of issues surrounding the problem of evil and the doctrine of hell. I would recommend it as very interesting (if a little disorganized).",
    "Very good course -- expanded my understanding of the Problem of Evil considerably and opened up a lo of new ways of thinking about it. Sometimes it felt like the protracted musings of Professor Keith DeRose, but he has very interesting musings, so it was all cool.",
    "A comprehensive overview of the problem of evil and a good survey of its major philosophical contributors. Highly recommended.",
    "The course investigates the different arguments concerning the coexistence of an OOPG and evil. I would recommend it if the person has an interest in an OOPG."
