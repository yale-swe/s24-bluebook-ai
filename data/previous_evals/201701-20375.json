   "comments": [
    "How research works",
    "I learned how to design an experiment with financial constraints in mind. I also learned that a lot of designing an experiment is seeing what other research has been done before your own.",
    "This course taught me to become a more independent researcher and to really delve into completing an undergraduate research project. I learned technical skills and methods pertinent to my lab, and also gained insight into the process of designing experiments.",
    "I learned how to do imaging analysis, which is a tool needed for my project. I also learned how to write a research paper and deliver a presentation. It was also a great experience to learn how to work with others for this project."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I wish that the senior project also had the option to do a design project. Most other engineering majors at Yale have this option and I believe it would've greatly strengthened my BME education on the whole.",
    "Many PIs don't feel like one semester is long enough for a senior project, so the BME department should create an infrastructure that funnels students into labs prior to spring semester of senior year. The experience is also extremely variable depending on the advisor.",
    "I think that senior project is very much dependent on your PI and grad student. Unfortunately, it becomes very difficult to get into a lab that you are interested in and invested in with a desirable culture, based on the structure of the BME curriculum and how the department is set up. You don't get a chance to meet many of the professors in the department and many professors are unresponsive when you ask to work in their lab. Furthermore, it is unfortunate that the senior project is so geared and biased towards lab research. This is symptomatic of the entire curriculum and departure. There is very little opportunity to get involved in biodevices and biotechnology. Instead, engineering is limited to research. There should be more opportunities in general to develop what it means to be a biomedical engineer. There is so little opportunity to develop practical skills, and it really only comes in electives. It seems like only a couple facets of BME are represented within the major, and that was very much echoed in senior projects. The BME major needs to find ways to expand its curriculum to engage students.",
    "Strengths are that the course is very hands-off and is thus very flexible to shape according to what would best help the lab and professor. Weaknesses are that it sometimes does not provide enough hands-on guidance throughout the semester. It could be improved by giving examples of stellar final presentations and reports as a guide for students, and by having one or two more informal check-ins throughout the semester.",
    "I think that it was great to be able to work directly with my mentor. I really got a glimpse into what it means to work in a research setting. I also thought the end of semester presentations were great because we got to learn what everyone had been working on for the semester.",
    "I wish there was a team project choice for the capstone, instead of just an paper"

   "comments": [
    "This is a required course for the major, but can be taken earlier. It may be wise to plan for a one-year project instead of a one-semester project.",
    "Yes, I would. This course gives you the motivation to complete an undergraduate research project and thus is very valuable.",
    "If you are a BME major, you have to take this course second semester to fulfill the major requirements."
