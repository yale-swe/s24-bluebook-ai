    "Good level 2 language class.",
    "Somehow, the merits of the language managed to shine through despite the class itself, so if you can take it with Marta, do it.",

    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It's a fun, chill course, and totally worth your while if you want to learn Brazilian portuguese :)",
    "yes!",
    "It truly depends on the professor. I've heard Marta's better, but Prof. Jackson is such a sweet guy (and really smart). Portuguese is also awesome, so learn it.",
    "Portuguese 120 will really help any student to learn portuguese. After taking this class you will know a lot of information about Brazil and the Brazilian culture, and you will also have been exposed to all the grammar forms which make up the Brazilian Portuguese language. I would definitely recommend taking this class, but would warn that a student must practice the language often outside of class in order to get the full benefit of the course."
