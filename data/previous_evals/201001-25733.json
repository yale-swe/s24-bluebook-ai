   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course if you like sequences and series. The entire semester essentially consists of integration, applications thereof, and sequences and series. Not alot of homework, but the tests are somewhat difficult.",
    "This class demands a much more in depth understanding of the material than the teachers seem able to teach. I found myself finding it much more convenient to skip class and learn from the book. But even though my teacher had a heavy Russian accent, he made the class quite enjoyable. Accents aren't as bad as people make them out to be, they just take getting used to.",
    "Take it if you need it - but it moves quickly so be prepared to learn out of the book a lot.",
    "A difficult course . If the student enjoys conceptual math and has great math intuition, this course would be great.",
    "Shop for a good TA, and this can be a good course. You need to keep up with the material.",
    "I would recommend Math 115 to anyone fresh off Math 112 and still interested in Math with plans of pursuing a major which requires high levels of proficiency in Math."
