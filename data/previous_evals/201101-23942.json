   "comments": [
    "Terrific class and highly recommended. The readings were reasonable in quantity and superb in quality. Without a doubt, the best part, however, was class itself. Ambassador Simons offered a candid and (for me) enlightening first-person perspective on diplomacy, international politics, and the foreign service. For someone without much background on these topics, I felt as though I walked away with a fundamental understanding of how these things work, an understanding that will not attenuate with time as I inevitably forget details and facts. This is exactly what I aspire out of Yale classes and exactly what I got out of this one.",
    "IR 769 is a practical course for someone who already processes the analytical framework of general international relations\/diplomacy theory. The case studies are innovative and the instructor is engaging.I would highly recommend the course to another student who has general understanding of International relations theory. Because this course is what needed for students who has some level of theoretical exposure to gain practical understanding of world issues.",
    "Take this class- low key but you'll learn a lot",
    "I would highly recommend it to any students with an interest in U.S. foreign policy.",
    "It depends. If one is interested in the pragmatic skills for the diplomatic negotiatin, this course is good.",
    "overview of american diplomacy",
    "The class body was very diversified with students from not only US, but also China, Japan, Singapore, etc. All of the fellow students were very active and involved in the class discussion. I really recommend this course."

    "The research papers gave me a chance to delve into my interests, and Professor Simons was helpful in suggesting people to talk to.",
    "Greater knowledge of decision making from the Chief of Mission's perspective will help throughout my career. It will also be very useful in my research at Yale.",
    "Many readings and first hand information. Enhanced skills in speeches delivery and academic writing."
