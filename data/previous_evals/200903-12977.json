    "It helped me to know about that certain part of history and its background.",
    "Considering that I had had a very superficial knowledge of Japanese architecture, this course was very valuable to me.",
    "I enjoyed this course very much. I appreciated that the course structure was cohesive, the material coverage was comprehensive, and the course discussions went beyond the usual anecdotal facts and touched on the philosophical disparities between architectural practice in the east and west. My experience in this course did not only satisfy my initial interest in Japanese architecture, it also helped strengthen and mature my own philosophical views on architecture."

    "Professor Ota and the TA are effective responsible and helpful.",
    "The visual presentation of the material and the accompanied narration were quite successful. Sometimes I found myself lost in the amount of information and would wish to spend more time on individual architects and their work. But considering the nature of the course and its length, perhaps it was not possible to cover all of the information in a grater detail.",
    "Professor Ota is very knowledgeable of the subjects and very well spoken in class. It is sometimes difficult to follow the spelling of Japanese names of buildings and architects. It would be better if handouts were made available at the beginning of each class."
