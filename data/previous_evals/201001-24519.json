   "comments": [
    "Everyone needs to take this course. Don't leave Yale without it. It will make you see the world in a new way.",
    "Intro to ER&M is a really cool class. The issues and topics we cover are really interesting and lay a good foundation for topics covered in other classes\/departments. The lectures are interesting but since Professor Camacho doesn't use lecture notes\/outlines it was kind of difficult to follow what was going on at times. Still, the workload wasn't too bad; everything was take-home. There was a lot of reading (quite a lot, actually) but how necessary it is depends on your TA. Classes like this, however, attract a lot of like-minded people and I really wished that someone had spoken up with a dissenting voice just so we could hear a competing view.",
    "This course should be required, even for science and math majors. It will help you make sense of the world!",
    "Definitely! One of the most important courses I've taken at Yale. Do be prepared for the heavy reading load, though (and know that skimming the material doesn't cut it -- you're expected to really engage with it critically).",
    "Yes.",
    "This class is not one that you can ignore - the readings are important and paying attention in lecture is key, as Professor Camacho gives you essential information in class that isn't available elsewhere. Very interesting overall. Let yourself go with the flow and you'll see the big picture in the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend it to another student. Also, I don't know is this is possible, but I think a lot more interest could be generated for the major if ER&M were offered in both semesters. I did DS in freshman year, and didn't have a strong sense of what I wanted to major in during sophomore year. I became an IS major, and then started taking some classes that got me interested in race and immigration, and then I started to think about ER&M. While the bluebook suggests that ER&M majors take ERM 200 as soon as they can, I did not have the opportunity to seriously consider taking it until my spring semester of junior year, which I think might be a little late. So if there is any way that the course could be offered more often, especially since it is the only required class for the major, that would be great.",
    "I found it particularly helpful to address questions regarding my own activism. Politically-inclined and socially conscious people definitely can profit from the class. It's a lot of fun! Professor Camacho is particularly amazing at highlighting the optimism with which we have to look at the future, in spite of what some history has proven. I also really loved the compilation of art pieces, songs and photographs that played an essential role in the class. There are a lot of (fun) assignments, though. Take a bit of time to learn Prof. Camacho's lecturing style.",
    "You must take this class. It is a good deal of work, but it is completely worth it."
