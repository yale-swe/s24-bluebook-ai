    "Don't take it unless you have to, though this lab taught a lot more useful things than most other labs at Yale.",
    "Biochem lab is a great lab to take if you enjoy longer, project-based experiments instead of the one-day \"technique\" labs in many other courses (such as organic and general chemistry). The course consisted of 11 lab days during which 2 major projects were carried out. Both of the projects were extremely interesting. Each lab was preceded by a short quiz, and a lengthy report was due after each project (2 in total). The course required a lot of work (for only 1\/2 a credit), and at times seemed poorly organized, but was very satisfying to take. One of the better labs at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this lab. You learn important techniques and learn about protein structure, which was fascinating.",
    "An okay lab course. There are weekly quizzes, but only 2 lab reports and 1 problem set. The lab reports are also due after Thanksgiving Break and reading period, so there is relatively little work until then. However, make sure you start early on the lab reports. The professors and TAs are great at answering any questions you might have. The lab lectures are very dry and quite long.",
    "3.5\/5 overall, manageable workload",
    "This was one of my favorite lab courses that I have taken so far at Yale. It was well-organized and I thought that the workload was quite manageable with the new format (meeting once a week for the whole semester, one long lab report + one short lab report) as long as one started their work in a timely fashion. I truly felt that as long as I put in the effort to make my best work, I could get a good grade.",
    "A note of caution: the last two lab reports are rather closer to finals period. Make sure you put your effort toward them since they will end up making up most of your grade.",
    "a fast paced lab, in which all the outside-class work is at the end of the semester (2 big lab reports and a problem set). I would recommend it, but be aware of the back-loaded nature of the work.",
    "This lab, in my humble opinion, is HORRIBLE. The labs are painful, the lab quizzes are annoyingly detailed, and the lab reports were terribly terribly long. Only take this course if you have to. I took this as a premed RLST major and had not taken any other bio labs remotely like it, so even the concept of pipetting was foreign to me. The lab manual procedures assumed a certain level of experience that i just didn't have, which only made things worse. This lab was possibly the worst lab I've been in at Yale (as a second semester senior, so out of 8 labs, this is the #1 horror). Hate to be dramatic, but it was the bane of my existence this semester.If you do take this class, START THE LAB REPORTS EARLY. Seriously, whatever you think is enough time to complete it, add on a week. That'll ALMOST cover it.",
    "This was one of the more interesting lab courses I've taken, but it comes with very long lectures during incubation periods. The quizzes are pretty easy as long as you take the time to learn all the vocabulary in the lab handout."
