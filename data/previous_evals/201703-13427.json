    "Very good course, much work but felt stills improving all semester. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in future work in statistics.",
    "Strength: Wonderful lectures. Weakness: Hard homework without solutions, which makes it very hard to understand which parts go wrong.",
    "Very good. You can definitely learn a lot.",
    "could be improved by going through how to code the examples we go over in class",
    "pros:introduced a lot of tools in computational statistics. cons: not very theoretical.",
    "The lectures are well organized, informative and easy to understand. The lectures and the homework keep a good balance between theories and application (like programming), and maintain an appropriate workload. I actually don't have a very clear suggestion for improvements for now.",
    "Very useful course!",
    "Awesome!",
    "This course is super good in terms of computational stat, it covers all the important algorithms, which is extremely helpful for the research.",
    "This course helps me learn a lot about computational skills. I think it is perfect!",
    "strengths: interesting\/revelant materiel, weakness: sometimes tested on topics not covered in class.",
    "This is an excellent course. The instructor is an engaging speaker and is able to explain concepts that could be confusing in a very straightforward and clear way, such that they seem quite intuitive. The problem sets and exams are challenging but reasonable, and everything that one might need to know to solve them is included in the course. The instructor and teaching fellow made themselves very available outside of class time so that we had every opportunity to ask the questions that we needed to. I would highly recommend this course to another student.",

    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Instructor was very helpful and clear in lectures and available for office hours.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Strength: Good lecturing. Weakness: No typed notes and homework solutions, which makes this course inefficient.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Great instructor. Very patient and intelligent. Also funny.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Dr. Crawford explains everything clearly. He is patient and responsible.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Prof. Crawford is excellent. His class is very helpful.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Dr. Crawford gives the lectures in an interesting way. He is very accessible and responsive to our questions. And also, his hand-drawn 3D plots are impressing.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Very nice instructor! Very inspired for different approaches.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Awesome!",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0He is so good at explaining the ideas of different computational methods and so nice.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0I really like Dr. Forrest's style! He's an intelligent and kind instructor. I appreciate his help!",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0great professor, helpful office hours, good at explaining theoretical topics.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0The instructor's teaching style was great - his explanations of both concepts in the course and the expectations in the course were always very clear. The course is well-designed in the sense that the problem sets ensured that we grasped the important ideas taught in the class and were able to use them.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Great instructor Organized and knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0His explanation is very clear and easy understood"
