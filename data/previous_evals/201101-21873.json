   "comments": [
    "If you're very interested in the topic or need a good upper-level bio class as a requirement, this would be a good choice. Otherwise, this class is not very interesting or relevant to other fields. The material presented in class is never tested, making it very difficult to pay attention. Evaluation is only of a presentation and two papers. Professor Stein is so nice, though.",
    "If you are looking to take another class like Cell Biology, this is definitely not the class. It's structured a little bit like a lab meeting\/paper presentation with each lecture essentially focusing on a current published paper. There is no textbook and there is a lot assumed in terms of what you already know.This is a very low-key but interesting class that focuses on very specific topics regarding neurobiology research. There's a lot to be learned if you pay attention, but because its focus is on the nitty gritty protein reactions and how scientists went about investigating, a lot can be lost if you don't take initiative.",
    "If you have a particular interest in the subject matter then definitely consider taking it; a lot of interesting material is presented in this course. That being said, be sure to shop the class first to make sure you can handle the lecturing style of Prof. Elke. She's very nice and approachable, but sometimes can be monotonous in her inflection and a little unclear. The time of the course in the late afternoon didn't help this; I saw a few students nod off. Because the grading for this class is fairly lax (Prof. Stein mentioned during the first class session that she had never failed a student) a lot of people didn't show up for class, but it's really their loss.",
    "This course is great! Professor Stein is very knowledgeable about the subject and her lectures are pretty engaging, and she's also really nice and accessible if you have any questions. The only problem is that many times, the material is so dense that it's very difficult to learn from a powerpoint lecture, unless you go home and read\/digest every single paper assigned (which I'm pretty sure no one did). It's not like you're taking a quiz each week on the material learned, so I can't say I learned everything. However, what's nice about the class is that it allows you to really focus in and learn a lot about any specific topics that you're interested, which you can do through your midterm paper (3-4 pages), oral presentation (30-40 minutes), and final paper (12-15 pages). But those are the only assignments throughout the whole semester, so the class as a whole is not a lot of work at all. Take it!",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is genuinely interested in neuroscience and wants to learn in a relaxed, no pressure environment. If you are the kind of student who can take responsibility for your own learning, this is a great class.",
    "MCDB 460 is a good upper-level course to take for the MCDB major and covers a wide range of topics in neurobiology. The workload is definitely manageable- a presentation, short midterm paper, and 10 page final. Lectures can be difficult to follow if you're not paying attention the whole time, so don't be afraid to speak up and ask questions, Dr. Stein wants that.",
    "Take the course if you want to have a pretty detailed understand of neuronal functioning at a molecular level. You can do well with not much effort.",
    "Lecture presentations of cutting-edge neurobiology research by an enthusiastic (although very soft-spoken), kind-hearted professor.Not too much work: 500-700w midterm paper, 3000w final paper and one powerpoint presentation on a recently published paper assigned to you.How much you learn in this class is highly dependent on how much time you decide to put in.",
    "While this class seems interesting on paper, I wouldn't recommend it. As an MCDB major with an interest in neurobiology I was excited by the class's focus. Unfortunately, I found the lectures disjointed, overly specific, and poorly contextualized. The class suffers from a lack of overall organization and drive."
