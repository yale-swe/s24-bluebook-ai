   "comments": [
    "If you have any interest in Russia, take this course. It's a comprehensive (and very complete) overview of Russian history before the modern period. I definitely recommend it for anyone with even a passing interest in the history of Russia.",
    "Absolutely. Russian history is fascinating, if you haven't studied it yet, and they're amusingly crazy. Prof Bushkovitch gives a great overview of the period, neither too broad nor too narrow, and his attitude\/performativity if nothing else make the class great. Plus the workload is far, far from stressful.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, I consider it one of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale so far. Prof. Bushkovitch is great and really funny. There's a fair amount of reading but about what's to be expected from a history course. Just a midterm, one paper (5-10 page book review) and cumulative final. If you're interested in Russian history at all it's a great course to take, though the first half addresses pretty obscure stuff.",
    "This Russian History course covers the entirety of Russian history from medieval times until the end of Catherine the Great's reign. I'd recommend it for anyone who wants a broad knowledge of Russian rulers, land acquisitions, foreign relations, population changes, and religious and city history. The books to read in the course go very well with his lectures, and in some instances, a simple perusal of the texts suffices.",
    "History 290 roughly covers the development of Russia from Kievan Rus of the 10th century to 1801. It covers the important political, social, and religious developments of the Russian state. It is a great class for someone looking to learn something new.",
    "I can't believe more people didn't take this class. There were 10 this semester; it was a gem of a course. Excellently taught, very interesting...",
    "I would recommend this class because the Russian history is fascinating."
