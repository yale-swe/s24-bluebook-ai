    "Philosophy 702 is an in depth study of Cusa's most well known work \"On Learned Ignorance.\" Such an intensive study allows one to immerse oneself in one aspect of Cusa's philosophy in a way that is unlike traditional courses that focus on the work of a single philosopher. I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Cusa is a very important thinker that few people have read carefully. His ideas are worth wrestling with in their own right, which is what you will get in this course. There's not as much room for class conversation as a typical seminar, but it works out for the best."

    "I study modern thought, and thisis the first time I've ever spent a whole semester on the Middle Ages. So it was extremely valuable for me to see the importance of medieval thought, and makes me want to take more courses in this area."
