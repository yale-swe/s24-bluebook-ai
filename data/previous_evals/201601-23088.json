    "A good course on imperial theory with lots of good readings. i wish we could have done more with our discussions in class, but I guess that's a 9:25 for you. Moved through and identified important phases in imperialism and colonialism.",
    "Wonderful seminar, but very theoretical. A passion for the time period is a great advantage. Class discussions were often stimulating, but the readings could get pretty dense. Definitely look for the most engaging quotes and choose to discuss those. Worth taking overall!",
    "Heavy emphasis on the British, decent amount on the French and a little on the Germans, though most everything else got squelched out due to time constraints. The course is more a survey of reactions to imperialism from an intellectual history perspective as opposed to a policy driven history, so be prepared for that."
