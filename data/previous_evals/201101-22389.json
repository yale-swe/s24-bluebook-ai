    "I would recommend Hebrew 120 to another student. The class is small enough that you receive individualized attention while befriending the members of your class. Also, the teachers in the department are outstanding teachers and very patient.",
    "Take it. You will learn a lot and it is a really fun class.",
    "If you have a choice, take it with Ayala. Dina's not a reason to not take the class, but you'll love it and be motivated more with Ayala.",
    "I loved Modern Hebrew. It is not as intense as some other introductory language classes. However, I felt that I definitely learned a lot and came out with a basic knowledge of Hebrew. The class combines textbook and cultural work, making it a lot of fun. The instructors are approachable and well informed.",
    "This course is fun. More work than L1, but also more interesting because you really are able to start expressing yourself in Hebrew. Fun class!"
