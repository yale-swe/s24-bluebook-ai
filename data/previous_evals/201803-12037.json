    "Strengths: The department is very close knit and caring. There is a lot of work done to emphasize cultural learning and in practice exercises. Weaknesses: Since the course is heritage, there is a pretty high assumed baseline of knowledge. We frequently skipped through grammar sections because individuals class already knew it.",
    "The course was very good.",
    "The strenghts are that it is engaging and taught well.",
    "Strengths - we go through the language step by step. Many interactive activities are used to test our oral ability which is important.",
    "The strengths of the course are all the extra help available to help understand the language since its quite difficult. The only weakness is that the course is a bit disorganized at times, leading to confusion."

    "Yes! It's a great class!",
    "Yes! It equips you with the ability to read and write another language.",
    "I definitely would recommend this class if you have had previous Hindi exposure. It goes at a rate thats not too fast and allows people really practice the facets theyre lacking."
