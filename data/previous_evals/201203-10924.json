    "Yes, I recommend it. A great way to learn about both history and law. An understanding of how people have come to own living intellectual property is highly important in the history of science and technology and also informs ongoing debates on biotechnology.",
    "Though the course title appears to be esoteric at first, the class material presents a great historical narrative of the increasingly relevant role of the biotech industry. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in understanding the interplay between patent law, innovation and monopoly in biotechnology since the 19th century. The weeks dealing with GMO and gene patenting controversies were probably the best part of this course."
