   "comments": [
    "Linear Algebra is the easiest math course you will take. You don't even have to go to class, except once a week to turn in the psets. The material is dry at the beginning, but when the applications part of the course starts, it is much better.",
    "Involves primarily self-study!",
    "Hard to understand what the professor says. You can learn the same or more from watching the MIT lectures online.",
    "This is a course about doing math problems (unlike Math 225 or Math 230). The other two courses will not do nearly as much to make sure you can actually do the mathematical computations necessary in and engineering or science setting. That being said, I also took Math 230 and the theory was a nice complement to the problems (really, it should be viewed the other way around- that the problems supplement the theory). The workload is manageable although it varies depending on who the professor is. The pace also varies dramatically depending on the professor. Make sure you read the textbook sections before class. The lectures might be unnecessary to attend for most people.",
    "AMTH 222 is an excellent class that would be of interest to any student who hopes to learn linear algebra. It provides a great introduction with enough theoretical background to understand why certain conventions exist and how matrix algebra is used.",
    "The first month, I regretted taking this class so much. It's a completely different way of thinking about math than any calculus course you've probably taken before. The fact that Schultheiss is pretty much 90 years old didn't really help either. But the longer I stuck with it, the more I got used to the linear algebra \"way of thinking,\" and the easier the course got. I had to supplement with the MIT video lectures, but I started weening later on. A lot of people don't go to lectures; I strongly suggest you do, or at least have someone you're friends with go, because around 2\/3 of the way through the course, Schultheiss starts diverging from the MIT lectures a bit. The tests are really fair. First midterm is very easy. Second one gets much more tricky, and the final is pretty difficult. But I still felt like we had learned enough for me to apply my knowledge to the problems and solve most of them. Even though I despised this class at first, it turned into one of my more favorites. What you learn (Markov matrices, differential equations, fourier series, etc.) is applicable in a lot of other fields, and this is a great setting to learn it.",
    "I was disappointed by this class. The material was interesting however based on what I would have expected from the title: Linear Algebra with Applications\" I was disappointed by the very small number of applications covered and their narrow scope. In addition, this class assumed a fair amount of prior knowledge that I was unfamiliar with. The professor clearly knows what he's talking about, but has a hard time explaining concepts and moves through material really quickly. In addition, the book does a good job of introducing equations and concepts but is poor at explaining them. The homework is very reasonable, however the small number of problems assigned on each concept makes it difficult to master a topic before moving on. In order to understand a majority of the material I attended another Linear Algebra section as well, one that went at a slower pace and explained concepts better, which was very helpful. In addition, the online MIT lectures can be useful. Finally, I thought the class catered specifically to mechanical engineers and ignored the small subset of the class such as myself who were not majoring in Engineering or a related field. In this way I felt alienated from the class.",
    "I had such a hard time in the class I would never recommend it.",
    "This class is fairly slow paced, and not too conceptually difficult. The problem is there is a pset assigned every class, and he doesn't use classes v2. So if you miss class you'll miss important logistical information, which is annoying. The lectures are a bit dry, but he's very knowledgeable.",
    "Linear algebra is cool",
    "It was a pretty good class, but definitely not as easy as people make it sound. If you take it with Schultheiss, you will learn a LOT-the other section only got through about half as much material as we did. If you have questions it's better to ask him before\/after class or at office hours rather than during lecture. Also he goes through proofs very quickly so you might find that you don't really understand why you're doing much of what you're doing. Personally I really liked 120 but did not find Linear Algebra very interesting.",
    "This is a great introduction to Linear Algebra. The homework is fair, and the tests are very representative of the problems we did in class. Take it with Schultheiss--though you should be sure to come to lecture.",
    "I was king of indifferent about the class. It has some extremely interesting parts near the end but the first half of the class is very boring and tedious.",
    "Yes. Take this class. The math is not too complex and the concepts are not hard to understand. If you study the practice tests you will be fine for the tests.",
    "It's a lot like a high school class. Psets are 3 times a week out of the textbook and then tests are (overall?) straightforward.",
    "Linear algebra is an interesting subject (and very useful for the quantitative social sciences); I definitely recommend taking it with Professor Schultheiss.",
    "Take it if you are interested, probably not for people who are not into math",
    "Take it with Pr. Schultheiss! It'S quick pace with 3 small PSETS a week. But the PSETS are short and they allow you to learn the material on a constant basis rather than the night before -- if a large PSET were due.",
    "We covered a lot of material and schulteiss is very fair. The daily homework thing csn be a bit annoying but is flexible and manageablr.",
    "Solid math class. Interesting material towards the end.",
    "It's linear algebra, the lectures aren't so engaging and very few people even attend. I took this class largely online and through the textbook with Gil Strang."
