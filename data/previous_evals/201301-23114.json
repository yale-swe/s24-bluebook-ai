   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed 421 overall. It's a small, lecture-based course mainly focused on the physics of medical imaging. Professor Constable is a pretty good, friendly lecturer. The workload is pretty light: two papers, a midterm, and a final. The exams are memorization-heavy, so they take a lot of preparation, but in general I thought the workload and the grading were fair. I'd recommend this course to anyone interested in the physical side of medical imaging technology.",
    "Its a decent course if you want to understand more of the physical concepts behind different imaging modalities and factors you have to consider when setting up experiments. Can be a little dry and hard to follow at times, but Prof.",
    "I would definitely recommend BENG 421 to another fellow student. It is a great overview to medical imaging.",
    "Yes, take it. Is not as mathy as other engineering classes. It teaches you how to write a review paper and a grant proposal.",
    "This was an excellent overview of medical imaging. Professor Constable was a great lecturer and always tied in examples applicable to the field and material- he also went out of his way to give examples of the current industry, and had a good sense of humor. The review session at the end was particularly helpful and the papers were really nice given that they were in NIH grant format and journal review format (since most people have not got exposure to these formats, both were good to practice). I enjoyed the course and lectures. Professor Constable was always ready to answer questions and very approachable."
