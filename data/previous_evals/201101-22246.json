   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Definitely take this class! The readings and class discussions are really interesting and Ziv is a great professor. Also, the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would recommend it to someone interested in the topic, although I also think they could probably get a good sense of the material by reading a well chosen book on the subject rather than taking the course. Writing the research paper was a good exercise, particularly for someone who hadn't done much of this before. The professor was very available to help.",
    "Starting in 1873 with the Comstock Law and banning of passing \"obsenity\" (i.e. birth control) through the mail and ending with the different forms that the modern family can take, the course is a survey of the evolution of the family over the past century. It's really interesting to look at the movement that we're all familiar with and examine in depth how the affected the family.",
    "If Ziv is offering this class, I highly recommend that juniors take it. There's a lot of reading but it's all relevant, engaging, and pretty doable. Ziv walks you through the process of creating a research topic, doing the research, and crafting a great paper, so juniors would really benefit from his help. He also makes you think of things that totally shift your perspective, especially as a sociology or history person. In this class, you aren't allowed to just say birth control is good for women or gay marriage should be legal or divorce hurts families or religious fundamentalists are crazy. You have to consider both sides, really understand the issue, and figure out why people feel the way they do. If you are at all interested in history, sociology, American Studies, WGSS, HSHM, etc, this class is a must take.",
    "Yes. Really great professor. Class is very informative and I looked forward to going to it each week.",
    "Modern American Family 1873-Present was the best class I have ever taken at Yale. I hate seminars and this still beats everything I've taken before. Every class had an interesting and relevant topic and Ziv facilitated discussion beautifully, supplementing our debate with great video clips. The range of reading-types was perfect, allowing us to get a taste of a range of primary and secondary sources. The research term paper was fun. I love this class. Definitely take it. You will not regret it."
