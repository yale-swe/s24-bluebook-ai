   "comments": [
    "Take this class when you're sure you want to engage with a very theoretical and hard-to-define concept in democratic theory. This topic of\"the people\" isrelevant and will help you grapple with your own political and theoretical convictions. It will lay the foundation for democracy-related (protest movements, democratic aid, immigration, electoral policy, etc) courses you'll take at Yale. However, I recommend having a specific case study or topic in mind when approaching this course. Or just be a theory buff.",
    "a review of what the idea of \"the people\" means to political theorists. you have to be ready to spend a good deal of time talking about populism.",
    "The People goes through different views in democratic theory on the meaning and construction on 'the people'. The readings are interesting and light, and class discussion is generally animated (and open - there were only about 7 kids in the seminar this semester). The final paper is open-ended and not that long. Our semester we spent the last bit of every seminar doing presentations of case studies on the previous week's reading (these worked okay but didn't seem particularly helpful) but I'm not sure if they'll continue next year.The class would appeal to you if you are interested in democratic theory, social contract theory, or immigration. Some relevance to populism and political appeals to 'the people' as opposed to elites or other groups.",
    "I would recommend the course to students who have an interest in the abstract ideas of what is meant by \"popular sovereignty\" or even \"the people\" itself- it is not just for students interested in learning about populist movements."
