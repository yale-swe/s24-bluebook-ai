   "comments": [
    "This course is excellent. Every epidemiologist should take this class because it really provides a foundation for understanding how different chronic and infectious diseases affect the body physiologically. Exercises and problem solving challenge you to think about a problem from multiple perspectives.",
    "I LOVED this course! The professor was engaging and the topic was very interesting, and everything was made applicable to public health.",
    "Fantastic class! There is a lot of content and the lectures are filled with information, but in keeping up with all the weekly readings and going to class, I have learned a great deal from this course. Definitely a great class, and Dr. Yeckel keeps the class very entertaining and engaging! One of my favorite classes (maybe ever).",
    "There are few classes in grad school that provide so much content wise, and also allow for one to apply that content to public health practice and research. This class is one of them. I learned so much about physiology and how to apply it to my personal research.",
    "Not your typical physiology course that requires rote memorization. Instead, the emphasis is on the physiological rationale behind public health issues that you, as the student, have complete flexibility to choose throughout the semester. If you are looking for a solid, detailed physiological course for something like med school, this probably wouldn't be the course for you. That said, I loved the structure of the course and thought the professor was incredibly smart, insightful, and engaging.",
    "Very interesting and engaging course. There is a lot of content, so being able to synthesize information is more essential to success in this course than simple memorization.",
    "Fantastic",
    "Although I came from a background in medicine and this was not my first physiology course, the tailoring to epidemiology made it greatly different and interesting.",
    "This class was very good. Its biggest strength is the professor who is amazing and knowledgeable, and how applicable the course is to public health. In addition, the write ups were a way to research topics that were interesting to each individual, and as someone who dislikes writing, even I enjoyed doing them. My only suggestion is that sometimes there is an overwhelming amount of information presented in lectures that can get hard to follow. However, assessments never focused on small details and were more big picture, so the course was very fair.",
    "Content was relevant to public health. The course had a strong organizational framework, however, the slides for each system did not necessarily follow this framework. The flexibility in assignment topics, allowed students to focus on their public health topic of interest.",
    "This is a great graduate-level course of high quality and entertainment. This course provides comprehensive (but not overwhelming) information about the physiology of all the systems. Moreover, it is tightly connected to public health issues, which is especially useful for public health students. The weekly write-up also helps you to get a better and deeper understanding of the lecture contents. Moreover, the biweekly case study is also really helpful. You'll learn a lot from this course even if you don't have any background in physiology previously.",
    "This class takes extremely complex physiological systems and simplifies them to the point that we get all the information we need as public health students. Her exams are designed to test our understanding of these bigger themes and allow us to think outside the box. The open-endedness of her assignments allows each student to be excited about whatever interests them, and we are constantly encouraged to share this enthusiasm for specific topics with our classmates. I LOVED the weekly assignments and thought they were a great learning tool! When Im finished with Dr. Yeckels course, I am confident that I will have the strong background in physiology necessary for any position in public health.",
    "Great course to learn more about physiology. For those with no physio background, it may be a bit difficult grasping the concepts since it can get pretty detailed, but the content is super interesting and a great way to learn more about the science of common diseases and conditions.",
    "Very well designed course. Weekly write ups offered freedom to engage in physiologic systems in a way that interested each student. Exams were well designed to force us to think critically and apply knowledge learned in lectures.",
    "Each student can focus on content that relates to their public health interests.",
    "Great course! I enjoyed the flexibility in the weekly write-ups and Dr. Yeckel's broad-stroke approach.",
    "Very instrctive!",
    "Very informative and useful, I enjoyed every class I had with Dr. Yechel.",
    "A very good class. Very nice, comprehensive, and easy to follow overview of our physiology. Also very customizable to your own interests and focuses on susceptible populations and applications to public health.",
    "I really enjoyed this course and felt I learned a lot about the biological and physiological processes underlying the health outcomes of different risks and exposures.",
    "This was an excellent (and a bit overwhelming) tour through the physiology of a variety of bodily systems, and the public health implications for those systems when things go awry. The scope of the class was ambitious. Each of the systems we discussed had a tremendous amount of detail that we could have approached, so often times we were stuck on the surface level of certain problems. However, I think that worked well for this classit provided us with an opportunity to dive into certain things in-depth on our own time, while still covering a tremendous amount of material. The write-ups were an excellent way to get us interested in the different systems. Allowing us to choose our own topics let us pick things that actually got us grappling with pertinent physiological questions on topics we either had or wanted to have some degree of knowledge. It also gave us a chance to really go in-depth with certain systems, giving us a better understanding of how the body works in relation to our own interests. The feedback we received on each write-up was also greatDr. Yeckel asked us great questions, and let us know when we were doing things well or needed work. I was a little sad that a few classes were shortened or skipped just because students said they wanted a breakI think we couldve gotten pushed to keep learning. I wouldve liked to have gone through a few more systems, but we wound up cutting a few things out before spring break, due to everyones heavy midterm schedule. I think a little bit of wiggle-room around the write-ups could be more engaginginstead of assigning write-ups for certain systems, assign 6 or 7 due over the course of the semester after the respective lectures, to let us choose which systems we want to investigate more fully."

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Professor Yeckel was one of the best professors I have had at Yale --she's engaging, enthusiastic, and always concerned with our needs and what information about physiology best serves our interests. She was also very sweet.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is really a great professor. She is extremely understanding and patient, yet she fills the lectures with images and easy-to-understand presentations. I wish she taught more classes at YSPH, as she kept me extremely engaged. Additionally, she included interactive components to lectures, which helped the hour and 45 minutes of class fly by! It is obvious she is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about physiology, and she conveyed it and answered questions in such a way that made it easy for me to understand as well.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel has been a great mentor to me over the course of this class and throughout my time at YSPH. She is a cornerstone of the faculty in EHS and a great role model for women in the sciences.",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very enthusiastic about subject and provides excellent feedback about work completed for the class.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy is extremely passionate and cares about all the students in her class. She is beyond brilliant and teaches this class in a very unique and provoking manner. Excellent professor, and I would recommend everyone take this class to learn from her!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cares deeply about her students. Great passion about her work!",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Her enthusiasm for physiology is infectious and made the material so exciting to learn, her feedback was also always appreciated and made you know that she was paying attention and interested in your work.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel made it a point to learn every student's name, which was really refreshing compared to other professors. She was clearly very passionate about the material and knew an overwhelming amount of information, but made the subject very approachable and always brought the lectures back to their significance in public health. In addition, she was very understanding of students' workloads and cared more about students learning than having to give strict deadlines, choosing twice to adjust the schedule so that students could have an easier time with midterms and finals. She was one of the best professors I have had at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is an enthusiastic educator who uses active learning strategies to engage students and to promote critical thinking.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel is a fantastic professor. She is knowledgeable, and her lectures can always make students easier to understand those difficult definitions and mechanisms. Her teaching style and skill is also outstanding. Every student likes her.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0tl;dr: Dr. Yeckel is amazing and cares so much about teaching. I haven't had a teacher at Yale that has Dr. Yeckels enthusiasm for teaching. If you sit in on one class, you can see how much she loves teaching and being around students. From her enthusiastic mannerisms to her ability to tie in students personal research interests into each weeks physiology topic, Dr. Yeckel has proven to be an exemplary professor at Yale. At the beginning of the semester, Dr. Yeckel asked us to write down our names, departments, and personal research areas so she could recommend optional reading each week that matched up with our interests. Ive never had another professor, in undergrad or at Yale, that went through the trouble of hand-picking weekly reading assignments that matched up with the classs diverse interests. I cannot imagine how much time and effort it takes to select all of her recommended readings each week, and I hope she knows her efforts dont go unappreciated! She also encourages personal exploration of each weeks topic through her weekly writing assignments. We each write a 2-page paper summarizing an issue of interest related to that weeks physiological system, and she promptly responds with detailed feedback and encouragement. Ive had professors at Yale that take over a month to grade shorter papers, and Dr. Yeckels turn-around time is incredible given the size of the class. Receiving prompt feedback is very important for students and really helps us to learn while the information is still fresh in our memories.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Catherine is very enthusiastic and passionate about what she teaches. It's hard to doze off during her lectures because she does a great job of engaging the class.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Excellent professor. Truly cares about the subject and makes lectures involving relatively dense material engaging and interesting.",

    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Very knowledgiable and kind.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0One of the best instructors ever. Very enthusiastic about the topic, and conforms her teaching to students' interests, with great emphasis on public health problems. Easy to follow, which is saying a lot considering the comprehensive topics on the entire body and its systems.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Cathy was a great instructor! Her lectures were always very interesting and engaging. She got me to think about the links between different body systems and their relevance to public health from a new perspective. You can tell she is passionate about what she teaches. I know several professors prefer not to upload lecture slides until after class, but I wish the ones for this class had been uploaded prior. I find it helpful taking notes and staying engaged in the lecture, particularly in a class like this where there are a lot of details.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0She is passionate about her material, is engaging and one of the best instructors at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Catherine Yeckel \u00a0Dr. Yeckel was, by far, one of the most dedicated teachers I've had at YSPH. She put in an incredible amount of work choosing interesting, pertinent papers and grading our homework assignments and exams. Getting extensive feedback and multiple questions on every assignment demonstrated how much work she was willing to put into our learning, which, in turn, spurred me on to work harder on every assignment. She was incredibly flexible and responsive to feedback we gave during the semester, to try and incorporate our interests into the actual lecture material. All of that being said, I think my particular learning style did not always match with her teaching style. I only realized later in the semester that the class was mostly operating with a pseudo-flipped classroom; most of the actual learning of the hardware needed to happen in the readings before class. This allowed Dr. Yeckel to use the class to discuss actual public health implications of the different physiological symptoms without wasting time discussing the hardware. However, on the weeks were I wasn't able to complete the out-of-class readings beforehand, I was fairly lost during the actual class, since I had never had any anatomy or physiology classes before, and the basic functionality of the hardware was not explained in class. I think Dr. Yeckels grading could be a bit stricter. I felt that no matter what quality work I turned in, I would get a high grade, which disincentivized me from handing in my best work. It also meant I often left this work for last, since I knew a good grade was guaranteed. This frustrated me, since I wanted to put in as much effort as Dr. Yeckel; unfortunately, she also made it easy to prioritize other classes or a thesis over her own."

    "Good class, even better instructor. It is so clear why she was nominated for Teacher of the Year.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to a fellow student. It's very interesting and the professor is 100% interested in you learning vs. grading very hard or making things difficult.",
    "Great course! 10\/10 would recommend. There are weekly write-ups due, but they are meant to engage our own interests in the weekly lecture topics. I found this extremely useful every week, as I would discover a new piece of physiological applications after a lecture on the physiological system. I learned a great amount from this class, and would definitely recommend it to another student (even as an elective).",
    "Great background in the physiology of humans and how we relate to our environment. I recommend this course to anyone in any of the divisions.",
    "Two take-home exams, and weekly reading write-up are managable. And you learn a great deal from this class",
    "Take it, you won't regret it. Professor Yeckel has designed the course so that you would be able to explore physiology from a perspective of your interest and you won't ever be bored at having the opportunity to learn more about the bodily systems with regards to an area that interests you!",
    "This class will teach you physiology, while never forgetting that its mission is to connect the physio back to public health issues. I would definitely recommend taking it, as lectures are interesting, and assessments are very fair, while the professor is also amazing.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students because it provides a broad perspective on physiology for use in the public health field.",
    "This is the best course provided from EHS department. No matter the professor or the lecture contents, this course would rank one of the best courses at Yale School of Public Health. If you are still looking for a course to fill in your credit requirement, don't hesitate to choose this course!",
    "This course provides a broad overview of each physiological system. Don't expect to come out a doctor - but you will learn a lot if you engage with the reading material, weekly assignments, and during class!",
    "Definitely take this course to gain a new perspective on chronic and infectious conditions. It's very interesting, and coupled with a great instructor makes for a fantastic elective!",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Definitely!",
    "Take it if you have any interest in the body. You will learn a lot about how our body drives the public health problems we experience today.",
    "This class is great for those who are interested in the physiological mechanisms most important in public health and understanding why certain vulnerabilities exist in specific populations. I feel like I learned a lot of super relevant information that I believe will serve me well in my future career.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Especially if you've had any sort of anatomy, this course provides you with an excellent survey of how different public health problems directly impact human physiology. The write-ups allow you to pursue your own interests within the broad scope of the class, and Dr. Yeckel is an amazing teacher and sounding board for ideas and concerns."
