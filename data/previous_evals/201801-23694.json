    "I developed extensive knowledge about different diseases and conditions, in Spanish. I also learned more about healthcare processes and proper etiquette that should be shown in the medical field.",
    "Medical spanish knowledge",
    "Basically, I learned numerous things about medicine, strengthened my skills in speaking and reading Spanish.",
    "I learned about various diseases, symptoms, and treatment plans, as well as ways in which to talk to patients. My Spanish was strengthened through our many oral and written assignments.",
    "I learned how to write and speak about medical topics in Spanish with clarity and precision.",
    "I improved vastly on my ability to listen to native Spanish speakers, to read and write in Spanish (especially with medical terminology), and became a bit faster at speaking in Spanish. Outside of Spanish, I also learned quite a lot of different medical terminologies, different diseases, and patient care.",
    "I learned an impressive amount of vocabulary during this course. I became a much better Spanish writer and was able to improve my speaking skills.",
    "Working knowledge of medical terms in Spanish.",
    "new vocab, practice giving presentation in spanish",

    "Strength: Professor Weakness: Professor's disorganization",
    "This course was very engaging and interesting and allowed me to improve my writing, reading, and listening skills in Spanish. It could be improved by incorporating more small-group discussion during class.",
    "Good overview of spanish in the medical professions. Something that would make the class more fun\/interesting is having a biweekly lesson where we would learn about a pathology by trying to \"diagnose\" a patient",
    "The atmosphere of the classroom was fantastic. It allowed me to speak comfortably and learn in a judgement-free environment. The homework is fair and interesting. Everything about this class is fantastic.",
    "Not enough speaking",
    "great class!",
    "Having two writing assignments a week helped me to vastly improve my ability to read and to write quickly in Spanish, and listening to all the videos in class with subtitles helped me to train my ear for listening in Spanish. One thing to be improved on is just knowing the lecture topic beforehand so that I could print out lecture notes if need be, but this was usually not a problem.",
    "I see many strengths, such as the consistent writing homeworks, the open-ended final essay topic, and the well-thought our PowerPoint lectures. While I didnt get a chance to speak very much in class, I recognize that with a larger class, its difficult to get a lot of participation in.",
    "Good course, learn a lot",
    "to improve: more time practicing talking in small groups; more videos in spanish strengths: fun and not overwhelming good pics in slideshow; freedom on final paper to write about topic of interest",
    "I think that the only weakness of this course is that is was a 9am and that could have curbed participation. However, the strength of this course was Profesora Carreras who had enough energy to get the class involved in the early morning!"

    "Yes! Professor is great",
    "Yes! It is one of the best courses I've taken thus far.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! If you are interested in medicine\/patient care at all, this class is amazing for practice with speaking Spanish in the medical field. You learn a lot while also not having to do a whole lot of work.",
    "Yes! I learned a lot in this course, with a low amount of stress.",
    "Yes, it was a good course for students who want to learn more about medicine in another language.",
    "Yes! This course is fun and provides really helpful vocab for people who will be working in the medical field. I think the stuff taught in this course is necessary for anyone who wants to learn Spanish."
