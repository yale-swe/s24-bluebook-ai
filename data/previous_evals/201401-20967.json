    "Yes, I recommend this class for any MCDB major. The waitlist is long though, so contact Dr. Wolenski as soon as you know you are interested in taking this course!",
    "Yes, email in advance and take this course. It's a course focused on cultivating passion and potential for science research and education, and on building a family that is fun, supportive, and educational.",
    "You must take this class. It is one of the hidden gems at Yale.",
    "Take this class if you seriously want to understand how to conduct an experiment and solidify your lab techniques. It's the best science class or lab I've taken here, and if you're lucky enough to get in you'll really enjoy it.",
    "YESSSS. Please take it.",
    "MCDB 345L is a course that stands very well on its own, while incorporating the techniques learned from MCDB 344L in a very streamlined manner. I particularly appreciate how the course was geared toward solving a problem that no one had actually investigated before. I believe this has added a greater level of significance to the work we've done, and I am proud to have been a part of it.",
    "MCDB 345L is a great class. Definitely take it if you can. It and is companion class of MCDB 344L were my favorite labs at Yale so far for sure.",
    "If you take 344L, you should definitely be taking 345L as well. It's the same class, really, just with a different TA and different project. This year, we got to crystallize proteins, and seeing our results under the microscope was very rewarding. You do have to do a 15 minute formal presentation of a paper from Science, but Dr. Wolenski's feedback is very helpful and the experience will help you prepare for future presentations you'll have to give in real life after Yale.",
    "BEST LAB EVER! You must take it if you have the opportunity. I have absolutely no regrets. This was one of my top 3 classes I have taken at Yale and by far my favorite science class.",
    "This is the best class at Yale! Absolutely take it if you can! The class is so enjoyable and you will learn so much. Professor Wolenski is such an amazing teacher, and makes every class exciting!",
    "Phenomenal. take this class if you can. One of the best classes at Yale and well worth the time.",
    "Take it!"
