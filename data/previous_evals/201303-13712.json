    "Too less for one semester of our own department, even though I joined other departmental seminars, my interests is in CDE, so expected for more seminars per semester.",
    "it was interesting to hear about what the professors are researching in the department",
    "I loved to have the chance to come together twice a month to hear about current research going on in the department.And the food was good.",
    "I wish we had more seminars throughout the semester. I know EMD has seminar each week, I look forward to hearing about other people's work. It would be great if we could learn about potential internship opportunities as well.",
    "The panel and the guest speakers were very interesting and informative. Great to hear about the research each professor is doing.",
    "Other departments have a lot of seminars. It kinda seems like less effort is put into CDE\/SBS.",
    "Great presentations from different instructors. The food's nutritional quality was not always the greatest. More healthy snacks and food is highly suggested.",
    "great speakers, delicious healthy food provided for SBS",
    "Interesting talks. Wish there were more of them.",
    "Really enjoyed the range of lecturers for this seminar. Will definitely be attending these in the future",
    "The course was pointless- We only had like 3 discussions in the whole semester and I did not find the topics interesting. We should completely do away with this course. There are so many interesting speakers coming to Yale, we should not be forced to listen to the ones selected by the SBS seminar. Section should be totally optional!Strengths:--Networking opportunity to meet professors in different departments--Opportunity to heard about different research projects.--FREE FOOD---essential--No homework, not a source of stressWeakness:--not many sections--topics were not intriguing to everyone",
    "Lectures topics are interesting.Only 5 seminars offered this semester.",
    "You get to listen to interesting 1 hour talks about people's research and eat free lunch. Not too bad of a deal.",
    "Great way to learn about the research of faulty in public health. May be lunch can be more delicious and less pizza.",
    "I enjoyed listening to the research of the faculty and think it is a great idea to hold this seminars to engage students and faculty",
    "It was really interesting to hear different professors talk about their research. I learned a lot.",
    "Good; speakers could have been a little more interesting;good lunch",
    "The first seminar was great- being able to hear about what each of the CDE professors are interested in and conducting research on was very interesting and helped us think early on in the semester about who we might want to work with in terms of theses or internships. The other seminars were also very interesting- I just wish we had them more often!",
    "Interesting topics. Nice way to get the department together on a regular basis.",
    "I'd like a more regular session with more speakers on other varied topics such as mental health and food policy.",
    "I enjoyed getting a taste of chronic disease epidemiology as it's happening. I actually wish we had more of these lectures.",
    "I thought this was a great way to learn about different research being done in the field. Some speakers and topics were more interesting than others, but this would be expected in a seminar of this type.",
    "More frequent seminars would be nice.",
    "The seminar was interesting on the limited number of occasions we had it. I am not sure how much I really got out of 3 hours of total instruction all semester, but I did enjoy each seminar and the free lunch!",
    "This is an excellent course. A great opportunity to learn more about the research projects that are being carried out in the school. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see any weakness"

   "comments": [
    "It is recommended to join seminars in any department if you are interested in the topics, because this will inspire the interest into a field and maybe help you with some idea of the thesis, or persue a higher education after MPH degree.",
    "Yes, very informative and enjoyable.",
    "Great way to learn about the research happening in SBS\/CDE and to meet the professors. Would recommend even for those who are not required to attend.",
    "The seminars provided an opportunity to meet and network with professors from the CDE department. The seminar also helped expose students to different types of work being done at Yale. I would definitely recommend the seminar to students who are interested in learning more about the type of work being done at Yale as well asthe opportunity to discuss careers and research with professors in and outside the department.",
    "Free lunch, good speakers, only twice a month - good deal!",
    "Really enjoyed this seminar",
    "It's really random--either you will love the speakers and professors or you won't care. It's really luck of the draw. At least we don't have any homework.",
    "You get to listen to interesting 1 hour talks about people's research and eat free lunch. Not too bad of a deal.",
    "It's required but worth taking it.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this seminar because it's a great chance for students to learn about the research that is going on locally and to engage with faculty",
    "Very interesting lectures, I suggest attending.",
    "Good lunch",
    "A great informal and non-time consuming course that allowed us to hear about various interesting topics in the department, while eat lunch with colleagues!",
    "Lecture series from different CDE faculty. Interesting topics, good introduction to the department.",
    "Exposure to the work that professors and professionals in the field have been doing currently, and lunch is provided. No real downside. Recommend this course.",
    "This is a great seminar, it is relaxed since there is no additional work needed to be done for it so you can just focus on and enjoy listening to the presentations.",
    "Seminar content is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it is a requirement. The monthly meeting schedule makes it hard to get a ton of value from the course overall, but I was never sorry to go. The free lunch was always great, and the speakers were interesting!",
    "This course is a great opportunity for new students to learn more about the research projects that are being carried out in the school. I would absolutely recommend this seminar to another student."
