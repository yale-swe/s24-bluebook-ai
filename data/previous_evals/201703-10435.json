    "This course was the perfect introduction to photography! Not only how to physically use a film camera, develop your own film, and print photographs, but the course also introduced concepts like composition, subject or thematic matter, and the work of prominent film photographers.",
    "I learned both the technical aspects of taking and developing film photographs on a 35mm SLR as well as artistic aspects of black and white photographs.",
    "I learned how to operate a 35mm analog camera, shoot and develop 35mm black and white film, and print photos in a darkroom. I also learned more about what makes a quality photo, in terms of composition, and I learned about several landmark film photographers in history. Throughout the course of the semester, I also learned to see things differently, as potential photos and moments. Putting a frame around the things I see offered a unique perspective through which I could view my world. It so impacted me that I intend to continue shooting film.",
    "I developed a new way to approach, move through, and appreciate the world in which I live in. Taking pictures out in the world and then doing the hard work to see those pictures come to fruition was an amazing experience. I also learned how to appreciate art in a new way, from philosophical understanding, to technical execution."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -really bonded with my peers (though this is not something you can control) -great feedback from peers, TAs, and professor Weaknesses: not enough time to do everything! did not get demos for some printing techniques like burning and dodging until very late in the semester",
    "Strengths: The course is fun and you can learn a lot if you put in the effort. Weaknesses: The workload is pretty heavily backloaded and it would be nice if it were spread out more evenly. The course is expensive. Lisa's lectures aren't that useful and are pretty scattered and disorganized. The class overall can be disorganized and doesn't do a great job of teaching you the basics of composing and taking interesting photographs. Also, there isn't a ton of clear feedback and we were given no grades the entire semester.",
    "Strengths - getting to use the darkroom, teaching staff, getting to know the other students. Weaknesses - cost, the professor left for a yale nus visit and missed a few classes. Some kind of financial support or better advice for how to get grants from the college. More time on critiques especially early on.",
    "The strengths of this course are that it is a group environment and that everyone was supportive and willing to offer encouragement and advice to anyone that wanted it. The professors and TF did a good job of allowing us to express ourselves in our own ways but at the same time give structure and lessons along the way. The weakness, if I had to point one out, was that at times the class felt a little large and congested, especially on crit days. However, this wasn't necessarily a bad thing because we were all excited to see each other's work. It just meant each person got a little less time to show off their work."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! You have to understand that you MUST put in the time in the course to photograph and print, but the class was so worthwhile and it was work that I always enjoyed.",
    "If you're willing to the put the time in I would recommend it.",
    "If you have any interest in photography, film photography especially, take this course. The workload is heavy, but worth it. I found the process of making these photos--from taking them, to developing the film, to contacting and printing them--to be insanely rewarding, beyond the instant gratification of digital photography. You gain skills from this course that you can use for the rest of your life. I took this class as a first-year student, and although the intensity of the workload and creative demand (I'm not an art person typically) were shocks to my system, I can say that my best memories of my first semester came from this class. Putting in hours in the darkroom really brings you closer to your classmates--you form some great bonds with some interesting people. Lisa is a terrific instructor, and she makes herself available for guidance. Overall, the class is a lot of work, but can be so, so worth it.",
    "Take this class if you can put in the time. It will put you out at least $300 though and I had to get another student job to pay for it, but very worth it. Shooting the 35 rolls throughout the semester wasn't easy, and printing can be frustrating but it was so great to go through the hands on processes of analog photo. Nice mix of students from all years of undergrad and grad from outside of the art school. You really get to know the other students from darkroom time and from critiques. Great teaching staff.",
    "I would because I personally believe that classes which facilitate creative artistic expression should be encouraged for everyone, even people like myself with zero background in the field and next to no artistic abilities."
