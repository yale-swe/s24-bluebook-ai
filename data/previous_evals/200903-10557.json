   "comments": [
    "Take it if you have a very specific research goal in the period. For a general overview of the period, you would be better served by something less research oriented and less fragmented.",
    "i would recommend english 971 01 to two types of students: those without particular background in the field looking for a broad overview of english modernism, AND those with a good background looking to do intensive research in on an understudied figure or movement.",
    "Absolutely! The readings are excellent (and students have a lot of say in what texts are read), Professor Lewis is a fantastic teacher, and the smaller discussion\/project groups actually allow you to have REAL conversations about literature, as opposed to awkward and artificial discussions that pervade most seminars.",
    "I would recommend it for someone who wishes to cover or at least, get a taster for many aspects of this period, and also for those who have worked or wish to work on more specific texts from the period whilst also fitting them in to a broader context of the era as a whole."

    "learned a lot about aspects of modernism pertinent to prospective dissertation themes."
