    "lots of work but your chinese improves",
    "Take it!!",
    "If you can speak Chinese pretty well, but don't know how to read or write, then this is a good class to take. The beginning four weeks are really tough - I spent perhaps 2-3 hours a day on homework because I didn't know any hanzi. However, these hours will taper off into the 1 - 1.5 hours that you are expected to spend every day in order to do well. This is a very rewarding class if you put in the time!",
    "Excellent! Some students were definitely more fluent in speaking than others coming in and that can be a bit intimidating during the first few weeks. Liu-laoshi is great though and makes class a good time!!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone it was designed for. It's a great way to learn Chinese at an accelerated yet appropriately leveled pace.",
    "I really enjoyed this class overall because not only do we learn the language and improve so much over the semester, we also learn more about Chinese culture. On the one hand I do like learning more about Beijing, but sometimes I do feel like the textbook is really trying to get students to visit China. I loved the small class size and the interactive nature of the course. The weekly meeting with the tutor was also super helpful. Definitely take this class if you are a heritage speaker and don't really know many characters. I'm actually not really a heritage speaker and I know a lot of characters so writing was definitely not a challenge for me, whilst I was struggling sometimes in class to make myself coherent. This isn't a problem though because the teacher grades you on your improvement, or else it wouldn't be fair for people in the class. I found the work load to be much lighter than I expected, MUCH lighter than the science classes. I personally don't feel that it is worth 1.5. If the work load of this course was 1.5 credit worth, my other science classes would be like 2.5 credits. Although we have daily homework,they are routine and quite short. Daily quizzes weren't really a challenge but for me the oral presentation and essays took up a lot more time. The midterm and final were pretty fair. The discussions towards the end of the semester became so interesting and I was really happy e.g. I'm now able to discuss about the single child policy, arranged marriages etc.",
    "Great class! I wish it focused a little more on speaking and less on characters and writing, but I think that's what the second half of the course is going to be like. Liu laoshi is very approchable, and everybody is usually very friendly and nonjudgmental when it comes to speaking in class.",
    "I would, Only if they are willing to review a lot of vocabulary each day which would take increased amounts of time if you want to be ready for each class",
    "This course is for students who are fairly proficient at speaking and listening but who may not have any experience in reading or writing. I would definitely recommend this class to any student who fits this description-- it's an intensive class but I learned quickly and am very happy with my progress.",
    "Take it if you are genuinely interested in the language and willing to put in the work. If you're just looking for an easy way to get your distributional requirement over with, I wouldn't recommend it. This class often felt like 1.75 credits."
