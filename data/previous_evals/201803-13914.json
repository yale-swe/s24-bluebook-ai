   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned how to operate a printing press, how to look at printed works through the lens of typography, how old traditions involving printmaking influence modern typography and design, and about the current atmosphere and practices surrounding letterpress printing and binding books.",
    "I have learned a great deal about printmaking and the processes involved in creative and innovative design of books and printed work. I greatly appreciated the insight into Yales printing history as an institution and how it shaped the education offered here. Printmaking is also such an incredible artform and I am excited to continue to make work at the JE Press over the next few years.",
    "I am by no means an art major so I only wanted to take this course as an interesting class; however, I gained an appreciation for the art of printing that I never expected. Over the course of the semester, I was trained to proficiency on every press in the JE Pressroom. In completing my assignments I also became well versed in the art of typography and gained insight and knowledge into modern and ancient printing techniques, paper and ink selections, and the setting of type. I didn't come to Yale meaning to learn any of this but I'm glad I did.",
    "I learned how to operate various kinds of printing presses and how to carry out longterm printing assignments. We touched on the history of printing, typographical features, and visited many different libraries to see various printing examples, but overall it was an art class focusing on teaching us how to print.",
    "I learned to use a printing press and to analyze printed works as objects instead of just for their content.",
    "I learned how to set type and operate several kinds of printing press. I also learned elements of thoughtful design that can carry over into other art forms.",
    "I learned about the history and process of printing",
    "The biggest thing I learned was the art of letterpress printing and setting type, which I greatly enjoyed. I also learned some of the history of printing at Yale as well as the history of letterpress at large, along with some bookbinding\/bookmaking techniques."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I ended up loving this course, but I know that a few people in the class (myself included) went into it thinking it was more of a history class than an art class. The description of it on the first year seminar page didn't really tell how hands-on it was. One element of this class that was very frustrating was getting into the press. Four press managers had swipe access, but only one was reliable in letting us into the press. The other three rarely were able to let anyone in and often didn't respond to requests (made well in advance) to be let in. It was frustrating that we were not able to swipe into the press when we were allowed to be in there without a press manager. This was by far the biggest weakness of this course. I really, really loved this course. I think it helped me not only in learning typography but in learning how much is available in the Yale libraries and how I can use those resources. Professor Rose is so kind and always helped everyone in the class to feel welcome and valuable.",
    "Professor Roses expertise on printmaking techniques, design and printing practices (among many other derivatives of those) is obvious from the very first moment we met him. I thoroughly enjoyed some of the readings but I wish he had offered the reading packet as a separate pdf that the class could access online, but I do like my physical books on printing techniques! I wish there was more material on actual bookmaking and binding. I also wish the students had steadier access to the press itself because the press managers have a busy life too.",
    "This is a great course for anyone willing to put the effort in. The seminar style is perfectly suited to the course material and contents, enabling every person in the class to gain in-depth experience in the pressroom under expert guidance but also during field trips, and discussions. In addition to Professor Rose, the press managers do a fantastic job mentoring students and aiding projects. As long as you're willing to put in the work in and out of class on your projects, you'll be rewarded by your growth as a student and as a printer.",
    "Strengths: Professor Rose is an amazing teacher who cares so much about printing. The projects are really fun and require all different artistic elements, and you get to create some amazing things. Weaknesses: The projects are very time consuming, so you'll be spending a ton of time in the press. But it's definitely worth it overall",
    "This course was very engaging and interesting and I learned a completely new skill. The only thing that could be improved would be giving students swipe access to the press to work on projects.",
    "The only weakness is that there are no available grades because it is project based. Otherwise the course was wonderful. I learned so much and I am proud of what I made. Professor Rose is a great teacher and very passionate about the class.",
    "The course was very interesting, but also a lot of work when projects were due. The press shop schedule was good, however, sometimes no one would be available to open it for students to work.",
    "Strengths: Even though this was my first semester, I have a feeling that this will be one of the classes I remember as my fondest. Lots field trips to the art library, YCBA, and the law and medical libraries to look at interesting historical examples of print, not to mention a trip to Whitlock's Books! No shortage of things to do in this course, and of course there's the printing projects as well. Weaknesses: even with only nine people, it was hard to work in the pressroom with all of us in there at once. This necessitates working outside of class, which is totally valid and expected of an art course, but it's made harder by the fact that students in the class cannot open the press by themselves. I wonder if there is a different way we could facilitate the opening of the press - set weekly open press hours outside of class once or twice a week, perhaps. Also, I don't remember ever using the book we were asked to purchase at the beginning of the semester."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would, but I would advise them to really think about if they would enjoy spending so much time in the press. While I really enjoyed having the time and space to make things, I think it comparatively is a really large time commitment that a person has to be confident about making.",
    "ABSOLUTELY YES! An incredible opportunity and I am infinitely grateful to Professor Rose for introducing me to such an incredible form of art.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student who wants to learn something new and interesting. Art of the Printed Word was engaging and exciting almost every single time the class met, whether that was going on trips to Whitlock's Book Barn, examining copies of the earliest medical textbooks, or printing our own books and broadsides. It was the type of learning that first got me interested in Yale and I believe that it will remain one of my favorite classes over my time here and beyond.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Professor Rose is amazing and you get to learn something that is super cool and that you would otherwise never get the chance to learn. It's a lot of work, but it's an incredible course, regardless of how artistic you are.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is a unique opportunity and a fascinating class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning how to make quality pieces on a printing press. No level of artistic skill is required for this class to be a wonderful experience.",
    "I would if they are interested in taking a different course, and theyre aware of the workload",
    "Yes! This course is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with historical art equipment. If you're an artist\/bibliophile, you will love having the ability to work in the pressroom. Expect to be in there a lot!"
