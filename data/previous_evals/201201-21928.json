    "If you want to read the Spanish dramas, then this course is for you. I took Spanish 261 last semester and I found the courseload of this semester's is lighter but Susan's expectation for us is higher, so work hard and it will pay off.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to someone else; Prof. Byrne is wonderful for providing information about the author, the time period, and really about anything else that's relevant to the text. An amazing professor\u0097she really enjoys her work. The class is like a discussion section, and, as you're expected to read certain parts of each work before class, and class time is spent in a close analysis of the words and characters through re-reading and acting out the play itself. Not too much work and it's really worthwhile to read what dramatic authors' writing was like in earlier centuries. The 2 essays are a breeze; Prof. Byrne will help you as much as you need it, and there is a chance for revision. The third essay, 10ish pages, is a little more difficult, but she gives you tons of time to do it and is available to help you think of ideas and\/or sources. Take this class.",
    "This is a great, relaxed class. It is largely discussion based and you look at one work from Golden Age Spain over 2-3 class periods. A lot of the class is also reading out-loud various parts of each play, because they can get a bit complicated and it's really helpful to read them with Prof. Byrne's input. 2 short papers (3-5pgs), 1 midterm, and a final paper (10-15pgs). Professor Byrne's great and keeps things fun and light-hearted. If you're interested in the subject material, then go for it!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students who are looking for a challenging and interesting L5 Spanish course. The readings are interesting and worthwhile, although challenging for me. The assignments were fair and even fun to do. I always looked forward to class because we had a great group of students and lively discussions. I'm going to miss this class next semester."
