   "comments": [
    "At a school where courses are often heavy in theory and light on application, this class was so helpful in teaching tangible leadership skills and general life techniques that I can apply now and every day moving forward. We discussed some phenomenal innovators that have changed the course of history in a variety of ways, showing that there are so many ways to make an impact on this world and that it's up to you to identify how you can do that. This was a great course.",
    "Learned about different leaders, leadership styles, innovation and leadership methodology that has been studied, and value based leadership and the importance of it.",
    "I have taken away a new appreciation for leadership and all it entails. I also developed the skills to have deeper conversations with peers.",
    "I learned of the backgrounds of many of America's greatest leaders. I also was grateful for the opportunity to peek into the mind of a top business consultant in the form of our esteemed professor!",
    "I learned a lot from reading about past innovators and leaders that shaped the world. By looking at them through specific frameworks, I developed a deeper understanding of them and their similarities.",
    "Critical reading, great discussion practice, and different types of leadership style and analysis",
    "Discussing my personal experiences in innovation and leadership in a classroom situation.",
    "Learned about amazing leaders, innovators, and the frameworks they developed. Started developing my own frameworks for the type of leader I want to be. Awesome readings, great discussions, great professor, and amazing people in the class.",
    "I learned how to work in a team to create a proposal in regards to different business\/marketing\/entrepreneurial situations. I also learned how to analyze leaders using crafted leadership strategies and how to apply those models to my own leadership."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think there could be even more discussion about the historical figures in today's context. How would their skills and approaches to innovation and leadership translate in modern times? The readings were great, but I wish the discussion included more conversation and less regurgitation. Professor Baldwin walks the walk, and after his midterm survey in which he asked for feedback from students, this definitely improved. He was also kind enough to invite students to pizza after almost every class, which shows how invested he was in actually learning about his students.",
    "Strengths: good, interesting readings, fun case studies at the end of the course, very engaged professor and interesting guests for the seminar. Weaknesses: Sometimes we would just discuss the readings which is a little boring, but other than that, most classes were fun and engaging.",
    "Strengths: Course material Weakness: the way seminar was run (too much focus on regurgitating info)",
    "Strengths- very knowledgeable and passionate instructors. Students also cared a lot about the subjects! Weaknesses- discussions could use more reading analysis and less fact recall.",
    "The course was very engaging and covered many interesting readings. At times, I felt the seminars could go a bit deeper into analysis, but Professor Baldwin took our feedback into account and molded the seminar around it.",
    "This class is a great way to learn about leadership from so many different perspectives. Discussion with your classmates is incredibly insightful and the readings are great (although a bit excessive at times).",
    "Fantastic readings and great professor. Great people in the class too.",
    "I think this course could be improved a couple of different ways. I wish that the discussion in seminar felt less like a pop quiz every week. I wish the discussion were more based around personal experiences. Second, I wish there were more diversity to the subjects that we talk about.",
    "Strengths - pretty much everything. A few boring readings, but most awesome readings. Awesome readings, great discussions, great professor, and amazing people in the class. Great activities to actually work with other students on solving problems we will actually face. Few classes at Yale are as tangible. Weaknesses- Long readings",
    "Strengths: not too much work, humanities credit, some interesting conversations Weaknesses: the readings seemed kinda pointless because they focussed on random tidbits from the leaders's lives, rather than on innovation and leadership. I think most of the students who signed up for the class were looking to learn more about innovative thinking and leaderships skills, and this class didn't necessarily provide that (however, it was a decent course in its own right). Another weakness: the two papers were essentially the same thing just one was longer than the other, and both were pretty useless and boring.",
    "I think that the reading list for this course was great. We read detailed biographies about top American innovators and learned a lot about how their personalities, family backgrounds, and leadership styles allowed them to emerge as the top innovators. I also really enjoyed the group situational activities we had that allowed us to work as a team to creatively think and strategically present our proposals. I did not particularly like how our discussions were focused around summarizing the chapters of the biographies rather than analyzing the leaders and asking critical questions.",
    "Strengths: not too much work, humanities credit, meets once a week Weaknesses: dry discussions, not much innovative focus, meets at night, papers are boring and long"

   "comments": [
    "Take this! A unique and valuable course that I see myself drawing upon well into the future. A course about how to take what you've learned at Yale and use it in the real world.",
    "Low workload, good college seminar with awesome guests and pizza with Prof. Baldwin after every class is definitely a plus. Would highly recommend taking this class. At the start, it may feel a little wishy washy, but as we advanced all the frameworks you discuss start to make sense. Prof. Baldwin does a great job of making everyone \"lean-in\" to a lot of the activities (like coming up with a personal mission statement) and he's also a lot of fun to talk to after class. If you can get in, take this class!",
    "Take this course if you want to hear a bit about leadership theory and reading about people who changed American society.",
    "Fantastic course, one of the top three courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Baldwin knows his stuff and cares about the subject. He went above and beyond what was required as a professor by bringing in guests and continuing the conversations with us over pizza after every class. At first, I was afraid the class would be super \"buzzwordy\" and lack content, and while the former was certainly true, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I learned about leadership, and how often I see the concepts we discussed in class referenced in everyday life.",
    "This course was really fun and the readings about previous innovators and leaders were all really engaging. I learned a lot from being able to see the similarities and differences between these historical figures, and was able to take away some ideas about what makes an innovator\/leader great.",
    "Yes!",
    "I'd strongly recommend this class. The reading are really interesting and the discussion was usually engaging during the seminar. It made me view entrepreneurship differently, and I'm glad I took it.",
    "Yes",
    "Definitely take this class if you can. It's a great learning opportunity, you'll meet great students who you may never have had a chance to get to know otherwise, you'll learn more about our country's great leaders and you'll gain experience and knowledge that you can use for your own leadership in the future.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Take it. You learn so much about amazing leaders and it empowers you to be the best leader you can be, as you realize they are just ordinary people who did extraordinary things.",
    "This is a great opportunity to get a Humanities credit for STEM majors, as it isn't too much work and it's fairly interesting.",
    "If you are a student involved in tech innovation or entrepreneurship, I would recommend this course because I think these students would enjoy the structure of this class. I think humanities students would find the class discussions a bit too surface level. The reading list itself is awesome, so even though the class discussions did not dig as deep as I would have wanted, the reading was very interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're a STEM major looking for a low-workload Humanities credit. If you really want a course on innovation, this isn't it."
