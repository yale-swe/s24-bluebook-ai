   "comments": [
    "This course offers an exciting and impressive introduction to themes of foreign cinema, and is a nice follow-up to the Hollywood-heavy Introduction to Film. Highly recommended for majors, but be forewarned - the class is more work than meets the high. Large classroom\/screening commitment.",
    "Film 240 is a great course for anyone that loves watching movies. I feel like I took a lot of knowledge away from this course. Plus, the professor is really passionate, if a bit disorganized, but passion is always good. Good writing credit, though it is a lot of writing and the grading scales are really weird--not to mention the final paper and final exam.",
    "I really wouldn't recommend this class. I took it because the reviews were great, but I was very disappointed. Some of the movies are good, but a lot aren't. The lectures are so boring that I just stopped going. The readings are terrible. There's not much reason to take this class - just watch some foreign films on your own time.",
    "World CInema is a good introduction to films from various regions around the world. I came out of it knowing a lot more about international cinema than going in.",
    "As someone who hadn't taken a film class before, I found this a perfect intro course. I got to see some great films and interrogate my understanding of 'foreign films' as such. This is a WR course so there's a good bit of writing and the time commitment for the class is more than that of others (2 lectures, section, and 2-hr screening), but it's all worth it. Professor Andrew is knowledgeable and excited about teaching.",
    "This course was a lot of fun and very interesting. I learned more in section though then I did during Prof. Andrew's lectures (which is a first). I thought the lectures themselves were very disorganized and a bit all-over-the-place and times completely irrelevant. The projects and screenings, however, were very interesting and fun and I learned a lot from the readings (which there weren't a whole lot of). Overall, would recommend taking this course.",
    "Great course! Very well taught, interesting lectures and a well-rounded tour of world cinema. I would recommend this course to those interested in film for any reason - whether this is the first film class you've taken or whether you are thinking of majoring in film. However, do know that this class is fairly time intensive when you count in weekly movie screenings, section and the essays.",
    "yes. if you're capable of going to the movies consistently and have an ability to write decently well, expect to get a great grade. if you're capable of doing the readings and listening in lecture, then also expect to learn something about cinema from other countries, and more interestingly about what life is like in other countries through the history and development of their cinema. it's cool as a history class tool.",
    "It is a solid writing credit.",
    "Take this class if you want to be able to talk about films and have a basic background in film terminology. Also, this is kind of a history class at times which is NICE for people like me who do not want to take a real history class and want to learn about film in general.",
    "It's a fun Cr\/D course, as you get to watch a lot of great movies you'd otherwise not be exposed to, all without worrying about all your paper grades. That said, there is a lot of work and a lot of papers. I enjoyed most of them at the end of the day, though.",
    "I would, especially if you have no background in film. I didn't, and I found that it opened up a whole range of ideas and notions.",
    "Ehhhh... yeah I'd say take it. It's a good bit of writing, not too much reading, midterm and final are easy. Professor Andrews is pretty boring but there's a way around that... don't go to class. I did enjoy the class, the films were very interesting and the papers weren't that bad to write.",
    "Take it",
    "Only take it if you're interested in the material. It's fairly dry, not a gut, and it has a big time commitment (meets three times a week plus two hour screening).",
    "The class is very self-aware of its limitations, so if you are looking for a relatively easy, interesting survey course, this is it. But don't expect to me an expert on international cinema. The readings aren't that much, but be prepared to watch 2-3 hour films every week."
