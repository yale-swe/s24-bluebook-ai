    "If you are planning to pursue grad work in math, stats, or econometrics, you should probably take this class. The material is definitely not easy, but Professor Luli is very accessible. If you really, really enjoy real analysis, then you might like this class even if you aren't planning on grad school, but the material tends to be quite pedantic, and the results aren't nearly as elegant as those from MATH 315."
