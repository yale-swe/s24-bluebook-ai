   "comments": [
    "A lot of syntax learning. not much theory",
    "If you want applications of Computer Science, take this instead of 201. It's improved my programming and ability to teach myself new languages, although there are some really random aspects of 200 which are just 201 translated into other languages. Nobody needs to know disassembled Python, but you'll have to regurgitate it for exams. Good luck. Professor Slade is as dry and witty as ever, if you turn up to lectures and tune in to him, which probably isn't necessary to get a good grade. However, the data science aspect of the course is pretty interesting, as you get to write simulations and your own AI strategy for a card game tournament.",
    "Do not take this class. If you want to learn Python and R you will do better to do so on your own using the internet and other sources. This course is extremely uninspiring and uninteresting. It is difficult to pay attention in lecture because the pace is so slow and Professor Slade is not energetic. Additionally many of the lecture notes are taken straight from other sources on the internet. Not a good class.",
    "This course is a good overview of Python and R. The majority of the course is focused on Python, only moving onto R in the last few weeks of the semester. I would recommend this course for people who want a practical introduction to programming or specifically, exposure to R.",
    "Useful class you'll get a lot of practice with Python and R, although the lack of feedback on problem sets can be frustrating.",
    "Take it if you want to force yourself to learn Python.",
    "This is a great course if you want to learn programming",
    "This course offered a very practical introduction to Python and R. All you need is a little programming background to be able to get through the psets (I had done CPSC 112). The psets were very manageable, but start them early, as they often take more than the estimated 6-7 hours. Also, office hours are helpful but do not expect them to know the answer to you question immediately, as they are not required to do the problem sets beforehand.",
    "The one sentence version is that \"this course teaches you Python programming from scratch\". There's more to it than that, but that is at the core and the largest piece. I would recommend this to another student if they: - Want to learn programming from scratch for the first time - Want to learn Python I also believe that a course like this is useful for anyone that will have any sort of interaction with IT\/developers\/programmers in their careers (which is a huge group of people) because it will build intuition of what is and is not possible and how to \"speak their language\"."
