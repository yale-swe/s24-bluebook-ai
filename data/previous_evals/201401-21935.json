   "comments": [
    "A quick-witted and interesting course. The focus on New York through the life of a single man allows this class to get surprisingly deep into many issues confronting the city through its history, especially poverty and race. This isn't a course about a guy who built roads. It's the lives of three generations of New Yorkers epitomized through changes in their city. And the instructor is young, brilliant, and hilarious. If you're lucky enough to be seeing this review in a year when the class is being offered again with Huyseen, take it.",
    "This was a really well-done course. It involved a great deal of reading, but the subject was absolutely fascinating to anyone with an interest in the built environment; cities and suburbs; racial and ethnic divisions in America; ideologies of democracy, government, and power; etc. Class discussion was always engaged, and everyone seemed into the material. Professor Huyssen was both funny and knowledgeable, pushing students to delve deeply into the texts and historical methodologies presented. Overall, a course to take if offered again.",
    "An engaged and stimulating experience of looking at New York through Robert Moses's doing with the help of Robert Caro's The Power Broker. In other words, a very blunt and honest approach to learning what New York has become in the last few decades because of one man. All the while, this class helps you become a better writer and historian. Overall, it's a terrific learning experience! If Prof. Huyssen comes back to teach it again, do it!!!!",
    "Definitely take it, especially if you are interested in urban studies or New York politics\/history. It will blow your mind.",
    "I strongly recommend HIST 117J, although unfortunately it will not be offered again next year. It was a pleasure to study with Professor Huyssen, who incisively dissected the politics of public figures as well as the accounts we read of them. The course at times became mired in criticizing Robert Caro's \"The Power Broker\" rather than focusing on fruitful analyses of New York's urban landscape by other historians.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student if it offered again next year",
    "This is a very, very focused class, which gives you a great sense of the era in which Robert Moses was in power in New York City, and engages deeply in questions about the nature of historiography. The research paper gives you an amazing opportunity to develop your own thoughts on ideas related to this class, and at the same time it allows you tremendous freedom as a writer. I would recommend it strongly to anyone.",
    "I would have recommended \"Robert Moses's New York\" to everybody if David Huyssen were coming back to teach it - but he's not, so I don't know whether the course will be offered again and if it is, then I'm sure there is no way it will be as good. It's a history junior seminar, so you do a big research paper that helps history majors think through how to do the work they'll need to do for their senior essays. I'm not a history major, though, so for me the whole class was a fascinating exercise in thinking critically on what history is, how it's written, how we interpret it, and how to write it. I'm coming away convinced that everything is deeply historical, and sort of wishing I were a history major. The topic is Robert Moses and New York at the same time: the man who helped plan and build NYC for 45 years, and the history of that city and its development. The main text is Robert Caro's 1200-page biography of Moses, though we supplement it with other books and articles as well. It's a fair amount of reading (maybe about 300 pages a week) plus the major paper, but what makes it all worthwhile is Huyssen's brilliance. He's dynamic, funny, makes you notice things about language you never would have thought to before, shuts down BS, weaves critical theories and profound insights together in a way that's very accessible, and is generally a phenomenal teacher who is always willing to sit and help you think through your ideas.",
    "If this course is offered again with the same syllabus, I would recommend it only hesitantly: I don\u2019t think it was worth spending an entire semester discussing Robert Caro\u2019s _The Power Broker_. However, should you have the opportunity to take a class with David Huyssen (if he returns someday to Yale, or if you encounter him at another university), you should absolutely take it--especially if he will be supervising a research project. He is incredibly sharp, and he is not only approachable but also extremely willing to engage with students as intellectual equals. His approach to history and the practice of writing history have already had a profound impact on my writing and thinking."
