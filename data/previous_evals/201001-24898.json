   "comments": [
    "It's a lot of work, but the reading is sooo worth it. Class discussions are great, and I learned a ton taking the class.",
    "definitely recommend. discussion reaches far beyond statement umbrella topic of city v. country",
    "You get to read some amazing novels, but instead of just discussing them, you get a new perspective that can be applied to all future reading. I would definitely recommend this class if you like the books or if you just want to get more out of your reading.",
    "A great class with a sense of both community and scholarship; not without its fun moments! LITR 241 was what I would expect from a lit senior seminar, although the secondary reading was rather more than expected. I think we grappled with heavy texts in a way that made them a) altogether more accessible and b) make sense within a greater theoretical schema.",
    "YES take this - one of the best classes I've had, mostly because of the quality of the texts and the discussion. It felt like one of those great high school classes where you get to know the other members in your class and your teacher really well, making discussion fun and easy. The work load was very easy, but the books were fantastic- best balanced class ever. Brunson is one of the nicest people ever too.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. Professor Brunson is an exceptional Literature professor. In addition to the novels, the course's backbone, students read relevant essays and book excerpts, and analyze 19th century Western European and Russian paintings. As any good class, this one adjusts, within reasonable bounds, to the group of students who happen to be taking it."
