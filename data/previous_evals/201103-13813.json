   "comments": [
    "It is like any other L1 course: work intensive. But by the end of the semester, when you finally feel like you learnt a lot, that is pretty gratifying. If you want to learn the language, you have to take this.",
    "Yes!!! We learned so much in just one semester! I am amazed that we went from not even knowing the alfabet to knowing how to speak in the past, present, future, subjunctive and other high level grammatical constructs. It's amazing how fast paced this class is compared to any lanugage I took in high school.",
    "I would recommend this class, but only to students who truly need Arabic and are willing to dedicate at least two hours to it daily.",
    "This is a good class if you're interested in taking a challenging non-Western language. You learn the alphabet within the first 10 days and then move on to reading short stories and learning simple grammar. If you do the work, it's easy to do well. However, the overall lack of organization (in the teaching and structure of the class) can get frustrating.",
    "This is a fairly self-driven class. Grammar concepts are never introduced in class, you are expected to learn them on your own beforehand and just get more details or practice in class. This is really difficult to do on your own though since the textbook is very simplistic and not comprehensive at all. Overall though, the daily workload is not too bad other than the fact that you have to come to class every day. Tests are relatively fair, though they don't always cover all of the material you were required to review for them. Expectations on assignments are not always clear in this class so make sure to develop a good relationship with the professor so that you're comfortable asking for clarification. Shady is a really fun, relatively nice professor but not always consistent with how strict or lenient he is about expectation for the class. You will always have a blast in class though because of his jokes and fun personality.",
    "Arabic 110 is what you make of it. I highly recommend it to those students who will be willing to put in the time to make it a meaningful course. Without significant study time outside of class, you will not be able to keep up and you will not enjoy the speaking-based nature of the class itself. If you truly care about learning Arabic, this class is a fantastic way to get started and learn a ton in a short period of time.",
    "Take it, but be passionate about it. Do all the homework, even if professor Shady will not immediately check it. This is fundamental as the workload increases incrementally and it is hard to keep up unless you have very very solid bases (like conjugations).",
    "I would highly recommend Arabic 110 to another student. It's a demanding course in terms of how much time the students need to devote to it to do well in the class but I think the time and effort is well worth it.",
    "I would recommend it as long as the student is ready to be very dedicated to the course, and is truly interested to learning Arabic.",
    "Yes, I felt we accomplished a great deal, but I also looked forward to coming to class everyday because it was fun.",
    "Arabic 110 is an intensive but fulfilling introduction to Modern Standard Arabic. You will learn a lot in this course, but be prepared to work. It is highly recommended, but be aware that your experience will depend on the instructor you have."
