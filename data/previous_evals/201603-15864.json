   "comments": [
    "This course was a wonderful and thought-provoking exploration into the works, life and cultural impact of James Baldwin. Students who take the course will gain priceless insight into Baldwin's genius, as well as develop critical reading and writing skills.",
    "I learned that you don't have to agree with everything your professor and classmates says to get a valuable section discussion. I felt that the best classes were the ones where students pushed back in really thoughtful ways",
    "I absolutely became a better writer from taking this course. Writing about Baldwin is difficult because his texts are extremely dense; this challenge improved my analytical writing. I think I became a better personal essay writer as well--this was not a formal part of the course, but rather I just began to write more about myself while reading so many reflective essays from Baldwin.",
    "This course was absolutely amazing. I developed a greater appreciation for Baldwin as well as the ability to admire his work while still maintaining a critical eye. This class stretched me beyond my comfort zone by requiring me to bring not only my thoughts but also myself to the table. Moreover, the participation of classmates, our professor, and our guest scholars made this class a remarkable and memorable experience.",
    "In this class, I learned about James Baldwin, of course, but I also learned how to approach a writer when reading his works as a whole. It was great to see themes play out across books and genres, and to be able to hear what other people saw across texts. It was also interesting to hear criticisms of Baldwin, and to think about how someone who was such a genius in many ways can still be blind to things (esp. the struggles of women) because of the time and place in which he is writing. It was very enlightening to see students talk about that, and to see Professor Goldsby respond.",
    "I got to see a much fuller arc of the development of James Baldwin's ideas. Professor Goldsby is really interested in Baldwin's \"late works\" and understanding them not as lower quality attempts at replicating his more acclaimed early work, but as attempts to address limitations of this earlier work. You get to see how Baldwin works in media besides that of the essay, including music, theater, film, and attempts to take aspects of these different media and incorporate them in writing. You get to see how Baldwin attempted to write about problems of racial difference not just as public national struggle but as a private individual reckoning in each and every one of us. You get to work through Baldwin's relationship with masculinity and his portrayal of black female characters. In addition to writing reading responses (6 total) and a final critical paper (10 pages), you get to do an archival research project. I had never done this before, and Professor Goldsby provided a lot of support in making the research workload reasonable but still feel meaningful. If this course is a Franke Seminar again, you will also attend some lectures by prominent Baldwin scholars and afterwards continue the conversation with them over a delicious dinner.",
    "I developed greater critical reading skills, writing precision, and learned to ask better questions.",
    "I feel like I walked away from this course with an enhanced ability understand, critique, and remain hopeful in our current country. An amazing class.",
    "This course provided opportunities to improve analytic and writing skills while offering a breadth of literature to learn from. As a course that focused on James Baldwin, the insights developed provided critical perspectives for understanding American history and culture."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "In all honesty, I don't know how this course could have been improved. Thoroughly fantastic from beginning to end.",
    "The only way this course could have been improved if Professor Goldsby had spoken a little bit less. She, at times, dominated the discussion and, therefore, some people felt less inclined to jump in.",
    "The course could be made more rigorous by incorporating increased criticism of our writing.",
    "The class gives you a comprehensive, deep ability to explore the works of Baldwin and this allows you to not only know his \"American scene\" with such greatness, but to also be critical of Baldwin and his work. This is a powerful tool. The course's depth includes visits from and dinners with professors from all over the country, and this not only allows you to see humanities work done in different dimensions, but it also helps you take away from the course professors to speak with in the future if you continue this work. The people in the class and the professor are wonderful you will learn so much from all of them. The only way I imagine the course being improved is for the final research projects; perhaps allowing for me time to give each presentation, and this means actually doing \"cluster\" work so groups rather than individuals go at a time. The reading responses were extremely helpful to synthesize thinking along the way and receive feedback on writing.",
    "This course provides an incredible opportunity to engage critically with Baldwin's work.",
    "Strengths: -Baldwin is a talented writer whose ideas are incredibly relevant to questions of racial difference and, at core, human nature, today -Professor Goldsby really knows how to manage seminar productively, also gives great advice during individual meetings -Opportunities to reflect critically on the reading and eventually develop ideas into a longer argument in the final paper Weaknesses: -Official reading load a little heavy at times. Less so when reading the nonfiction than fiction. Often there would be assigned scholarly writing in addition to whatever particular work of Baldwin's we were considering for the day. I think the Baldwin writing alone often felt quite substantial for a single class discussion. In practice we often did not discuss the additional assigned work at all. Better to make these optional except when the scholarly work really is going to be engaged in class. -Just Above My Head is an awesome read that deserves more than 2 weeks. Perhaps 2 weeks plus the Thanksgiving break would work.",
    "The course was incredibly engaging, wth amazing resources and opportunities for learning. It was a real commitment, setting a high standards for the rest of the courses I take. I can't think of many weaknesses.",
    "The material, design, and pacing of this course cannot be beaten. Each week it was like adding a piece to a growing puzzle. Focusing on one author can sometimes feel saturating and tiring, but this class kept everyone engaged. When discussion went well it went really well. Some days it was harder to catalyze conversation."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, yes, yes. This course was fantastic. Whether you are a Baldwinian scholar already or have never read any of his works before, you will be challenged to think in new ways and will be so happy to have been able to explore Baldwin in such a meaningful way.",
    "Yes working with prof goldsby was great and Baldwin is amazing",
    "You read great material and the work is completely manageable!",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who enjoys reading, writing, Baldwin, or American history.",
    "Yes. Please take this class, if you can. You will be challenged in many dimensions, but you will see real results of you work by the time the finals classes come, and you can make critical analyses or deep connections from other weeks or work. You will meet people who think about Baldwin in different ways, and these dinners and lectures you will never forget.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this, or any class with Professor Goldsby. She was great, and though she clearly knew more than anyone else in the room about Baldwin, she listened thoughtfully and responded to students. She also was great with every guest lecturer we had, and helped ask questions to open them up to us. It's also great to take a course that focuses on one writer or thinker, because it can give you a unique perspective on that person and their work, as well as help you approach other writers later.",
    "Definitely.",
    "Absolutely take this seminar if you are willing to commit a lot of time to it. It's probably good if you have read some of his work in the past already and enjoyed it. You will read a lot of Baldwin, which I found to be a great feature, but if you are not as enthusiastic about Baldwin then you may be in a tough situation. You'll see a lot more complexity in his writing if you go beyond the canonical favorite works of his (e.g. The Fire Next Time, Notes of a Native Son). Professor Goldsby has such fluency with Baldwin's work and earnestly wants everyone in the class to engage and make for a strong conversation, not just push her ideas across to us. She makes us work through ideas more rigorously when necessary, but is also great at acknowledging the class's diversity of perspectives. While possessing such great academic ability, she brings her full self to the seminar table - you interact with her as a human, not just as a professor.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in American history, literature, and James Baldwin. The course leaves me feeling confident in my knowledge of the author and the texts we read, with a desire to read more, which I feel is the most you can ask of any class.",
    "100% take this course! You will not regret it. Professor Goldsby is a gem and you will fall in love with James Baldwin if you are not already.",
    "Absolutely yes! This course is an immense privilege. If you have the opportunity to take it, you should."
