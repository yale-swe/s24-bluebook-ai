   "comments": [
    "Take it if you're at all interested in plants or if you just want to know something useless but really interesting!!!",
    "I learned interesting facts in Plants but it is unclear how many of them will stick with me. The class was merely a march through the phylogeny of plants with small tangents into larger concepts. The amount of memorization needed before exams makes it unattractive as a science credit for non majors, but unless you are crazy into plants it won\u0092t be of particular interest for majors either.",
    "This class is extremely taxonomy-heavy. A LOT of memorization is involved, and if you want this to pay off at all you really should take the lab \u0096 I didn't, but feel as though that could have helped me absorb a lot more of the information and have a better understanding of the adaptations discussed in lecture. Overall, this is a really thorough overview of the plant phylogeny, a lot of fun if you're a gardening enthusiast or a cook, and incredibly useful if you are at all interested in botany and plant biology. Also, Wendy is a fantastic instructor!",
    "This was a great course. This is the first time the course has been offered in years and Wendy teaches it like she's been doing it for years. I highly recommend taking lab with this course. It is a lot of rote memorization so if you are good at memorizing things, it will be a good course. This course is great for people who have no experience in bio courses or a lot experience in bio courses because Wendy is very helpful and her lectures are very clear. She is a botanist herself and a young professor so her enthusiasm shines through when she teaches and it is contagious. Also, Beth, the TA was helpful and both of the instructors were pleasant to work with. Take this!!!",
    "It is definitely worth your time if you are at all interested in plants. I would definitely recommend!",
    "The first part of of the course covers everything you need to know about bryophytes, lycophytes, gymnosperms, etc. The second half of the course is Angiosperm Taxonomy compressed into half a semester.I would recommend it, provided you have significant background knowledge on plants and flowers (can you name any of the flowers in your mother\u0092s flower garden? If not, this course will be extremely challenging).",
    "If you're interested in the material then this class is certainly worth taking. It is very much a taxonomy and identification based class however, so if you're not as interested in specific families as broad ideas of plant diversity then the class will not be engaging. If you do have the patients for the taxonomy, then the course is very rewarding and you will get an understanding of greater plant diversity and some evolutionary theory.",
    "If you really enjoy plants and want a broad understanding of what plants are in the angiosperm phylogeny, I would definitely take this class. It's one of the most practical classes I have taken at Yale, and has allowed me to view my surrounding environment with a whole new perspective.",
    "Good overview if you're into plants, take something else if you're just broadly interested in organismal biology.",
    "The lectures are dry and the tests are hard...it's interesting and will change the way you look at the world but will be tough on the way there. If you're not planning to continue with plant science\/botany it will also feel tedious and not relatable enough. I am happy about the knowledge base I gained from this class but I did not enjoy the process of gaining it.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR A SCIENCE CREDIT. I REPEAT: DO NOT TAKE THIS FOR A SCIENCE CREDIT.Only take it if the course description is EXACTLY what you are interested in. As in, really, really interested in. Don't mess around. No dilettantes, and no Sc shoppers should even vaguely consider this course. Just, no."
