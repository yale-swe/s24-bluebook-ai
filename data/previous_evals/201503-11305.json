    "if you are studying and have interest in Medieval and Reformation History, i suggest you not to miss this class.",
    "Lots of study of historiography in the field. Long final paper, but you have a lot of freedom in topic.",
    "Prof. Eire's class provides an introduction to popular religion both as a concept and as an interpretive lens through which to approach problems of religion on medieval Europe. The syllabus was wonderfully diverse in its scope and each week had a discrete and approachable subject. If you're interested in either medieval culture or religion, this class is a must-take.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to all Divinity students.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Weekly discussions about a book plus some recommended articles. One-two students lead discussion each week, and everyone prepares a final paper of approx. 30 pages. If you are at all interested in medieval studies, religious studies, etc., this is a great option. Very highly recommended."

    "My interest area is Protestant Reformation, it was very helpful and informative for me. i am glad that i took this class, and prof. Eire is awesome!",
    "I took this course as an undergraduate. It helped me to get a better feeling for what graduate work in history might be like.",
    "This course allowed me the opportunity to expand my understanding of familiar subject matter using a new interpretive schema. I will be taking the questions raised in \"Popular Religion\" on to other classes I plan to take in the coming semester.",
    "This course gave me an in-depth view of the topics and challenges of the study of popular religion, especially, but not limited to the early modern period.",
    "I didn't know a lot about or have much of an interest in popular religion before I took the course but I am now very interested in popular religion or rather have realized that a lot of different things I am interested in fit under the label of popular religion.",
    "I think that we covered a lot of ground in this course and all gained a better grasp of the slippery issue of popular religion in Europe."
