   "comments": [
    "Great class overall, not a bad work load, and Professor Brick is the man.",
    "Loved the class, Professor Brick is great and the workload is light.",
    "A great way to get a LAAA credit for the history major \u00e2\u0080\u0094 just a midterm and a final paper. Brick delivers a good lecture and is very accessible outside of class \u00e2\u0080\u0094 be sure to get lunch with him, as he has lots of interesting things to say.",
    "The class only has a midterm exam and a final paper. Doing the reading is helpful for your final paper, because otherwise you are dealing with a lot of terms that you have no clue what they mean.",
    "It was interesting if you really enjoy ancient civilizations but it is very vague because there is not much proof about the topic.",
    "Yes it was a good class to finish distributional requirements for history major and it was interesting and not TOO much reading outside class.",
    "Actually, I very much recommend this class.It's extremely straight-forward. Readings alternate between an enjoyable--if old-fashioned--textbook, and primary source excerpts or journal articles. They're not entirely necessary though, because the lectures cover almost everything that you need to know and the lecture slides are posted online. I'm sure some people used this as an excuse not to go to class, and although I recognize that you could probably do that and get away with it, I wouldn't recommend it, mostly because if you're skipping this class then maybe that says something about you and your interest in learning more so than the class itself. It's an enjoyable, easy time in lecture and you get to learn a lot of interesting things. Why wouldn't you go?The best part of the class, to me, is learning about a topic that's totally new to most people. Even if you don't learn the most fascinating things ever in the class, it's really interesting and cool just because it's new. At least in my opinion, a straight-forward class on Ancient India is going to be better than a straight-forward class on WWII or the American Revolution or something just by virtue of it being new to most people.The grades break down into 40% for a midterm (straight-forward, fact-based questions), 50% on a final paper (on any topic, and I ended up getting really into mine), and 10% participation. Very manageable.Finally, David Brick is incredibly sweet and knowledgable and really wants to get to know you if you want to too. He has very reasonable expectations and wants to help.I wouldn't recommend this class to someone who wants a more theoretical class, or a more advanced class. But if you're looking for something not too difficult, interesting, and possibly pre-industrial or LAAA for the history major, it's a great choice. Just, maybe not for your last class at Yale or your only history class ever or something.",
    "Easy lecture course, not too much work, and an interesting subject. Lectures could get bone dry, but they're always online, and you don't necessarily need to go to every one.",
    "Take this course! It is an excellent overview of pre-Islamic India, and covers all the main topics in that period of history. It does a good job of balancing religion and history, as most of the historical texts from that era are also religious texts. Also, it is a manageable work load, with a midterm exam and final paper.",
    "Yes, not much work.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Indian history. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a history credit who wants to learn more about non-western tradition.",
    "Should be called History of Ancient Indian Religions and placed in the Religious Studies Department.",
    "Take it if you are interested in the topic, or learning more about ancient India."
