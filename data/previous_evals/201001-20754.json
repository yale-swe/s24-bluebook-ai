    "I definitely recommend the course, best course on MOS.",

    "The course is a very comprehensive and hands-on introduction to semiconductor devices and technology. Great for first year engineering grad students."

    "This course allowed me to deeper understand my research discipline and laid important foundations for my dissertation. I gained practical experience in the cleanroom necessary for future fabrication processes.",

    "helped to give me a better understanding in this area and towards future research",
    "The course is relevant to my research and in that respect deepened my understanding of the field and contributed to my dissertation progress."
