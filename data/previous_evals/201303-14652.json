    "It will save you from a lot of pitfalls in pronunciation.Taking it early is important, because the instructor points out a lot of quite non-obvious issues and errors. If I did not address these issues as early, I doubt I would have been able to correct them later after they become a habit.",
    "One of best English class I ever had. Yes.",
    "The course will help you to be a little bit more prepared to start teaching. The focus is on pronunciation, but also vocabulary and teaching strategies are taken into consideration. I would recommend the course, although I think that a course more focused on teaching strategies rather than language skills would be more helpful."

    "The course is not intended to deepen the knowledge of my own discipline. However it did help a little bit to improve my language and teaching skills, which I need during my graduate studies and later on for my profession."
