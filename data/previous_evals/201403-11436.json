This is a class that could not be taught in a classroom, and we were so lucky to have Ann taking us into the forest every week.",

I started looking trees carefully such as the shape of leaves, color of burkes. Even walking down the street, I started enjoying new landscapes captured with my new 'eyes'. The material covered in the class is applicable even in the different part of the world.",
    "Ann and Marlyse are amazing, and the fiedltrips are just right.",
    "The field trips, the diversity of sites we visited and the fact that as an international student without a car you got to see a good deal of the forests in Connecticut :)",

    "We definitely should have had a few classes covering the Taxonomy part (rather additional classes than cancelling field trips), since this was a big part of the final exam. Also it should have been made clearer that in the midterms exam we are supposed to know all of the species already."

    "Take this course if you love being outdoors and want to know your trees. Be careful to study as you go and practice on your own. Don't think of learning the tree species as memorization; think of it as making new friends. It takes time, but your memories will stick if you put in that time to form new relationships with each tree.",
    "So this course is mostly valuable if you are going to work in a temperate region, preferably even in the US. The taxonomy part helps you orient yourself in general, though.",
