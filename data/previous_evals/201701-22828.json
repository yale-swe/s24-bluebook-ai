   "comments": [
    "The principles of the Sonata Theory, knowledge of extensive classical repertory; I also developed a more comprehensive understanding of contemporary discourse in Formen-lehre and its inherent tensions with the Sonata Theory.",
    "I learned to analyze sonata movements using Sonata Theory.",
    "I found this class to be an effective introduction to Sonata Theory as an analytical method \/ hermeneutic heuristic. While I had previously learned the \"Figure 2.1 from Page 17\" version of Sonata Theory, this class was a methodical education in all aspects of the theory, built from the ground up. I am confident that my experiences in this class will be the groundwork for all of my future encounters with sonata movements, analytic and otherwise.",
    "I learned to think about connections within a musical piece on several levels, as well as to think more broadly about the composer's style, and how deviations from the norm can gain meaning.",
    "As expected, I learned the ins and outs of Sonata Theory, as well as a decent amount of form-functional theory to either contrast ST or provide tools for analyzing lower-level formal constructions. We got it straight from the horse's mouth, so it doesn't get much better than that."

   "question_id": "GS403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are both its depth of a particular method and breadth of the repertories studied. However, application of the theory to Romantic repertories felt less productive and insighful.",
    "I wish this course had fewer students so that we were able to express our views more often.",
    "The strengths of this course were too numerous to mention all of them. I will single out the depth of the occasional prepared lectures as well as the prepared handouts as particularly excellent and useful - it is clear that this was only the latest iteration of a course that has been refined over many years. I would only call out two \"weaknesses,\" although they really boil down to \"things I would do differently.\" The content both inside and outside of class was almost exclusively analytic, and while I very much enjoyed doing all this music analysis (certainly the most I've done for a class at Yale), there were a few moments when I felt like I would have liked a seminar-style discussion of assigned reading. The two moments in particular that stick out were after reading Vasili Byros' excellent article on Beethoven's 2nd, and after reading Appendix 1 of Elements, both of which I would have liked to digest as a class. The second \"weakness\" for me, and perhaps this is a frustration with my peers rather than with the class itself, was how elementary the material was at times. I realize that I am speaking here as a Theory student in a class that (quite effectively) catered to students with a wide range of Theory backgrounds. Still, I found it frustrating that we had to spend several weeks covering material like Caplin's phrase types, material that I felt I had mastered during my undergraduate studies. Again, I recognize this was necessary to accommodate all of the different student backgrounds, but I often felt that class dragged because of rather simple misunderstandings or misconceptions, especially in the beginning of the semester.",
    "This class was absolutely wonderful, full of love of music, and interesting discussions. The \"drill\" style exercises were very useful in the beginning of the year, as was the general atmosphere in class. The one thing I wanted a bit more of was a clear delineation of the limits of Sonata Theory. I think it can usefully be applied to music outside its original repertoire, but the implications of such an application could have been more clearly spelled out.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the course very much. As great as it is to learn from one of the creators of Sonata Theory, it does make questioning and\/or problematizing certain aspects of it more difficult."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend the course primarily because of the expertise and enthusiasm of the professor.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to all of the music theory and musicology students.",
    "Yes, even if the student is unsure that they want to interact with 18th- and 19th- century \"Classical\" sonatas.",
    "This course allows students to get a deeper understanding of core-repertory from the classical canon but in a very compelling way. The music came back to life for me, and I felt both intellectually challenged and free to speak about my musical intuitions: a combo that seems to be rare in classroom settings.",
    "Glad to have had the opportunity to take what may have been the last iteration of this course!"
