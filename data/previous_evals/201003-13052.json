    "TAKE THIS CLASS.. MY FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE SO FAR (and i spend hours bluebooking and shop way too many classes each shopping period because I'm committed to never wasting a single credit)it will open your mind and your heart to the problems we are facing right here in America. So often people go on these mission trips to Africa, or South America, but just look at what is going on here, to you fellow citizens, you neighbors... your friends. We at Yale are soo lucky.. and this class will bring you right back down to earth and get you to roll up your sleeves and think about how you would go about making changed. Prof Maralani is a role model and our TF Matt was incredible. we were a small class, which was incredible, but no matter what the size, take it.",
    "SOCY 314 is a rewarding course, mainly because class discussion is very rich and Professor Maralani is an amazing teacher. That said, be prepared to work unbelievably hard on your final project -- often without much guidance.",
    "Take this course! If you're interested about understanding the causes behind the inequalities in America, this is the class to take. The readings were initially a bit difficult because they are sociology studies and sometimes heavy on methodology, but they get much easier to comprehend over time. They were always very enlightening and contributed to the classroom discussions, which focused on the various individual and social causes of these problems. Additionally, you get to design your own literature review and research proposal for any inequality that you personally want to study, which is definitely one of the highlights of the class. Professor Maralani is awesome and always available to help you with the project or if you just want to talk about the readings. It is definitely one of the best classes I've taken so far and really made me think from a sociological perspective about the various solutions for the disparities in America.",
    "This class is worth taking, but be prepared for a lot of reading and worksheets. One of the highlights was the individual research project. Also, Professor Maralani is great."
