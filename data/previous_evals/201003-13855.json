    "Yes. Keller was very good about holding office hours to consult with us on our projects. The readings were usually easily found and uploaded to v2 which was convenient.",
    "The instructor compiled a helpful and engaging reading list, from which the students could draw inspiration for ideas, and also for how to convey those ideas. While not all topics covered were relevant to each student, the collective body of materials was an excellent resource as we worked toward developing our proposals. The only suggestion I would emphasize is that students should be encouraged to begin developing their proposals over the entire course of the semester. While most of the development occurred post-mid term, a great deal of the research into finances, germs, multipliers, etc could be done in the early stages of the semester, leaving a longer time to fine-tune the actual business plan and proposal. It also would allow more time to test out and vet the idea in class and in a realistic context. Otherwise, the material and trajectory of the course was both challenging and rewarding. It was a highly enjoyable class!",
    "Yes, resources were easy to find, though sometimes readings were not posted until the night before which made things difficult.",
    "We had all of the resources we needed.",
    "The resources were very adequate."
