   "comments": [
    "This course is worthwhile if you want to know more about one artist, but it also extrapolates to art theory in general.",
    "A class on everything Rembrandt",
    "the in-class sections are so bad. stop doing that.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to anyone interested in Renaissance art or portraiture. It's a fantastic course!",
    "A wonderful course on a fascinating topic",
    "Good art history class for non majors",
    "I would recommend because this class is easy, has very little work, and you get to look at cool Rembrandt paintings.",
    "Pretty basic art history class that gives you the tools to learn how to look at a work",
    "Pretty interesting, low work art history course. Nothing special, but definitely good.",
    "This course was alright. I would probably take it Credit\/D if I could do it again (given that I'm not an Art History major and this was more of a \"take for fun\" thing). I'm glad that I got to study Rembrandt and his work with such depth, and I learned a lot about how to analyze paintings. But the lecture could be dry and occasionally hard to follow. They did a thing where they combined section and lecture -- so class went from 11:35 to 12:50. One day a week that whole time would be a lecture and the other day of the week it would be lecture until 12pm and then \"section\" from 12-12:50. I thought this was bad because 1) having a section style discussion in a 40 person lecture is awks, especially when no one wants to talk 2) the lectures felt super long. I hope they don't do this next time. Workload was alright. Pretty good amount of reading, with some theoretical stuff that may be hard to understand if you don't have a background in this topic. 1 midterm (straightforward), 1 paper on a text, 1 final paper on a painting. The grading was reasonable."
