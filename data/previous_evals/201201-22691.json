   "comments": [
    "It's a straightforward question. Do you want to focus on your speaking abilities in Spanish this semester? If the answer is yes, take this course. If the answer is no, don't take this course.",
    "Pretty good class. Shop different sections and see which you like.I felt like I got a lot lot more comfortable with speaking spanish through this class, although my grammar got a little worse maybe since we weren't focusing on it. Overall not too bad. I would def recommend it. (Just check over your homeworks carefully,since the grammar grading is very nitpicky. you get to revise it though so no worries.)",
    "I recommend this class and the professor as well.",
    "Yes. I don't think you will become fluent by taking this class but it definitely provides great progress.",
    "I'd recommend taking SPAN 150 with Professor Leon because she really helped me improve my Spanish. However, I would recommend that you take lighter courses in conjunction with this one, or at least allow yourself more time than you'd think to devote for this class.Professor Leon challenged me to use a ton of new vocabulary, and pushed me both in class and in my writing to analyze more than I ever had in my other classes.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 150 to a student looking to maintain the ability to converse in Spanish without taking on an extremely rigorous language credit. This class is an excellent way to complete the language requirement for L5 Spanish.",
    "This class was enjoyable, but it's really about being able to BS--it's kind of like an English class, you discuss novels, debate, etc. You have to be able to speak on the spot and always have ideas. For Rosamaria Leon--she's an awesome teacher, but make sure you use the vocabulary and as many precise\/big words as possible in order to get a better grade. She's kind of a tough grader.",
    "It's a conversational class that assumes a fairly strong grammatical background already, so the focus is far more on fluency\/vocabulary than on writing. It definitely improved my Spanish significantly, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to do the same.",
    "It is a class that enhances your oral spanish by placing a large importance on oral tests. Topics and literature covered are interesting and enjoyable to investigate. I would recommend it."
