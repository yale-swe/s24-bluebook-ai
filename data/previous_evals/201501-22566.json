    "Who you are will determine if this is the right class for you (duh...) Are you going to be a physics major? No: You probably don't want to take this class. Yes: What is your math background? I have completed AP Math BC and did a good job but nothing more: You need to be better at math. Take MATH 120 and MATH 225- self-study some physics (I suggest working through Taylor's Classical Mechanics. Getting through at least chapter eight would be a reasonable goal for the year and would prepare you for PHYS 410- don't worry about not taking PHYS 260\/261) I have completed a course in Multivariable calculus: First ask yourself: Am I really, actually any good at multivariable calculus? If not then you didn't take a course in multivar and go back a step. If so, you might want to consider MATH 230\/231 paired with MATH 222 (alternatively you could take just MATH 225 with PHYS 260\/261). Again, the physics class is really optional (as long as you are willing to do at least some self-studying-- notice a pattern?) I am a math wizz: You probably won't get much out of this course, go ahead and enroll in PHYS 410.",
    "As long as Baltay is teaching the course it will be good. Curve is very generous and you learn a lot of cool stuff with a very manageable workload. If Anna is still the TA you are in luck.",
    "NO do not take this class. Baltay gives an extremely non-rigorous and even more confusing overview of quantum mechanics and general relativity; you will have to memorize a million equations for the final because he doesn't teach in a way that lets you actually understand what's going on. And then you will forget it all. Sounds like a waste right?",
    "PHYS 261 is good if you've never seen any quantum before, but the GR part is total bs. Depending on how much you want to do physics for, it might be worth slogging through it just to see the quantum. Also don't believe the kids who say they \"get\" the GR portion-- they are most certainly lying. Baltay never explains what a tensor is, possibly because he himself doesn't know, so even though we can all manipulate the symbols according to these arbitrary rules he gave us to get the answer he wants, that does not mean anyone knows what a tensor actually is, why we need them, or what it means to be contravariant or covariant (other than, of course, the self-referential and arbitrary reasons Baltay gives us).",
    "Physics 261 is a more qualitative look at many of the coolest ideas of physics. Coming out of Math 120, I had no chance of fully understanding all the math that Baltay used in the General Relativity unit, but if you memorize a few derivations from his notes then the tests should be fine. The first three-fourths of the course were quite good and almost made up for the GR finale, but I still would not recommend 261 to anyone who doesn't need it for a requirement.",
    "PHYS 261 is definitely a challenge, but one where you'll learn a lot and enjoy yourself a lot. I really appreciated learning all of this new subject matter, even though it was difficult. I'd recommend this class to anyone who is interested in physics, though, if you're not very good at math, I'd recommend auditing it instead.",
    "A disappointment after 260. Baltay attempts to cover way too much material, and as a result he does so in a cursory manner. During the general relativity unit, there is not much to gain from actually attending lecture, because you have all of Baltay's semi-comprehensible notes in a packet, which he just copies to the board in painstaking detail but with insufficient explanation. His lack of precision in notation, especially for such an intensely mathematical unit, is beyond frustrating. Quantum mechanics was interesting, but we just brushed over many topics. It would've been much more satisfying to delve deep into a topic instead of handwaving our way through a large chunk of modern physics. I would not take this course again. While I would recommend 260 to many, I cannot recommend 261. Probably a better sequence would be 260\/201, or maybe just 200\/201.",
    "If you took PHYS 260 you should also take 261! I was thinking of taking 201 instead because I'm not a physics major and quantum physics and general relativity just sounded intimidating. But I'm glad that I stuck with 261 because the materials were very interesting. The grading for the midterm and psets were very generous. I would recommend going to the problem sessions on Friday, especially if you find the pset hard. I attended the sessions every week and it helped a lot both for the psets and the exams.",
    "A conceptually diffucult but fascinating course that delves into the complex fields of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Your brain is constantly strained with the strange physics of tiny particles, waves, and gravity, but the psets only take a few hours a week and the course is very rewarding in the end. Both the midterm and the final were very reasonable if not downright easy. Take this course if you are interested in these fields of physics and want a not-so-rigourous introduction to them.",
    "Take physics 260\/261 if you have a background in mechanics and electricity and magnetism. Don't worry about how hard he makes the course sound at first. Professor Baltay goes over the basics of mechanics and electro-magnetism in the first semester and does so very well. I enjoyed every topic we learned about in the class.",
    "PHYS 261 is a great class. As a non-physics major, a lot of the material felt kind of unnecessary for my academic interests, so I would recommend that non-physics majors take a different class, but it definitely covers a lot of interesting (if abstract) material. Baltay and Anna are fantastic in their teaching roles!",
    "Physics 261 was easier and more interesting than the previous semester. We covered a lot more new material, albeit a lot of the material you are guaranteed to have seen in some high school physics class. When you start General Relativity things start to get harder to follow, but Baltay gives you his own notes in a nice book form and really helps to be able to review and point out any mistakes during the lecture.",
    "The second semester moves much more quickly. Waves, quantum, general relativity, cosmology. The first two units are good. The waves material comes from Griffiths E&M, and the quantum from Krane. If you want a solid understanding of quantum, though, I'd recommend reading Griffiths quantum (especially if you liked his E&M book). The general relativity and cosmology units are more difficult to follow. The derivation of Maxwell's equations from special relativity is really cool. But the gravitational stuff becomes difficult to follow Baltay can hardly expect freshman and sophomores to have backgrounds in differential geometry. Cosmology is cool.",
    "If you're really truly skilled and interested in physics, you should probably petition the DUS to skip this class altogether and start in with the more serious treatments of individual topics (mechanics, thermo, etc.) designed for serious sophomores. That way you'll avoid spending a year feeling like you're putting in a fair amount of time into reviewing high-school mechanics and E&M and gaining superficial understanding of a too-ambitious, wide range of topics.",
    "If you are bored by the average physics class and would prefer something more exciting I would take this class. If all you are interested in is getting a foothold on physics I would probably start with one of the lower classes. Physics 261 is filled with kids who are very invested in being good at what they do, and the class itself often uses mathematics that are nigh-incomprehensible. Also this class is good for anyone highly interested in the properties of special and general relativity.",
    "Physics 261 has extremely difficult and complex course material (Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity) but to do well in the class grade is quite easy. You do not need to understand the material well to be able to solve the simple problems on the homework and on the tests. I think the point of this class is not to really get you to master these to topics it is more meant to excite you about Physics and make you want to take more. However, for me this class did not excite me about physics because I enjoy learning things in Physics only when I really understand them. Learning about cool ideas or topics in physics doesnt excite me unless I understand them. I, as well as most of the other kids in the class simply didnt have the mathematics background and free time to really understand all the material being taught. If you are like me and only like learning things that you truly-truly understand I would not recommend this class. If you get excited by someone telling you some very cool advanced equations in physics with a bunch of plausibility arguments for these equations but NOT proofs, then you should take this class.",
    "Very fun class! I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to get a taste of the advanced topics in physics.",
    "This class was an excellent continuation of Physics 260. The strength of the two intensive introductory physics courses is that they provide access to the conceptual development of the gravitational and electromagnetic forces from Newton to Maxwell to Schrodinger to Einstein to Hubble. This means that as freshmen, we have the ability to cover a higher amount of material than the other introductory courses cover. Anyone who took Physics 260 should take this class. It presents quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology in a highly accessible format. While the material itself was much more challenging to understand than the previous semester's mechanics and E&M, the problem sets and midterm were easier to manage. This allowed us to focus on the primary goal of the course, learning and appreciating the subject.",
    "PHYS 261 was a fascinating introduction to Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. Although technically an introductory freshman course, this semester was fast-paced and mathematically intensive. There were weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final. The workload was reasonable, especially given the nature of the subject, and I found the exams to be fair. Professor Baltay was awesome he teaches in a clear, concise, and effective manner. I would highly recommend this course if you are interested in physics and have the math background necessary.",
    "I would recommend Phys 261, but only to someone who was up for a challenge and really liked physics.",
    "It is what it claims to be, a top-level introductory college physics course. None of the material is overwhelmingly difficult, but it can be easy to fall behind and end up not understanding some of the material, even if you know how to use it on the tests. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in pursuing physics, or even just someone who wants to expose themselves to a good chunk of physics in an efficient manner before moving on to something else.",
    "TL;DR - Take it! The grading is way easier than it might seem, and the topics that you will study certainly pay off in the end. PHYS 261 is an amazing introduction to Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. If you have taken PHYS 260, you should know that it is more confusing and less people will have heard of the topics before (since PHYS 260 might feel like a review for some students, which will hardly happen during the General Relativity part of 261). However, the effort certainly pays in the end, and you will be able to say that you had at least an introduction to the major concepts in both QM and GR. *NOTE ON GRADING - IT IS NOT BAD If you are worried that the considerably harder topics will affect your GPA, keep in mind that there are weekly psets, one midterm and one final, and that all of them are much, much easier than the class itself. For instance, last year's final only had one question on GR, and it was an easy one (from the first week of classes), which is much easier than everything that Baltay covered in class.",
    "A more intuitive class and a lot more interesting compared to 260. EM\/Mechanics are largely solved topics, but QM and GR is so exploratory in nature. For me, 261 was the easier course because there were fewer hard formulas to memorize and knowing the general concepts helped much more. Take this course if you started with 260 because you need 2 semesters of physics for most science and engineering majors."
