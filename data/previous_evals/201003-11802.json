    "If you're at all interested in meaning and how it works, take this class. You will learn something for sure. Just be sure that you're ok with Horn's lecturing style.",
    "This class is much more philosophical than a traditional semantics class. Don't go into it unless you are willing to handle difficult and long philosophy of language papers (which don't actually come around until the second half of the semester). Professor Horn is more of a lecturer, but he is brilliant. And all of the assignments (midterms and final, included) are take-home, which is great. Definitely take it, if you're interested in the material and can handle the philosophy readings at the end of the semester.",
    "Don't take it unless you are sure you like linguistics. I took it as my very first linguistics course and found out how little linguistics interested me. lots of very heady theory readings that go on at length about very small concepts."
