    "Yeah, a pretty easy-going class.",
    "A cool class where you talk about some new and important topics regarding the role of media in activism internationally. It is not too difficult, but it can be fun sometimes and can be an interesting look into a pretty new field. That said, it will be unfocused at times: the material can, occasionally, feel superficial because we don't look at it on the most academic level (all of the source material is incredibly new), and though we try to problematize popular interpretations of activism and the internet, you will not have the most rich critical discussions ever.",
    "I liked this class a lot. Only do it if you're interested in the readings because there's a lot of it. The discussion felt unstructured at times but people generally had interesting things to say. Guest speakers are excellent too. If social activism, the Internet, tech policy, censorship, protests etc interest you at all, you'll like this class.",
    "This class could be interesting if you are interested in digital activism (particularly outside of America) but could also be fairly boring if you don't feel passionately about those things. The coding exercises were really cool though and although there was always a ton of reading, there wasn't a huge amount of other work.",
    "Digital Media Activism is an excellent course and worth your time, if you put in the effort! The readings are insightful, and definitely have helped me in my digital media activism efforts. As the syllabus states, this course is for practitioners. So, if you come into this course prepared to learn both theory and useful applications (i.e. how to protect yourself digitally as a journalist, how to code data mining scripts, etc), then this course will be immensely helpful to you. TL;DR -- If you're an activist and serious about learning how technology and the Internet can help you expand your cause's reach and efforts, take this class."
