    "A short answer: Free Trip. Long answer: There is really nothing like this class at Yale. While the trip is still the main reason to take this class, the cased-based discussions are interesting, and the level of access Bo and this class gets you to people actually working in the field is simply unparalleled. Bo is also just a great guy to work with and get to know. Take it - and if you're a sophomore reading this, apply to GLBL so you can get in!",
    "Great class and one-of-a-kind experience at Yale. You spend the first semester analyzing cases, get paid to take 2-3 weeks in the summer to go visit a social enterprise in a developing country yourself, and spend the second semester writing up your case. I really enjoyed reading and analyzing cases this semester - I don't have a business background and I personally found it fascinating. Don't expect a structured, academic experience, because this field is hardly structured and it's more about cases and examples. There were a lot of written assignments - while it wasn't too stressful, there was at least one 2-page assignment every week. Bo is a knowledgeable and approachable person as well as a great instructor. It may be a little unclear exactly what he wants - sometimes it felt like there was a predetermined answer he wanted to get at, both during discussions and for assignments. This can seem like you can't really think for yourself and be creative, but at the same time, I found value in getting to what he thought.",
    "Yes, for students interested in learning more about social enterprise, I would definitely recommend this class. The opportunity to travel to a developing country and study a social enterprise is not one that you come across too often. In addition, working with such a small group of your peers for a whole year is something really special. I already feel close to all my classmates.",
    "This is an in-depth overview of the field of social enterprise as applied to international development. There are lots of case studies and real-life examples so it's very much grounded in actuality. I would definitely recommend this class as it prompts students to re-evaluate the typical public-private binary.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in how social enterprises maximize their double bottom line and navigate the social and economic tradeoffs. Case studies are fun to do!",
    "A great overview case study course on social enterprises",
    "Absolutely - this is an important field and especially for those who want to know about how business can change the developing world.",
    "YESSSSS! If you are accepted, this class is a unique opportunity at Yale and one I learned so much about the real world in- everything from poverty, business, and writing case studies. This subject area is cutting edge and there is so much room for it to grow in the future. I didn't know anything about social enterprise really at the beginning-or I thought I did but actually did not- and now I feel up to speed and actively engaged in the space as it continues to develop!",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. This class explores the idea of social enterprises: businesses that focus on helping the poor through market-based initiatives. Throughout the class, you will explore the entire spectrum of this space, from NGO programs turned private, to larger firms trying to expand down the pyramid. Things to keep in mind: it is a year long class, so you would be committing to a summer travel (of about 3 weeks) and another class in the fall, GLBL 306, where you will write your electronic case study.",
    "It was a really fun class - great group of people, such an amazing professor. My favorite class this semester by far. Bo is one of the funniest and most knowledgeable professors here, and really laid back. It's an awesome opportunity to learn about social enterprise and the guest speakers are all fantastic! And obviously the chance to go almost anywhere in the world to do a case study on a business is so sick. In terms of workload, we wrote a LOT of case study analysis papers...I think he might cut back for next year though because it was a lot to handle and got a little repetitive. Really helpful class discussions though - the time always went by really fast. Overall, would highly, highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes! Amazing class, you won\u2019t regret it. Bo is awesome. The chance to go to the developing world for 3-5 weeks and study a social enterprise is awesome. There is a lot of work, but I enjoyed doing it because the case study analyses are so applicable to real-world, current debates and problems, unlike many courses at Yale which can feel too theoretical.",
    "I would definitely recommend the class! The course provides a very practical and pragmatic approach to the concept of Social Enterprise and the unique opportunity to apply the learning in a real setting over the summer. Prof. Hopkins makes the classes fun and very engaging. He is also one of the few professors at Yale who actually care about improving the experience the students get at his class."
