   "comments": [
    "Covers a lot of material fast, but tests and homework avoid the most difficult stuff so it's not overwhelming. Goldberger is a good lecturer and posts his complete notes online, which is very helpful. Homework takes about 10 hours per week.",
    "A bit too many materials that unavoidably make it slightly discoherent. Also the material dictates that its more application focused then theory based, be it a good thing or a bad thing.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "One should take this course in order to understand the electromagnetic approach to optics. Also in this course, lots of the theoretical tools are developed to be used in further studies of QED and QCD",
    "Yes, it is a nice precursor course to some of the Quantum courses where you put hats on the equations learned in this course- so you have insights about the classical physics already for the concepts you might come across in the quantum version of electrodynamics.",
    "PHYS 502 was work (but also learning) intensive, and I highly recommend taking it with Professor Goldberger, who will make the time you put into the class entirely worth it. He also covers relativistic electrodynamics.",
    "The class is very hard, and the lecturer goes very quickly. Don't try to do all the problem sets on your own unless you've seen this material before."

   "comments": [
    "This course does exactly what it is supposed to - gives a nice familiarity with Maxwell's equations and their many uses. As far as a requirement, I'd say it's reasonable, as it builds a foundation and intuition for understanding a lot of different phenomena. I probably would not have taken it were it not a requirement, so perhaps it's good that it is. Making it challenging and rigorous (which it is appropriately) makes it more worth the time.",
    "Was nice that the course touched on more advanced topics without making them a huge part of the course. Not a grad student, so can't comment on dissertation part.",
    "Not fully related to my discipline. But it is possible that I would make use use of some theories\/ applications in the course.",
    "Derivation of Maxwell's equations from more basic principles Einstein introduced is a great experience",
    "It helped me develop problem solving ability, with respect to electromagnetic problems.",
    "Most certainly this class taught me a lot and helped me develop skills and intuition to solve other problems in the future. Since I'm a first year, I can't say if this will contribute to my dissertation or research.",
    "This class gave me a great introduction to Jackson, as well as to relativistic electrodynamics, which helped me learn four-vector notation that I'm sure will be useful in future coursework.",
    "I know a lot more about electricity and magnetism coming out of the course than I did going in. In particular, I have a much better qualitative understanding of the field, which is quite valuable since the calculations can all be done on a computer.",
    "It taught me how to solve Laplace's equation and boundary condition problems. I'm not sure if it contributed to my research."
