    "Michael brought a wealth of experience to the classroom. He was invested in our work, and in our revisions, and in our work with collaborators. He brought in guests and stood behind our hard work as he helped to critique it in useful, meaningful ways.",
    "Loved Michael Korie as a teacher. He was invested in us as students and consistently engaged us as playwrights.",
    "I loved this course. I thought Michael inspired a lot of play, professionalism, and reflection about the role of the writer\/lyricist in the field and in the world. I learned so much from the professionals he brought in, and from our collaboration with the composers. I really want to keep pursuing this craft! This was a wonderful introduction."

   "comments": [
    "It stretched my brain in new, painful, and mostly useful ways. We did a lot of great overview work on kinds of songs and how they fit into a musical. Would have also loved to deconstruct the wording of a few songs with Michael's guidance on a more micro level. In retrospect, I think just a little bit of that detail work would have upped my game tremendously.",
    "Very.",
    "Very helpful, especially with the plays I am currently writing. Many are filled with songs! I loved having a class that focused on technique. A good balance with workshop this semester."

   "comments": [
    "I received some of the kindest most invested feedback in this class and also witnessed some shaming in place of teaching...which I believe has no place in the classroom. I hope that in future classes Michael will continue with the tremendous part of this and find his way to avoiding the harmful part. It's very important to say that Michael was also my only professor to speak on student protests--which he did with heart and understanding."
