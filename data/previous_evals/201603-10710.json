    "I learned how to write a successful argumentative essay. I also wrote my first research paper in this class and learned how to take multiple sources and create an argument. Overall, this class helped me to organize my writing skills and to . Also, I learned a lot about how science is viewed in society and how it is necessary to question what is really true.",
    "I learned about the nuances of science and normalcy. The seminar built upon not only writing skills but argumentative and conversational skills.",
    "This class completely changed the way I view science and, as a STEM major, really let me examine the many facets of science through a philosophical lens.",
    "This course improved the quality of my writing. I learned how to write incorporating warrants, motives, and claims. I also learned how to read and analyze scientific texts.",
    "Taking this course allowed me to improve my writing tremendously as well as learn many new facts from my fellow peers. The debates and discussions that we had in class were extremely interesting and engaging. I gained knowledge in several different aspects of science, religion, and society.",
    "At first I had trouble working through the long and wordy readings, but a few classes later, I was able to read through and understand the readings fairly quickly. I started to enjoy the readings, and memorised important ideas to discuss in class. This class also helped me share and refine my own ideas, as well as debate those of others during discussion in class. Finally, the class helped me become a better writer. While working on four different essays, I worked on my writing style and structure, and learned how to use citation software in the process.",
    "I learned the importance of a claim when making an argument. In this course, learning the proper way to make a strong argument is necessary.",
    "I learned how to think critically in a clear and concise way and to question what is accepted and why we accept it. This course challenged me to think differently and to write in a clear and concise manner."

   "comments": [
    "This course is very engaging and the discussions are great as long as you do the reading. The topics discussed are very interesting and thought provoking. Sometimes I had trouble grasping the task when essays were assigned. However, it was a great learning experience and I definitely came out a better writer.",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics all round Weaknesses: while the topics were interesting, they diverged from what I had originally thought \"Republic of Science\" implied.",
    "The course does a great job to dissect one's understanding of science and its relationship to society through class discussions and engaging readings. Very good course overall.",
    "The strength of this course is in the class discussions. Students learn just as much from one another as from the professor. The weakness is in the first essay and first readings of the semester; the class begins as an uphill battle, especially when one finds themselves unprepared for the level of the text.",
    "The strength of this course is that it really enables one to become engaged with the material after a class discussion. The downside is that it is difficult to process some of the material given before the discussion."

    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It was very engaging and thought provoking. The discussions were really interesting and it's great to hear the different perspectives of all the students in the class. In addition, it really helped to improve my writing and gave me a better idea of how I should be writing. This specific English 114 course was really interesting, because it questioned how we see truth and how society sees science. We often accept science and truth to be what they are but this class taught us to think philosophically about them and to develop our own views. I would definitely recommend taking an English 114 course, and would suggest to take a Republic of Science.",
    "Yes, concrete writing class that helps you understand the seminar concept if your high school never had seminar classes.",
    "Of course I would recommend this course to other students, especially STEM majors who might not be taking as many humanities classes. The course completely revolutionizes the way you view science and will give you a valuable, priceless perspectives on the merits of science going forwards.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The readings will benefit students in future courses, as will the writing skills acquired. Additionally, the professor truly cares about his students and makes the course enjoyable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload is very manageable and the quality of discussion is wonderful. It was a very enjoyable course and I looked forward to attending class twice a week every week.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, and section: A Republic of Science. For me, even though the subject matter was esoteric, the professor made the course. Professor Templanza is a wonderful professor who values everyone's opinion. He worked through the readings with us, making sure we understood and appreciated the finer points. He kept discussions lighthearted and fun, even though we were discussing Heidegger, who is not. Writing the essays was difficult, but satisfying. I felt my writing improve with time, as well as my ability to make good arguments. I would also recommend going to the Writing Center to improve each essay.",
    "Absolutely. It is a fantastic course for those who wish to pursue a career in science. It makes one think about the different perspectives that exist on a variety of issues.",
    "If someone is interested in logic, philosophy and science I would recommend this course. It certainly helps with writing and critical thinking skills."
