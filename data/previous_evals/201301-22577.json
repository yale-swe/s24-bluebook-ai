   "comments": [
    "Yes. Very interesting lecture! Not too much work and a fun class with a great professor.",
    "A really awesome and crucial time period to know about. For myself (I'm Jewish), I had no idea about how Christianity was shaped and the differences between Protestantism and Catholicism; now I do. Prof Eire is such a boss, and so much fun, you should really attend all his lectures.",
    "Interesting class if you are into religion. It is a great period in history. The readings are definitely not all necessary to do and the midterm and final are SO manageable.",
    "yeah i would recommend it. the only thing is, it being a history course and a history course with a lot of material, you can very easily lose track of time and chronology of events. ask for notes from people who've taken this class before.",
    "Take it!",
    "I'd whole heartedly recommend this class to any history student looking to take a more intellectually focused history course on Europe.",
    "Yes, absolutely take it if you're at all interested in Catholicism, Protestantism, or really Early Modern Europe in general. Professor Eire is an amazingly engaging and witty lecturer, and the workload is pretty low. Would be a great fifth class or humanities credit.",
    "Great class with an amazing professor on the Reformation. Professor Eire has a gift at describing micro-events that fit into the larger picture of history, and his clever jokes are also a gem. The two tests require a lot of review but are only an hour long and a list of IDs and essay topics are giving in advance. The readings are mostly primary material by famous figures such as Luther, Calvin, etc. so they were pretty interesting to me as a RLST major, although perhaps newer for HIST majors. However, I felt like the sections could have been more engaging - instead of trying to cover the main points of each reading, having everyone talk about what they thought was interesting or had questions about, etc. But overall, great class - I would take another one with Professor Eire in a heartbeat.",
    "If you're looking for a fun, interesting lecture, take this. I knew little about Christianity going in and I learned so much. It really makes you appreciate how things are today. Not too much work, but you learn a lot. Eire is fantastic.",
    "reasonably good course on an exciting period in history. Professor Eire gives you lots of color but does less well in explaining why events happened the way they did. I have lots of good anecdotes from the course but not as many concrete things to say about the decisive timeline and events in the Reformation.",
    "I would certainly recommend the course as it is fantastic history, very informative, and low stress.",
    "I recommend this class. Professor Eire is an engaging and scholarly lecturer and he made the material come to life with great anecdotes and slides. I generally liked the material quite a lot and enjoyed seeing the connections between the Reformation and concurrent and later historical phenomena. Know that there is a very large amount of reading for this course, and not all of it is essential. Do not feel guilty for not completing all of it; in fact, some skimming and skipping is important for sharpening your ability to determine what is important and what less so. Section was fine, nothing too special. DSers, this course gives you knowledge about a part of history largely overlooked in the DS syllabus, and also connects rather well to many of the texts in H&P. Know that it will be a lot of reading and if you are taking it at the same time as DS, you have to be willing to skim\/skip some readings to stay sane.",
    "This class is great if you're interested in the theology behind the Protestant Reformation. Be expected to read a lot, a lot of texts. Eire's lectures are really interesting, and the graded work itself is manageable (midterm, paper, final).",
    "History 215 is a small workload for a lot, lot of material. If you are good at condensing facts and expressing ideas succinctly, you will do well on these tests. and the tests are fair too! The material is interesting and most of these subjects I will never forget.",
    "Yes, very straightforward class.",
    "Yes!",
    "Eire is the quintessential man of history. Take it to become enlightened (sapere aude!).",
    "This is a really good class, if the material interests you. Professor Eire is great.",
    "Really great class, lectures are fascinating and fun. Lots of theological reading which can be pretty dense at times.",
    "This is a fantastic course for both majors and non-majors alike. There is a lot of primary source reading, so be aware that you'll dedicate a substantial time to reading the material or trying to find summaries of it (they don't really exist). The lectures, though, are very interesting, and Prof. Eire is ridiculously helpful with the paper. It is the first Reformation course I have taken that hasn't been vehemently anti-Catholic.",
    "A great survey course of a really important period in history. Really interesting and fun.",
    "Super interesting and not much work. Take it!!",
    "Strongly recommend.",
    "It's basically an in depth history of the European Reformation. It's really a painless class, especially if you're very into the material. However, it's not the best history class Yale has to offer. If you're not looking for some kind of religious studies credit or a pre-industrial history credit, I'd look elsewhere for a mind-blowing class. This class is pretty average.",
    "RLST 283 is a course that covers the religious figures of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation. The course also covers important religious and political texts\/persons\/events of the period. The weight on exams is a bit steep (80%). Section and the course paper do little to help your grade. If you plan to master this course with your writing abilities or section contributions, look elsewhere. Good test-takers will be rewarded handsomely.",
    "Take this course absolutely. I promise, you will understand the world around you much better if you do.",
    "Professor Eire's love for his subject was contagious. Lectures were funny and engaging. Great European History\/Pre-Industrial credit.",
    "DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IF YOU ARE AT ALL INTERESTED IN THEOLOGY OR RELIGIOUS HISTORY",
    "OK class, you learn a lot about the Reformation and the enmity between Catholics and Protestants, if you're into it."
