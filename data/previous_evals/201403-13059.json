   "comments": [
    "Totally recommended, and not only for people considering going into finance. I found the course very entertaining, and Prof Geanakoplos way of analyzing topics in Economics is very insightful. My advice would be shop the course, if you like it then stay. The topics become more complex towards the end but the style of the class will remain the same. The PSets can be demanding, but not impossible (ten of them,) there are two midterms and a final. The exams are hard, and length so make sure you know that you can make the problems really fast.",
    "ECON 251 covers various aspects of financial theory. I would recommend the class to students who are truly interested in economics and have a relatively strong math background. It is also really helpful to have some experience in Excel. There are weekly problem sets, two midterm exams, and a final exam. The professor is really engaging and I greatly enjoyed the class!",
    "Yes!!! I'm not going into finance, but I decided it might be important to know basic finance concepts, and took this class (and Capital Markets). FT was definitely worth it, CM was not.",
    "Financial theory is an amazing course for anyone that is a quantitative thinker. Professor Geanakoplos comes from a mathematical background, so that is how he teaches his course. Don't let that discourage you or make you think that this course is all numbers, however. The numbers are a means to an end and really help you understand the theory. Take this course! The one drawback is the second midterm is basically the last day of class. This makes studying for the final easier, but it is still a burden to have a midterm so late.",
    "It's a great class, but it's hard. I felt like I learned a lot though which is nice. Take all guts and then this, you will learn and It is worth it. Hard final",
    "good",
    "Computationally-intensive, fast-paced introduction to financial equilibrium, asset pricing, hedging, and portfolio theory. Lots of resources (review sessions, online lecture notes) to help you learn, though this course will be easier if you have a good quantitative background. A must-take, since all of us will want to save or borrow money at some point.",
    "Absolutely! This class has the right amount of theory behind all the practical ways of getting to know the ins-n-out of how an arbitrage hedge fund makes money. The best ECON class I have taken so far! There will be some posts that tell you how hard this class is. Believe me, this class is what you make out of it. If you do all the practice tests beforehand, you are set. I am an ECON major but I wouldnt say I have the best QR abilities. There are math\/physics majors who take this class but if there is one class in which you can compete with them on the same ground then it is 251. Math is not hard at all, it's tricky. For most part of the class you will be using backward induction, solving Cobb Douglas to get to a GE or calculating forward rates and using basic discounting formulae.",
    "A challenging and disorganized course. It's really a shame because Geanakoplos is extremely intelligent, but simply doesn't lecture that well. Class is disorganized, from the fact that the course is disjointed thematically to the sheer difficulty of just reading his handwriting on the board. I found section to be much more useful than lecture in terms of figuring out what was going on as well as learning how to do the problem sets. I did, however, gain some knowledge of interest rates and other more broad understandings of how financial systems work. Honestly, you dont need that much math skill to do well in this course (mainly applied statistics) but its difficult because most of the time you simply dont know whats going on. Take it if you really want to, but its just a disappointment of a course; if you really want to go into finance youll probably pick up the knowledge anyway.",
    "I would definitely recommend Econ 251. It is a great base in financial theory. It is difficult but absolutely necessary for understanding the financial world.",
    "Insightful material, intellectually challenging, and incredibly useful to understanding the interaction between finance and economics. There should be more class time. Prof. G is at the top of his profession as a hedge fund manager and a teacher. He is an expert, passionate, and approachable professor. Every class was a great experience. This course is not difficult if you do the problem sets on your own and read the lecture notes carefully.",
    "Take if you want to understand the theory behind finance. Just take an SOM course if you want to know how to use finance and memorize equations.",
    "I'd definitely recommend this class to anyway who's remotely interested in working in finance or how the financial sector works. This class can get pretty challenging - especially the psets. But the exams are relatively straight forward once you've mastered how to do the psets.",
    "I like this class a lot and I would recommend it to anyone that likes math. If you don't like math then you're probably going to hate it. The math isn't hard it's just tedious algebra. John is entertaining and pretty good at explaining the material.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend.",
    "This class is really interesting, and Professor Geanakoplos makes it even better with his experience. Exams are long and challenging, but not impossible.",
    "Only take this class if you're genuinely interested in the theoretical side of finance. If you are, then it's great. But if you're expecting, investment banking 101 stay away. The problem sets and exams are challenging and only amenable if you are truly interested in learning the material and doing well. I'd cautiously recommend this course.",
    "A lot of work. Coming from a non-economics background, it was a learning curve for sure. Section is really helpful, and so are the notes posted online. Exams are fair and well-curved. Interesting if you're willing to put the work in. You start to get a better intuition about how assets are valued, etc, even if you don't gain practical skills.",
    "Yes, I would. It's been by far one of my favorite Econ credits so far. It is fun and interesting, and not nearly as hard as the reviews claimed it was- weekly problem sets that take on average about 4-5 hours, two midterms and a final which was pretty hard. It's not relevant to actual finance, but you get really good at certain types of problems like present value, and you are thinking about finance the whole time. Prof. Geanakoplos is pretty funny and very intelligent. The first week or two of the class (the parts about GE) are the worst part of the class, and it gets a lot better after that.",
    "Great class - particularly for those who would appreciate the mathematical logic in finance.",
    "Econ 251 is a survey in the basics of financial theory: financial equilibrium and uncertainty. You get exposure to a bunch of different financial instruments and how to price them theoretically. It's a great way to understand what's going on in the financial world. It's a great way to see economics applied to the world in such a practical way. I totally recommend this class. You should take it.",
    "Great class to learn the theory behind finance. Might not help you much in finance interviews but a great class to take if you're at all interested in going into finance. Long psets (and this is coming from a math major) but it's worth it."
