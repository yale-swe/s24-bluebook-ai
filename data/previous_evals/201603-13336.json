Fires are only going to increase in frequency and severity with climate change and this course is indispensable for knowing about fire ecology and fire management. This course needs to continue to be offered!!!",

    "The presentations in this course helped me grow as a presenter , at the same time, preparing for these presentations helps you to delve into a topic that you personally care about. Other presentations made by the classmates can teach you so much.",
    "Learning from each other",
    "Since the course material was fairly broad, the multiple presentations allowed for students to explore the particular topics that interested them the most. Also, I thought there was an appropriate number of guest speakers to cover a few different topics that needed specialized expertise without becoming a class that relied entirely on guest speakers thus becoming disjointed."
