   "comments": [
    "This class is very interesting and the grading is fair, but there are a lot of readings assigned. They take a lot of time and don't always get discussed in class.",
    "It is a lot of work but in the end it is worth it. You learn a lot about modern french culture and the challenges the country faces today. Your speaking skills sky rocket.",
    "Brilliant class. But make sure your spoken French is good and comfortable *before* you take this class as otherwise there's much that'll go over your head.",
    "FREN 160 is a great course for anyone looking to learn more about France and improve their writing and speaking! I took the course CREDIT\/D\/FAIL because I wanted to keep practicing my french. I wouldn't recommend doing so because you still have to do enough work that it makes sense to just take it for a grade! I chose Madame Bergougnou over Madame Pinzka because (our semester) the class size was smaller and I liked that Madame Bergougnou was from France. I preferred Madame Bergougnou - she was fantastic!",
    "This is a great comprehensive course that will greatly help you improve your french comprehension! The material and in-class assignments are very interesting. This class requires time. Reading assignments are long.",
    "I would recommend French 160 to any student hoping to improve his or her understanding of modern French culture, as well as writing and\/or spoken skills. The class is an overview of French politics, education, familial structure, geography, international trade, and many other relevant topics."
