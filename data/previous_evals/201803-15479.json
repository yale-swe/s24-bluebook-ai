   "comments": [
    "This was a very unique course, and the strength of the course was its instructor. I very much enjoyed attending seminar every week, and the content of the course was unbelievably fascinating, especially towards the end of the term. I think the main weakness of the course was that some graduate students made comments that did not help me learn anything, and may have been meant only for other graduate students. But this did not significantly detract from my experience in the class.",
    "It was good.",
    "Strengths: Professor Della Rocca dedicates a lot of office hour time to meeting us individually to discuss more specific questions and issues we have. Not a weakness but this course is more like a combination lecture and seminar as class discussion isnt a major part of it.",
    "I felt like parts of the beginning were pretty repetitive, whereas the end felt rushed. Honestly, I would have liked to spend more time on the \"Methodology\" part of the class, and a lot less time on the Paradoxes."

   "comments": [
    "If the course is offered again, I cannot recommend it more. MDR is a wonderful professor who cares deeply about students' engagement with course material. If for some reason you can take this course, be prepared to come in with a very open mind. This course dealt with the most fundamental issues of any philosophy course I have taken, and it requires that you put a lot of effort into understanding the arguments every week. The opportunity to take this course is not one to pass up.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who is both already deeply interested in philosophy but not too attached to their views of it.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes",
    "Yeah! MDR is a fantastic teacher. It's a big seminar, though, so be prepared to be talked at a lot of the time."
