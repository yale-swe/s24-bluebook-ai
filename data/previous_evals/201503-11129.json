    "This was a really useful course, especially if you're interested in 20th century poetry and poetics! Professor Hammer is a great teacher, the material was consistently interesting and well organized, and I think I'll be glad to be familiar with the theory moving forward.",
    "Highly recommended to anyone who's interested in lyric theory and its theoretical invention.",
    "This course is an introduction to \"Lyric Theory,\" with a particular focus on contemporary theories of the last twenty years. I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "Very strong course. A lot of necessary groundwork established in the early weeks, more creativity and flexibility in later ones. Amazing class visits from range of writers and poets that added new perspectives\/vocabulary to the course and also changed the format of class discussion in a productive way."

   "comments": [
    "Because Professor Hammer was so supportive of students' writing papers that were useful and interesting to them, I definitely feel like the work I did was valuable toward my future research.",
    "I'm especially in terms of the relationship between lyric and society, especially the inclusion of contemporary lyric poets such as Reddy, Rankine and Howe.",
    "The materials covered in this course will be a primary focus of my dissertation, thus this course was an invaluable contribution to my research. I am currently putting together reading lists for my orals and the knowledge I gained from Professor Hammer's course is crucial in helping me to craft my lists."
