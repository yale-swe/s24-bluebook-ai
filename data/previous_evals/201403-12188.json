    "ABSOLUTELY. THE HYPE IS REAL. THE HYPE IS REAL I TELL YOU. Josh is absolutely wonderful. He is intelligent in so many things and he makes you want to follow his example. This section made Directed Studies worth it for me. Discussions were fantastic. His method of alternating between \"passage days\" and \"question days\" was very effective, and he always led such focussed discussions. He can be intimidating at first, but if you approach him outside of class, you will find that he is very kindhearted. Go to his office hours and you'll be amazed at what you can learn. He is open to talk about anything you want, from the texts to suggestions for the class to random things in general. He is also a difficult grader, and he knows this. He probably prides himself on this. This is good. If you work hard, you will indeed surprise yourself at how much you have discovered about each text. His instructions for each paper are incredibly clear, organized, and helpful. His comments are just as clear, organized, and helpful. He makes sure to address your paper in a way that is not so much discouraging as it is revealing. At the end of class, you will have such a profound appreciation for the texts that you never thought you could have felt. After all, who ever thinks to themselves, \"Wow! I love Greek tragedies!\"? Well, Josh Billings does. And he will make you think this too. He is an expert in this stuff. He began the very first class by reciting the first lines of the Iliad in Greek. He will make you want to be able to do things like this yourself.",
    "A demanding but extremely rewarding class. Not worth doing if you're not going to do all, or basically all, of the readings, which are considerable but totally feasible if managed well. Really gets you thinking about questions about and beyond the texts; it was a fantastic course.",
    "These nights [of DS Literature] are endless, and a man can sleep through them, or he can enjoy l[reading] stories, and you have no need to go to bed before it is time. Too much sleep is only a bore.\" In other words, though Homer says it better: it's a lot of reading, but it's worth every hour.",
    "You'll read a lot of early Western literature (the Classics), including Homer, Virgil, and other great authors. Works will span several genres but will be mostly confined to epic poetry. In class you'll discuss these works with other classmates. Would recommend. The class is great, filled with awesome, interesting content and essays that really flesh out your understanding (and your interest).",
    "Definitely take this class. Professor Billings is very intense and passionate about (Greek) literature, which is ideal.",
    "While the quality of the class certainly depends on the section leader, DS Literature is a class where you'll learn as much as you want to.",
    "DS Lit is a great course if you're genuinely interested in literature, specifically the Western Canon. If you're not passionate about it, it will feel daunting and boring-- but if you are, it'll be an amazing experience. Billings is one of the best; his sections are engaging and enlightening. His class is tough, but rewarding.",
    "An in-depth look at major works from classical to Judeo-Christian authors.",
    "I would summarize this course as a collection of discussions, papers, and lectures on some really important early texts that are ripe with connections to each other. I would recommend the class to students who believe that there is a gap in their knowledge when it comes to pre-Reinassance culture and literature if they are willing to put in a substantial amount of work to get their papers to a level consistent with that which is expected. My work in this class was definitely rewarding as I look back, as I have filled in some of the gaps in my cultural literacy."
