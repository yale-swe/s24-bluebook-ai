   "comments": [
    "HP spring takes a more theoretical approach to political study. Key questions of modernity turn up--not in the land of Plato anymore. An interesting syllabus. Take it if you want direction in your political studies.",
    "This class is a sprinting survey of historical and political thought from Machiavelli through Marx, Nietzsche and Arendt. I would recommend this class only for those who are prepared to do a lot of reading for a limited amount of discussion. On the other hand, even if you don't think you would be interested in history and politics, this class could be for you (as it was for me) just the thing to get you interested!",
    "Yes! If you're at all interested in political theory, the progression really allows you to see how the great themes came to be within their historical context. You definitely won't get as much in depth understanding as you would take a specific time period course, but DS H\/P offers the big picture that allows you to explore various parts of it. The professors are all highly qualified and know their stuff, so section is always enjoyable and rewarding. If you're at all questioning whether to do second semester or not, take a look at the course reading list and see if you're interested in those works.",
    "Rewarding if you do the reading!",
    "It's a lot of work, but was actually my favorite section either semester of Directed Studies. If you're considering Political Science as a major, I feel like this is an invaluable class that you won't regret taking.",
    "This is a very demanding class due both to the amount of reading and to the dense content of the works. The texts might appear to be unappealing sometimes but they make a lot of sense when taken together, especially with the rest of the DS syllabus. In the framework of the program, this is a highly recommendable introductory course for anyone interested in modern political theory.",
    "History and Politics was the DS course I felt I learned the most from. Whether you're interested in the subject or not, it's hard not to find yourself applying what you learn in the classroom to global events and even interpersonal relationships that you encounter once you step outside. It's a truly interesting course that demands a lot but rewards a lot. I recommend that students continue to take DS HP in the spring."
