    "It's a tough class that is very demanding, but it is very rewarding when things start to click. There is a lot of homework everyday, which isn't ideal, but seems necessary to improve your skills.",
    "The course has a high volume of work but grading is generally very fair and I felt like I learned a lot of Japanese this semester.",
    "Great teaching continues from 110-120 though in a more laid-back atmosphere; the workload remains high for good reason, and if you're committed to the language, it'll be a good ride."
