   "comments": [
    "I would never EVER recommend this unless you have to for the CS major. Completely useful class, but you will never feel like a worse\/more useless person than after you take this.",
    "Great algorithms course. The material is a lot of fun and the problem sets are rewarding. Dan Spielman is an amazing professor. Expect engaging lectures, clear explanations, and personal attention if you need it. The reading is essentially optional, but you'll get more out of the course if you work through more examples\/applications. 223 and 323 are great, but this is probably the first truly \"computer-sciencey\" course you'll take at Yale. This course will change how you think.",
    "Algorithms was one of my favorite classes - really not that hard, but it can be fascinating at times. Don't worry about the prereqs - I didn't have anything of them. You don't need the prereqs, just make sure you know how to do proofs.",
    "Very fun, not too difficult, and very interesting problems. It's a little annoying we can't talk with each other about assignments, but the problems are very interesting to work on, so I would definitely take this course.",
    "Great class. Probably gain more fundamental knowledge than any of the other required CS classes. Great class to take regardless of whether or not you are majoring in CS. This should be taken concurrently with 223.",
    "This is definitely a class about algorithms.",
    "It is a good class, very thought-provoking and useful in problem solving. As the employment of computer's power in solving hard problems has become central to many fields, ranging from academic to finance and administration, the knowledge imparted in the class can prove very helpful particularly for those preparing to join industries where algorithm is used.",
    "Yes I definitely recommend CP365.I took it without any of the prereqs. If you are a math major or have taking lots of upper-level proof based math you should be fine (just have your cs friends teach you the basics).The material is extremely interesting and Spielman is an engaging lecturer.",
    "Great class. Problem sets were not too bad, but exams were pretty difficult.",
    "You'll learn a lot about algorithms: how to design them, how to analyze them, and how to prove your conclusions. The lectures are tough to stick with, but the book is good.",
    "Really interesting material, but the homework problems can be agony.",
    "Algorithms is a very good theoretical course that lays the foundation for many of the higher-level courses in the computer science major. Not too much work and the prereqs are pretty much optional if you have a math background.",
    "definitely recommend to anyone interested in studying different types of algorithms, figuring out fast algorithms to problems, and studying problems for which no efficient algorithms exist.",
    "A very good foundation in Algorithms--while the problem sets were always something of a source of dread for me, I learned a lot from them. Lots of work, but lots of payoff. Definitely worth taking even for non-CS majors if you're interested in algorithms.",
    "This is a quite difficult, proof-based algorithms course. If you don't have much experience with proofs, it will be a difficult class. Professor Spielman is great, though, and the class itself is interesting.",
    "I would recommend this class to anybody who has a serious interest in algorithms. It is a rigorous class though.",
    "The course started off perfectly - the psets and the material were challenging but doable and greatly enjoyable. The second half of the semester however quickly became the biggest nightmare. I quickly lost interest because the material just started becoming way too theoretical and complicated. Dan also started racing through stuff.I think he is aware of this problem however and will slow it down in the future. Besides that it was a good course",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is really interesting and the professor is great.",
    "Required course for CS. Pretty challenging. Lots of proofs.",
    "I know its a requirement for most people who take it, but I thought this class was great. Would definitely recommend for Applied Math students (it counts towards the major) and math majors as well. We covered a lot of cool material in lecture and the problem sets were well written and helpful in teaching the material. Professor Spielman is really smart and his style of explanation worked well for me. I especially liked the section on hardness\/NP and the last few lectures that focused on material currently at the edge of the field.",
    "It's a pretty hard class. But if you're taking it, chances are you're an applied math or CS major. So just get through it!",
    "Good overview of algorithms. Warning: psets are far more involved than they appear, and the no-collaboration policy and \"see the trick\"-style psets are both problematic. Allocate plenty of time, especially for office hours.",
    "This class is required for CS majors, but just because you're not one doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't take it. If you're into math and into computing, this can be a cool class that combines the two. The class is challenging\u0097a problem set every week with around four difficult problems on each one, and a strict no-collaboration policy that seems to be followed\u0097but a lot of it is really cool. You learn some crazy algorithms, and more importantly learn how they can be applied in unexpected situations to great effect. The only downside of the courseis that the second half of the semester tends to be kind of mathy\u0097a lot of the probability was particularly confusing (though I think it was a universal feeling amongst the students). But if you're into math then it should be fine. If not, think twice."
