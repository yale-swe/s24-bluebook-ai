   "comments": [
    "Use this course if you plan on working in a psychology\/neuroscience lab. You just have to present during a lab meeting and write a final paper (1o page though).",
    "If you are looking to get ahead for your senior requirement, the half credit as a sophomore is key. Also, it gives you some practical experience outside the classroom in research and statistics.",
    "During our lab meetings (which isn't the case for many labs) we presented on interesting topics from outside the lab, that a student was interested in. This is a Neurbio lab, and one student did psych-economics, and another presented on brain cancer.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Great class- informative and fun, plus you get to work with monkeys, which really is as amazing as it sounds.",
    "Definitely take!",
    "Absolutely, a great way to get research experience and have fun",
    "Directed research is great. It can be a lot of work at times but you get a lot of hands-on experience that you don't get in other classes.",
    "Lab work is a great way to get your foot in the door for senior thesis work and to get a taste of what grad school will be like. The paper you have to write at the end of the course is not daunting at all. Since you have to do 8 hours a week for a 1\/2 credit, just be sure to keep on top of them and work them into your schedule the way you would a normal class, otherwise you won't have enough time. Overall, a very rewarding program! Very glad it's available to psychology majors.For YPEP in particular, be sure to read carefully and understand completely the current projects in the lab so you can be sure it's something you are interested in and passionate about.",
    "I accidentally signed up for 495 rather than 493...it's so confusing that the full credit course is a lower number class than the half credit! I feel like a lot of people make this mistake.",
    "Awesome opportunity. Before you commit, I suggest asking if you can sit in on one of the lab meetings. Lab meetings run very differently in different labs, and one style might suit you more than another. Also, see if you can arrange a meeting with your professor (or, more likely, a grad student) every week.",
    "really enjoyed- lab members are enjoyable to be around. studies being run are very interesting.",
    "Yes, I recommend it"
