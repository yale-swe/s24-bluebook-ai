   "comments": [
    "I think this class should be a necessary prerequisite for theory of galaxy formation, but right now everything that was covered in this class was adequately covered in theory of galaxy formation as well. That left us less time in theory of galaxy formation to actually talk about galaxies. The boundary between the two classes should be better defined, and the department should ensure that they do not occur at the same time.",
    "This course is tough -- independent learning is not only advised, but required. At the end of it, it strikes me as being nonetheless rather too brief and cursory an introduction to cosmology. Prof. Natarajan focuses a lot on the phenomenological content, rather than on the analytical framework in which it is placed -- as someone who has taken mostly theoretical physics courses this difference in methodological approach was a little disorienting, and difficult to get accustomed to.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Priya's cosmology course to another student. The class was divided into three sections: geometry and the Friedmann equations, the thermal history of the universe, and structure formation in the early universe. Most of the material could be understood on a conceptual level with Ryden, but more advance books (I mostly used Peebles) helped fill in the gaps. Cosmology is different from any other astronomy courses I've taken - usually much more theoretical - but Priya's experience with observational cosmology (especially gravitational lensing) and her discussion of how to interpret temperature anisotropies in the CMB helped ground the course in observations. I hope to study cosmology further in grad school, and I think this course was a perfect gentle (but with a steep learning curve) introduction.",
    "Yes, this is definitely a manageable course (though the final exam is considerably long!). I think any student, undergraduate or graduate, can get quite a bit out of taking this, and needn't feel intimidated as long as they have the prerequisites.",
    "This course is appropriate for any physics or astronomy student interested in the fundamental aspects of cosmology. I would recommend this course to graduate students interested in pursuing research in galaxy formation\/evolution or cosmology.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes - understanding Cosmology is so important if you want to be in astrophysics.",
    "This class is great for anyone wishing to get a much more in-depth understanding of cosmology, but I would definitely make other students aware of the difficulties of going from general conceptual understanding to gaining a real facility with the higher-level material, especially the particle physics."

   "comments": [
    "This is pretty useful for my research. I'll probably be applying this knowledge for the rest of my career.",
    "Would have been helpful if this was offered before 610.",
    "I certainly got a better understanding of CMB, and scale factors, and density variations with scale factors, and different epochs. It should help as I look into higher and higer redshift data to provide very good background!",
    "I am glad to have a stronger understanding of this material, and I think it gave me insight into some of the big outstanding questions in astronomy (i.e, dark energy and dark matter), but I do not anticipate engaging too directly with this material in my own work."
