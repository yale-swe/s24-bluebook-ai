   "comments": [
    "I learned about rich history of Latin American urban centers.",
    "Engaging more deeply with texts, completing a longer writing project (around 20 pates), general presentation skills",
    "I learned to examine history and current events through the lens of urban space, a useful framework, and one I hadn't previously used.",
    "I learned how to be a critical reader and how to read historical texts in an effective and efficient manner. I gained confidence to speak up more and being more of a vocal presence. I wrote my first long research paper and gained invaluable experience before senior year when I'll need to write a thesis.",
    "I learned a great deal about Latin American nations that I had little prior understanding of. I also learned about nation-building projects from an urban studies perspective, which shed new light on my understanding of class relations in a Latin American context.",
    "This course gave me great insight on urban issues in Latin America. More than anything, I believe this course and the people in it helped foster new discussion habits. I have never been more confident speaking in class, and I think the respect shown to me by my classmates has taught me the ideal form of classroom discussion.",
    "I believe that I learned a lot with regard to the usage of urban space in this class that I had not previously examined in other classes. I also learned how Latin American elites throughout the former Iberian colonies managed to impose a particularly Western, elitist cultural vision upon urban life in the region."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The seminar format was great and led to rich discussion led by a great instructor.",
    "The readings were always really good and relevant, though at times longer than they might have needed to be. Content also had a lot of breadth so I got snapshots of various cities at different moments in time but also a sense of general urban movements\/topics in Latin America.",
    "Great for getting a glimpse into Latin American history (and present-day realities) by focusing on urban space -- who shapes it, why it's shaped as it is, and how it shapes the lives of people who inhabit it. The reading was sometimes a bit heavy and occasionally dry, but classroom discussion was interesting and I found our discussions relevant to not only 20th Century Latin America but the U.S. today. The final research paper is weighted quite heavily (too heavily, maybe -- perhaps this could be changed in future semesters). Beyond that, you have weekly readings, a presentation, a short paper, and presentation on your research paper. The course could have benefited from studying a greater variety of cities -- we focused primarily on cases from Brazil, Argentina, and Mexico. A good class -- worth shopping to get a sense of the syllabus and who you'll be in class with.",
    "This was essentially a perfect history seminar. I like alternative sources like movies, art, and architecture, so it would have been great to incorporate even more of those kinds of analyses into the syllabus. This said, if it ain't broke, don't fix itand this course was wonderful!",
    "Greatly insightful and productive class discussions. Great professor!",
    "Strengths: Super engaged and friendly seminar group where everyone was able to speak up and be heard without it feeling competitive. Discussions were very interesting and always centred on the readings. There was a good amount of reading each week without it feeling overwhelming and the texts were very interesting and manageable to engage with. Weaknesses: Would have liked to have watched more films and had more context\/background info at the beginning of the seminar before we launched into student presentations and discussion.",
    "There is little I would recommend changing. If anything, it would be nice to see more primary sources, although the secondary material was critical to my understanding of the courses' main themes.",
    "This course had wonderful readings that were interesting and of a manageable length. However, I feel it focuses to heavily on Brazil and favelas. In addition, i wished we focused more on race in discussions and readings.",
    "I would highly recommend requiring some form of graded reading comment before each class in order to hold students accountable for the readings. I often did not read as much as I should have before class--not because I did not want to do so, but simply because I had too much reading from other classes which required reading comments. If the seminar reduced its weekly readings but required reading comments before the start of class, I think that students like me would have been more likely to have come prepared (I was definitely not alone in this respect). Still, I thought that it was a great course!"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was a great course and enjoyable course!",
    "Absolutely! The readings are really great and the professor is so kind. Because the cities are often placed in the context of national movements, I also feel like I gained a lot of broadly applicable knowledge on the 20th century that will help in future classes.",
    "Really interesting readings, interesting ways of conceiving of Latin American cities, engaged classmates, and constructive paper assignments.",
    "\"Latin American Cities\" was a fabulous urban history classfor those interested in Latin America, urban studies, architecture, and labor relations. The research paper offered an exciting opportunity to pursue a field of interest, and discussions covered a multitude of topics. The workload was standard for a history seminar. Overall, the class was a pleasure and I hope it is offered againwith its top-notch instructor, Andra (a last-year PhD student), or with another faculty member.",
    "Yes, great way to learn about social, economic and political forces that have and continue to shape different countries in Latin America. Great professor!",
    "Absolutely! Andra is so enthusiastic about her class and the readings were all super interesting, not dull or boring at all, and there weren't so many that you felt completely overwhelmed, as can often happen in history seminars. Take this class if you have any interest in city planning, urban design and Latin America.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in urban studies or Latin American affairs. I greatly enjoyed the readings and learned a lot."
