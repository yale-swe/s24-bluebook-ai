    "OMG I loved this course so much as it was so different from all other Public Health courses. We had hands-on experience of doing actual bench work that corresponded to the lecture, which was so good and impressive.",
    "Really enjoyed the lecture material and especially the laboratory components. The assignments were somewhat confusing -- didn't really know when they were due or what to expect.",
    "Good material, although not always up-to-date Allows for hands-on experience with laboratory techniques; accessible for those that are non-savvy or uninitiated. More labs would enhance experience Decent course for outlining and emphasizing the importance of the biological components of disease and the research methods required to investigate the contribution of genetics\/epigenetics to health outcomes."
