   "comments": [
    "Yeah,teacher is spunky, most of the material on the tests are in the book as long as you read it",
    "It's okay, not too much work, but pretty boring.",
    "STAY AWAY.Take it ONLY IF U HAVE TODO NOT. I REPEAT. DO NOT. (DONT YOU EVER FRIGGIN DARE)taking it with lefranceshe's smart, but it's VERY HARD to communicate with her and her assignmentsare vague. Your only chance is ending up with a good TA.So with all due respect to lefrance, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is an interesting class that can really change the way you perceive things. It is interesting material that is really relevant to the way you think about and look at things. Its a great class, and the workload is easily manageable.",
    "I loved this course. It was exactly the field of psychology I was interested in, and I felt like I learned a lot more about people and the way they act. Professor LaFrance was engaging and funny, and her lectures were a good mix of powerpoints and video clips. There were also moments of audience participation, which I felt added. There wasn't too much outside of class work, so it was manageable. I would highly recommend it!",
    "PSYC150 is a very basic course in Social Psychology. It could be a good fifth class, but not too intellectually thrilling.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in why people act the way they do. It definitely gave me some insight on my own actions, and was so interesting! It's an easy class, and if you're a psych major you should definitely take it!",
    "Eh, it was fine. It probably would have been more interesting had I not taken it as a senior Psych major. If you're not one, you should go look at an evaluation that will actually pertain to you. Go on now, shoo.",
    "It's a pretty nice follow-up to intro to psychology. 2 papers (50%), 2 multiple choice tests (50%). Textbook reading for each class (similar to intro psyc). Tests weren't too hard. I was caught off guard a bit by the multiple choice, but once you understood how the concepts were going to be tested, you'd be fine. The papers are graded very fairly, just ask the instructor for grading rubrics which proved to be helpful.",
    "This class was basically a survey of social psychological experiments. Although much of the results are inconclusive and can only be chalked to causation, there are some awesome findings that are very interesting and that lead to an interesting class.",
    "I would recommend it. It's not terribly difficult, and it did not require much work overall besides studying for exams and writing the papers. But that's what you do for any class.",
    "The studies we went over in this class were very interesting, and the results did not always seem obvious. Although I had seen the movies we watched (about the Milgram experiments and A Class Divided) in other psych courses, it was a nice review. Take this course if you are interested in human behaviors, and why we all act like we do.",
    "Take it. It's easy. No reason to go to class though, since info comes directly from slides.",
    "Social psych is a great class for formally studying things you already have an intuitive knowledge about. I felt like everything we learned in class or read in the textbook was relevant to our everyday lives, which is a great feeling. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone. It makes you look more closely at society and understand interactions between people.",
    "Interesting material presented in a boring way. Not much overlap with Psyc 110. It was unclear what material was going to be covered in the tests (both multiple choice) which made it difficult and stressful to study for them. Overall not my favorite psyc course. There was one interesting concept once every 4 or so lectures.",
    "Take it if you're truly interested in social psychology!"
