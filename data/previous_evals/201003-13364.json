    "Stats is definitely not a difficult class IF you have taken AP Stats before. Even though JRS says at the beginning of class that this isn't a class for those who have done so, the majority of the students within the classroom have definitely come in prepared, and it hurts those who haven't on exams and problem sets and in general in the fast-paced nature of the course.",
    "This is an excellent class if you want an introduction to basic statistics and to understand some of the major statistical methods used in EEB (ANOVA, etc.).",
    "A good intro course for biostatistics. You learn a lot in a semester and it's immediately applicable to any research you're doing.",
    "JRDS is corny, but has to be to keep the class awake. His lectures can be all over the place, and the answer to everything is \"MiniTab.\" The second half is with GPW, who's very monotone and whose lectures are pretty disorganized. My friend fell asleep in every class. The problem sets are manageable, but the tests are kind of difficult because most of the homework is done by using computer software. You'll be a MiniTab and ANOVA expert at the end, but not sure of most of the theory behind your work. Make sure to take it with a friend so you can cross-check problem sets, or you won't do as well, trust me. Take it if you have to, because you have to, but don't just take it for the distribution credit. The Life Sciences section is pretty bad, but I didn't talk to anyone in another section that liked theirs better. Get ready to hear a lot of Austrian fairy tales you've never heard of before...Oh, and we figured out way to late that GPW really likes when you ask him questions, so don't be afraid to. Don't fall behind. Get ready to use Wikipedia a lot.",
    "I think Stats 101 was an okay class, however, one of the other sections would probably do a better job in helping students apply the concepts taught .",
    "It was great. Both Jonathan and Gunter Wagner were brilliant professors. Only problem I had with the course was all the minitab crap for the homeworks. They should not have been learning how to use minitab, but knowing when to use which tests, and how to analyze the results of them."
