   "comments": [
    "focused on speaking and writing in a more formal, fluent manner. my Chinese was really brought to the next level and I learned how to discuss important topics in today's world",
    "I got a really wonderful overview of many issues in contemporary China. I really loved this course because the material is always varied and really pracitcal.",
    "Formal Chinese in media",
    "I learned how to speak and write more professional Chinese, specifically in the context of Chinese media and societal issues.",
    "written and spoken Chinese and various topics in contemporary China like LGBTQ rights, women, art, wealth inequality and education",
    "I learned practical skills that I can see as being useful if\/when I visit China: I learned how to write and speak Chinese in a scholarly manner, to deliver a presentation effectively, to translate academic items like museum labels, to view contemporary media sources and read scholarly articles. The material we covered in class was also very relevant to current times and to the current state of China (we studied LGBTQ+ rights, feminism, the youth of China today...) and the media we studied was what actual Chinese people presumably consume.",
    "Better understanding of formal Chinese, particularly for writing and speaking, ability to read news articles and resources directed towards native speakers",
    "I learned how to write formal written Chinese in essays and how to articulate myself on more controversial and relevant topics in the world today.",
    "Reading articles in Chinese, discussion of topics in Chinese, formal writing, news style writing",
    "Zhou Laoshi's Chinese 166 helped me develop critical reading, formal writing, and presentational skills in professional Mandarin. We focused our efforts on elevating our Chinese for formal discourse. This class was particularly effective in teaching how to read professional journalism written in Mandarin, for example People's Daily or NYT Chinese. Chinese 166 also focused on improving our formal presentation skills with an emphasis on fluidity and fluency.",
    "Formal Chinese speaking, writing, and reading. You get to read real, genuine articles and reports and opinions on real modern issues. A great class!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Very well organized and expectations were clear. I wish we got more time to practice speaking but that was largely a factor of the class size",
    "I think sometimes the frequency of essays and oral presentations could sometimes be stressful to manage.",
    "Great course, well organized with a great evaluation structure. I wish there had been a bit more writing.",
    "very chill and understanding professor, oral presetations and essays designed to improve spoken and written Chinese, manageable workload and decent classmates",
    "The biggest strength of the course was how little it relied on those traditional forms of assessment that language teachers usually employ. I really appreciated Zhou Laoshi's attitude toward learning. When it came to homework assignments, we had to make Quizlets for the readings we did and regularly use them over the course of the term, conduct biweekly oral presentations, write short essays and participate in class discussionswhich I believe is a better way of ensuring we as students actually retained the material being taught. I liked that he had less emphasis on learning a ton of vocabulary and doing lots of tests. Work in this course always felt necessary and self-motivated. I don't think there are many weaknesses to this course. I know Zhou Laoshi constantly adapts the course and I think the course this semester worked very well.",
    "The structure encourages us to relate to the content and to formulate our real opinions in class. Perhaps a little more help for oral reports could be helpful.",
    "Strengths: Lots of reading and class time spent on discussion, really good use of broad range of media including watching news clips and films!",
    "Zhou Laoshi is exceedingly kind, warm, understanding, and accommodative. From the first day of class it becomes clear that he is truly passionate about teaching this course and Chinese as a foreign language. He is very organized, meaning deadlines are always clear and confusion about homework \/ presentations \/ etc. is never a concern. All his teaching materials are tried and true, having been refined after years of practice. That said, at times the material felt a bit out of touch or old as he is simply unable to wholly update the entirety of his curriculum every semester (this would require finding and annotating in detail nearly 100 new articles for each semester). At other times, classes could feel repetitive as we had the same approach to every non-presentation day: an oral quiz focused on discussion of the text, a study of vocabulary words and grammar structures, and a discussion about relevant topics."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! great way to continue language learning for advanced speakers in a manner that is relevant and not too stressful",
    "I would recommend this to any student who wants to continue to improve their Chinese and learn how to express their thoughts clearly on a variety of very relevant modern Chinese issues.",
    "Yes, if youre looking to keep up your Chinese while learning maybe 80 new vocabulary words, take this class. The prof is fantastic and chill.",
    "I would recommend! Zhou is a great and understanding teacher who really cares about his students' success in the classroom. The class is also well structured for learning and Zhou makes sure not to waste your time with learning things that are useless. You can take control of the vocabulary you learn and the skills you acquire from the class, which is awesome.",
    "absolutely, Zhou Laoshi is the best Chinese professor",
    "I would strongly recommend the course to any student. The course improves both your writing\/speaking ability and will give you important knowledge on how China as a country is today, through the lens of its media. The homework is very manageable and class was always interesting.",
    "This is a wonderful course. Professor Zhou is a fantastic instructor and discussion mediator and chooses very interesting and timely subjects for discussion. Workload isn't overwhelming -- a great way of keeping up your Chinese and improving your formal literacy and speaking\/writing abilities.",
    "I would recommend this course, as the workload is very manageable but students still get a lot out of taking the course. Learning is very efficient, especially when learning more formal ways to say common phrases.",
    "Yes, it is a very enjoyable and meaningful course because we discuss pertinent issues facing China.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student given he understands its purpose. This class is not meant to continue improving conversational Chinese skills, which means fluency and fluidity of dialogue can suffer after a full semester of prepared formal presentations and essays. That said, this course is necessary for students hoping to read Chinese sources in their original form.",
    "Absolutely! Zhou laoshi cares about letting every student be heard in seminar, and most of the classes are just group discussion!"
