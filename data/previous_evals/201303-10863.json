    "Italian 110 is crazy and fun and difficult and rewarding. I would absolutely recommend this course for anyone who is fascinated by the italian language and culture.",
    "This is is good course. You'll definitely learn a lot of Italian. You speak only Italian from the second day, which throws you right into it and helps with speaking and understanding Italian. Italian is a fun language and this is a fun course!",
    "I loved my Italian class! It's very fast-paced, but also completely worth it. I went from knowing almost no Italian to being able to carry on a conversation and understanding much of what I hear. I would highly recommend taking Italian! The only thing I would have liked more of is a little bit more cultural instruction.",
    "Yes it's a beautiful language and not an excessive amount of work."
