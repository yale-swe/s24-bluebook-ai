    "Socy 162 involves little (no) math, though it is a QR course. Most of the course is focused on sociological interpretation of data rather than characteristics of data itself. For a person interested in math-ier aspects of statistics, I recommend going through another department. For the sociologically minded who wish to learn basic statistical methods, this is a great course.",
    "A good and not-too-stressful QR that might be useful for anyone interested in social science research or just understanding basic statistical concepts. The weekly problem sets were fairly straightforward and the mid-term and final are take home (more learning, less stress). Professor Maralani explains things well in lecture and is quite friendly.",
    "A great course for if you want to understand how statistics and data connect to sociological research and understanding the patterns of people in society. There is a PSET each week and optional section, but it is not an overload as work as long as you attend section and start the PSET in time. The most complicated part of the class may be understanding the statistics program, STATA, that is used for the class. Nonetheless, Professor Maralani provides a lot of help in and out of class in terms of understanding the methods of interpreting and analyzing the data. If you are simply looking for a QR credit I would not suggest this class because it is better for people that hope to use data for research in the future. If you plan on using the knowledge from this course in the future, then definitely take it!",
    "Take this class -- You will learn a lot, and you will understand what is going on each time.",
    "SOCY 162 is a really good into stats class done in the context of sociology, led by an excellent professor. We learned how to use Stata and I feel like now I have the tools to do more advanced data analysis, which is really excellent, and got to work with Professor Maralani, who is awesome. Besides that, I don't feel like I learned much about sociology, and the class itself wasn't too exciting. We had maybe 25 kids in the class, and it was run as a lecture, so the class itself wasn't really engaging. The weekly homework was definitely manageable (although it does get harder as you go along), but I had the experience of feeling like I understood everything that was going on in class, and then not doing well on the homework and tests because we never did problems together in class and were never explained clearly and fully how to correctly and completely do the homework problems. So the material itself was pretty easy, but graded hardly, which ended up being really frustrating. Hopefully they will change this in future years, and I think the class might be run differently in the future. Either way, it's a solid alternative to normal stats, and Professor Maralani is great.",
    "Absolutely! I took Quantitative Sociology as a QR and I can't imagine a better way to fulfill that requirement. The material is really relevant and useful -- like, actually math that I can imagine using in real life -- and it's chill (only takehome exams and p-sets!) without being a gut. Professor Maralani is the greatest -- she's incredibly nice and she goes through the material carefully and clearly. The P-sets varied in difficulty and sometimes points were deducted for annoying little things, but overall, the workload is quite fair. As someone interested in education research, in particular, having the quantitative experience going forward will definitely be a huge asset. Also, just take it for Professor Maralani because she's awesome!",
    "Cool leminar teaching statistics. It was nice to be in a smaller class atmosphere, but this class does go quickly. Prof. Maralani is good at making sure everyone is onboard!",
    "Great course! It is very well organized and Prof. Maralani is amazing. She is concise while explaining enough so that stats doesn't seem like a chore. The weekly psets are relevant to the course material and can be completed by referring to the lectures notes. Definitely work with others to complete the PSET or at least compare answers. The PSETS are fairly straightforward if you paid attention during class but require a lot of writing and analysis, especially to interpret substantial results. You'll see what I mean. Overall, it is a reat course that teaches you the basics of statistics, how to use STATA, and how to apply them to sociological research. I'm a bio major who is also pre-med and I got a lot out of this course. Take it!",
    "If you can get in, you should take this class. Especially if you feel comfortable with math and with the idea of learning how to program.",
    "This is a statistics class, don't be fooled.",
    "It's a great class. I would recommend it; you learn useful information about statistics and its an enjoyable process. The workload is definitely manageable and the material is not nearly as dry as one might expect. The sociological approach enriches the material and makes it much more engaging."
