   "comments": [
    "If you are interested in learning french go for it, you'll learn all the nitty-gritty stuff. If you are just needing the credit, it'snot bad - you will be fine, if you pay any attention.",
    "French 121 is an excellent intermediary step between advanced language practice and being an absolute beginner. You will learn a lot about and gain an appreciation for the FrenchLanguage and culture. That being said, be warned that French in Action can often be boring and there are a lot of practice exercises assigned EVERY DAY.",
    "I would recommend French 121 for students wanting to strengthen their French grammer skills before moving onto higher course levels. The course is majorly grammer and vocab based with limited reading of French texts.",
    "Yes! DO this course if you did some basic French in high school but have not done so for a while; do it if you only know basic tenses or nothing at all. Do it if you're not confident of your speaking abilities.",
    "Definitely take it with P. Ngame!",
    "It reviews and covers almost all basic aspects of the French language and moves along quickly, giving you more confidence of the language, though you won't be fluent afterwards. Yes- if you want to reach higher levels of French, take this class (obviously you have to, but if you have the option to start at L3, I still recommend this level first - covers way more than high school).",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. You'll learn a large amount of French, fairly painlessly. And I would definitely try to get into Prof. Ngame's section. He's the perfect balance of nice and easy going along with extremely effective at teaching French.",
    "Challenging but useful course if you want to improve your french.",
    "A good review of French grammar with an introduction to the subjunctive. Plenty of opportunity to work on all four skills.",
    "It's what you'd expect out of an intro language. Bi-weekly tests, daily homework exercises. I personally love language courses (I took this for fun as a senior) because you get to know the other people in the class since you see them everyday and they're not very stressful because you build on your knowledge so you're never cramming anything. (the biggest test is the final and it's only 10% of your grade!)I've taken French and Spanish at Yale and French is definitely more work, in terms of quantity, not necessarily difficulty. Intro languages are pretty easy As, especially for 1.5 credits.Ngame is great! I would definitely recommend him as a teacher."
