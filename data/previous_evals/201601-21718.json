    "A fun class, not too much work, that will make you think differently and less logically than other classes with more argumentative subject matter. If you're curious about reading and writing poetry, worth investigating I have been reading more poetry since taking the class.",
    "Great class for learning how to write poetry, good vibe, very enjoyable",
    "As one of the few non-English majors in this class, I feel qualified to say that Professor Zarin's course is a wonderful introduction to writing poetry. As an Econ-ish major, I had never written poetry before this class. But poetry sounded like fun, and I wanted a fifth class, so hey, why not? Professor Zarin did a wonderful job of giving us a comfortable but challenging experiencewriting (good) poetry is actually hard! (Who wouldda thunk?) You write a poem a week, one short paper about a poem you like, and then revise five poems at the end of the term. That's it. Really. But don't think this class is a walk in the parkif you want your poems to be any good (and you're not that one person in the class who's so talented that you make everyone else hate themselves), you will have to put in serious time. But think of that time not as \"spent,\" but rather \"invested.\" Professor Zarin will help you be meticulous with your language, and you'll see improvements not only in your poetry, but in your prose as well. In short: fabulous!",
    "Great! Just write some poems, talk about poems, very straightforward",
    "As a law student, this course was an absolute delight. It has actually helped me be more effective in my own field of work, as far as writing and thinking about writing goes. I would encourage other students from various schools, or even undergraduates from different disciplines, to consider enrolling in this course. Professor Zarin makes poetry accessible, universal, and relevant. The course will expand your perspective in whatever field you work."
