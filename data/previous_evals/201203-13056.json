    "Great class. However, course name should be changed. Relatively little sculpture was done (or was required).",
    "Most of the projects dealt with making videos, which I did not expect. It turned out to be pretty fun however so I would recommend this class.",
    "I would say it is a space to explore all different kinds of medium that penetrate a space. Sculpture, performance, video, sound--everything becomes available for you to manipulate. Take it!",
    "This is an introductory course dealing with multimedia sculpture - mainly digitized work, so that means you'll be handling cameras, working with some video editing software, and making videos all by yourself."
