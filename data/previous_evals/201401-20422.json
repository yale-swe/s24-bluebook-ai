    "This class was okay. not as exciting as I thought it would be but it was a great intro to archaeology. the lab assignments were kind of random and felt a little like busiwork, but I appreciated the take-home nature of everything so that memorizing dates did not become the focus of the course. Professor Underhill's lectures are well presented",
    "Definite recommendation to anyone with an interest in the field of archaeology, regardless of your actual major. The more perspectives the better. Its a great into level course that focuses less on just the history of ancient civilizations, and more on how archaeology has studied these places. I definitely gave me a better understanding of what archaeological research requires. These techniques were explored in section.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. It's a much smaller lecture than I was expecting, which is nice in and of itself. And the format of the class is that it bounces from civilization to civilization while tying our studies of them together through their common characteristics or through different archaeological techniques. The workload was perfect and I felt very in command of the material by the time the take-home final came around.",
    "I took this as a requirement for the anthro major. It is a pretty painless class with a light workload and interesting material. I came to enjoy it much more than I thought I would. Prof. Underhill is really helpful for any questions concerning any of the assignments.",
    "You should go take it.",
    "It is a basic and principle course for students who would like to study archaeology in the future."
