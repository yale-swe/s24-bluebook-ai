   "comments": [
    "Gordon's expertise in organizing the class was exactly what any graduate school level course should be, thurough but open enough for students to bring new topics and interests to light. As an MFA Sculpture student in a Drama course I initially felt nervous that I wouldn't be able to keep up by just talking or doing critical readings of the text- but after only a few weeks it became quite clear that Gordon was there for us. Time and time again he was easy to communicate with and incredibly supportive. Outside of my studio class for my own major, this class was the most productive and engaging course I've taken while at Yale.",
    "Some of the readings certainly got a lot more attention than others. Of course, you can't do all of it, or even most of it, any kind of justice there's simply too much to read and much, much more to say about it all. I might have taken some of the longer readings Molloy, for example off the syllabus to allow room for other things. I'm not sure what we got from \"First Love.\" In my own humble opinion, \"The Expelled,\" \"The Calmative\" and \"The End\" are more interesting, and many of the same conclusions can be taken from, for example, \"The End,\" as can be taken from, say Molloy (the new style that came with the shift to writing in French, the ambulatory weirdo, and all the psychoanalytic stuff, if you're interested in that). Reading one of those short stories could have taken the place of Molloy. Of course, everyone should read the whole Trilogy, but in a drama class it's just not possible. There simply wasn't time to discuss them.",
    "Excellent overview of Beckett's work with an apt focus on why he choose to work in the theater in addition to fiction. There were times when I found the discussion a little unfocused, but perhaps that is natural and even productive, especially encountering such difficult subject matter. I think the syllabus could have included even more of the short plays and media plays. I very much enjoyed presenting in class, and found others presentations illuminating and stimulating at times. I was very glad there were students from across the University in the course!",
    "Greater access to readings would be helpful.",
    "The presentations were given few parameters and as a result most classes were dominated by them.",
    "This course was organized by a question that attempted to bridge the gap between Beckett's prose work and his works for the stage. This question generated a syllabus that allowed for the widest possible exploration of Beckett's work within the time-frame of the course. I have rarely come across a course that could move so fluently between the various modes and genres in which Beckett wrote, from his early prose works, through the trilogy of novels, from his earliest plays to his most sparse late works and late prose. The course also included references to other artists, specifically painters and sculptors that heavily influenced Beckett and culminated in a class on the influence of music, specifically Shubert, on Beckett. Such a wide scope is not easy to achieve and was organized beautifully through a manageable amount of reading, class presentations, guest lectures, and fruitful discussion. It was also invaluable sharing the class with students from the art school and french department, whose input widened the range of discussion typically found in the drama school. Gordon's facility with these other approaches to the work meant that the discussions were well guided and productive.",
    "I enjoyed the student presentation format of the course. However, I wish we would have received clearer guidelines for the presentations."

    "Discussion was generally very good, and always very free and enthusiastic. At times the conversation may have strayed a little further from where Gordon might have preferred it to go. Gordon was generally very good at reining it in, when necessary, though.",
    "Most classes were dominated by discussions stemming from presentations.",
    "It would have been better if students had had more opportunity to discuss the material.",
    "Please see previous comment.",
    "Gordon did a good job of letting students contribute to the discussion, and I cannot remember any serious lulls in our conversations.",

   "question_text": "How well did the assigned papers, reports or other projects reflect the aims of the course?",
   "comments": [
    "The assigned paper was generously open for us to make our own connections- it allowed for us to facilitate conversation and research something that we felt we could really flesh out. This was not only helpful for me as an artist interested in theatre, but it was helpful on an academic level where it gave me the ability to explore writings critically and who they may inform my own artistic practice.",
    "I'll only say that some of the class presentations were more informative than others. There maybe should have been a clearer limit set on the amount of time any one person could take up.",
    "As mentioned above, the in-class presentation was very helpful, and I found the final paper to a fit (and formidable) challenge. It gave me a way to apply many of the themes in course (Beckett's musical sense, his increasingly specific and sparse dramaturgy, etc.) to a select number of works.",
    "They were a great help.",
    "Gordon allows for a wide range of approaches and styles of writing when approaching the final paper of the course. Having just completed my comprehensive exams on Beckett I did not want to write another academic-style paper. Gordon allowed me to write a paper in the style of a note from a dramaturg to a director on the adaptation of the late prose works. This type of paper, i felt, was helpful as a professional exercise.",
    "Clearer guidelines for the presentations and prompts for the papers would have enhanced the course, I think. Gordon allowed us to write on a wide range of topics, which was liberating. I think khe could have tightened some of the topics, however, as some of them were very general.",
    "All classes should have final papers and presentations. Having the chance to express ourselves verbally is CRITICAL."

   "comments": [
    "Although, see above, question 1 re: Molloy.",
    "I actually would have welcomed more reading towards the end of the course, but overall the amount of reading, given its depth and complexity, was appropriate.",
    "Hit or miss.",
    "Occasionally, we would not have enough time to discuss all the assigned readings.",
    "It was frequently the case that texts were assigned which did not get discussed during the week they were assigned--while other texts would be discussed instead. This may have been okay for those who already knew the entire Beckett oeuvre, but for those who didn't, it presented some big challenges. Since a lot of reading was assigned, and it took quite a lot of time to read it, it would have been nice if it had been addressed.",
    "Beckett's works range from 30 seconds to 300 pages. Gordon was careful to make sure that there was always sufficient material to discuss without overwhelming the class. This meant that the entire class had generally read the material well and were able to discuss it in depth. Gordon also played to the strengths of the class member's individual knowledge of Beckett by asking each person to present on a topic that they had encountered before. This raised the standard of discussion considerably.",
    "Many times during the semester, texts that were read for a particular meeting were not discussed in sufficient depth (or at all) during that meeting. Gordon has a very relaxed style as an instructor, which makes for a very comfortable classroom setting. However, I sometimes felt the conversation had strayed very far from the assigned reading. Often times, people would speak at length about reading that was not required for the course, which put many students at a disadvantage, and also made difficult a discussion of the assigned readingI think more focused discussions would have been richer.",
    "Beckett was a pithy writer, for which all students should be thankful."

    "I believe it would be possible and totally legal to upload some of the videos of Beckett's work, especially his directorial work, to V2. That might have really added something to the discussions of the later work.",
    "Helped a lot in visualizing Beckett's worlds.",
    "The course was supplemented by a number of videos, reviews, and audio recordings which are essential to understanding the difference between Beckett on the page and Beckett on the stage.

    "I came into the class with knowledge of Samuel Beckett and his writings- However, my own knowledge and exploration paled in comparison to what was able to be explored during the course of the semester. Gordon gave us the authority to find what it was that we were all interested in within the writings of Beckett and explore these topics openly through presentations and class discussions. Allowing enough space to cite observations and openly agree or disagree with one another during class.",
