    "Enjoyable films, discussions, and readings, along with three very doable and open-ended papers.",
    "Film Comedy is a great class, the three 7-page papers are not too bad, and coming to class every week is fun. Expect to do one short informal presentation, three papers, and watch amazing films.",
    "I would recommend this course. The courseload is very light and a significant amount of class time is spent watching the films (which also means no additional screenings). The assignments are three short papers, which is very doable, and the film selection is excellent.",
    "Excellent class with an excellent instructor. You watch great movies and the work load is totally manageable.",
    "Yes. Don't take intro if you're just interested in taking a random film class. This is a great one.",
    "Great class to take regardless of your major. Take it if you want to learn anything about comedy, laughter, or art in general",
    "This class should absolutely be taken by anyone even remotely interested. Roemer is brilliant, the films are (for the most part) rather funny, and you will learn more about yourself and what makes you laugh than you'd expect."
