    "Time is always a limiting factor, but if there was any way to provide more space for discussing the reading assigned it might help contextualize them further. The time off in October was very helpful for working on proposals.",
    "This course was incredibly helpful for pushing me to get my research ideas off the ground and turn them into a reality. The discussions ranged from highly philosophical to very practical.",
    "With regards to Question 1, I found the textbook readings at the beginning of the class to be especially valuable for establishing a foundation on which to base my research strategy. Having never conducted research before, it was helpful to learn about the general approaches and philosophy behind performing research. With regards to Question 2, I found that the progressive assignments of annotated bibliography to outline to full proposal were effective for promoting a productive and well organized research strategy."

    "The instructor's passion for the subject, he clearly cares a lot about his students becoming good scientists.",
    "Instructor enthusiasm and knowledge of material",
    "I really appreciated the motivation this course gave me to build a research idea, and create a first draft of a proposal. I also gained a lot of knowledge about the research world, and the best ways to navigate a career in science.",
    "To do a real research proposal",
    "The course actually got the ball rolling on my project where I might have delayed to work on it the first semester because of other classes.",
    "The course really taught someone the in's and out's of developing and then writing a research proposal, especially for someone who has never written one before. The annotated bibliography was helpful in figuring out what the student wanted to research.",
    "I really appreciated the philosophy of science aspect of this course, as I had never learned much about it previously. I also thought the ethics aspect was very useful. It is great to start out with a formal class in which so many aspects of being a scientist are discussed--by someone with in depth experience. I appreciate that Os talks about so many subjects like publishing, the scientific process, authorship, literature review, etc, without the expectation that we already know something about each subject. So much of what is covered in this class is basic enough that anyone who has been in science for even a couple of years forgets how mysterious it all seems to a novice. Os does a wonderful job of guiding us through the first few steps of becoming a scientist.",
    "I thought the structure of the class and the assignments were key aspects of the class that allowed my research to progress at a productive rate. I also found Os's teaching to be one of the best aspects of the course. He presented all sides of a topic in a clear and concise manner that was accessible even for students who had not previously performed research.",
    "Forcing us to begin the process of proposal design and submission.",
    "The course is structured to help students develop their research proposals which was quite handy for beginners like me.The feedback on the draft from the proposal by the instructor was quite useful in developing good proposals.",
    "I would never have started my thesis project this early and smoothly if I had not been challenged to write a research proposal and give a presentation."

   "comments": [
    "More discussion of the readings. Also, it might be helpful to have a lecture on making the most of conferences and professional networking in academe.",
    "This may be true for most students, but I felt like I struggled a lot with the initial development of a research idea. It might have been helpful to have more in class discussions with other students about our ideas and interests beyond the presentations and the reviews at the end of the semester.",
    "I missed to have science theory background: some poper, some latour.",
    "it would be nice if Os could bring in more examples than just ecology",
    "I think it would have been helpful for everyone to have a 15 minute or so meeting with the instructor at the beginning of the semester to narrow down the research topic a bit more. For those who came in not knowing exactly what they wanted to study - but had a general idea - this could have been extremely useful.",
    "In my opinion there are no glaring aspects of the course that need improvement.",

    "I think it was a very critical course to understand what a research project entails.",
    "This course helped me develop the research proposal which will be the basis of my next three semesters at F&ES.",
    "While my adviser would have expected me to complete a project proposal by January anyway, having a course in which I was presented with a series of mini-deadlines towards the goal of completing the proposal was extremely useful. Furthermore, as I suggested above, it is great to have had a succinct outline of what it means to be a scientist--I feel much better prepared to move forward towards my master's degree.",
    "This course was a requirement for me as an MESc. candidate. Furthermore, it was a very important course for me to take since I had not previously conducted research (or developed a research proposal) and therefore, was essential for setting a foundation for this type of work.",
    "Articulating ones thoughts or ideas require good writing.More ideas that can attract funding require much work and effort and so this class provided a lab to help in writing out the research thoughts and ideas in a way that people (not only from my discipline) can understand and relate to the concept. It helped in refining my objectives of the research and its envisioned impacts.",
    "This class is very helpful in preparing us with what to expect for the MESc program and beyond when doing research. It forced us to think hard and develop a meaningful and feasible research project in the first semester."

    "The final assignment of serving on the grant review panel of other student's proposals was the closest thing to group work in the class. I found this exercise to be extremely valuable as it put into perspective what my colleagues look for when evaluating research proposals. It also allowed me to see how reviewers read and evaluate proposals that may not align with their particular expertise.",

    "It is a good course for those who have research interest.It is best to have an idea in mind on what wants to do,makes it much easier.",
    "1. Start each assignment early, don't wait until the last week. 2. Put more efforts in October when classes do not meet. The second assignment is not really in \"billeted form\" - flesh out ideas in detail."
