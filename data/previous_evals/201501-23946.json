   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this course. You will learn so much, and feel enlightened after every class.",
    "This course isn't for everyone. For a residential college seminar, it was a lot of work. Weekly two page responses plus a fifteen page final paper made for about forty pages of writing in this class, and the reading was substantial. We also hardly talked about the Book of Job at all. We read it for the first week, spent some time in the first few classes reading and discussing the early parts of the book, and then pretty much left it behind for good. We rarely even referred to it in class discussion; we talked about the Holocaust a lot more than we talked about the Book of Job. And to be clear, I didn't mind that so much. I found Rabbi Ponet to have a lot of interesting thoughts on a wide range of subjects, and didn't really mind listening to his insight on whatever subject he wanted to talk about. If you're open to that, you'll probably enjoy this class. But if you're someone who can tolerate only focused discussions on exactly the topic that the syllabus says it will be on, this class is probably not for you.",
    "Fantastic class, likely one of the best and most thought-provoking I've taken here at Yale. Rabbi Ponet is wonderful and makes himself incredibly available to students.",
    "Essentially, this course is a semester long master's tea led by a Rabbi. Take it for an interesting college seminar that is emotionally challenging.",
    "I hope this course is taught again because it provides an opportunity to discuss important topics.",
    "A select close reading of early books from the Hebrew bible, followed by various explorations of life, death, suffering, good, and evil. Classic thinkers like William James and Abraham Lincoln to more modern authors like jack miles and Paul Kahn. Also includes important post-holocaust thinkers like Arendt, amery, Levi, Wiesel, and Wiesenthal.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this seminar to another student. I feel like the question: \"why do bad things happen to good people?\" is a question that all of us grapple with. The material in this class is incredibly thought-provoking. The small size of the seminar (15) really allows for dynamic discussion and debate. I would recommend this class to any student, regardless of their major.",
    "Although this course was primarily a far-ranging examination of evil's definition, origins, and manifestations through a look at the Book of Job, the Holocaust, apartheid, and various other contemporary evils, it was also a broader look at ethics and featured Rabbi Ponet's extraordinarily insightful and poetic reflections on life, love, beauty, comfort, reconciliation, and forgiveness, among other themes. It was truly among the most outstanding courses I've ever had the pleasure of taking, and I wholeheartedly recommend taking it. You will unquestionably be glad that you did.",
    "Amazing course! Obviously it will be different every year, but if you have the opportunity to take one of these seminars (especially if Rabbi Ponet is teaching it), definitely do it.",
    "This was as life-changing as a Yale class can get. The experience was stirring--spiritually, intellectually, and emotionally. I grew so much from this class- the works by Levinas, Arendt, and Buber have pushed me philosophically, and Ponet was always plugged in, always engaged, challenging me on my philosophical assumptions. Just take it. It's so much more than a class at Yale. I will always remember this experience , and I'm so grateful for having been a part of it."
