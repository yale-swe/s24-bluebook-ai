   "comments": [
    "If you havn't taken multivariable calculus before, this class is challenging and rewarding. The main objection I've heard about this class is from people that have taken multivariable before that say it covers material that they have had before, but this is really their fault.",
    "Hard class. I thought I was good at math before this - math was my thing - and I'm not saying that this class dramatically changed that view, but view of my own math skills was constantly going up and down. The weekly problem sets can be tedious sometimes, but if they are spread out throughout the week, they ought not to take too long. However, the effort I put into the 12 problem sets, I felt, should be representative of more than 10% of my grade. Be aware of the grading scheme, and also know that there is very little, if any curving, in this class.",
    "Take it if you want to see how much you actually like math, or if you need it to take other courses (obviously). I learned a lot about my math skills since this course required me to teach myself mostly.",
    "Math 120 is a fairly standard introductory course into multivariable calculus. It does a good job of covering a breadth of material that is requisite for its subject, and the relatively small size of Math 120 sections made asking questions in class easier. With Professor Kushnir, you'll find the class taught similarly to most high school math courses - lots of notes and practice examples to be copied from the board. With this in mind, it's a fairly manageable course. Keep in mind that the curve can be fairly brutal, as test averages are fairly high.Certainly do not hesitate to ask Professor Kushnir questions if you do not understand the material. He does an excellent job of answering one-on-one, and an adequate job with explanations in class.",
    "Its easy if you read the book and learn it yourself. But be prepared for difficult hw problems. I would recommend it to a math savvy person.",
    "If you are able to teach yourself math with relative ease, take the class. Otherwise, avoid it. The only reason the class went well for me is that I have a lot of practice teaching myself math. The problem is that the subject matter is very, very interesting, and the teaching and class format doesn't do it justice.",
    "I came to \"appreciate\" math a lot more through 120."
