   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to another student if they wanted to focus on these elements or questions of Anthropology in regards to Africa. As it focuses upon Africa, I found it particularly useful from that standpoint but remain unsure for those who do not wish to focus exclusively on African topics. In this regard, it may be useful for those who specialize in other regions to compare their area of expertise to the experience of Africa.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students but only ones that I know would be able to deal with the workload and ideas. It is definitely more anthropological than political and perhaps this would frustrate some students who thought it would be the other way around.",
    "\"African Politics and Anthropology\" is a seminar-style course that introduces a student to a diverse range of topics related to politics that will shift the way you conventionally think about corruption, failure, corruption, space, and power. I would definitely recommend fellow students take courses with Professor Lombard! Africanists especially will be thrilled to have her as part of the Council on African Studies.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. The readings were interesting, the workload was manageable and the instructor was great."

   "comments": [
    "This course directly bears upon my dissertation research because my dissertation, while interdisciplinary, requires a solid understanding of the available Anthropological literature and studies to date. This is particularly true regarding various interpretations and understanding of the state, its functions, role, and utility. Therefore, this course has been very useful in my research.",
    "The course has completely reframed my thinking and I believe that it will contribute greatly to my future research.",
    "As there is only one other professor in my department that does anything African Studies related, it was incredibly helpful to have Professor Lombard offer this course and be open to my ideas as they relate back to my broader dissertation research. I definitely was pushed to think hard about an interdisciplinary nexus that isn't often explored, and feel lucky that this course was able to help develop ideas on a lot of different lines."
