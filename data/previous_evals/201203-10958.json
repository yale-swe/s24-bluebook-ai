    "Interesting subject matter, especially if you are focused on China, but no need to do the reading or even show up to class for that matter.In sum, only take the course if your field of study is China (or you find it incredibly fascinating).",
    "I would summarize IR574 as a thorough overview of China's post-Mao economic growth, and the social, economic, and political steps it needs to take now in order to continue healthy growth into the future. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in China. It's an extremely wellstructured overview of the contemporary economics of China.",
    "It predicts the development of Chinese economy and Chinese society. I would recommend it to any students who envision themselves working in China or doing business with China because this course tries hard to predict where China will end up with a plethora of evidence and data.",
    "Yes I would recommend it to another student. It gives an overview of the economic challenges and opportunities for China in the next decade or so.",
    "Interested in China, and\/or interested in Economics? You have to take this course, period."

    "I plan to work in China in the future, and so this course helped me understand what kind of society China will become.",
