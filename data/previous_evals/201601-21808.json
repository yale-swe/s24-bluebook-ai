   "comments": [
    "This course is wonderful for an introduction to the basics of how renewable energy practices, heat engines, and basic energy market analysis occurs. The course divides between conceptual and quantitative analysis of these energy systems and pathways which helps the student become knowledgeable in all aspects of renewable energy. Highly recommended for those interested in energy and agriculture.",
    "Take it but be wary, you can get screwed on the exams if you don't learn the random minute details from the slides that they can sometimes ask for.",
    "Lectures are dry and arguably not worth going to, psets only took like 2 hours per week. You learn a lot about renewable energy technologies but the two weeks on heat engines are very boring, and the grading on the midterm and final was confusing at best.",
    "Incredibly boring. This was my first STEM class at Yale where at any given moment 25% of the class was paying attention. Most of the class would only show up to turn in PSETs because the lectures were so painfully boring (I was one of few that actually went). When a student finally perked up and decides to ask something, I found that both professors responded condescendingly, generally deterring people from actually asking questions\/engaging. Very unimpressed. Learned some important stuff about Renewable Energy for sure, but I feel like we spent more time learning trivia than science. On the bright side, PSETs take often less than an hour if you're a STEM major\/have experience with basic physics. Take it if you want nothing more than a gut for your major, but don't have high expectations in terms of quality.",
    "Its a pretty interesting course! Take it if you can. The p-sets are a bit challenging, but doable.",
    "A good survey of renewable energy. Weekly psets are mostly quantitative and not too difficult. Tests can be tricky, but manageable.",
    "This class will be relatively easy if you're comfortable with high school math and physics. The exams are both qualitative and quantitative so make sure to study both sample problems and slide content. The class serves as a relatively relaxed introduction to energy in general and renewable energy specifically.",
    "Good introduction to renewable energies, but focused mainly in the geological part of it. I wouldn't recommend it for mechanical engineering majors, for example.",
    "This course was a great overview of the field of renewable energy. It got into the details of various technologies an their applications. Coming from a science background, some lectures were a bit dull as they reviewed basic physics concepts. But on the whole this was a fun lecture!",
    "A great class. When reading reviews I was worried that my minimal background in physics and thermodynamics was going to make this class difficult, but with a little bit of work, all of the concepts made sense. This class complements G&G 274 nicely but is a little more technical. It gives you a great lens to view the energy problems of the world through and addresses economic, geographic, and political obstacles renewable energy faces. The professors are both very good. Take this class if you have just a bit of interest in energy. Also the field trips are pretty cool, so go on those if you get a chance.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking for a good basic introduction to the physics of different renewable energy technologies as well as some good big-picture perspective on the energy crisis and the different economic and geopolitical factors at play. The workload was extremely manageable and the weekly problem sets were not very time-consuming. Exams were also very reasonable as well."
