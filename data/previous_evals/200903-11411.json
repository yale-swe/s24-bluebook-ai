    "Yes, I would recommend Astronomy 120 for another student. The material is very interesting, especially if you aren't a science or math major, and you're always learning something new. The math required for the course is substanial, though. This is not an easy course, but it is an entertaining, enriching course which is what I think it should be.",
    "A really engaging, non-trivial science cred for non-science majors. Kenney's a great lecturer, but be prepared to do a good deal of math for the weekly problem sets (which has the upside of granting a QR cred, as well). Sections are optional, but you're going to want to go as they're free points towards your grade if you do. Tests are medium difficulty.",
    "Not a bad way to get a QR if you suck at math. lots of small assignments that add up to making up a decent part of your grade which is nice.",
    "I would say that the class is not hard, but it is not a breeze. You still have to do the work, because the midterms and the HW Problem sets do matter. Professor Kenney is funny in lecture, although there are times where I wanted to fall asleep. Overall, the class wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst possible science class I could've taken. The work wasn't difficult, just tedious.",
    "I would, but ONLY if they genuinely like astronomy. Believe me, otherwise you might not enjoy this class.",
    "This was an interesting class, and if you need a Sc credit, then it's a great way to get it. It's not particularly difficult, a couple of weekly lectures and a pset, and you'll learn a decent amount about astronomy. So why not, just go for it.",
    "only take for distribution requirement",
    "Yes, if you are at all interested in astronomy",
    "ASTR 120 is an introductory course to astronomy, galaxies and the universe in particular. I would recommend ASTR 120 to anyone, but especially someone who is not particularly good at math and needs to fulfill the QR requirement. There are a lot of assignments including weekly problem sets that get easier to do as the course goes on, online reading quizzes before each class that get you to do the reading and contribute to your grade, an observation session that is fun and interesting, optional weekly section that contributes to a better grade, and a mid-term and a final.",
    "A good QR requirement course for non-science majors. It's relatively interesting, and because of his quirks, Professor Jeff Kenney can be quite entertaining at times (he basically summarizes the readings, but he does a pretty good job of that). Problem sets are annoying, but these ones are relatively easy if you tackle them in groups. The math is not at all difficult, and the concepts are usually pretty interesting.",
    "Recommend for all non-science majors trying to get rid of one of their QR requirements.",
    "Definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in astronomy! Professor Kenney is hilarious and makes it interesting.",
    "Not as much of a gut as people say. There's a fair bit of work to stay on top of if you want to do well in it. The midterm was surprisingly really hard, but I don't know how the final will be.",
    "I really recommend it. It isn't a gut, but its manageable for students (like me) who aren't strong in science and math. As long as you are curious about the subject material and put in the time, you will enjoy it immensely!",
    "NOT A GUT. The material is very interesting, but it's a lot of work. Class attendance is mandatory, and I couldn't do the problem sets without attending QR sections. Lots of material. I repeat DO NOT TAKE AS A SCIENCE OR QR GUT.",
    "I would only recommend this class if you need a science or a QR.",
    "I think it wasn't necessarily an easy course, but it was very engaging and helpful and a good and interesting science course to take.",
    "DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It was not a GUT, as some people suggest. It was interesting and challenging, but not un manageable.",
    "Most people would consider this class a gut. That's not far from the truth. The material is not very difficult, and the problem sets only take about an hour (two max) a week. However, you do have to go to class (he takes attendance with the clickers), and you have to do reading quizzes before each class, which is kind of annoying. That being said, the material is interesting and the professor's lectures are engaging. I would recommend this class.",
    "Very mixed feelings about this class. There were a lot of good things. I'm not a science or qr person, and it was a great way to get my qr credit. The math is not too terrible -- the problem sets do get a little tedious and long, but it's doable. But do NOT think the class is easy or that it doesn't take a lot of time. There are bi-weekly reading quizzes, the problem sets *can* be long and tricky, and not all of the concepts are easy. They are learnable, but very complex, so this class should not be viewed as a gut (though you should still take it). Learning about the universe was incredible. I feel so small, and I'm so appreciative of everything I learned in this class. The TAs were all fantastic. Professor Kenney was a hilarious lecturer and always entertaining when in the spotlight, but not very approachable outside of class. The biggest drawback was the debacle with observing sessions -- if you take the class, make sure you go to the first one, otherwise you'll spend two months keeping every night open incase the clouds clear up for observing. Definitely lots of busy work, but you learn a lot of really cool things -- so my overall recommendation would be to take it.",
    "I would recommend it because it is a QR credit that is not too difficult for someone who does not excel in the science. I summarize it as very basic cosmology.",
    "A not too difficult class about the basics of what we know about the universe. Not difficult if you have a basic physics background, but not in-depth enough for serious science students. Definitely recommended as an enjoyable class of easy-moderate difficulty.",
    "I would recommend this to someone who just needs a QR or a science requirement.",
    "Recommended if you are good with math word problems.",
    "Semi difficult science course that I enjoyed. I would recommend it. It was fun and low stress.",
    "Astronomy 120 is not a gut course nor is it an easy one; the conceptual aspects in the latter half of the semester are very difficult to internalize though the QR aspect does become progressively easier. I would recommend this class but only for students who are genuinely interested in astronomy and aren't simply looking for an easy A.",
    "If you need a Science\/QR credit, take it. The subject is interesting and non-specific enough to not go over your head.",
    "I would definitely recommend Astronomy 120 if Professor Kenney is teaching it. He makes lectures enjoyable and interactive. The math isn't too hard, and the work isn't too taxing. People tried to scare me away from this course before I decided to take it, but I'm really glad I did. If you're looking for a QR or science class that is easy, but not mind-numbing, I don't really think you could do better.",
    "If you are interested in knowing what the Big Bang really is and scientific theories about the universe then take this class. If you like math but hate science and need a science credit then this class is for you.",
    "Good class, but don't think it's easy, because it's not.",
    "The first half of the semester is more focused on stars and planets, the second half on larger scale galaxies and the universe (hence the name). I would recommend it if you want an interesting math or science course that doesn't require such advanced mathematics.",
    "Take this class (with Kenney)!! So much fun. Learn about the universe and big questions.",
    "I took it for the QR\/Sc. Be warned, however, this is not a easy class.",
    "If you\u0092re looking to get a QR, this class is good for people who would like to improve their basic math and problem solving skills. The subject is also interesting.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "If you need a QR, and like space and stuff...but its not a gut, and its harder than it seems.",
    "If you're looking for an easy QR, keep looking. Lectures are boring, the material is not that easy, and professor Kenney enjoys putting people on the spot.",
    "If you are genuinely interested about learning about space, yes, it is interesting. But if you just want a gut science\/QR credit, it is a lottt of work and definitely not a gut! But in the end, all the material was interesting but not applicable anywhere else other than in the classroom.",
    "ASTR 120 is a good (albeit difficult) way to fulfill your science credit. I came into this class with a terrible background in physics and scant knowledge of astronomical phenomena. If you are this type of student, you will be very frustrated for the majority of this course...until finally, everything clicks in the end and you begin to make the necessary associations. Professor Kenney is good at simplifying the concepts covered, and the TA's were all quite friendly and approachable.It may take time, and you may not get that easy A you were expecting. But if you are patient, you will walk away from Galaxies and the Universe with a treasure trove of interesting knowledge, and a newfound appreciation for the fundamentals of astrophysics. Because of this, I would recommend ASTR 120.",
    "Take it but you need to put effort in it. Not that much a gut class.",
    "this class is not a gut. the math isn't difficult, but it's not straightforward plugging stuff into an equation. the material is really interesting, to me, at least. so i definitely think it was worth it.",
    "It requires a lot of work, but it's a good class to fulfill QR requirement while still being interesting. Kenney is amazing.",
    "A quantitative class that gives you a science credit. Take this class if you are keen on doing weekly algebra-intensive problem sets, attending class regularly, and spending a few hours at Yale own observatory.",
    "It's not conceptually difficult at all. The TA's grade pretty strictly--probably only to discourage the class' labeling as a \"gut.\" But it is. Don't let them fool you. If you need a gut Sc credit, this class fits the bill pretty well. Just make sure you keep up with the work.",
    "If you want to take an easy QR or SC, then don't take this course. It's a lot of work.",
    "if you are interested in astro, take it.",
    "I would say that while this class was fairly good, I would advise those confident in their math ability to take a more advanced class.",
    "First of all, this course is NOT a gut, you will get a bad grade if you don't take it seriously. That being said, you can get a good grade, there is a lot of material, it is interesting, and it is very well taught. There is a lot of hand holding to make you do the work like quizzes before every class, which can get annoying.",
    "Definatelly",
    "Take it if you need a science credit",
    "THe lectures are good and the readings are manageable. As someone who took this course to fulfill a QR and am not very strong in math, i found the problem sets rather difficult and i relied heavily on the help provided by the optional sections in order to do them.",
    "I hated it. I only took it to get the QR, and I hate QRs...so possibly the class isn't that bad...but I personally couldn't stand it.",
    "It is a gut, but with more work.",
    "If you need a QR that will not break you, this might be the class for you. However, you will have to spend time with the material. So, if you don't have any interest in astronomy, don't take this class or you will be miserable.",
    "An A in this class would require a LOT of effort.",
    "Definitely take it.",
    "The workload wasnt too bad and i thought it was a pretty interesting class",
    "This class was harder than I expected. The math itself isn't too hard (once you remind yourself what math is, which I had to do after having not taken a math class in a year and a half), but the problem sets are tricky. Once you figure out which equations you need for each problem, the hardest part is over. It really helps to shop around the different sections and find a TA who makes sense to you. Lectures can be really, really dull, but Professor Kenney does his best to make dense information tolerable with physical demonstrations, funny diagrams, and corny jokes. To be honest, I'll probably forget most of the minutiae I learned this semester, but did come away feeling smarter about the physics of the universe, which is kinda cool.",
    "I would recommend the course to any student who is actually interested in astronomy. otherwise, the course can feel a bit tedious and filled with busy work. The course is NOT just a gut course. Do not simply take it for a QR\u0096 take it only if you have a genuine interest.",
    "I would recommend astro to anyone interested in the subject, or anyone who wants an interesting QR credit. The class is by no means easy, there's some tedious work, (you get credit for attendance, you have to turn in reading responses before each class) but it is manageable if you keep on top of it. The psets are of varying difficulty but in general are not impossible, especially if you work with others. Overall, I liked the course. I learned an incredible amount about astronomy and professor Kenney is great and keeps it interesting in class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to people who would say to themselves \"i am not good at math.\" This class is deceptive in its claim that it is for \"non-science majors\" which is true, the scientific concepts we go over are very basic, but the math is quite difficult.IT IS NOT A GUT CLASS! I was told that, I read that, I was stubborn and did not believe it. I implore anyone reading this evaluation, this class is time consuming and is not a gut.",
    "Astronomy 120 is a good introduction to general concepts in astronomy. If you plan to actually study science\/astronomy, take a harder course, but if you want to dip into the subject this is a good class.",
    "I would only recommend Astronomy 12o if you're either truly interested in the subject matter or already have a good understanding of physics. If you only have a passing interest in the greater universe or struggle with physics concepts\/math, you probably won't enjoy the course or get much out of it."
