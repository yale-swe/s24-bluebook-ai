    "I would 100% recommend doing research at the Innovative Interactions Lab - you learn a lot and working there is an absolute pleasure.",
    "There is no better way to spend your time at Yale then doing research! Psyc 495 allows you a wonderful way to get involved! If I could I'd take this for all of my classes.",
    "Take it! It's a great way to get some lab experience, and to figure out if it's something you want to do. You'll learn a ton about the research method, what makes a good research design, and will get experience with developing your own research and presenting your ideas. Super chill half credit.",
    "I would recommend this research for credit experience to anyone who is considering pursing psychology or cognitive science in the longterm. There is no better way to see if you like something than to go ahead and do it and this course gives you the opportunity to do research, which is the heart and soul of the field."
