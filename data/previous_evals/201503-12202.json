    "I think this class is certainly worthwhile taking. I went in with one idea about what the class would be about, and came out with a completely different view on what role women had in grassroots politics and how they've shaped our nation. A perspective worth learning about.",
    "This course is a history of grassroots movements in the united states. It's a side of US history you will never learn, and it changed the way I understand a lot of things we see in politics today",
    "I would definitely recommend it, I feel like I learned so much! You definitely have to put your work in, but Professor Klein is super helpful and it's certainly worth it if you're really interested by the way women's place in the U.S. has changed throughout the twentieth century.",
    "I would HIGHLY recommend this course. It completely the changed the way I think about issues of race, class, poverty, and intersectionality in the 1960s and 1970s, with constant connections to the same problems that we face in today's world. Professor Klein is so cool, definitely go and speak to her during office hours and work with her to refine your paper and writing. You will definitely gain an appreciation for the importance of a historical (rather than poli sci or anthro) lens in this class.",
    "It's a great class. Super interesting and important material that we read and discussed and very relevant today. In order to understand American society in the present, we need to study the past and its historical legacies--this class is a perfect example of that. I highly recommend this class. Professor Klein is awesome. She is a great discussion leader, knows just so so much, and really pushes her students. She has high expectations, but if you take that as motivation to work hard, you will learn a lot.",
    "Great course! Sometimes there would be too many assignments in one week to feasibly be done (ex: a draft of a paper due, reading one dense history book plus additional articles), but overall was a fascinating survey class of activist trends.",
    "Take HIST191J! Professor Klein is really superb and definitely one of the smartest professors at Yale. The class and readings are well worth the work."
