   "comments": [
    "Yes. Definitely a good class; not very hard, not that much work, and you can get some requirements out of the way.",
    "It's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it. It simply tries to do too much - Michael Warner has read everything ever written and so he has a lot to offer, but not enough time to do so in 50 minutes. Lectures usually feel rushed and end late, and I had more trouble than I usually do feeling motivated to keep up with large amounts of reading. If the course were reorganized to cover fewer writers, or if Michael Warner taught an American lit seminar, it would probably be awesome.",
    "This is a really great course; Warner is amazing, as is the syllabus (even if you think it sounds boring, I promise you it won't be). Definitely take it.",
    "It's a great class for English majors and a decent class for American Studies people. It's very much an English class, not an American Studies one. It's a good class, but I (having never taking a non-writing English class at Yale) had a really difficult time with it. Not too much work, but the grading can be tough!",
    "A great way for English majors to simultaneously fulfill their American and pre-1900 requirements. Also an excellent excuse to read some beautiful poetry in the second half of the course - Whitman, Dickinson, etc.",
    "Amazing intro to early American lit. GO TO LECTURES - Warner crams so much interesting and important information into each one, plus he's just pretty funny and focuses on unusual aspects of the works that you wouldn't anticipate. The amount of reading is sometimes ridiculous, but it's almost all very enjoyable. Definitely recommended for English majors - great way to fulfill the pre-1900 and American requiremt too.",
    "Absolutely consider English 280 if you are interested in reading the books on the syllabus--I had read almost none of the selections and had wanted to, and this gave me a great chance to both read and analyze a wide selection of American literature. Professor Warner is an enjoyable lecturer, the readings are interesting, and while the reading load varies, it is generally not strenuous. Good for an AmLit requirement or if you just want to increase your AmLit knowledge. I did!",
    "This is a great class. The reading list is both broad and deep. You get to read all of the classics you want to - Uncle Tom's Cabin, Walden, Leaves ofGrass - but you also get to read a lot of lesser-known stuff and nonfiction. Professor Warner is one of the leading queer theorists, but he wields this tool with precision, introducing theoretical frameworks only when necessary and spending a lot of time on close-reading. One caveat: this class is much more of an English class than an American Lit class. It's American Lit only in the sense that you get some historical background into the readings, read some nonfiction, and visit the Bienecke, but my AmLit friends struggled with the amount of serious literary analysis they were expected to perform.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in English, American Studies, or both. I took it as an English major, and it was a nice change to take a class that focused on context rather than just close-reading.",
    "I would recommend this clas to anyone interested in literature or history, even if the period doesn't seem interesting. Warner makes these texts come alive. I can't recommend him enough.",
    "Solid lecture course of canonical American texts with thoughtful commentary from Michael Warner. I'd recommend this course for its content and for Warner's kind and insightful nature. The work ranges from barely anything to manageable, though I get the feeling that most people err on the side of less reading.",
    "This is a very good introduction to American literature, and I felt like the reading\/writing requirements were reasonable. You should bear in mind that this is truly a survey course (as it is advertised to be)-- most authors only are discussed for one section. While the pace is fast, I still felt like I learned a lot as a result of Professor Warner's insightful comments.",
    "I wouldn't have taken this class if I didn't NEED to, with that being said it wasn't bad. I'm sure the kids who chose this course and actually like literature (from this time period or otherwise) really enjoyed it. I learned a lot that I wouldn't have if this wasn't a necessary course.",
    "ENGL 280's biggest strength is Prof. Warner. He is incredibly knowledgeable, gives great lectures that are informative and often entertaining, and offers much more sophisticated analysis of texts and literary trends than one might expect in a lecture course that covers so much material. And there is a lot of material, which is perhaps one of the drawbacks to the class- it is difficult to get too invested in anything when the course is moving along so quickly. Unless ENGL 280 is your academic priority, it is also sometimes difficult to do all of the reading, and although it is certainly possible to do well in the class while missing some of the texts, I felt like I was missing out by not getting to everything.",
    "ENGL 280 is a survey of American literature through the Civil War. It is a great opportunity to read some of the best American writers, including great Thoreau, Emerson, Dickinson, Whitman and Melville. Professor Warner is a strong lecturer and a great teacher if you seek him out. Though some of the weeks near the beginning were dull or general, the class becomes really engaging once you get to some of Warner's favorite authors, like Whitman.",
    "Take it! You'll read some of America's most important and best writers from a weirdly overlooked period (at least in the rest of my coursework), and Warner is really good.",
    "Yes, I would. Good reading, good lecturer."
