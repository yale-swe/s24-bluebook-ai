    "This class is a solid introduction to Islamic law and ethics, and provides a broad overview of classical jurisprudence through more contemporary type debates about whether there can be an Islamic democracy. It is a good way to get oriented in the field before choosing one area to really delve into. If you take this class it would help to have an idea what you want to get out of it in advance and to have a broad paper idea so you can focus on course materials relevant to the topic and skim\/lightly read the rest. My only objections to the class was that the reading was not very contextualized, there was too much of it for the number of credits assigned, we jumped around geographically and temporally with little signaling as to why\/how this mattered, and that the professor frequently assumed everyone had a solid grounding in Islamic history. Although we had a very small number of students in the class, the professor limited class time to lecturing, never addressed the class with questions, and seldom engaged with us about our questions. There were, however, discussion sections available but few people attended, probably because they didn't feel like they were engaging with the material enough to have really great discussion questions. Again, there was just a lot of material to soak in, and it was hard to know what was significant and where to focus our attention and limited time. Professor March is clearly brilliant and has an encyclopedic knowledge of Islamic Law primary sources as well as the constellations of scholarship and discourse. The problem is that he frequently lectures and speaks with us without providing necessary background or context. For example, I have no idea what methodological or disciplinary framework we were using in the course. This made it difficult to know what the common vocabulary for our discussions should be. Political science? Philosophy? History? The class's interdisciplinary aspect could have been a boon if we had discussed more self-consciously the styles and methodologies being employed by authors. Another flaw or perhaps difficulty of the course is that there is such a mix of students, and all with quite different backgrounds in Islamic studies. We had undergrads, poly-sci grad students, div students, and law students. There was even a Phd in the class! Perhaps this explains why class discussion was so difficult and why Prof March felt like he needed to lecture at us. Final thought: this course was just as time consuming,... if not more, than a 4 credit black letter law class.",
    "I declined to answer the question about management of classroom discussion because the class is a combined undergraduate-graduate class, making it quite different from ordinary YLS classes, and thus hard to compare. The class really resembles a masters degree-level course, and is very good for those interested in the material."
