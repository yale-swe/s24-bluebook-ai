   "comments": [
    "This was an interesting course that improved my knowledge of categorical data analysis as well as basic biostatistics principles. It covered a range of material and utilized SAS, which will be useful for my future in public health.",
    "The course was very theoretical at times which is good, but not at the expense of learning more practical things like learning how to input the data in SAS and interpreting the output. For the most part, students were left on their own to figure out these issues. This being said, the course is a must take for students who will be conducting data analysis in the future, and provides an important next step to material learned in the introductory BIS courses.",
    "Excellent instructor, abstract lectures, sometimes challenging to understand but practical and useful information",
    "I love Professor Zelterman's of way explaining concept, crystal clear.I would recommend it to other student.-Xiao",
    "I learned a lot from this class. Professor Zeltermann tries to make you understand biostatistic concepts by yourself. At the beginning this is quite disturbing but you get used to it and learned a lot.",
    "It could be helpful if there were some powerpoints or print outs that showed more step by step progression of logistic, log linear, poisson analysis or other topics covered in class. Additional resources beyond the course textbook would be helpful.",
    "Very good foundation for statistical considerations in research. Less emphasis on learning SAS, but that was stated upfront and was acceptable to me.",
    "The course was well taught and the professor was very knowledgeable. It was good that the professor spent so much time answering questions. His knowledge of the subject really came through and thus made it easier on the students to understand.",
    "This is one of the best course I took in EPH. It's very attractive and interesting. I am able to understand some comfusing concepts that have bothered me a lots. The strenth of this course it that professor can explain a complex problem in a simple way. That is very helpful.If there's something needed to be improved, I prefer more topics to be covered in class. I feel like the lectures were somehow too short to cover many topics.I also suggest that professor should post the answer key for homework assignments. These homeworks are very good to test what we've learned and help us to understand in-depth. We do need answer key to make sure we know the right solutions.",
    "Great course! The material may normally be quite dry (statistics...) but the instructor made it all worthwhile. Excellent as is.",
    "Strengths:Dr Zelterman really opens himself to helping students understand ... and doesn't give up.He's very fair in how he helps students learn SAS by examples that he lays out very helpfully.He's got a musical way in building a rhythm and then floating a harmonious narrative onto that ... and then building mathematical layers of meaning onto that.Like the Rolling Stones, he's better in person, though.Weakness: The course book drives students up the wall. I kind of agree. It needs some Tufte-style diagrams and some editing. Of course, it's pretty that way because Dr Z was too busy helping students instead of imperiously driving a fleet of grad students to edit his book for him.",
    "If the instructor taught the content of the assignment before giving it the course would be greatly improved",
    "the course was a little difficult to begin with mostly because the concepts were a little bit more abstract. but became very interesting and useful half way through.",
    "good interaction and flexibility, maybe a little more structure would be better",
    "The pace of the course was reasonable, new material was introduced and discussed in class and there was adequate time to ask questions. However, it seems that the material covered in classes was mainly just an introduction to the topic and that it was overly simplified and general. In depth, analysis of the statistical methods or how to use each method and interpret the output was not discussed or taught enough in class. This made completing each assignment extremely difficult and frustrating because I felt unprepared to even understand where to begin the analysis. A lot can be said from learning by doing, and I believe that the assignments were an excellent way to apply the course materials, however, I would have hoped to have gotten more out of the lectures themselves. Additionally, I appreciated that we discussed the assignments in class right after we handed them in, but this process got to be quite frustrating as many new ideas and concepts that we had not learned but needed to use on the assignment would be revealed and thismade it frustrating to know that we didn't have all the tools needed to do a good job on the assignments.",
    "The biggest weakness is the lack of comments when the assignments are returned. There are still things I am unclear about with log-linear regressions, simply because there were no comments on the assignments.The biggest strength is that it is fairly approachable for a student coming out of Biostats 505.",
    "Good course to learn logistic regression and log linear models",
    "It is very interesting",
    "Strengths: I enjoyed learning more about different statistical methods. This class was better than 505B because it offered a smaller class size and more attention to each individual statistical method. In addition, I enjoyed the homework assignments because they were the only forms of feedback (feedback was from TA) for the students - as to whether they were completing the analysis correctly or not.Weaknesses: the professor lacked to discuss more about the interpretation of the SAS output and data. Therefore, when I was completing the homework assignment, I almost felt it was hit or miss as to whether my interpretation was correct.",
    "Strengths: Interest of the instructor in ensuring that the students understood the course content. Although there were assignments almost every week that took tons of time to complete, it helped in understanding the course eventually.Weakness: Very difficult and abstract at times. Recommended book did not help most times."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is a great biostats teacher - he is funny, explains concepts fully and clearly, and makes sure to address student questions and concerns. I appreciated that he always answered email questions promptly and was always available to meet outside of class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman provided good lectures, but unfortunately did not provide much feedback. This is an upper level course and as indicated is a very important one, yet he did not grade any of the assignments. I received several homework assignments back with no comments whatsoever, and while I would like to think that what I turned in was error free, I do not believe that this was the case. Considering that he is an expert in the subject and we are certainly paying enough money for this program, feedback from him on homework assignments would be desirable (this is not to suggest that the course should not have a TA as Alison was very good, but the instructors should be grading assignments in upper level courses given that they are much smaller than the CORE courses). Also, I felt that he was too focused on deriving equations at times instead of more practical concerns relating to SAS and the interpretation of results.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0A genius.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman is a very good teacher. He pays a lot of attention to his students. He is always available to answer questions or to explain some concepts several time, by email or during his office hours.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The instructor was enthusiastic and excited about the material which was engaging. However, at times the lectures seemed scattered. A more structured approach with more step by step process may have been helpful to those who are not statistics experts. Although the course by nature covers varied material, more continuing or progression between subjects before hw is assigned would be helpful for general understanding of the course material.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Very good natured and a pleasure to learn from. His teaching style is quite effective.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Professor Zelterman is very knowledgeable and approachable. He likes to make the students think through their questions and arrive at the solutions themselves (while he provides guidance). This is a good approach as in the end a deeper knowledge of the subject is achieved.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is an extraordinary teacher. He is good at making a boring stat course to be attractive. My peers always felt enjoying in his class.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman was by far the most engaging lecturer in all my classes this semester - he made me look forward to every Monday and Wednesday morning; amazing explanations of all the materials, as well as answering all the questions we as a class could throw at him - I even used one of his explanations of p-values and uncertainty using a hill metaphor to explain the concept to one of my undergrad friends and he was suddenly able to comprehend the concept with far more clarity than any class he'd ever taken before. Great explanations of everything!",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0See above.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0He teaches very well. Uses entertaining anecdotes to illustrate the course content. He was always punctual and stayed within the time limit of each class.",

    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0very good interactions, could give more time to lectures than questions",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman is an interesting instructor to listen to. The classes are very lively and he always accommodates questions. He was always very approachable after class to answer questions. Dr. Zelterman taught us all of the main concepts however i feel i would have gotten more out of the course if he also went over in more detail how to apply these methods including troubleshooting with some of the more typical errors and how to interpret and use the output from each analysis to model the data.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Dr. Zelterman's strengths are enthusiasm for the material and knowledgeable about the topic.The only weakness was that sometimes the material could be confusing, but that's the nature of it and Dr. Zelterman did an excellent job of covering some complicated topics in as easy to understand terms as possible.I suppose the one thing that I would have liked to see was more information on how to interpret SAS results.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0very good",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0The professor is very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Daniel Zelterman \u00a0Strengths: knowledgeable and very patient with studentsWeaknesses: needed to tell us more as to how to interpret data\/output",

    "As this is most likely a required course, there's not much to say about recommendations, but Dr. Zelterman is a GREAT lecturer with beautiful explanations of pretty much any questions about the course material that you can think of.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's very practical and I gained a lot of information. The assignments may be very time consuming if you do not have a solid 'SAS' background.",
