   "comments": [
    "Lots of reading!",
    "It's a ton of reading, though you dont need to do all of it. The grading is very hard and you need to spend alot of time on the papers. Its basically 4 very long papers because its in 1.5 spacing and the mini-assignments are a drag (though very very helpful)Yes, I would recommend it, but only if you are intersted in the material bc you need to have the time to do a lot of reading. the course work-load is a ton!",
    "I want to say yes because I do like the material this class covers, but because the professor was so incredibly critical of his students, I would say no. Do not take this course.",
    "This class has an extremely heavy course load. Basically a 5 page (1.5 spaced which is brutal) paper about why you are writing your 10 page (1.5 space, 4,000 word) course paper. Then there are the take home midterm (5 pages, 1.5 spaced) and final (5 pages, 1.5 spaced). So I wrote 10,000 words (28 pages double spaced or close to how long my senior essay will be) for this class. In any case, if you are willing to put in the work, the course is extremely rewarding. I learned a lot about the history of psychiatry and Freud, and I was really proud of my paper when I finished. Professor Rocha knows a ton about the subject and started every class with a movie. I enjoyed going to lecture and the online resources that he gave us (lecture summaries, slides, discussions) were extremely helpful for paper writing and the exams. Overall, now that I am done with the work, I realize that this was a very good class with just a few too many pages to write.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it!",
    "yes- its a very interesting class and you should definitely at least shop it",
    "This class had a lot of work for a 100 level history class. The reading is pretty much impossible to do. However, the topics are interesting.",
    "Know going into the class that you will NOT get all the reading done, even if you try. The lectures are very interesting, and I feel like I learned a lot about the history of psychiatry and psychology. The professor is weird with his grading (uses a rubric?).",
    "HSHM 231 is a class that will take time, but if you are interested in the material, it is well worth the while. If you are not interested, the class will be tough to get through.",
    "Yes!! If you are at all interested you should take it. I learned so much and would frequently tell my friends about things from class. The work load is kind of intense (TON of reading, annotated bibliography, course paper, take home midterm and final), but you don't really have to do the reading and as long as you stay on track with the course paper you should do well. The assignments are usually very clearly laid out too. Professor Rocha is a great lecturer and he posts his slides and lecture summaries online, although you should definitely go to class. This course unexpectedly pushedme to better my writing too. The TAs give really detailed feedback about writing style so I couldn't be lazy. Overall I really enjoyed this class.",
    "survey of psychiatry and psychoanalysis. no psychology though per say, which was a little disapointing.",
    "yes, good class and very interesting",
    "Yes. It was a great way to learn about the history of psychiatry. The entire second half of the course involves Freud which was very interesting but if you know you don't like Freud I would beware. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this course. No in-class midterm or final (both take home). Great history class.",
    "Take this class only if you are very interesting in the material and in learning a lot about Freud. I took this class as a Psych major who wanted a better understanding of the history of the field and of Freudian theory, and I enjoyed it a lot, especially as I chose a great topic for my final paper and I really enjoyed the research. However, expect a ton of reading and a few boring lectures.",
    "This class was a sweep through the development of psychiatry and psychoanalysis, from Freud to Foucault, through a theoretical and historical lens. I would definitely recommend it to another student because the lectures were always worth attending and the class offered universally-applicable, interdisciplinary perspectives on the fields of psychology and psychiatry.",
    "I say take it. Overall, a really interesting course with lectures that for the most part were really engaging. A ton of reading but I didn't even buy any of the books and was fine. Seems like a hard grader but the curve is generous.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to any student. This class has a lot to offer and each lecture brings something interesting. This has been one of my favorite classes at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this class.",
    "if you are at all interested in the material DEFINITELY take it",
    "I wouldn't recommend taking this class unless you have a serious interest in Freud. Or you could always take the first half of the class and then drop it."
