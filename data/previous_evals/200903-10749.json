   "comments": [
    "I would (even though it is required...) recommend this course to others. Simultaneously with this course I also had to take a weekly physiology seminar lead by Emile Boulpap. The seminar was set up roughly the same as methods except we only covered one paper in the hour slot. I always felt that I was the most prepared in the course, and I have methods to thank for that.",
    "This is a required course. You break down papers and try to understand them. When you meet with the professors, you realize how much you missed.",
    "Methods is a class where you read three papers a week on your own and meet one day to dissect them with your fellow classmates. Then, later in the week, professors come in to essentially prove to the class that we don't know everything. I would absolutely recommend Methods to another student. I learned so much and also got to bond so much more with my class. It was my favorite class of the semester.",
    "This class consisted of reading and discussion primary scientific literature. I would, obviously recommend this course, as I feel it teaches you a better method of evaluating papers, which increasing your general knowledge of biology.",
    "It cover a broad range of topic in class molecular biology and related experiment. It not only enhance your reading ability but also provide sufficient training in experiment design.",
    "A class in which you learn to read and think about scientific literature. I would recommend it to anyone who thinks they want pursue higher education in the sciences",
    "Highly recommended - though the students don't really have the option...",
    "Methods and Logic is great. It's different from any other class - it puts emphasis on student participation and I got the most out of it compared to any class. If you're allowed to, take it!"

    "The way of thinking",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of my area of research tremendously from two perspectives. In the first, my historical knowledge of the area was greatly improved having taken this course and sampled many seminal works in the field. Also, I now know how to read and critique papers, which is an invaluable skill in research, so in that sense I am also more prepared for doing my own research, as I can now evaluate the work of others in my specific area.",
    "It makes you think critically.",
    "This course absolutely helped to deepen my knowledge of the field. By reading so many papers, I have learned more of the subject matter in addition to seeing different ways of writing and seeing published mistakes firsthand.",
    "This course train us to evaluate other researchers' experiment. In this way, we can write better proposals.",
    "This course will be greatly helpful. I learned a great deal of methods i will need to know and i learned how to read the literature. Many things i learned in this class will be very helpful",
    "I learned some techniques, though it seemed more like a first exposure rather than being able to fully learn them. The content was so varied, I was not able to absorb a lot of the biological concepts underlying each week's papers. I am now better at reading papers and articulating scientific concepts and experiments. Sometimes it felt more like answering questions than participating in a discussion."
