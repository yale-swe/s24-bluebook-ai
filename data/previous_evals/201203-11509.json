    "Certain lectures (global budgets for example) less helpful.",
    "This particular foundation course allows the student for an overview of the systematic theory approach.The type of discussions in class are helpful in forming the mindset for policy makers when encountering science inputs. As well as develops the mindset for natural sciences researchers to learn the importance of result communication and outreach. Anyone wanting to work with natural resources should take this class.",
    "For a foundations course, the instructors assumed that the students knew too much and did not explain basic concepts clearly enough in the beginning of the class. The slides did not explain content clearly and graphs lacked titles and information that would have helped students understand their meaning. The instructors often didn't know the answers to questions that were asked. The readings were much more detailed than the content of the lectures, so it was clear from the beginning that most of the readings were not going to be helpful. The main out of class project was a carbon budget, which the instructors said that they were going to walk us through completing over the course of the semester, but we never really got much direction and did not even receive a project description until almost the very end of the semester. I did not feel like the course prepared me to complete the project at all.",
    "For all questions related to the instructors, we had 2, so i answered as best I could for both \"on average\". I found Os to have great big picture perspective and found his lectures quite interesting and thought provoking. I know that the content Pete taught was, by its nature, a bit more granular and in some ways technical, but I found his lectures sometimes challenging to get through and be inspired by. A bit more lively interactions with the students is one thing that I think would have helped.",
    "I wish it had been clearer the extent to which the readings were background material. I spent a significant amount of time familiarizing myself with the papers in advance for the first midterm and would have allocated my time more efficiently had I known that that material would not be covered in the exam.Really appreciated that Oz knew every student's name by several weeks into the course.",
    "I have strongly mixed feelings about this class. I really like both the professors personally and think their work is interesting. I can't really imagine a more challenging format for me to learn from than this class, especially for content I am so interested in and people I am so excited to learn from. In all, the class was an excellent survey of the history and practice of ecological thought. In practice, the lectures were raced through and difficult to comprehend. The readings were largely never touched upon in class or in the exams, and we were often expected to read them after the lectures. While this may work for some super dedicated students, given the time constraints we are under from other classes, I found it very impractical to get anything from the readings in this context. Lectures themselves were both extensive and bare, and it was easy to miss key concepts.At the same time, the class really did impart a very wide breadth of ecological concepts, although my mastery of them is limited, despite my better efforts. I would love to see this class conducted as a seminar, with more of a focus on reading, writing, and discussion, with more depth, with few and more focused lectures. The midterm and final format did not work for me at all, except to the extent that it forced me to go back and relearn things that I missed the first time around. This is not really how I want to be learning.",
    "I found the readings challenging because they were not adequately tied to the lectures. Half way throughthe course, I backed off the course reading and focused more on lectures, and found this to be more helpful.",
    "1. This was a foundations course for the MEM program and my first ecosystems course ever. It was great to be exposed to the primary literature. However, some required basic readings or readings broader in scope may have been valuable additions to the course. After the course was done, I read Energy in Nature and Society by Vaclav Smil and found that reading Chapters 1-4 would have been a great complement to what we learned in class.2. The readings for the course were helpful, as was the synthesis. However, I found that commenting on other people's comments was not necessary and didn't really add to the discussions. My major complaint with the course was the ecosystem budget, which seemed like an accounting exercise more than a gratifying exploration of primary literature. While we had opportunities to choose our subjects, it degenerated into a search for numbers and an exercise in making assumptions. I would suggest a different type of project that would still let us appreciate the complexities of ecosystems without such a focus on quantification. The lessons that ecosystem budgets are difficult and that it is hard to make them tie is easily taught and it doesn't seem like going through the exercise as a final project adds much value."

When we had these particular sessions we were able to integrate the lectures, readings and analysis over current science-policy debates.I would also say the final project was a highlight. Using all the acquired knowledge and analysis tools from lectures into a practical application was helpful in the learning experience.",

I also liked how it seemed to go slow enough to appeal to people like me who were new to the subject but also seemed to maintain the interest of people who had more of an ecology background. I also really enjoyed the guest lecturers and wish there had been more.",
    "Team taught well. Really well done for a foundation-level course.",
    "I enjoyed the material very much, and sometimes was quite excited by it during the lectures. I liked the discussions to a certain extent, although they were mostly just lectures as well.I really liked learning about food webs, which was new to me, and the nutrient cycling across ecosystems.",
    "The class discussions and reference to management and carbon credit \/ sequestration projects were more helpful.",
    "I really enjoyed the lectures where the instructors detailed their own research. The specific examples that these provided enhanced learning of the concepts.",
    "The course was an introduction to the concept of systems thinking. I found some of the concepts to be parallel to those in other subjects which reinforced ideas such as system boundaries and control."

   "comments": [
    "Some of the Powerpoint presentation lectures were too long and the professor went a little too fast. Also, the exams were a little lengthy and I don't think there was enough time allocated to complete them.",
    "Some lecture material very basic. Students should be expected to catch up if they are missing some of the most basic knowledge.",
    "I think this class is a reflection of the experience and seniority of the faculty. The syllabus and readings are well established. The use of classes V2 is well integrated in the topic discussions. Perhaps a field trip would add to the learning experience.",
    "I had a lot of problems with this course. I think my problems all come down to the fact that it was really really disorganized. I basically liked both of the professors, but it was abundantly clear that neither of them were giving it their all (or even half of that), and there were a lot of problems that went along with that.I felt that the whole course was just unclear--I never felt like I had a good understanding of the lecture material (I never got the feeling that lectures were really prepared in advance), and I was never sure of what the main \"takeaway\" points of the lectures were. As such, I was never sure what to study for the exams; likewise, I felt that a lot of the exam questions were really vague--and yet the professors had specific answers in mind. I believe one question on the final was something to the effect of: \"What are necessary processes for ecosystems to continue to function?\" If \"any intelligent answer\" was accepted, this would be fine--but I think there is one specific \"right\" answer; at least that's how the midterm was. As such, I didn't feel like my grades at all reflected how well I understood (or didn't) understand the material; they just seemed to be a bit random.Likewise, I found it very frustrating that we didn't get feedback on the Topic Discussions that we did over the course of the semester. We did 5 or 6 of them, and only ever got feedback on the first one.Finally, I found the end project (carbon budget) to be so vague as to be extraordinarily frustrating. It would be really nice if a model project could be provided to next year's students--though in all honesty I think there are better projects that could be done as a part of this class; I'm not sure that the carbon budget project was particularly useful, and it was very time consuming. Even so, given the fact that this course has been offered before, I felt like I never understood what I was supposed to be doing for the project, which made an already difficult project even more difficult.If this class was new, or this was the first time that the professors had taught it, I would cut it some more slack, but it has been taught before by these professors. Students are expected to put 100% effort into our classes; I know the professors are busy and have other things to do, but it was disappointing that this class was so disorganized.",
    "I did not find the carbon budget project to be useful for my learning at all.",
    "Earth and climate system, and ecosystem dynamics.",
    "The lectures need to be structured in a way that actually provides students that have not taken ecology before with a foundation. Slides need to have more explanatory information on them so that students can understand what they are talking about. More topic discussions to facilitate learning earlier in the semester. More explanation of the carbon budget project earlier in the semester.",
    "I found the structure to be a bit disorganized, especially with regard to the carbon budget assignment. More interim deliverables and more specificity in terms of expectations would have helped a lot. I also think that incorporating more discussion, even in the \"lecture-based\" classes, would have helped solidify some of the concepts more.",
    "Prof. Raymond needs to put up the slides he's using before the lecture!",
    "The carbon budget project was completely amorphous. I had no idea what was expected of me or how to tackle the process. In the end, I felt that we wrestled it out, but how much more worthwhile a project if it had been presented as a guided introduction to modeling, and we actually discussed some of the process and challenges together...I felt the lectures were a difficult combination of really exciting\/too fast to really learn, and too slow\/disinterested.The discussions were interesting in terms of the readings for sure, and sometimes got lively: I would have liked to see more of us sitting in a circle, wrestling with ideas and less staring at a powerpoint. A very linear model of learning: students lack, teacher imparts.",
    "I realize that this is a natural science course, but I felt that the topic discussions should have included more of a nod to the social sciences and anthropogenic aspects of the problems. Seeing as the current changes in climate are primarily driven by human activities, to ignore them (in my opinion at least) is to ignore a major part of both the problem and any potential solutions, as well as failing to answer the call for interdisciplinary analysis and action.",
    "More synthesis between lectures, and between readings and lectures.",
    "The discussions were good exposures to the primary literature but their general lack of structure and lack of expertise in the issues among class members led to some tepid interactions and my feeling that the time could have been better spent. One exception was the discussion on Global Linkages of Natural Resource Exploitation, which was excellent because it had an introductory lesson that gave much more context to the articles themselves and drove student interest, leading to a valuable session."

Hard to tell whether I learned any specific skills I will be able to apply to my research, but there are certainly concepts that I am familiar with now that I would have had no other place of coming across.Although I greatly appreciated the history of ecology being interwoven into the class, I sometimes found it difficult to differentiate between the instructors own research and the different perspective in ecological thought. I would have preferred more explication of these different schools of thinking about ecology.",
