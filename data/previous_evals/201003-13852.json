   "comments": [
    "The library could be a bit more lenient on their lending policies, but the resources are all there.",
    "I thought that between the reader, the instructors, and library that there were ample resources available. If one class were devoted to looking at some rare manuscripts or catalogues which may not be in the general circulation I think that would enhance the experience, but it is also the responsibility of the student to supplement the course work with their own explorations of the material.",
    "The resources available were more than adequate. As a higher-level history\/theory elective I felt I was well introduced to what was available as research tools and this was a great opportunity to investigate all of the resources that the university has to offer.",
    "We are very fortunate to have the chance to study in an institution with such an incredible wealth of resources. I found a vast amount of books and visual documents which were necessary for me to complete my project, but again, I am pressed to note that the strict library regulations in regards to the borrowing of books make it very difficult to work at times. Unfortunately, architecture students often find themselves working in their research papers in the final weeks of the semester. Not being able to check multiple books out of HAAS very often poses a great obstacle. Perhaps something could be done in regards to this concern, which I am sure is shared by many of my classmates.",
    "Yes, always. We have the best digs of any architecture grad school."
