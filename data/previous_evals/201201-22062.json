   "comments": [
    "Take it if you like to paint and are self-directed. If you're expecting an intense experience, then wait for Robert Reed's painting course.",
    "I thought we'd learn a lot more than we did and do a lot more paintings, but it was an okay class.",
    "Yes. Don't be afraid if you're not an art major. It is a great relaxing hands-on and creative experience.",
    "Introduction to oil painting. Do a few color\/technique studies, then a few bigger projects. Assignments are pretty open ended. I would recommend it if you really like or are studying painting. It definitely helps to have drawing\/painting experience. Probably just for art majors, unless you're willing to put in the time and energy.",
    "4 to 5 assignments with group crits following each. Requires a lot of time, so keep that in mind when making your schedule. It's great if you already have ideas about what you want to do but it can be a little frustrating if you go in with the expectation that there would be a lot of direction. Painting with oil is lots of fun though!",
    "I recommend this class to those who are serious about art.",
    "A good class but could be more rigorous. I felt like the projects were fun but the speed of the class could have been much faster. One painting a week would have been ideal. A mandatory sketchbook would have been even better to develop visual concepts outside of class.",
    "Absolutely -- a must-take at Yale"
