    "I would recommend Digital Photography to any student who wants to introduce themselves to the digital world. Anyone, from total beginners to people who already know film could take this class, and it's open enough that anyone could get something out of it, whether that means they are beginning their exploration entirely, or beginning their exploration in the digital track.",
    "YES...take this class! it's a bit of work, but fun work!",
    "I would recommend this class to students who have a budding to serious interest in photography and is willing to make the time and money commitment. It's exciting to learn from instructors and students from the Art School, but the class isn't for everyone and it is more populated with artsy people than dabblers.",
    "Cool course. You are forced to take a lot of pictures and as a result you begin to develop your own style of photography. Critiques can be really long, and you'll end up spending a LOT of time printing and editing photos in the lab. Also each class is 2 hours. You get out of it what you put into it.",
    "Take this class! John is the best at explaining photography in a totally clear-headed way. Also, his lectures on different artists are arguably more interesting than any you'll find in an art history class. Be prepared to work hard, though!",
    "I strongly recommend the class. It's a good starting point for someone looking to master digital photography and start a career in photography.",
    "I though that digital photo was a very enjoyable class that does demand that you dedicate a certain amount of time each week to taking pictures but other than that isn't very overbearing and the crits are helpful without being too stressful.",
    "Yes, absolutely. Take it! You need to know that you will be expected to spend a few hours taking photos every week but its well worth it.",
    "Introductory Digital Photography with John Lehr was a great experience, both for the guidance it allowed me when capturing my own images, and for the teachings on iconic and contemporary photographers alike that broadened my creative outlook. I loved the pace of the class--which demanded a consistent allowance of time, but likewise made you step away from the computer screen and book--and the fact that you walk away with a stack of prints cataloguing a semester of hard work. What you put into the class is what you get out though. Though you are required to capture 150 photos a week and put together a small collection of prints every other week, this can be easily accomplished with only minor effort. Nevertheless, most kids in the class do put a good amount of effort into their work--especially considering that an interview was required to gain entrance."
