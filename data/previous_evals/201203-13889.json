   "comments": [
    "Lots of work, but a good class.",
    "Need more instruction in how to conduct systematic review\/meta-analysis. Grading was very hard, but expectations were not clearly laid out.",
    "This course was very interesting. I really enjoyed the Thursday discussion sections were we discussed and practiced actual skills in analyzing different kinds of literature.I found the lectures interesting, but not always helpful. I think that there should have been more in-class opportunities to connect what we were learning to the systematic review we were working on. At the beginning of the semester we did this when we discussed our systematic review topics. I think there should have been milestones along the way (in addition to the protocol) where we had to hand in different sections of our review. This way we could have had the opportunity to discuss the actual process of systematic reviewing and any barriers we were encountering.My only other suggestions is to limit the number of assigned readings! There were so many I never knew where to start. Pick the ones you think are are the MOST pertinent to the topic, and make the rest optional.",
    "Strengths:1)Excellent tool to learn2) Good review of systematic reviews and how to conduct themWeaknesses:1) Preparation for discussion helped individually to clear concepts but during discussion section it was not that helpful since we all did not read the same article. It would be helpful if we read the same article and did some exercises on them2) Sometimes some analysis and concepts are difficult to gauge but the course is too short to cover this vast topic.3) Lack of TA",
    "The course is dense with information. It certainly does throw students into the deep end. It provides a good overview of the methodological considerations of various study designs and has helped me refine my ability to read papers critically.I wish more lecture time was dedicated to the mechanics of systematic reviews (e.g. using RevMan, keeping references organized, inputting data into a meta-analysis, etc). Perhaps some of the didactic component could be compressed to allow just a bit of time for this, maybe even 5-10 minutes per session.I also wish the Thursday sections focused more on presenting the progress of our systematic reviews to the class and discussing the issues that came up. Maybe a system could be worked out where an alternating subset of students brought in articles on the topic of the week, so that the remainder of the time could be spent talking about our reviews.",
    "This was an excellent course. Professor Bracken is very knowledgeable about evidence-based health care. He is an excellent teacher.",
    "Strengths - a great skill set to haveWeakness - the group discussions were not very helpful",
    "This is a great course for students who want to learn how to do a systematic review or meta-analysis. These are concepts that are not often taught in other courses and are very important for conducting epidemiologic studies. This course covers a wide breadth of topics and the professor makes the sessions very interactive. It is a good course for learning how to critically evaluate studies and explain studies with different findings. I really enjoyed the structure of the class and Dr. Bracken did a great job teaching the material. This is a great course!",
    "I enjoyed the course and thought it was extremely informative. I wish that I had gotten more information on our actual assignment during the section time.",
    "Strengths-Great to explore medical\/epidemiological study design in more detail.Weaknesses-80% of the grade is attributed to a single assignment: a systematic reviewWe don't spend much time in class learning about how to actually DO a systematic review.",
    "The course did a good job reinforcing concepts from epidemiology and how to apply them to the systematic review process. The limitation of this course is that it is relatively narrow in scope, however since systematic reviews can be done in multiple settings, there was information regarding all of the different review types. The Thursday sessions often seemed like one-on-one meetings with the instructor, just in the classroom setting, as each person picked a different topic to discuss and received individual feedback. It was a good learning process, but it was occasionally easy to lose focus.",
    "The course is very informative and helpful. This course can help me to have a systematic understanding of the evidence-based medicine and how to write a systematic review.",
    "This course was an excellent introduction to evidence based medicine and how to properly evaluate the evidence available for clinical guidelines and scientific studies.The systematic review project was a great way to learn how to do this type of study from the systematic search to the analysis.I wish we had spent more time on the meta-analysis piece. Although the protocol was properly explained, a bit more emphasis on how each section is to be properly addressed would be greatly beneficial to ensure to the students produce material that is adequate. Although following the Cochrane handbook was a useful guide, more instruction from the professor would really help the students improve the quality of work.",
    "I really enjoyed the course. I wish we had more hands on experience using RevMan and churning through the review process before the protocol was due. The lectures were really informative.The Thursday \"discussion\" sections were pretty intimidating for me. I felt like this portion of the course - and Dr. Bracken - favored people with clinical experience. At times it just turned into a show of how much medical\/clinical background do you had, without the opportunity to share and learn from the knowledge of the class in a meaningful way.",
    "The course trains students in a very specific skill. I appreciate it's focus and excellent delivery. The course consisted of a lecture and sessions. The format of the sessions rendered them relatively useless. Although one might bring up the motivation to listen to others' projects, they are often so specific that even when putting effort in, I felt one does not get much out of this format.",
    "very good course",
    "The course was interesting but at times I felt like I had to fit into a box to complete the work.",
    "I did not think there is weakness for this course. this course led us go through the systematic review from evaluating individual studies, searching data base, critique studies and guidelines, to doing a review paper. during the course, we learned how to review a paper in different angles,and using guidelines to evaluate a paper, which were very useful and practical skills and knowledge.",
    "Strengths- learn to write a review paper. If you are ambitious you can learn to write a meta-analysis.- very thorough, and detailedWeakness- the lectures can be dull and monotonous.- This class will put you to sleep if you are already feeling tired- entire eval is based on a final review paper, a protocol for that review and participation. I wish there were more assignments were were evaluated on.",
    "Overall, I found this course very helpful in providing an introduction to evaluating published articles and to creating meta-analyses\/systematic reviews."

    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0He is very knowledgeable, and expects a lot from his students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Good, tough grader.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is great! He really knows how to make this material accessible to students. I love how organized this class was! From the weekly summaries of topics we were going to cover, to the readings, to the discussions, it was very well done.Dr. Bracken also made himself available to students outside of class hours which was very helpful. My only suggestion is to make office hours directly after class in the same room, this way students don't have to travel to your office which is out of the way from our other classes.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is excellent and very knowledgable. He makes the lectures interesting with exemplars.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0The instructor is very knowledgeable. His lectures are interesting and easy to follow and often entertaining. He was able to explain concepts in a clear and accessible manner.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is an excellent teacher. He taught us evidence-based health care. He gave us exercises every week which were critical for my learning of health care.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken was a great teacher. I really enjoyed the class structure and the material covered. He taught very valuable concepts in both a lecture and small group format, both of which were very interactive and helped students to reason through the material. He was also very receptive to student questions and always willing to help when students had questions. I really enjoyed having him as a teacher and would highly recommend his class to any student.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Knowledgable and willing to give advice if students seek it out.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Exceptionally knowledgeable. We could have benefited from more direction in class on how to do the systematic review, perhaps a few minutes set apart to address any issues people were having.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken is very knowledgeable about the subject matter and has obviously participated in the process of writing and critiquing systematic reviews for a long time. He was a good resource to draw upon due to his incredibly thorough knowledge.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Braken is very helpful and he gave us a nice talk every week.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Prof. Bracken is a great instructor with a great mastery of the subject. He was funny and inspirational for his students. IT is clear to see that he has great passion for the material presented. Definitely one of the best professors at YSPH",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken was very informative and organized. He brought so much practical experience to the table and really probed us to think deeply about epidemiological and clinical studies.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0excellant teacher",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0He knows his topic and is rather interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr Bracken was a very nice instructor. He responded any questions we proposed. He is a knowledgeable professor. However, he could have TA provide a couple of workshops regarding how to use Review Manager, as some students from outside of public health department were not familiar with this software and had difficult figuring out the operation of Review Manager. It would be a huge help for students if they could have workshops to tell them how to use it.",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Very knowledgeable.Very relevant.Could be more engaging. His delivery would make him much more sought after",
    "Instructor: Michael Bracken \u00a0Dr. Bracken was very approachable. He was very understanding and really wanted all of the students to succeed."

    "Good class for individuals who want to pursue academic research in the future.",
    "Excellent Course. You learn how to conduct a cochrane review.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about doing a meta-analysis.",
    "I would highly recommend, but beware that it is a lot of work!",
    "Take the course if you want a taste of Evidence based medicine. Although do not just consider it as another elective. To make most out of the course one has to put in time. The topic is vast and its upon you how much you get out of it.",
    "CDE 650 is an advanced and practically applicable course. It not only teaches you the elements of critically evaluating studies, but the importance of stepping back to think about the larger picture of scientific research. The work load is heavy, and the instructor is demanding, but it is a worthwhile course to take.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I learned a lot on this course.",
    "This is a great class for students who want to learn about how to conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis. You learn the intricacies of critically evaluating studies and how to pool estimates, which are not taught in any other courses. And you ultimately do your own meta-analysis or review in the end which can be put towards a publication. In addition, Dr. Bracken is a great teacher and very helpful to students doing reviews. This is a highly useful class for clinicians or other people who will be doing epidemiologic research later -- I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "It's a lot of work but an excellent experience if you have the time to invest in the class.",
    "It is a great course to learn how to be more critical of research. It is a great supplement to Epi I in that you explore study designs in more detail. The systematic review is the main portion of your grade, and requires A LOT of work, so be prepared for that commitment.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anybody looking to learn more specifically about systematic reviews, as Dr. Bracken is likely one of the best resources in the world in this area. The process of identifying a topic for review and completing the protocol and review itself was labor intensive, and it was easy to come across bumps in the road, but that is the nature of the process, rather than an indictment of this class.",
    "Maybe. The course is very helpful and informative. But the final paper may be too much to be finished in a short time period.",
    "This course provides an introduction to the field of evidence based medicine, providing students with the tools to critically evaluate any piece of scientific or clinical study and to perform a systematic review of the literature in any specific topic",
    "I'd recommend this course, especially if you enjoy challenges. The systematic review was a huge push for me, but I believe I learned a lot about the process, and myself (corny, I know, but true).",
    "If one wants to pick up a specific skill, here meta-analysis, this course is extremely helpful.",
    "Prepares you to do a systematic review, which I think it helpful for just about any field so I would recommend it.",
    "Yes, I will recommend this course to other students, as it provides students a structure way to analyze studies with various designs, and compose a valid systematic review or meta-analysis.",
    "twice a week lectures, each were 90 minutes long.One day lecture, the other day was discussion-style on that lectureparticipation markprotocol markfinal review mark",
    "I would recommend this course to any student interested in a career in research or medicine."
