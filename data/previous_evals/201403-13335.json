    "An amazing history class that covers the history of eastern europe from the 7th century through 1914 with an amazing lecturer.",
    "yes, but be warned that you cannot use computers to take notes and that the tests are more difficult than those of other history courses",
    "Snyder is quite possibly the best professor at Yale and this class is great though it is very dense in the sense that it tries to pack 1500 years into three tests. In that regard it definitely was not as good as the second half of this class, but it was still really great. If you're a history major and you need a preindustrial credit, this is the best option. If you're more into studying history from the 19th century and onward you will probably find this class really important in understanding things that happened in later time periods. In short, definitely take this class, but ABSOLUTELY take Eastern Europe SINCE 1914.",
    "I thought this was a good change to learn about history pre-1914 in Eastern Europe. Time Snyder is an amazing lecturer, just brilliant! The test structure is also really beneficial to students, given that it is just three tests, section participation and a map quiz. Definitely take this class if you are wanting to learn more about a region that is ever more important in international affairs (think Ukraine, Russia).",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to any student.",
    "HIST 263 was a wonderful class. I am so thankful that I took it. I didn't know much about Eastern Europe at all coming into the course, so I was curious. It was a first-rate class. If you get the chance, take it!!",
    "Snyder is awesome. Tests are fair and the 3 midterm, non-cumulative structure is totally doable. I knew nothing about eastern europe coming in and really enjoyed it.",
    "I'd recommend any class by Snyder but I'd definitely the other half of this class (E. Europe Since 1914) 10000 times more than this one.",
    "Absolutely would recommend, whether you're someone who already has interest in the region or not. Snyder is worth it and to boot, it's not a particularly hard class - just three non-cumulative midterms that are graded very fairly. Keep up with the terms and go to lecture (which you'll want to do anyways since Snyder is unreal) and you'll both learn a lot and help out the ol' GPA.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in history.",
    "AMAZING. Snyder is a master lecturer: be prepared, however, to not be allowed to use your computer to take notes. A lot of reading. Graded by three 50 minute exams (so you're done with the course before finals week, which is very nice). Honestly, Snyder is amazing and you'll learn so much about Eastern Europe -- I'm definitely taking the second half of the course next semester.",
    "GREAT CLASS - ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT!!!",
    "Interesting course. Great Lectures. Take this for fun. I think its a good history class to take because you probably wont learn any of the stuff if you dont take the class.",
    "Absolutely take this course if you have any interest at all in history (or none but just need a cool credit). Professor Snyder is such a great lecturer, you will leave every class feeling very enlightened and also somewhat entertained. It's such an interesting part of the world that gets very little coverage, but he, while very modest, is one of the experts. The readings are a mixed bag and can get a little dense some weeks, but they usually elaborate well on the lecture, and it becomes clear what does and doesn't matter when tests approach. And the three midterm approach is excellent; you never have to write a paper, you never have to review everything, you study a chunk and are done. A gem of a course, not to be missed.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Definitely take this course. You will learn so much!",
    "Fantastic class! I looked forward to every lecture--they changed how I thought about monarchy, nationalism, religion, and so much more. The assessments were very fair and though they took quite a bit of studying (very information\/dates\/names heavy) it felt like the IDs on tests were the most obvious ones to ask about. Doing the reading every week was not always a joyful experience, but section was led very well (with Romain) and I especially enjoyed the information presented in section that was beyond the scope of the lectures. I would recommend anyone take this class, Timothy Snyder is a revelation.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "I loved this course. Professor Snyder imparts so much knowledge upon his students in just 50 minutes. I now know so much about an area of history largely skipped over in high school. My only complaint would be that I preferred Professor Snyder's lectures to those of the best lecturers, but that's just a reflection of how amazing he is. His tests are fair and the readings are completely manageable.",
    "If you're looking for a lecture that you'll enjoy going to every week, delivered by a brilliant and talented professor, this is it. The class is not very much work at all and the tests are easy to study for and get good grades on. The class also covers a region and time period that you don't hear about much, which is great.",
    "I would recommend it to another student - it's a pretty fair class with a nice breakdown (three tests - all \"midterms\" and weighted equally \/ section \/ one easy map test) and you definitely learn a lot. Snyder is a great lecturer too. I liked the second half of the course (the spring semester Eastern Europe from\/after 1914) a lot better though.",
    "Good class overall. 3 tests each worth 25%, 1 map test worth 5%, and section participation worth 20%. No final or papers which was great. Tests were fair and there were no surprises. A ton of dry reading that you don't necessarily have to do, but that can help you if you are lost in lecture. You have to hand write your notes, and Prof. Snyder is great but speaks very quickly so you have to really pay attention and keep up to know what's going on. There was so much material covered that I feel like I didn't really learn anything very well, but I still left the class with more knowledge about Eastern Europe's history than when I came in. So take it if you're interested in the region, or if you want to take a history class that doesn't involve papers.",
    "Absolutely. Can be a little difficult to get all of the names and countries, but definitely creates a better understanding of history. Loved it.",
    "Take this class! Even if have think you have little to no interest in Eastern Europe before 1914, take this class. I gave almost no thought to Eastern Europe before the course but it was by far my favorite of the semester. Snyder is an incredible lecturer, the readings are fascinating, and there is neither a final paper nor a final exam. What more could you want?",
    "ONE OF THE BEST HISTORY CLASS AT YALE.",
    "Absolutely take this class! So interesting and informative! One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "An amazing lecture that manages to give a very detailed overview of almost 1,000 years of history.",
    "EE1914 is a fantastic class. Take it! Professor Snyder is the best, the material is interesting, the readings are doable, and the exams are fair. As a senior, this was the first history class I've taken at Yale. It was amazing.",
    "Definitely take this course! You'll gain a vast degree of foundational knowledge necessary to understand more modern Eastern European history and have lots of fun in the process. Pick and choose with the readings - some of the early Polish stuff can get repetitive and irrelevant - but be sure to take advantage of Wandcyz and Professor Snyder's own writings are particularly pertinent.",
    "Nice class to pick up some knowledge about an area of the world that (at least for me) wasn't really covered in high school history. Top class prof.",
    "Take this class! Even if you don't have an immediate interest in Eastern Europe, you'll leave with one!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! Professor Snyder is the best lecturer, the TAs are wonderful, and the material is fascinating. It is a bit of work, although the three exams are very fair, but all the work is worth the experience of the class. Eastern European history is so rarely covered in traditional history class, unless from a Western perspective, and it's a rare experience that you can learn such new material from such a wonderful professor. You won't regret taking this class, I promise.",
    "Take this class for Professor Snyder. He is a brilliant lecturer and his classes are always interesting. Be wary of the pace because he goes very quickly through the material and I was almost never able to jot down everything he said. Also, the readings were quite dry which made section less than thrilling but TF Marta saved the day with her kindness and extensive knowledge of the material. She was very accessible and really interested in helping students improve.",
    "Take this class! Amazing lectures. It felt like we should clap after every class.",
    "I took it as a fifth class to complement some pretty high workload classes and to kill off a distribution requirement. There's a lot of reading, but I read almost every page and always did it on the day of section after all my psets were due and it was manageable. Really interesting material, because most history classes in America are really Western Europe\/USA centered and we never hear about Eastern Europe unless America happens to be involved in something there.",
    "HIST 263 provides a fabulous overview of Eastern European history with attention to influences from Asia and Western Europe. The course begins with the early history of Eastern Europe, which frames the rest of the semester. I would strongly recommend this course to another student. It's one of the best history lectures I've taken at Yale. You will learn so much you never knew.",
    "This class was absolutely amazing. Even if you aren't a History major, this class was fascinating and I have never before had the opportunity to study this oft-overlooked area of the World and of History. The reading load was very heavy, but that is to be expected of History courses. The material was dense and it took a little while to get used to the names but that did not in any way impair my ability to thoroughly enjoy the class. Professor Snyder is a phenomenal teacher, he managed to always include a staggering amount of detail in his lectures while tying everything together beautifully. This was everything a history course could and should be- I can't wait to take the second half in the Spring. The lectures were always riveting, I don't think I'm alone in wishing that we could have applauded each and every one.",
    "Definitely one of my favorite courses that I've taken at Yale, and a good option for majors and non-majors alike. Prof. Snyder's the best lecturer I've had at Yale, both profound and funny, and lecture each day is a revelation. Section was good too; Marta did a very good job leading it, and if you can get her as your TA, do so. Plus there are some good guest lectures as well. There's a ton of reading, but some of its very good and you can learn a lot from it. Absolutely take it, and then take his course in the spring. You won't regret it.",
    "Yes, absolutely. It was one of the best classes I've taken so far - the material and the professor are great. TAKE IT.",
    "Great class, not a lot of work, and you'll learn a lot about a topic you probably don't know much about. Professor Snyder's lectures can be breathtaking, but he'll also make you laugh. Here's a rundown -- there's one tiny map quiz, a midterm, a final, and then section participation. Take good notes in class, study for the exams, and you'll do well -- and you'll have learned a TON about Eastern Europe.",
    "If a student isn't daunted by heavy reading loads, memorizing large chunks of historical information (more than I've ever run into in any other history class), and is looking for a challenging, interesting, sometimes dizzying history course, I could not recommend this course more. While I wouldn't describe it as an introductory-level history course, it is certainly one that isn't to be missed. If you have any interest in history at all, history major or not, do yourself a favor and take it."
