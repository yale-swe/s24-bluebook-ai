    "Watched a lot of excellent war films through this class! Had a new appreciation of the purpose films serve in society.",
    "Film analysis and remarkable insight into a variety of cultures' expressions of the experience of war (from every perspective you can think of... victim, combatant, civilian, good, evil, colonialist, insurgent). It was a truly wonderful course.",
    "I learned about the representation of war on film and about different film techniques and concepts. I learned to write better essays in terms of structure and content, and the topic of the class opened up my perspective on the way we look back on wars, its meaning, its purpose, and its morality.",
    "This course allowed me to develop a critical eye with which I can watch movies and understand exactly what the director was trying to demonstrate. Furthermore, the topic of war is filled with historical context that allowed me to tie in together several events and improve my knowledge of history. Having to write three essays gave me the chance to improve my writing skills as well."

    "Choice of films was really good; maybe there could be a week left open to students to vote on certain films that they wanted to watch! Discussions in class were a little muted sometimes but I think that's more to do with the group of students than with the teaching itself!",
    "The screenings were terrific and the professors were fabulous. Honestly, present company excluded, the students were rather brilliant as well -- from a lot of different backgrounds. It was an amazing experience.",
    "The structure of two professors co-teaching was great in that Professors Shpolberg and Clark rebounded off of each other's comments in class discussions and each brought their extensive knowledge to the table. The class was structured really well, with Monday screenings, Tuesday comment hand-ins and Wednesday discussions, which kept us in the action of thinking and reflecting on the films, and had us discuss it while they were still fresh in our minds. I liked that we explored different types of films: propaganda movies, international films, different genres and tones, about different wars and different sides of the war. The discussions themselves were well driven, with Professor Shpolberg structuring it based on our comments and sometimes having us discuss in pairs or in debates. The workload was also manageable, yet kept us engaged and left room for personal input as well in the topic of choice for the final paper.",
    "I really enjoyed having two instructors instead of one, which allows for different perspectives to merge together."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Really enjoyed watching all the war films and talking about them! Films were not just American-centric but branched out internationally; though it was still a little Western-centric (we only watched 1 Asian film I think?).",
    "I strongly recommend this course to any Yale student -- it's likely the closest most of them will get to war. And the way that Masha and Professor Clark set up the course is designed to communicate the universally horrifying experience of war, which is a critical life lesson that much of humanity throughout history had to learn the hard way.",
    "Yes. 100% Yes.",
    "This course was amazing! Professors Shpolberg and Clark were really nice and enthusiastic, and made the class so lively. The workload was manageable and kept us engaged in the topic. The screenings were a bit long some weeks, but Professor Shpolberg took our feedback to heart and would take some films off the syllabus if it became too much. We had discussions, debates, guest speakers. It was a small seminar but everyone's opinions were welcome and diverse. We had screenings on Mondays, had to hand in comments on Tuesdays, and discussed in class on Wednesdays - so for three days we were immersed into the topic, and then would basically get the rest of the week off. There were 3 papers, one was a close analysis, one was a reception paper and the final one was both (only 6-8 pages and you could choose which film to talk about for the last one). We discussed a lot of topics, and saw fictional and propaganda movies, international films, about different types of war (genocides, combat, cyberwar, terrorism, etc). Overall, it was a really great class, please take it.",
    "If you are interested in film and war then this is a great class for you to take. You'll learn a lot about different wars, film techniques that convey certain messages, and much more!"
