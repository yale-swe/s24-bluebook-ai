   "comments": [
    "ENGL 011 covers the speeches and writings of Abraham Lincoln over the course of his life. In this class you study these works and analyze them for their meaning and what it says about Lincoln. I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning more about Lincoln or speech writing.",
    "This was a great course. I was not prepared for the level of non-Lincoln sources that we were going to read. However, they were still beneficial. I highly recommend this course.",
    "Take this class!!! It was a great, comprehensive look at all of Lincoln's speeches and writings along with supporting texts. Professor Bromwich is amazing. Each class was interesting and engaging and I would take it again.",
    "Great class that exposes you to the words and thoughts of one of America's most prominent figures: Abraham Lincoln. Bromwich is a bit prickly, but he has a profound knowledge of Lincoln. The class has a lot of reading, 5 essays, and a final. The final is an ID quote test of all the reading--wish I knew this in advance so I could've jotted down some notes\/quotes from all the readings from the beginning. Nevertheless, if you're interested in reading a LOT of Lincoln, and working with a great professor, it's worth it.",
    "It's a great class that requires a lot of reading. You'll go really in depth into Lincoln's thought process and how he constructed arguments and speeches. I would highly recommend it to other students. You'll improve as a writer and a thinker. Additionally, Professor Bromwich is brilliant and being in a room with him every week is a great experience.",
    "Professor Bromwich provides a fascinating look into the political rhetoric and philosophy of mid-19th century America. The readings are great, and the classes are better. Prepare carefully for each class and make sure to listen. You will come out with a deep admiration for Lincoln, and a clear understanding of America's political tradition.",
    "If you can get into this class, take it. It was the best class I had all year. But only take it if you want to learn about Lincoln. Lincoln is one of the greatest writers you will ever come across, and in this class you get a chance to examine his thinking through his direct language, rather than through the narrative woven by historians. It's an incredible opportunity to work with David Bromwich as well. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "A wonderful chance to get to know a teacher who will challenge your thoughts, all while working off the words and speeches of one of the greatest writers in American history. Highly recommend.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I feel it is important to be able to think critically about the history of the United States.",
    "Incredible class. Yes, it is intensely focused on just one person, Lincoln - don't let that scare you. You'll walk away with a very thorough understanding of the legal, political and social issues of the time period, the repercussions of which are still felt today.",
    "This class takes an in-depth look at Lincoln's thoughts and actions by examining his speeches and writings. This has been my favorite class so far at Yale. I feel like I now understand Lincoln's mind and how his thoughts and ideas influenced the course of the nation's history. As a lover of both history and English, this class was perfect. Bromwich is one of the most intelligent professors I have ever had. He is very good at facilitating discussions and encouraging students to disagree and debate. Class was never boring, and the hour and fifteen minutes always seemed to fly by. My writing, critical thinking, and ability to speak intelligently also improved substantially. Overall, this was a fun, relevant, and extremely interesting class, and I loved every minute of it."
