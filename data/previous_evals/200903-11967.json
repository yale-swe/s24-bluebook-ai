    "It's an intro Latin class. Take it if you want to take the language - I'm still not sure why it's at all a sensible language to take for a non-Classics major, but I like it anyway. Oksanish was excellent, but apparently he won't be teaching it again, so shop different sections if you can; this class could probably turn intolerable with the wrong instructor.",
    "This is a very difficult, fast-paced class with daily homework. However, you learn basically all of latin grammar in one semester, so at least it is very effective in teaching you the language. The class is much easier if you have had any exposure to Latin, or another romance language before. Learning Latin as a first foreign language was very difficult, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend the class to someone else with no other language experience.",
    "A very fast paced class, especially if you have no experience with Latin before the class. Homework every night and quizzes every week with a graded assignment, therefore, has a lot of work. You get through a lot of material by the end of the semester. The class meets during reading week which was annoying. Find a good teacher who makes the class interesting and then the class will be less tedious.",
    "Latin 110 was a hard but doable course, and you cover an amazing amount of ground--if you're at all interested in Latin, it's a great foundation. Expect to spend about an hour a night on assignments, but that's not [so much]more than other courses, whatever the other evaluations say...John Oksanish is a great teacher--he's been teaching Latin a long time, and it shows! Well worth taking with him."
