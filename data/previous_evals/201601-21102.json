   "comments": [
    "I'm not a fan of theory classes because they're mainly an exercise in proving that you can never do anything well or fast. But I also just had a really hard time understanding anything in this class in general, so I might be biased.",
    "Basically a math class. Lots of proofs, but we reuse proof techniques a lot. Start thinking about the problem sets as soon as they're handed out.",
    "If you like theory and proofs and that good stuff, it's a decent course. The material can get a little boring (I wasn't as interested in the material near the end of the course), but the assignments are fun.",
    "I would recommend CPSC 465 to any computer science student that is interested in parallel programming and mathematical computer science. I would also recommend CPSC 465 to anyone who is not interested in the above, but is interested in theory for the sake of theory! Distributed computing is a beautiful theory and Aspnes does a great job engaging with it. It's also not so much work -- 3 problem sets and a final. Go to all the lectures, they are full of unique insights and intuitions that you won't get from the textbook!",
    "Look at the syllabus. If you like what you see, take it. It's like an easier, more focused 365.",
    "Yes. Aspnes is great and this material is right in his wheelhouse. He's a funny lecturer, and is fun to just go talk to during office hours. The material is interesting and it's reasonably complicated, but the workload is light 3 p sets and a final."
