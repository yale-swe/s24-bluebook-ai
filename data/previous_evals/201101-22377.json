    "I wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. As I said before, Portuguese is a rising (geopolitical and economic) language and I think that it is a great strategic move to become fluent in it right now. It definitely will set you apart from the multitude of Spanish speakers and will poise you perfectly for entry into Brazil's economy and society. That said, this isn't a language you can just learn on the fly. Because it is a challenging language to learn, you are best off learning it through a regimented Yale course. For these reasons, and because Marta Almeida is such a great teacher, I recommend this course to all."
