   "comments": [
    "This is an extremely current and engaging overview of a new specialty in history - including topics and methods that cut across a wide range of regions and eras. It is useful for almost any historian as well as students in polisci, law, ISS, architecture, undergrads, etc. For students interested in thinking about contemporary affairs, studying across regions and specialties, learning as well as critiquing new analytical tools, and taking risks, I cannot recommend this course highly enough.",
    "I would unequivocally recommend this course! The readings address a wide range of subfields within transnational history; each week thus provides an entry point into a different corner of the discipline and sparks lively conversation within the seminar. Weekly responses provided an additional level of engagement with the texts and other seminar participants even before our weekly meeting. Overall, a very interesting course that could (and should) accommodate diverse interests and participants.",
    "I thought this was a great class- I learned so much more than I had expected. Transnationalism can be a very abstract concept, but this class was an excellent opportunity to consider it from a variety of perspectives and appreciate its importance as a working phenomenon in virtually every aspect of history. The focus on historiography and methods was very valuable and will definitely be applicable to my work in other classes. On average we read one book and one article per week, and every student took a turn presenting the week's readings to the class. Discussions were terrific. I would highly recommend this class."

    "Yes - this course gave me a new way of thinking about my dissertation as well as a growing body of work it fits into. It also provided a crucial theoretical underpinning to some things I will be dealing with in my dissertation."
