    "It's a lot of work, so I definitely wouldn't recommend students to take it with any other work-intensive classes.",
    "Again, it's a great class if you have time to do the labs. Probably the most work of all CS classes.",
    "CS 422 is an introduction to internal workings of operating systems. Major topics include booting, processes and preemptive multitasking, virtual memory, file systems, and networking. Students complete a series of five programming projects leading to a fully functional basic operating system, and well as a final project of the student's choice. It is one of the best courses in the computer science department, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. Be prepared for a fairly heavy workload, though.",
    "Great course. Expect to spend a good deal of time on the labs - the shortest lab probably took at least 15 hours. The instructor and TA were very helpful."
