    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is committed to doing the work. It was fascinating and I feel like I have a much better understanding of the forces that shaped modern public health.",
    "I would highly recommend the course for its engaging readings and critical discussions.",
    "This class is a reading seminar focusing on the central issues that historians of medicine and public health grapple with. It engages with the methods and craft employed by historians of medicine. I would recommend this class to anyone interested in health cultures and the social study of medicine and public health.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the history of medicine and health cultures. I would describe it as an overview, using a book a week as a test case.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student, with any level of knowledge about the field. The seminar will leave any diligent student with a substantial amount of insight into the discipline.",

   "comments": [
    "This course did not relate directly to my research, but itprovided me with a useful history of how public health developed over time. I only wish that I could take more courses in this department because I feel like I have gained so much knowledge and insight. It was also fascinating to learn about publishing and academia and historiography.",
    "The course was a helpful introduction to the field, particularly as a first-year student.",
    "I learned a lot about craft issues, which was very helpful. I also thought of a lot of our readings as a springboard for my own research questions.",
    "Not being well acquainted with the history of medicine before starting this class, it gave me a great introduction. The exposure to the different methods and approaches (the craft of history) made it very useful, whether or not I will use any history of medicine in my future research."
