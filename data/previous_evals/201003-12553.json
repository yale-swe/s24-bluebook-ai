    "I would recommend the course.",
    "It's basically what it says on the tin. As a prospective major, I obviously liked it, but plenty of non-majors took the class. It has fun assignments, varied lectures, and (maybe moreso for non-majors), introduces a style of thought that you probably haven't more or less absorbed by osmosis already, unlike an intro polisci or philosophy class, for example.",
    "It's a survey of many architecture topics. Professor Purves is amazing. I also had excellent TAs which made the instruction for this class extraordinary. The syllabus is excellent; the lectures are organized well. The downside is that no one does the reading. Sections are focused around the sketchbook problems (and one paper and one design problem). But the readings introduce you to many great architects\/thinkers and complement the lectures well; I highly recommend them. In doing them I have a really good sense of the trajectory of architectural (and artistic, economic, etc from that) thought in the last few centuries and especially the turning points (steel-reinforced concrete. big deal!) that I wouldn't have gotten fromthe lectures alone.",
    "Even if you're not really considering an architecture major, this is a great class to take. Drawing assignments are thought-provoking and not very intimidating for non-artists, and the feedback you receive is warm, enthusiastic, and patiently critical. Purves' lectures are eye-opening and immersive.",
    "Architecture 150 is a good introduction class that is challenging, but not so challenging to the point you cannot enjoy the class. I would recommend this class to anyone with an inkling of interest in architecture. Just through this brief introduction one will learn to pay more attention and see buildings in a different light.",
    "Pretty good class. Readings were interesting at the beginning, but there was little incentive to continue doing them. Drawing and design assignments interesting and doable. I think it's a great intro to architecture course, though the lectures could be more interesting.",
    "Architecture 150 is an introductory class to Architecture. The lectures are extremely fascinating, and informative, and they include a number of guest speakers which really complement Prof. Purves's phenomenal class. I think that section was also pretty enlightening, and the TAs are always there to help you.",
    "It's a great class for anyone. I would take it credit\/d if you don't have much\/any drawing experience though.",
    "Good class, good assignments, nice break from writing intensive classes, even if you're not a great drawer",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to perceive the world in a different way.",
    "Take it - even if you're not going to be an arch major - it is really worth it - you see the world around you differently",
    "Very broad overview. Alright lectures, silly sections and projects. You'll have no trouble if you can draw.",
    "definitely take it! great lectures, fun assignments, and not too hard. i learned so much and now i am shooting to major in architecture. if you're not interested in majoring in architecture you should still definitely take it. it's really interesting and makes you think in a whole new way.",
    "This was a great class. I took it as a non-major, and thoroughly enjoyed it. It gives you a really neat way to think about and appreciate the architecture that surrounds you.I ended up taking it Cr\/D since the TAs expected us to devote tons of time to our weekly drawings which I simply did not do...but still a fantastic course!",
    "Great. Take it.",
    "If you want to draw for a HUmanities credit, this might be for you",
    "Take it if you want to draw and glue for credit, not if you want to be assured to get a high grade or be thrilled by lecture\/readings. Purves is decent lecturer, and the assignments are fun and interesting. I'd be wary about taking this class if you don't feel confident in your drawing skills--they don't grade on that, but it's hard to compete with amazing artists. Beware that they give no grades before midterms, so you won't know whether to credit-d it.",
    "This is an excellent, excellent course. Do take it! The lectures are interesting, but you don't have to go if you're having a busy week. You get to keep a sketchbook and most of the assignments involving drawing and modeling, so you get to do fun, hands-on work. The TAs are very real people (architecture grad students... they have it rough), so they are usually very kind and helpful (and incredibly dedicated to the field). The final lampshade project is really fun. If you come from a really artistic background, you might find the course very easy (I did), but if you aren't really comfortable yet with drawing or modeling, you will get much more comfortable. Overall, this was a simple, easy, straight forward class that I would definitely recommend.",
    "This class is about the theory of architecture, and teaches you to look more closely at buildings, and understand them at a variety of different levels, from structure to form, to light, to material, to arrangement. The class involves interesting lectures, and sketchbook assignments, as well as readings and some larger projects. Don't be intimidated if you haven't drawn before, as this class is more about personal improvement than perfect rendering.I would certainly recommend this class if you want to learn to see the world in a new and deeper way.",
    "for anyone remotely interested in architecture i woudl recomend this class",
    "Except for the 9:00 time of the lectures, this class was alright, and not really too difficult. You get out of it what you put in, i.e. how much time you spend on the weekly sketches. Readings are unnecessary and pointless. The only bad thing about this class is the entirely arbitrary grade. I was considering the architecture major before this class, but now I'm not because this class sets the stage for a very artsy\/theoretical approach to architecture rather than a practical one. If that's what you're into, though, you'll enjoy it.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are remotely interested in the philosophy of architecture and have some artistic skill. I am a horrible artist, so it make assignments both challenging and demeaning. However, it is a nice break from the normal workload of Yale to have weekly sketches as opposed to papers\/problem sets.",
    "YES absolutely. Take it even if you don't want to be an architecture major. It's not a whole lot of work, and really interesting.It's not super meaty in terms of depth about anything, but it's a good, broad overview.Be ready to draw, and let yourself get into the design problems - they can be fun.",
    "This class was very interesting as far as the lectures go, but if you are not interested in Architecture, do not take it. Also, if you cannot draw, DO NOT TAKE IT! It really is for majors, so as a non-artistic non-architecture major, I had some difficulties with the section assignments. It is also not a low-effort class. The section assignments sometimes took hours and there were lots of readings although most of the time it did not seem necessary to do them.",
    "Definitely recommend if you want a change of pace from problem sets and papers.The design projects and drawings are fun, challenging, and it's rewarding to have a physical object to show for your work.",
    "Yes, it will make you look at the world differently! Excellent class. Well-taught and interesting.",
    "Yes! Take it! As a senior, it made me want to be an architecture major. It's so much fun, you learn a lot about the basics of architecture and get to read some cool readings from famous architects. You learn how to draw well and to focus on details. Everybody is super helpful and supportive. Purves is great. The TAs were always available for help and were so helpful and encouraging.",
    "Architecture 150 01 is a course that teaches you about the theory of architecture, and that is about it: you learn to look at buildings more closely, and you study some important architectural movements, but there is very little focus on creation. I would recommend architecture 150 01 to someone who feels pretty sure they want to be an architect, but not for someone just looking for an interesting course or a creative outlet.",
    "If you are an architecture major, you have to. If not, it's enjoyable and pretty fun... But not for the casual students. There is real work, and the final project is intense!",
    "Yes I would recommend this course, definitely.",
    "Yes if you're interested in architecture and if you're considering the major",
    "Yes, the class is a quality introductory overview of architecture. Every lecture is engaging, the readings are great and every section has two TAs who provide fairly insightful commentary on the weekly drawing assignments.",
    "Take it if you are at all interested in architecture. The lectures are interesting and you are encouraged to doodle during them. Homework can take a long time, but the drawings are a refreshing change from constant reading and writing in other classes.",
    "This class is GREAT. I am currently a potential engineering major and I loved it, I'm even going to take more classes in architecture next semester. The lectures are interesting and it's not like you are forced to remember everything from lecture because you are never tested on the material, it's more just enjoyable. (same deal with the readings)The workload is not a lot, it might be time consuming, but if you enjoy drawing then it is more of a break from work (you have weekly drawing assignments that you can put in however much work you want). And don't worry if you're not the best drawer - its about improvement! There is just one short 5 page paper during the semester and no final, instead a final design project which is really fun! TAKE THIS CLASS!!",
    "This is an interesting class but the assignments are very disconected from what goes on in lecture. It's hard to get a sense of the cohesive thread that holds the class together. At the same time, it is interesting to look at things from an architectural perspective. If you want to get something out of it though you've got to put effort into the assignments.",
    "Definitely recommended whether or not a student is interested in pursuing architecture as a major or career. Lectures are fascinating and easy to apply- by the end of the course, you walk around analyzing and understanding all buildings in really wonderful ways. Weekly drawing assignments are interesting, but can be as much or as little work as you want to put into them. Grading system is unclear, but TAs and Professor Purves are all really accessible and very helpful.",
    "Purves is just delightful. What a brilliant and engaging lecturer. The course will inspire love for architecture -- and for your experience of spaces and places of meaningful experience -- for the amateur or aspiring architect alike.",
    "Yes. It is a very unique type of class that pairs well with a schedule missing an art. It is a nice break from paper writing and exam taking. And the overall experience of having section in the middle of the A&A building is quite incredible. Also, the information taught is important and interesting for anyone and will create a newfound appreciation for architecture.",
    "It is a wonderful class. Definitely take it at some point. The lectures were very interesting and are worth attending, but in the end there isn't a final exam so you don't have to worry about missing one or two. The drawing assignments are a great break from problem sets and papers.",
    "I would only recommend this class to students with an artistic background who are significantly interested in architecture. I don't think it's an appropriate survey course for someone who wishes to survey the history of architecture or just analyze buildings that have already been constructed. That being said, this is a fun class that blends art into your schedule in a way that isn't too rigorous.",
    "Yes, it's an interesting course that teaches you a lot about how to look at the buildings around you, even if you're not planning to pursue a career in architecture.",
    "Everyone should take this course. It is simple and interesting. You are asked to doodle in your sketchbook as a part of note taking! The lectures are all on different, interesting topics such as light, surface, material, landscape, theory, etc. The weekly drawing assignments helped develop my skills and the design challenge was my favorite part of the class. The TAs were also accessible, creative and a worthwhile resource.",
    "I would recommend the class. It provides a good base to start thinking about buildings in a new way. The two design problems are really intereting and give space for a lot of creativity. Good class to balance a reading- or pset-heavy curriculum.",
    "I would recommend Arch 150, whether or not you're interested in the architecture major. I'm an engineering major, and although it was sometimes (a) intimidating that there were so many great\/ practiced artists in the class and (b) annoying that it was such a non-technical class, it did change how I look at buildings. It was especially fun to be able to study Yale buildings. We never talked about the reading in section, so it was a very light workload, except for the midterm and final projects.",
    "Really interesting introduction to the field of architecture in terms of its cultural and theoretical significance. Each lecture covers a specific element of architectural design, theory, or practice -- light, form, materials, environment -- and the week's readings (not too heavy, and basically optional) generally reflect different famous architects' and theorists' take on these elements. There are weekly drawing assignments, a short paper, and two \"design assignments\" which involve both drawings and a built structure, plus a required weekly discussion section, which is basically a critique for the week's assignment. This class is not a practical or pre-professional-type introduction to the techniques and methods of architectural design, but if you're interested in developing a new understanding of what goes into the design of a building, and a new way of looking at the built world (or if you're a prospective arch major), then by all means take this class.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The topic was interesting, well organized, and well presented.",
    "This is a great class for anyone who, in addition to having an interest in architecture, loves observing and attempting to record\/convey through drawings the architecture she sees around her.",
    "YSE! Take it! One of the best and most unique classes I\u00b4ve taken at Yale.",
    "I loved this class, but I'm also an arch major. It is great if you are interested in architecture or want to learn more about it and would like a class where most of the assignments are drawings.",
    "The material is cool, but don't take this class unless you're a legit visual artist. Or unless you take it Credit\/D\/Fail. Lectures are interesting but are completely irrelevant to the weekly sections, and they don't give you grades until the final. Don't take this class as a gut or if you want to help your GPA unless, like I said, you're a visual artist.",
    "I would take this class. It provided an excellent broad introduction to Architecture. As a science major, I'm glad to have been able to experience something new and learn about a field that I really had no knowledge about. Although a lot of people say that the workload of the class is less, I wouldn't necessarily agree (especially if you're weak at drawing), that said, sketching can be pretty fun.",
    "I highly recommend both this class and this professor if you are at all interested in buildings and the evolution of architectural ideas.",
    "YES! It's a great course. Very enjoyable and pretty easy.",
    "Arch 150 is awesome if you enjoy drawing, playing with 3D models (like blocks\/lego\/glue\/cardboard\/blades), and challenging your perceptions on how to see things. If you consider yourself an artist, an architect, a creative thinker, or a student with any interest in creating human environments, this is a great class to try. The lecture is 70 students big, but the seminars are cut to 10 students or less. You get excellent attention from TAs and the professor is very friendly and wise. Have fun!",
    "Definitely take this class. I think it does a good job of introducing the subject of architecture and helping you to determine whether it is a path you might want to pursue at Yale. If you're not a sophomore, take it anyway, it's fascinating stuff."
