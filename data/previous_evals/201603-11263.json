   "comments": [
    "I learnt how to write coherent and clear mathematical proofs. I also learnt about algebraic structures which are very fascinating.",
    "This course covered group and ring theory in depth, drawing on examples from linear algebra and arithmetic to show how the theory we were learning was an abstraction of earlier topics. Professor Auel also gave us an overview of how group and ring theory would play into more specialized subjects in algebra.",
    "Abstract Algebra.",
    "I learned all sorts of things. This course, of all the classes I've ever taken, has been the biggest step up for me as a mathematician. I obviously learned about groups and rings a good deal; I also feel more confident in math in general. I have developed the skill of proof-writing and logical thinking. The title is accurate--the class forces students to think more abstractly, and less visually, than any previous maths.",
    "This class will definitely teach you abstract algebra, but be prepared for it to take over your semester.",
    "Matured as a mathematician, learnt a lot about abstract algebra.",
    "This was a very hard theoretical math class which really challenged my ability to understand a large amount of content quickly and see various relationships between objects. It also challenged me to understand and process complex concepts in a timely manner but taught me how to gain intuition into more theoretical, abstract topics.",
    "We learned mainly about groups and rings. Auel didn't teach how to write proofs, but those who survived the course learned how to through the process of trial and error. By the end of the course, I learned an insane amount of math and became much better at proofing.",
    "I gained an in-depth understanding of the course material, a better ability to write proofs and more efficient problem-solving skills.",
    "I feel better equipped to understand most general mathematics literature. To a lesser extent I feel prepared to understand contemporary mathematics research (but still more than before I took the course). In this sense, the course was a lot like a survey course.",
    "I'm a senior in applied math, so I took this course as a sort of final fling with pure mathematics before graduation. It was really enjoyable! I might take number theory in the spring because of this course (if it is being offered?)",
    "Lots!",
    "Abstract algebra is the first class where i relearned how to think critically. Absolutely the most eye opening class. After going through it all, I came out a stronger student in all regards.",
    "Beyond the requisite definitions and facts of abstract algebra, this class provided a nice overview of proof techniques (some old, some new), and was nicely supplemented with a brief history of abstract algebra and the role of mathematicians at Yale. It also made my understanding of a lot of topics, both familiar (fractions, matrix operations, etc) and unfamiliar (dihedral group, symmetric group), coherent under a common group\/ring structure.",
    "I learned about abstract algebra in detail, and I also improved my ability to write mathematical proofs and follow mathematical arguments. The course was very abstract, but it tied into a huge number of other fields (e.g. number theory, linear algebra, analysis, etc.), and it was always stimulating.",
    "I learned a ton of math (group theory, finite group theory, ring theory, and some module theory, etc.), but most importantly, improved tremendously in my ability to construct concise, logical proofs and write, learn, and breathe mathematics.",
    "Learned about groups",
    "I gained a great deal of mathematical intuition. My ability to think about abstract problems was built up. I also am now much more familiar with the proof-based format.",
    "I learned what the field of algebra is like; I learned lots of very useful foundations for further work in math.",
    "THe world is a different place after abstract algebra. To list any particular insight would be stupid, because your world view is changed.",
    "I was introduced to the field of abstract algebra. I hadn't had experience with algebra before this class and now I feel as though I have a good introduction to the basics of groups and rings.",
    "I learned the foundations of group and ring theory, as wells as how to write rigorous proofs in these subjects. I was able to see both the highly theoretical work of abstract algebra as wel as some of its applications into areas such as number theory.",
    "This is an excellent course, introducing a rigorous, proof-based approach to group theory\/rings. It taught me how to write proofs and think aboht mathematics on an abstract level, on how items in groups relate to each other and the structures they form.",
    "A strong introduction to abstract algebra.",
    "I developed a much more broad understanding of mathematics--not just abstract algebra, but math as a whole. The concepts taught in this class are applicable to so many fields of math, and Asher teaches them beautifully.",
    "I learned the material syllabus. Actually, we did not quite complete the original syllabus. This is not surprising given how slow the lectures usually seemed, but certainly could have been avoided by spending less time slogging through easy material. Early on, Prof. Auel emphasized that one of his goals was to teach proof-writing skills. I do not know what the average level of exposure to proof-writing across the entire class was at the onset, but coming from Math 230\/231 it seemed that the expectations were rather low. I certainly did not receive any feedback that improved my proof-writing skills. It seemed odd to me that all courses after 230\/231 were conducted with the assumption that you did not have that background.",
    "I learned a massive amount about abstract algebra, problem solving, and how to write better proofs. Overall, I strongly feel like this class helped me become a much better math student. One of the most difficult, but most rewarding classes I have taken at Yale. I don't think I've learned so much in any other class I've taken in college.",

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This class is great!",
    "Overall, this course was very well-taught. All of the material was clearly presented with pertinent examples. I think the main weakness is that we ran out of time at the end and didn't get to cover some topics originally on the syllabus. Since the first few classes were really a review of proof writing (induction, contradiction, etc.) which I think the class was already familiar with, I would have preferred to move into the material a bit more quickly and cover more in the end.",
    "We cover a lot of material, so it's hard to keep it all straight in your head.",
    "The class moved too slowly, we didn't cover modules at all.",
    "Strengths: Superb lectures Very helpful peer tutor Extremely interesting material Great textbook: easy-to-follow but also respectful of the reader's intellect Weaknesses: It's so hard!",
    "Covers a good amount of content that any aspiring mathematician should know. Problem sets were long and difficult but greatly facilitated learning.",
    "Professor Auel was a great teacher and lecturer. He does a great job explaining the complex concepts and answering questions. He is also very receptive to questions and suggestions and does a great job in understanding where the question is coming from and how to generalize certain questions to help the entire class without avoiding the original question.",
    "Strengths: the math is super interesting, the coolest stuff I've studied thus far. While the textbook (Dummit and Foote) is not always user-friendly, Auel is a fantastic teacher and his lectures are clear and enjoyable. Weaknesses: One word: WORKLOAD. The amount of work of this course justifies it being worth four credits. (That being said, if one goes to office hours, the peer tutor hours, and collaborates with others, the work can be much more manageable.) Be ready to be handed some problems that you can't solve given an infinite amount of time (your rate of progress will often be proportional to 1\/x^2 and will therefore not converge). Learn to swallow your pride and seek out help from others (together, you can get your productivity rate to 1\/x and maybe, just maybe 20 hours will be enough time for log(x) to reach the answer you need.)",
    "The course is large, which could be used as a strength (for example, we got a peer tutor). The online website for the course was invaluable, e.g. by listing the subjects covered in each lecture.",
    "Professor Auel was a strength of the course. In my time at Yale, every good math professor I have had has been a Gibbs Professor who thus does not get tenure at Yale. This is a real missed opportunity for Yale to improve the undergraduate STEM education.",
    "Really fantastic course! Prof Auel is the best math professor I have ever had. However, I would say that there was simply too much homework assigned for it all to be done thoughtfully and productively. It was clear that students who had seen the material before also had a massive leg up over those of us who were taking (INTRODUCTION TO) abstract algebra for the first time. I don't know how that coudl be fixed, but it sucked.",
    "This class is just plain hard, but there's no way around it. A different textbook would be beneficial. In all other regards, this class tops any other class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Math 350 is a phenomenal course and is structured in a very efficient way for student learning. Material is always interesting and engaging. One improvement could be taking time every once in a while to make sure the basic understanding of various \"strange\" concepts is hammered in; for example, the very elements of finitely generated ideals of a ring, and how to understand or know what constitutes relevant quotient rings, is something that featured prominently on the final yet was covered minimally in class. Intuition surely can help the student out with those things, but better yet for it to be covered in more detail.",
    "While it is certainly the case that one learns math through actually solving problems, I think that the problem sets could be slightly shorter (about 3\/4 in length) and still be just as educational. Even though I genuinely enjoyed learning the material, I do think that the issue might not only be the students' poor time management when a class group chat is very active until 5 am every Thursday night\/Friday morning.",
    "The course was really well-organized and well-taught, and although problem sets were extremely long, the system of starred and optional questions was very helpful. The schedule of quizzes was useful for forcing us to study the vast number of definitions before moving on to more complex topics. If anything, one weakness of the course might have been the assumed information sometimes quiz or homework problems assumed knowledge of the non-starred problem set questions, which I did not frequently have time to do, due to the sheer amount of time even just the mandatory questions required. There were also a few detailed topics from linear algebra (often to do with characteristic polynomials) that were assumed, and made very computational pset questions more manageable, but were unfamiliar to me (as well as other students) perhaps a link to some resource or textbook chapter might have been useful. But these are really minor complaints overall, the course was great.",
    "Abstract Algebra with Professor Auel was easily the best math class I have ever taken. It was extremely intensive, with consistently punishing problem sets, but at the end of it I feel that I have a stronger grasp of algebra than I have of any other subject I studied this semester. I would have appreciated spending more time on rings and perhaps touching on modules.",
    "I strongly feel that the problem sets were far too difficult. There were so many problems and they were rarely less difficult than \"hard\". But perhaps this is what made the class as rewarding as it was. I do wish there was one week where we could have just not had a problem set in the middle of the semester and not on a vacation so that we could catch up and ask questions that weren't related to the problem sets during office hours.",
    "Good, challenging homeworks",
    "Strengths: Auel is a great professor, the textbook is fantastic, the problems actually helped with learning. Weakness: the amount of work is overwhelming to the point of being not always being productive. Almost everyone I know in the class stayed up late Thursday nights trying to finish. I would recommend cutting the length of the problem sets by an extra 20%. I think that would improve the class experience for most people.",
    "Incredible teaching, great organization. I've never had such a devoted math professor. Asher Auel is a treasure, and math majors will be in a much worse place if he leaves. There's a lot of work, but I'm not sure that fact could be changed without making the course less edifying.",
    "Less homework. Actually, to be more precise, I mean less homework but harder questions that are not readily available online. Make people ACTUALLY do it. They don't actaully have to be harder because they were hard enough. It's just, make people think about them!",
    "I thought that a strength of the course was that it covered a large amount of material, getting me to a decent level of understanding in algebra without requiring much prior knowledge of algebra at all. I would say that the biggest weakness of the course was that it had students with a wide range of exposure to algebra, thus it was meant to challenge those with some background, making it very difficult for me, who had no background in algebra.",
    "The last couple weeks breezed through a lot of material. Typically that time is quite heavy in workload for a lot of classes, so it was difficult to keep up.",
    "Professor Auel's lectures are excellent and really made the difference in this course. The textbook was also a very helpful resource throughout the syllabus. It would be really nice if there were a section for this course, and I think it would have helped me not to accumulate points of confusion. That said, the sequence of the course is logical and the lectures very clear and engaging.",
    "This class was really epic. It covered a lot of material, and went in-depth into it all. The psets were challenging and really gave me a strong understanding of the material. Overall, spectacular class!",
    "The strength and weaknesses are addressed in my other responses. An easy change would be to not assign problems that didn't end up getting graded on psets that were already long and tedious. Given how rich a subject abstract algebra is, it would also have been nice to see more examples and problems that were not lifted straight from the book. As for the exams, I would have appreciated less true\/false and tabulation based problems. This is supposed to be a proof based class--shouldn't the exams reflect this? My guess is this was intended to make them easier to grade, but this is not a good design principle for a test. All it serves to do is leave more of the grading to chance. A class like this could also benefit from discussion sections (especially given how much material is covered). I think the best solution to many of these problems would be to have separate tracks for people with a stronger mathematical background. It doesn't make a lot of sense that all the courses that can be taken after 230\/231 are essentially a step down (at least in their expectations).",
    "The strengths of this class are that Professor Auel is incredible and you learn a ton in this class. The biggest weakness is that the workload is a bit ridiculous, and definitely hurt how much I learned in my other 3 classes, which was a little frustrating and disappointing. I think I would have learned just as much with a slightly more reasonable workload, and would have been able to gain more from my other classes and extracurricular commitments.",
    "occasionally hard to gain intuition, but that also comes from trying to condense a ton of material into one semester"

   "comments": [
    "All students who are interested in Mathematics should take this class. Absolutely fascinating.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in acquiring a deeper understanding of math. Group theory and ring theory have interesting, important applications to linear algebra and higher-level math. Professor Auel presented the material very well and the problem sets, while long, were instructive rather than tedious.",
    "This class is a LOT OF WORK!",
    "Professor Auel is very good at teaching (in that he makes it easy to grasp the concepts), but the class didn't move fast enough for my taste. The problem sets are very long and take a long time even if you already grasp the material.",
    "\"The official prerequisite is linear algebra... in reality, all that is required is a mature mathematical mind, some experience writing proofs, AND THE DESIRE TO WORK INCREDIBLY HARD.\" (The capitalization is mine.) This quotation is from the course website. Math 350 is the best math class--nay, the BEST class of ANY type I have EVER TAKEN. The course website is serious: you will work incredibly hard. But it is worth it! Remember: if you're even considering this course, you're at Yale and you've taken some math here already--you CAN do it, if you work hard enough. Will you?",
    "Take it! It'll be a huge struggle but it's worth it, especially if Asher Auel is teaching it.",
    "Take it. It will be difficult and problem sets will be long and sometimes tedious, but you will learn a lot.",
    "Many claim that pure math is often divided up into analysis (~calculus) and algebra; this course is a great introduction to the latter. This course shows how we can generalize many of the topics discussed in linear algebra which allows us to talk about beautiful relationships and symmetries between various mathematical structures. While the course is hard and a lot of work and certainly time intensive, Asher does a great job of explaining concepts and providing help when needed. It is definitely a challenging course, it is also extremely interesting and beautiful, and Asher is also a great professor who can passionately and clearly explain the course content.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this to anyone willing to put in the time. I didn't take the math 230-231 sequence, but I still survived this class and got a lot out of it. In short, you will learn a ton but that comes with the sacrifice of surrendering your entire being for a semester to a this class. Also, most non-math people will not understand why you're taking algebra again (\"Algebra? I took that in middle school!\"). It's very much worth the investment.",
    "Take it with Asher Auel.",
    "Take it. Pure math at its best: pure joy. Seriously though, this is a great course which will teach you to think in a completely different way. It will live up to its heavy course load reputation, but you will grow closer to your classmates and gain a great understanding of groups, rings and logic through this work. Also Asher is great. If you ever doubted the beauty of math, let this class prove you wrong.",
    "I think you have to take this course. I think it is probably going to suck and you are going to have to devote the most time to this course. You have to take it your sophomore year, even if you don't feel prepared (if you are a junior, better late than never). You truly do not need much to take this course (the more the better), except for a willingness to work hard (just like Auel says on his website).",
    "Yes, but be prepared to spend a ton of time on the homework! Like, a ton.",
    "Abstract algebra is the hardest course I've take at Yale. READ AHEAD and do problems ahead if possible. Working with other students is a must. Good luck, brace yourself. This is a wild ride, but it's worth it in the end. BEST CLASS AT YALE.",
    "Take the class-- it is one of the most engaging and interesting topics in mathematics I have ever studied, and Professor Auel is legendarily phenomenal.",
    "This course will take up much of your free time, but totally worth if you want to learn and groups + rings and if you are willing to put in the effort. I came out of it feeling not only accomplished but also much more confident in my mathematical and proof-writing abilities.",
    "350 with Professor Auel is a great course. Although it is a lot of work, it is extremely well-organized and well-taught, and provides a satisfying structure to unify a broad range of other topics (ranging from familiar ones, like fractions, functions, and matrix operations, to less familiar ones, like the dihedral and symmetric groups). Professor Auel also does a nice job of explaining concepts clearly, is very reasonable with regard to grading queries, and is helpful at office hours. He also provides a nice overview of the history of the subject (and Yales role in it), and shows the connections to other areas of mathematics. If you take this course, be warned that there are many, many definitions and facts, and it would be extremely useful to keep a running list\/study guide of things you prove in problem sets, as well as in class, as the year goes on. These will be very necessary on exams!",
    "Absolutely. No student should take this course unless they have a genuine interest in mathematics for its own sake, but if they do then they would be doing themselves an injustice not to take it. I found the subject matter thought-provoking and inspiring, and the teaching style was wonderful.",
    "Be prepared because this class is super hard all day and all night. Professor Auel is amazing but the class is SUPER hard.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student, particularly with Asher Auel. He is a gem of the Yale math department, and students should definitely engage with him while he is with us at Yale. The course is extremely difficult, and should be broached with caution, but I'm a non-math major and I think I did fine (fingers crossed!). The course will change the way you think. Abstract algebra is a beautiful subject, and it is presented carefully and effectively in this course. The course will leave you with a new appreciation for mathematics, and for anyone on the fence about majoring in math, it will probably convince you to do so! Also, if you're non-math, this stuff is really important for cryptography, advanced physics, etc. Take it!",
    "Yes!",
    "As you must have heard, professor Auel is fantastic. Take whatever class with him you can get. Abstract Algebra as a subject is beautiful and very interesting. Several of the topics are really hard to wrap your mind around, but you will emerge from this course a better mathematician. Be wary of the workload. P-sets were almost always upwards of 20 hours for me.",
    "I cannot recommend this course to a friend because after this course I do not think I have any friends anymore. Work hard any Asher Auel will act on the set of letter grades, admitting a trivial permutation representation $GradeInflation \\colon YourGrade \\to A$. Let me be more precise. Consider $MATH350=DesiredResult ActualOutcomes$ where $DesiredResult \\trianglelefteq MATH350$, but $ActualOutcomes \\not\\trianglelefteq MATH350$. It is clear that $ActualOutcomes \\cap DesiredResult = \\{e\\}$. This admits a homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon ActualOutcomes \\to \\Aut(DesiredResult)$, but note that the Sylow groups do not have the same order, and therefore $\\varphi$ is trivial; that is, all $x \\in ActualOutcomes$ map to the identity $e \\in DesiredResult$, as desired. \\hfill $\\blacksquare$. In all seriousness it was a good class. Put in the time and you will be fine.",
    "This course is challenging, but it is a great introduction to algebra. Math majors should definitely take this! Theoretical physicists should as well as the first half of the course is on groups (very important in theoretical physics).",
    "MATH 350 is an essential course for math majors. It is definitely challenging, but the material covered is interesting.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in math (who is either a math major or willing to put a lot of time into a math class). While it is a lot of work, the class is extremely interesting and rewarding for anyone who wants to learn theoretical mathematics.",
    "Yes, if you are driven and ideally if you have some experience in proof based math.",
    "The content is fascinating and the course is well organized. In the end most depends on your willingness to work hard and your ability to find other people to collaborate with.",
    "I'd strongly recommend this class. Asher Auel is an amazing professor, and he definitely makes the class challenging. Be aware that the problem sets will take time, and be very tough, so make sure to find a group of people to work with. However, I've emerged from this class with a much, much stronger grasp of mathematics--and I'd urge anyone with an interest in pure math to take this class.",
    "It depends on the student and his\/her mathematical background. I can best speak to the case of someone with a similar background to me. I took Math 230\/231 the year before and this class felt like a step down. I found that the work in this course was easier than 230\/231 (and less satisfying). However, the psets were very long, and often large portions were not graded (but we did not know in advance exactly what would be). This was frustrating since it forced me to sink large amounts of time writing up easy problems for no discernible reason. That said, the material is very interesting (and essential to math majors), but it could have been better packaged.",
    "This class is amazing. You will learn a ton and become a better math student as a result. However, if Professor Auel is teaching it, the workload is quite serious, and should be taken into consideration. The high workload in this class definitely detracted from my experiences in my other classes. But if you love math and have a schedule that can handle the workload, then I would highly recommend this class. Professor Auel is amazing and the material is quite interesting. This class also prepares you for a variety of other extremely interesting math classes.",
