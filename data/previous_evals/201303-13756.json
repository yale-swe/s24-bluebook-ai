   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Break the ground to introduce economics theory such as supply demand, market structure, health economics and social welfare. Well structured.Weaknesses: The class could have covered more material if it had been scheduled twice a week.",
    "Weaknesses - the textbook is hard to understand and doesn't include all the material (ex: insurance)Strengths - challenging material but interesting topics and class lectures.",
    "I thought that the lectures were very effective, especially the examples and working out problems. However notes were sometimes difficult to follow looking at them retrospectively. I also expected less of the very basics and more qualitative links to healthcare",
    "I walked into this course with no econ knowledge and walked out with a strong appreciation for the subject.This was my favorite course I have ever taken.It was challenging but interesting and very relevant. I would recommend this course to ALL students not just HCM\/HPM students (though I enjoyed the small class size very much).",
    "The course clearly teaches us the economics of healthcare. It is a very interesting class.It would be better for students to cope if econ was taught like epi, twice a week and short homework each week with more TAs to help weak students grasp fundamental concepts.",
    "The beginning of the semester was very difficult. For someone who had never taken an econ class before, I felt lost for the first few weeks. The homework was difficult, but in the end I think that I learned a lot.",
    "Great class! Fun way to learn some more econ!",
    "This is an intro to microeconomics. that should have more of a healthcare basis. You need to have been an econ major to opt out, but anyone with an intro econ class could have breezed through the first half of the course.",
    "This course would be improved by having shorter, more frequent homework assignments for practice.",
    "useful to gain a basic idea of economics",
    "very good course, difficult, but learned a lot",
    "Coming into this course without any prior economics training, I am aware that I learned an incredible amount over the course of the semester. I think that the class was well taught (assuming you understand economics vocabulary-the first couple weeks were a bit of a struggle), and I think that the lecture followed the assigned readings well. I think that the major weakness of the course was the scheduling. I would have gotten a lot more out of the course if it was offered more than one day per week with a shorter class period. I found it hard to absorb all of the information in the 2 hour class session and would lose understanding between classes.",
    "I really liked the course, it provided a good overview of microeconomics and then related that well to healthcare. I thought that the class was much more qualitative than qualitative which seemed very appropriate and which added a lot of value to the course.",
    "Good for improvement on quantitative skill.",
    "Excellent foundation course for an introduction to microeconomics.",
    "Great professor, hugely important material, good textbook, relevant assignments -- but we only had class once a week! For a foundational course! That was really unacceptable, to the point where we hardly remembered last week's material by the start of friday class. I believe they're changing that, but it was hard not to feel totally screwed over by having Epidemiology 3 times a week but only getting the occasional lecture in Economics. That imbalance is my number one complaint about this past semester, and a lot of us feel we truly missed out on an essential learning opportunity.Put in as much energy and effort as you can, this is the most important class of the semester for HMP students. Also get to know Professor Moore, he's a really cool guy and definitely knows his stuff.",
    "Useful course. Recommend it",
    "Great introduction to micro-economics and fun lecture",
    "I'm not sure how this required course will help me in the future.",
    "This course is overall ok. In the beginning, the course was very bad because Professor Moore moved too quickly was more concerned about tardy students than about teaching at an appropriate pace. Later on in the course, Professor Moore grew happier and his teaching showed. He started to tie in examples from the healthcare industry and that helped us to understand the material better. So on the whole, the course became better.",
    "I thought the class could have been structured better. It may be beneficial to add a section component taught by a TA.",
    "Major weakness was that the healthcare aspect was not emphasized till the very end of the course.",
    "1. Better organization of the class.2. Do not move the final exam up a week a month before finals3. Hire better TAs4.",
    "The material taught in this course is useful, but is taught at such an accelerated pace that you are uncertain if you understand the basics. This course states that it is for the novice, but in class we are literally covering 1-2 chapters at a time. The class was not very well organized, and the professor did not always appear to be well accessible. The homeworks had incomplete and sometimes error prone answer keys which can be very problematic for those with no economics background. This course is useful but could benefit from tearing down the existing structure and starting over again from scratch.",
    "This course gave a very good overview of basic microeconomics, with an emphasis on those topics important in understanding the economics of healthcare at various levels.Here are some points about the course:1) Dr. Moore was a good lecturer. He was clear and focused on important points. He sometimes went very fast though, which was somewhat confusing.2) The book was very good - clear and easy to read.3) However, the organization of the course seemed to fall apart by the end of the term. The \"mid-term\" was pushed back and came very late in the semester, so it contained most of the material in the class. In addition, we had two of the last classes within 3 days of the final exam, so there was not very much time to get a good grasp of that material or even understand at what level we should understand the material from the last 2 classes.4) We only had 4 \"problem sets\" - which had different formats and different kinds of content and changing due dates - this made it somewhat confusing as to what was important to learn from different lectures\/chapters and at what level were were expected to understand the material.My recommendations from this course in the future are:1) Give more regular problem sets - have a few basic problems (from the basic material that we should know) due for each section\/chapter before class each week or every other week.2) \"Quiz early and often\" - maybe give a 10-20 minute quiz each week or every other week, at the start of class, on the very basic concepts covered in each section\/chapter - this would also cause more people to come to class and to be on time, and it would give more foundation on which to base grades (but it would add more work for the TAs to grade).3) Have the mid-term earlier and don't move it back if at all possible.",
    "I think we went over and learned a lot of information in a short period of time. I would rather have learned less information in more detail and understanding.",
    "Good course!",
    "Weaknesses:there were no power point slides (please provide slides), graphs were permanently drawn\/erased during classthe lectures did not seem to be well structured",
    "Definitely learned a lot, but was all as a result of personal study and self- teaching.Found the instructor unapproachable. The classes made the material appear more difficult than it actually was.",
    "Overall, it is a solid course. PPT, especially of useful graphs, that can be accessed on classes v2 would been helpful.",
    "Too early in the morning, but an interesting class that should prove useful.",
    "Good course. Provides an general introduction to economics. It might be hard for students that do not have an economics background, but the teacher and TAs helped us to better understand the material.Weaknesses-the TAs were a bit disorganized with their office hours. They kept changing them and not always informed us about it.",
    "Came in with no econ background and really appreciated the healthcare focus of the class. Made the examples much easier to comprehend. Exams are much more qualitative than quantitative, which I appreciated, and really tested that you knew the concepts behind the econ. Got pretty lost in class sometimes though, I think the material is presented in a more complicated way than necessary. Good textbook.",
    "I am biased because I enjoy Econ in generally. The lecture was very fast paced --Too fast. This was a no texting or surfing the web kind of class because you can easily get lost.The assignments were fair.The midterm was not what many students expected.",
    "The course topic is challenging but Dr. Moore and the TAs do their best to make it a manageable amount of information."

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Strengths: I love Michael for his intelligence, easiness to approach and clear understanding of economic topics. He has a talent to present economic theories and how it is related to consumer behavior, policy making and market dynamics.He could have scheduled more classes...",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0I wish I had gone to more office hours! At first Prof. Moore was a little intimidating; however, by the end of the semester I found this class to be my favorite. He is engaging, funny, tells great stories that help you to remember the material clearly. Has excellent command of the material and enjoys what he does.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore was a great lecturer and I enjoyed going to his class despite it being early on a Friday morning. I thought his notes could have been clearer and some powerpoints may have helped.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore is a phenomenal professor. He is extremely knowledeable and passionate about the subject which in turn makes his students excited about the subject. Though I approached the early morning with ambivalence earlier in the semester, towards the end I looked forward to every lecture.He is a bit intimidating at first, but I understand it was to set some level of precedence.In fact, I believe it made me work harder and come prepared for every class.Thank you for such an amazing course.Professor Moore, you need to teach more economic courses here at Yale!",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor teaches too quickly and expects the students to be able to understand his material immediately. I think he forgets that most of us have never done econs before, let alone know what econ even is. He should slow his pace down.I was disappointed with the scheduling of classes, according to the original syllabus we were to learn oligopoly and game theory but in the end, we did not have time to cover the content we were supposed to learn. That made me felt shortchanged in my education here.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0The instructor went through information very fast in the beginning, but when things began to make more sense, the lectures became very interesting.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Michael was a really interesting lecturer, especially at 8:30 am!",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0This course is very important for health policy and management students, which is why it was such a disappointment to me that it was so poorly taught. We had three problem sets for which we received no feedback. We had a lecture covering 25% of the material we would be tested on less than 24 hours before the exam. Thank god I had evan a bit of background in economics because otherwise this would have been a disaster. He also gave repetitive problem sets that in my opinion causes more stress than necessary.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore is so smart and I know he's a good guy, but he's a terrible lecturer. He's great one-on-one, but something happens when he's in a large group.. The entire class he just draws dozens of charts assuming you're on the same page as him. This didn't feel like an introductory economics class. I had to resort to YouTube to really learn the material on my speed.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0I am so happy that he instructor emhasizes on the understanding ofeconomic concepts not memorizing. But, I hope the instructor could use powerpoint or write bigger notes on the blackboard during class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0very good lecturer, averse to using powerpoint, but still very good with explanations",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore was a good instructor. I like that he wrote out notes and graphs and always seemed to be well prepared for class. I think he could have moved a little more slowly at the beginning, but it was definitely possible to catch up over time. I think that he has good rapport with his students and cares a lot about teaching.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Did a great job, very accessible. Lectures were well prepared and he engaged with the class well.",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Excellent teacher",

This is a relationship where the more you put in, the more you get out -- and this is definitely the right guy to start you off on a professional-caliber understanding of economics. Big fan!",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Superb at explaining concepts and keeping students engaged",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0At the beginning of the semester, Professor Moore was my least favorite professor because he moved too quickly through the material and he was intimidating and mean. He gave a bad stare to anyone who was at least a minute late to class. As the semester progressed, he became noticeably happier and he even taught better because of that. He finally tied in examples fromthe healthcare industry and that really helped us to grasp the material.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0intelligent, may be intimidating at first but very genuine on wanting his students to learn how to approach problems with an economist perspective",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0He improved as the course went along; I felt like the entire course should have been last his last few lectures, slow, thorough presentations of the concepts.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Gets angry if you are late to class",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0The instructor was initially very unapproachable, which improved over time. He taught difficult material in a difficult way. Even easy material was taught in a difficult and confusing way. I do not feel that this was done on purpose, it was likely that Dr. Moore did not realize that most students did not understand what he was teaching, especially since initially some students felt that he was putting others\"on the spot\" when they asked questions, which further led to others not wanting to ask questions. His teaching may have been better if he could have used powerpoints to teach. Many students stopped coming to class because they could not see what he was writing on the board. In this 20th century, he needs to find a more reasonable method to get his teaching across outside of writing all his notes on the board in microscopic print. Dr. Moore knows his material well, but needs to find a better way of teaching in a reasonable paced and efficient way.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore is very knowledgeable in this area. He is a good lecturer - he is clear and focuses on important concepts - and he made the course very relevant to healthcare economics. However, he sometimes went very fast, which ended up leaving some areas confusing. Dr. Moore is also somewhat irritable at times - getting mad if people come to class a few minutes late (which happens in all classes) and not always open to all questions.",

    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Amazing professor, very engaging method of instruction.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Professor Moore is great in person, very accomodating with answering emails and being available. As a lecturer, he can be a little difficult to follow. Definitely has his favorites in the class, not sure why participation in class counts because it's not very dynamic.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Moore moves very quickly. Too quickly for the majority of the class. He is very personable during office hours.",
    "Instructor: Michael Joseph Moore \u00a0Dr. Moore does his best to connect with students though this semester it was a bit of a challenge because primary office hours were during a required course for the majority of the class. Given this, we hit our stride a little later in the semester. Overall, I found him a clear lecturer and interested in class participation."

    "This course gave a very goodoverview of basic microeconomics, with an emphasis on those topics important in understanding the economics of healthcare at various levels.Here are some points about the course:1) Dr. Moore was a good lecturer. He was clear and focused on important points. He sometimes went very fast though, which was somewhat confusing.2) The book was very good - clear and easy to read.3) However, the organization of the course seemed to fall apart by the end of the term. The \"mid-term\" was pushed back and came very late in the semester, so it contained most of the material in the class. In addition, we had two of the last classes within 3 days of the final exam, so there was not very much time to get a good grasp of that material or even understand at what level we should understand the material from the last 2 classes.4) We only had 4 \"problem sets\" - which had different formats and different kinds of content and changing due dates - this made it somewhat confusing as to what was important to learn from different lectures\/chapters and at what level were were expected to understand the material.My recommendations from this course in the future are:1) Give more regular problem sets - have a few basic problems (from the basic material that we should know) due for each section\/chapter before class each week or every other week.2) \"Quiz early and often\" - maybe give a 10-20 minute quiz each week or every other week, at the start of class, on the very basic concepts covered in each section\/chapter - this would also cause more people to come to class and to be on time, and it would give more foundation on which to base grades (but it would add more work for the TAs to grade).3) Have the mid-term earlier and don't move it back if at all possible.",
    "Introductory microeconomics course, you go through a lot of information in a short period of time. I would rather have learned less information in more detail and understanding.",
    "Definitely recommend the course!",
    "I would not recommend this course.",
    "I would recommend it to all public health students. A basic economics knowledge is very useful regardless of your area of interest. It can be challenging, especially if you have no economics background, but the TA and professors are very willing to help out.",
    "Good for those who have never taken econ before. If you have, you will be bored. The healthcare focus mostly makes the concepts easier to understand, you won't get anything new out of econ with the additional focus.",
    "Econ is a very marketable class. The content is very rich. I would recommend this class to students because if makes the world more understandable."
