   "comments": [
    "Thinking philosophically and reading analytically. I didn't know anything about Zen Buddhism before the course and came out of the class understanding that it's a very complex religion. I am no Zen master, but I know more than when I started.",
    "Very different from other courses as a social sciences major - different approach to thinking about history which was engaging and interesting but at times frustrating, as there were no real \"answers\" most of the time, but many questions.",
    "A soon as by the end of the first seminar, I realized that my pre-conceived notions of an entire religion were entirely off of the mark. I don't see myself having learned any of this information in such depth on my own later in life, either.",
    "I was able to walk away from this course with an understanding of Zen as a distinct practice within Buddhism. I also learned how to discuss and read Zen ideas, and to think and write about the tradition in a way I had previously not been able to.",
    "I learned how to think about religions that have come to prominence in cultural contexts very different from my own American upbringing. Learning the history of Zen Buddhism from Buddhism and Chinese intellectual traditions made the religion easier to understand in many ways, and showed the importance of not simply taking something like Zen at face value, because often there are so many layers of meaning that, from a Western point of view, are hidden.",
    "Got to read plenty of primary Zen Buddhist texts, as well as contemporary depictions and writings about Zen. Came away with an understanding of Zen doctrine and its institutional and historical context, both in East Asia and as it's come to be represented in the West.",
    "I knew very little about Zen Buddhism, or Buddhism at all before taking this course. In this course, students read and discuss primary source material which really allows them to learn about the religion.",
    "Hm. I'd say the biggest thing I learned was probably how to interpret text and draw conclusions across them, which was probably not the main goal of the course. I did learn about Zen\/Buddhist philosophy and its overall \"tensions.\" I learned how to ask lots of questions but not really how to answer them."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Unlike any other class I have taken before in that you are learning a doctrine that teaches a different approach to living. Class discussion was great. Professor Greene is awesome. The workload is perfect. Weaknesses - I know it goes against the grain to try to define Zen because that's not what it is all about, but I wish at the end we could have discussed what each of us thought Zen Buddhism was and its core principles.",
    "Weekly reading response were sometimes frustrating, as the readings could be difficult to understand and therefore respond to questions about, but the readings were mostly interesting and it was good to go over them in class. Having a student present each week was also sometimes challenging, as we got to know the student(s)' interpretations of the readings more so than the \"correct\" or more widely accepted interpretations (except for the few minutes professor Greene discussed the readings the next week).",
    "The weekly reading responses really kept me engaged with actually learning and not stressing so much about only taking the final. Great structure for a course.",
    "The course was good. Enough assignments to keep students engaged with the readings, while still being amnageable in terms of workload. Good discussions each week, too.",
    "I really enjoyed the primary sources, as they forced me to figure out many of the ideas directly from their (translated) source. Weekly essays were a good way to stay on top of the material. Sometimes discussion (when student led) was a bit disjointed, even though it was all part of a collaborative learning process.",
    "Weekly reading responses were a good workload to have. A final paper might have been more interesting and engaging than a final exams, since there was so much material to work with, and so many areas of potential study one could focus on. Classroom discussions also often felt like they could have gone further and deeper, though that's mostly up to the students. Maybe some of the scholarly secondary readings could have been made compulsory, to give students a better sense of the ideal level of analysis.",
    "Strengths: Professor Greene is great - very knowledgeable, enthusiastic about teaching, and accessible. In class discussions were very interesting, and useful as the texts require discussion and debate to understand. Weaknesses: I wish Professor Greene spent a little more time \"lecturing\" in class, as often I found myself wanting to hear more of his input on the topic to add to the in-class discussion.",
    "I'd say a strength was the weekly paper structure, since it kind of forced you to do the reading since you couldn't look up the answers online. I liked being held accountable for the reading. It also spurred us to answer questions in class, since we had all already thought about the material. I liked the films he showed, since they were funny and gave us an idea of Buddhism in the real world. I think the major weakness was that some of us didn't really know enough about Buddhism to get that much out of it. A lot of the time I was left wondering about basic tenets of the religion, and I didn't really get the big picture about what Buddhism actually looks like. I did learn some things about Zen philosophy overall, but I don't think this class should be offered to people with no knowledge of Buddhism."

   "comments": [
    "YES! Zen Buddhism is great, and Professor Greene is chill, funny, and cares about his students. You may think you know Buddhism, but Zen is one of a kind. You may not come out of this class as a Zen master - you would need a transmission of some sorts to get that title, but you will have a lot of fun learning about it. The readings are from primary sources so you get to look at what Zen scholars read. The workload is also chill. There's a medium amount of reading and a 700 word reading response each week. This semester, each person led class discussions once in the semester, and it was nice discussing topics where no one is going to hate on each other if you disagree. Because it's Zen.",
    "Good introduction to Zen, which is more different from traditional Buddhism than one might think. Thought-provoking, though often challenging and a bit frustrating as we were never really given the \"right\" answers. Though I did definitely learn about Zen thought and practice, which is fairly different from its contemporary connotation.",
    "Every Yale College student should experience this course. A fisherman set out upon the sea. At the bottom of his ship, there was a hole quickly letting water into the hull. If he were to plug the hole with his finger, he wouldnt be able to steer the boat. If he were to ignore the hole, the sinking vessel would pull him under. The fisherman set his ship ablaze. When asked by the fishmonger why he set fire to his livelihood, the fisherman asked for a cigarette. Verse: The ship is hardly seaworthy, Blind sailing is death, Holes weigh down the Dharma Vehicle, Shall you tread the water?",
    "Would absolutely recommend. Professor Greene is a must-have professor at least one while at Yale.",
    "Yes. Professor Greene is engaging and interesting, and the subject of Zen is one that is so often misrepresented in Western literature, so learning abot the true history of it is important to understanding what Zen is, and how that is definied differently from Western perceptions.",
    "A good introduction to the ideas (with a bit of practice) of Zen Buddhism, with about a third of the semester devoted to laying foundations in buddhism, confucianism, and daoism. I found the readings (though occasionally dense) fascinating, and the weekly essays helped guide our understanding. Very reasonable workload and professor greene is great.",
    "A decent class to take if you just want to learn more about Zen Buddhist doctrine and its historical and institutional context. Not so much if you want to learn about Zen Buddhist practice - maybe go for a retreat instead. Workload is pretty chill at one reading response a week, but for some weeks you should probably also do the secondary readings if you want to get most out of this course. The level of classroom discussion varies, as with all seminars. If you're already somewhat familiar with Buddhism, you might be a little bored at the start, but things quickly get interesting as you read all the wackiness that goes on in Zen primary texts.",
    "Yes! Zen Buddhism is very interesting, and this course teaches it well. I found in-class discussions to be illuminating, and the material very interesting.",
    "Yeah! Overall, I had a great time in the class! I really enjoyed the structure of the course, and professor greene was really nice and great at leading discussion. I ddn't think I came away with much knowledge of Buddhism, but I did learn SOMETHING. Even though the seminar was 2 hours, I didn't think it felt that long, and I enjoyed being puzzled by the lack of answers we found. That said, I would've liked more background knowledge on Buddhism, and I think that would've been more effective to have before going into this course."
