    "It was a decent course, but was almost identical to L2.",
    "French 130 is a good review of basic french grammar. None of the ideas are very complex and a good amount of class is spent going over the material, ensuring that you know what you are doing. The books were good and definitely readable if you've been placed into the course. Vysosias is a good lecturer. Also it's very important to participate in class. I would recommend you take this course if you need to get your requirements out of the way or you actually want to learn some french.",
    "I would summarize it as necessary to fulfill Yale's language requirement. It was good enough. I liked the books and films, I would recommend the course.",
    "Yale has an awesome french department, L1 and L2 are both taught incredibly well. L3 takes a bit of a dip in quality, and seems to focus more on perfecting old french, than teaching new french. (Vocabulary words not included - these are very new). Overall the class is fine if you get a good teacher (I didn't have her but I've heard widely that Burton is great, and I had Ngame for L2 and he is phenomenal) but not anything special. I would recommend it if you need to get your language credit done, or if you are willing to use L3 as a stepping stone to more interesting french classes, the higher level ones are supposed to be incredible. That said, I wouldn't expect to adore L3 for it's own merit.",
    "If you wish to complete your language requirements at Yale I would highly recommend Fren 130. But, there are biweekly tests at a location other than the normal classroom and a lot of nightly homework.",
    "I would recommend this course for anyone ready for level 3. I think you need to certainly know a good deal of french to be in the class but if you are prepared it's very manageable an fun.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in French. It takes continuous effort but definitely worth it."
