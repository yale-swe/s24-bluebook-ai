   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would. I'd say this is a good course if you want to learn how to work with primary sources, build your argument and ask theoretical questions.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student because I think that it acts as a form of graduate school boot camp, giving people a good starting framework for going about finding their own projects. I would summarize the course as \"a survey of different ways of establishing discourse around sacred space in Asia, where the students are asked to contribute to the discourse through their own independent research project.\"",
    "This course is primarily a research and methods course with the ability to show students ways to think about place and sacredness. I would recommend the course to another student, because these are good things for a scholar of religion to study and be aware of.",
    "This is a course focusing on religious sites in Asia. It is very useful for you to build a theoretic framework to examine sacred places.",
    "Would recommend this class to any student who is interested in the religious studies of East Asia, and is interested in learning how to develop one's own academic project.",
    "Sacred Place in Asia is about how sacred place is established in Asia, but it is equally about how we as scholars approach those sacred places and the concept of sacred place. In this way it works on several levels, ranging from the physical places in Asia themselves to the conceptual mind of the 'western' scholars studying them. I would recommend this class highly, as much for Koichi's pedagogical style as for the content."

   "comments": [
    "I believe this course is very important for my future research, and it definitely teaches you at least one of the approaches to study religions, history, etc.",
    "The course itself introduced me to different theoretical approaches to analyzing sacred space. The project that I did has forced me to read a large swath of material related to my research interests and therefore the course created space for me to deepen\/broaden my knowledge base.",
    "This course was very beneficial to me because it deepened my knowledge both of how other scholars talk about sacredness and place, and of different specific sacred places which I can now use as comparisons and examples in interpreting my own interests.",
    "I am interested in Buddhism and its impact on Chinese literature, and this course helps me get a better sense how the field of religious study is going on, and provides a different perspective for me to look at Buddhism other than from literary texts.",
    "It's always mind-opening to see approaches other than those one's already familiar with, and this course has served this course excellently.",
    "This course taught me a great deal about both sacred place in Asia and how work in religious studies is done. In addition, I learned from experience the sort of rigor that ought to go into any such study, which was far greater than I had been familiar with before. I think that this course will have a lasting effect upon the shape of my work in the future."
