   "comments": [
    "This was a good course that overviews the area of Materials Chemistry. However, it would be helpful to have a strong chemistry background prior to taking this course.",
    "This is an excellent survey of materials chemistry, including crystals, polymers, nanomaterials, and characterization. The textbook does a great job of exposing you to a huge variety of concepts, without going into tedious depth with lots of fundamentals or derivations. The class was conducted as a discussion of the textbook, which set a nice pace, and allows you to go in depth on the concepts you find interesting while still covering a huge swath of material. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "It is a good course for anyone aimed to do research related to materials chemistry. Because from the course the student can gain a general and clear view of the field of materials chemistry."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a good introduction to the subject area, but could be described as a mile wide and an inch deep. I certainly would not deem myself an expert in this space, but I think this course gave enough introduction to these areas that will prove very helpful.",
    "This course did an excellent job introducing many concepts, especially in the topic of characterization, familiarizing me with things I had not heard of so I will be able to feel more comfortable when I come across them in literature or my research. I feel that the class did a great job widening my technical knowledge, setting the groundwork for understanding the concepts more deeply when I come across them again.",
    "The course provides an outline for the field of materials chemistry, which is the most difficult thing for one to get by him\/her self. This is also the most important thing for me."
