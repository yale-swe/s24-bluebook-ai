    "This course was excellent. Of all my course this semester, I felt like this was the most valuable. Strengths: well structured, assignments were well designed to engage with material and foster discussion (as were lectures). I really felt like class discussion helped us think through material critically.",

    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Dr. Lichtman undoubtedly knows this material and her reputation and resume precedes her. It shows over the course of the semester how much she knows about the research and the context of research about heart disease and stroke. The only weakness is that she comes across as a bit intimidating with the expectation to contribute meaningful discussion in class at a level of analysis that students just learning about this topic may not be able to offer.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Excellent lecturer and very good at fostering class discussion.",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Strengths: understanding , passionate about the material, good feedback",
    "Instructor: Judith Hilevi Lichtman \u00a0Awesome teacher. She is very patient with students' questions and would continuously challenge us to think critically about the implications and roots of CVD events and their related risk factors."
