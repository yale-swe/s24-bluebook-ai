   "comments": [
    "Dutch 110 is a fantastic class. Yale students are very fortunate to have the opportunity to learn Dutch, since it is so rarely taught in the US. The Dutch program here is strong and is growing even stronger, at least in part because most students who take it have a true personal connection to Dutch culture and care about learning it well. I can't wait to take Dutch 120 next semester and then test out my new skills in the Netherlands this summer!",
    "Bonny makes each class really interesting and fun. While some question the choice of Dutch as a language it relates closely to many others and is really interesting and not too complex. The class does however suffer from a lack of structure, but that is the way that Bonny teaches and over all it is a fun class to take.",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who is not invested in learning the language in a speedy manner. If learning about the culture, while learning little bits of the language on the side, is what interests you, then take the course. If you want to be semi-fluent by year 2, find a different course."
