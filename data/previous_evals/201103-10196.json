    "Overall an extremely fulfilling course. Introduced us to the globalization debates and very interesting and relevant theoretical material and then case studies. Class was always interesting and Kamari led the course very well. The workload was perfectly manageable and I learned a lot from the weekly reading responses and final paper. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "Useful background for people interested in anthropological analysis and also interdisciplinary work. The issues brought up in the course were challenging but useful.",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend the course to another student."
