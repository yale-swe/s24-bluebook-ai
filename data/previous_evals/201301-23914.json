    "I was not entirely sure what to expect but I was happy that you were both receptive to all of our various perspectives. I very much liked doing the research of Havana and was pleased with our site model. All in all I enjoyed the studio but would have liked to have meetings (in some form) twice a week.",
    "Given the compelling prompt, I expected that the studio would more intimately develop arguments for different approaches to housing in Havana. Unfortunately, the studio defaulted to think about housing and design in conventional means. I think that a more exploratory approach would have benefitted the projects and the development of ideas in this studio.The projects would have benefited from outside criticism at points other than mid-review and final. Additionally, the critics should make better attempts to spend equal amounts of time with each student.",
    "All my expectations were met for this studio. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the method of designing for different sites but also think it would be nice to see different proposals for the same site.",
    "I had high expectations and they were met"
