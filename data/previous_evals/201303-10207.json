    "Sure, just be ready to write the essays alot like you would analyze literature. If you are interested take it for sure, if you aren;t sure whether you will like Film Studies or not, take it to see - its survivable even if you won't love it (if you end up not liking film studies)",
    "I would recommend the lectures, and I don't know how the other sections are, but I would strongly recommend avoiding my section.",
    "Film Studies is a broad overview of film basics and history. You get to watch a variety of films that span time and genre. You learn filming terms, film history, and a little theory. I would definitely recommend this class to a student, especially if they need a humanities or writing credit. It's fun.",
    "It's a really interesting introduction to film for both casual fans and prospective majors. Most of the movies are fairly important and things you definitely ought to see. The articles and readings can be dense but are usually insightful. Professor MacKay is excellent; super passionate, virtually a filmic encyclopedia, and don't be afraid to talk to him! Sometimes the content feels a little overly technical or specific, but generally it's useful and relevant.",
    "The lectures are interesting but the movies often aren't. If you are looking for a class that watches a bunch of block busters, this isn't it. You likely won't have heard of most of the movies we watch, but that doesn't mean they're bad! The class will give you a general sense of film studies, but it is A LOT of movies (four hours every Tuesday).",
    "Film studies was a great course, although it is a big time commitment (class + film screenings + section), but if you like watching films, it doesn't feel like a commitment. This course covers a lot of the main themes in film studies: sound, editing, cinematography, animation, digital cinema. You get a really good foundation by taking this course. However, this class almost always went over, so do not schedule a class immediately after this.",
    "Yes, but only if you are interested in the major.",
    "Definitely!!",
    "Interesting class if you like film, but not a knock out of the park.",
    "The paper grading is not too difficult. Not much work-- the only thing I would keep in mind is that there are mandatory 4-hour screenings every Tuesday.",
    "FILM 150 is an AWESOME class! I really loved it. It was one of my favorite classes of the semester. The topics that are discussed are really interesting. The screenings are great (both mandatory and additional). Section was fantastic! I learned a lot from this course and I really, really loved taking it. Professor MacKay is an amazing lecturer and really loves talking about film and the concepts that surround it. Intro to Film is an AWESOME class. Take it!",
    "Take this course if you're interested in film.",
    "You don't learn much from the lectures as taught by mackay, but the class is worth taking just for the movies. Some of them (like Yi Yi) are amazing. The actual work for the class is relatively minimal, but overall you will put in a lot of time. Film screenings can run as long as 3 hours (usually two feature length movies on a row).nobody does the readings, which are quite dense and theoretical.",
    "Film theory might be different from what you expect, but if you are interested in it, you'll enjoy this course",
    "An overview of film history, theory, and practice from the beginning of film to the present day. I highly recommend this course\u00e2\u0080\u0094it's among the best I've ever taken.",
    "It is a good place to start seriously learning about films. Prof. MacKay is very passionate about the subject (especially soviet cinema) but his mind wanders at times during lecture. The first half up to the midterm paper focuses on the more technical aspects such as camera movements etc. and that was my favorite part of the course. There was a lot of work, including weekly screenings of usually one short and one feature film (occasionally two feature films that lasted up to 3-3.5 hours but hey, it's still shorter than any of the Lord of the Rings movie). You get to watch some truly amazing films, many even on 35mm!",
    "A great introduction to film. It really gives you a solid foundation of material that allows you to view films in a new way. Even if you're not thinking about going into film studies, I recommend the course because films are a large part of our lives, and to be able to be informed about them and analyze them in a new way, I think, is really helpful. The professor was great and the work was fine. You do have to put in a little more time to watch the movies, but watching movies certainly beats work. The films we watch are all relevant and just films that everyone should watch in general. I really enjoyed the course.",
    "FILM 150 is an amazing entry level course for film students. I'd recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about film and get more information on what makes a movie truly great. We screen beautiful films (on 35mm!) and have such interesting discussions on theory, industry, history, cinematography, etc etc. Also Professor MacKay is the bomb - a Canadian-born professor specializing in Soviet propaganda film? Count me in.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who needs a WR and also has a love for film.",
    "I would recommend Film Studies for students who know they are interested in film and want to learn more about film theory. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is on the fence about taking it or doesn't have a strong reason for taking it. It requires a lot of work and time, and therefore someone should really be invested in the course for it to be worthwhile.",
    "The class is pretty good: you get to see some great films and get to think about films in an entirely new light if you've never analyzed them before. But there are a few things that should be worked on: Prof. Mackay, although completely devoted to the class and very excited to teach students everything, tends to wander all over the place when it comes to his lectures. He often goes over time as well, which can get annoying, especially if you have another class afterwards. Also, there are often double features (two long movies in one night) for each screening so make sure you can devote time to it. Also, make sure that you get a decent TA for section. It can easily be hit or miss and section can end up being very awkward. But if you really love film\/want to take a film course at Yale, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would recommend this course. I enjoyed it, and I definitely learned a lot about film. You do watch movies every week for this course, which is, of course, a little time consuming (7 to 10 or 11 o'clock on Tuesday night for us), and the extra section was an hour and felt totally useless. But the class itself is good, and Professor MacKay was great.",
    "Professor MacKay's enthusiasm in lectures is always refreshing. This is a good class that will expose you to a lot of great films and ideas, but the readings are a lot if you plan to keep on top of them.",
    "If you want to watch silent\/experimental\/esoteric\/old films for 4 hours in a classroom every week and then listen to\/make up your own BS about them for another 3 hours a week, go ahead. It wasn't for me, and I still don't understand why one would study film, but it seemed like some people really liked it. Lectures and readings aren't necessary, just know the terms and a bit about the films for the final.",
    "If you want to see some classic films, write two papers (one six page one 10 page), and a final exam then take it. That being said, the lectures and the readings were very much over my head and the screenings get to be a lot (two movies shown back to back every Tuesday night). Look at the syllabus and make sure they are movies you wouldn't mind sitting through, because some were awfully boring. Luckily, comprehending the lecturesand the readings were not that crucial for the course, but it was annoying that I wasn't really able to follow what the professor was saying ever. Professor Mackay is very passionate about film (especially Russian film) and his enthusiasm shines through in the lecture. It was his first time teaching the course so maybe next time he will make the lectures more comprehensive and less wordy. See if you like the syllabus and his lecture style. Everyone, the professor, TAs, and students were very kind.",
    "This class will introduce you to the basics of film, and you can take from it as much as you want. Remember though, you have basically three major grades: your first 6-8 page paper, your final 10-12 page paper, and then your final. Ialmost forgot and got screwed. This isn't a gut class, but it isn't necessarily hard either.",
    "If you wanna take any film courses at Yale, if you enjoy going to the movies for reasons beyond \"The movies are cool,\" then take this course, you'll be satisfied.",
    "I would recommend it to someone who is interested in Film Studies, otherwise the time commitment of the screenings would become annoying.",
    "There isn't terribly much work involved in the course, simply because watching a film takes considerably less time than reading a book. If you take the class, make sure to attend the screenings, but if you do you should be fine. There are only a couple of papers that are quite manageable in length. I would definitely recommend this class if",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone! The lectures were very enjoyable, the sections were fun, and the workload was not too heavy. The papers do take a while, but since they are quite open ended and are about movies, they are actually really fun to write! This is a great class for prospective film studies majors, because it opens your eyes to the scope of the discipline, or for anyone who loves movies.",
    "Amazing class - helps you gain insight into a whole new subject while providing you with the WR credit. Great professor, very willing to go the extra mile and bubbling with enthusiasm.Make sure you do the weekly readings. Wouldn't necessarily harm your grade if you don't, but you'd end up gaining a lot more from the class.",
    "A big time commitment if you want to screen all the films (which you should do, don't take the class without intent to). Outside of that, a very interesting course, it was outside of anything else I have studied at Yale. This meant it was nice to apply scholasticism to something I had previously only considered on the entertainment level.",
    "I would recommend it with the advice for that person to prepare for a lot of theory. Half of the films we watch are independent films that demonstrate the historical or artistic basis for what we're learning. These ones aren't always as interesting.",
    "I would strongly recommend Film Studies 150 to a fellow student, because it allows students to view films more critically and see more layers of meaning in how a film is presented. In addition, the critical essays that are part of the class's material give a good idea of what the general field of film studies is like. For anyone interested in film, the class will offer a different perspective with which to watch film, and for anyone interested in film studies, the class is an accurate and engaging introduction to the discipline.",
    "I would recommend this class. Be warned there is a pretty large time commitment outside of the actually classroom for watching the films. This is generally about two to three hours a week, but beyond that there is not much work that needs to be done for the class. The material is interesting and the films are great. It was a good experience to see some films that I wouldn't normally watch. The class is well taught and the material isn't overly complex. Overall a good class.",
    "Intro to Film Studies is a good way to earn a writing credit (it only requires two papers), and I feel that I watch films differently after having taken the class. However, you need to be willing to block off Tuesday nights to watch films (normally two back-to-back), so it is a considerable time commitment. You should also be aware that there is both a final paper and final exam, and grading is very subjective. Still, if you are interested in film and want to learn how to analyze films, I would recommend it.",
    "Offers a good introduction to film studies, but don't expect this to be a class that focuses much on film production or film history.",
    "Take it, even if you have only tangential interest in film, especially if John McKay teaches it again.",
    "YES. I loved this class - the lectures were interesting as were the readings and I can now watch films on a completely different level than before, with a newfound appreciation for the effort behind the production, the nuances of genre, and specific cinematic and artistic choices.However, I didn't realize the time commitment this class would be. While the workload is relatively light, the 2.3-4 hour screening every Tuesday ate away at my evenings, as did by 8pm section. In the end it was worth it, but I didn't realize that I would sacrifice 20% of my weeknights."
