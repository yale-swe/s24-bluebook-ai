    "FREN160 is a wonderful class, especially if you get lucky and end up with few classmates because then you get a lot of oral practice! At the same time, you constantly have short essays to write so your written French is improving, and you watch many movies throughout the semester so your listening improves too. Though you do have quite a bit of work three days a week, it's never overwhelming and it's usually enjoyable. I would definitely recommend this class if you're looking to learn more about France while ameliorating your French skills.",
    "I cannot more highly recommend FREN 160; it was by far my favorite course this semester. I personally think it's one of the better French language courses, because it discusses contemporary society in France - stuff that's relevant to French people (and to Americans) even today. It will make you question your own country\/society you live in by juxtaposing another national model. You will be able to discuss relevant issues in French - immigration, the environment, regionalism, race, socio-economic difference, government, politics, religion, food, culture, work, and daily life, to name a few - rather fluently by the end of this class. It will equip you with hundreds of new vocabulary words you never thought you'd be able to learn, and rapidly you will watch as your speaking and writing improve. Know what you are getting yourself into, however; this class is a lot of constant work! Every class has something due, most of the time some kind of 300-word writing assignment to produce as well as preparedness for discussion (these end up being easier to write as the class goes on and you improve). There are also four vocab tests in which you need to write two essays with 40 total memorized vocabulary words - kind of daunting at first, but you'll realize that because you have been using these words in your assignments all along, it'll come more easily than you think. Some might say that this is busy work, but in my opinion, it all helped me to improve my French. Some advice - it's a good idea to shop different sections, a smaller discussion group might mean more time for each person to talk in class and just a different class dynamic. You'll want to be in a class in which you feel comfortable participating since it's a conversational class, so be on the lookout for other classmates (as well as professor) that make you feel comfortable too. Overall... Take it if you want to see a noticeable improvement in your French! I don't think you'll regret it!",
    "Take this class! It was really great! The material was really interesting. It was A LOT of work, though. Much more than similar classes in the spanish department. There was a written assignment (300 words) and reading for every class. The tests were also difficult--writing essays using vocab words from a list you had to memorize. But it was definitely worth it!",
    "This class was often frustrating, as the workload was heavy and largely unenjoyable. As well, the format of the vocabulary quizzes and oral examinations can take some adjusting to. Overall, the course made French culture significantly less interesting than it could have been, for the sake of language-building exercises. But because the curriculum probably will not change anytime soon, make sure to choose a professor that brings the material for life, and that the overall atmosphere of your section of the class inspires you to converse, discuss, etc.",
    "French 160 is a really fun class. It is challenging and enriching. Take it. I was deciding between 150 and 160 because I wasn't sure how solid my grammar was, and I am infinitely glad to have chosen 160.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who is looking for a comprehensive French class that focuses on grammar, style, and conversation. There is not so much work for the class as there is for other lower-level French courses."
