   "comments": [
    "Definitely take it if you need an ROW (rest of the world) class for the history major. I would say definitely check it out\/take it even if you don't need that ROW credit.",
    "This is a great survey of Brazil. It focuses more on the colonial period than most survey courses. It's an excellent class if you like Latin America already, and it's a really straightforward and engaging way to get a rest of the world credit because Prof. Schwartz is a good lecturer and Brazil is a fascinating place.",
    "I would recommend it with some reservation. It's a good rest-of-the world and not too much work (with tolerable lectures) but to be really engaged, look elsewhere.",
    "Good course, useful as rest of the world. Lots of reading assigned- more than could honestly be done in a week- but not too challenging outside of that.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. Lectures were good, the material was interesting, and the workload was manageable.",
    "Great class. Take it if you know nothing or everything about Brazil.",
    "Good solid history class.",
    "Take it!It's a great overview of Brazilian history. The lectures are very engaging and go at an enjoyable pace. Its main strength is the passion that Prof. Schwartz imbues on the class. The main weakness is that it spends too much time on colonial period and too little time on Brazil's modern history (from 1900-today), which I found the most interesting. For instance, so many interesting periods of Brazilian history, such as the military dictatorship in the 60s, were briefly discussed as if in a rush to reach 2010. Meanwhile, Prof. Schwartz spent considerable time talking about themes that arose during colonialism and continually revisiting them.",
    "I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about Brazil's past problems and how they have contributed to the issues that it faces today. Brazil is so important in the world, yet so undervalued at Yale. I think this course teaches you an incredible amount and it is definitely worth taking. I'd say this is one of Yale's best kept secrets in terms of courses.",
    "If you want to learn about brazil, which is an extremely interesting country, this is a great class",
    "Maybe. It depends on the level of interest they have in Latin American history. If they're into it, they'll probably love this class. If not, it might become tedious and too narrowly focused at times. If they do take it, make sure to take really good lecture notes-- they are what the tests are based on. The tests are by no means easy, so don't take this class thinking it will be an easy 5th credit or \"rest of the word\" credit in the history major. But if they're generally interested in the course content, then definitely.",
    "I would recommend History of Brazil to another student. Its a good rest of the world class and Brazil is a fascinating country. Professor Schwartz is a good lecture. Its a lot of work though -- really challenging tests, readings, two papers. But its definitely work checking out and seeing if its a good fit for you.",
    "Take it, son.",
    "Survey history of Brazil. Not too much in depth but I would definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in the country or need a rest of the world credit for history.",
    "This is a great \"other world history\" to take! Probably THE BEST! Take this class AND Colonial Latin America--also taught by Professor Schwartz. There is manageable reading and only one 4-6 page paper (midterm and final exams). TAKE IT!",
    "This is a good class to take if you want a non-European history class. Professor Schwartz is a great lecturer and keeps the class interesting throughout the semester.",
    "Learn the History of Brazil with a big colonial influence. Could be more exciting but a very solid background.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it; the history of Brazil provides an especially interesting comparison for the history of U.S.",
    "A good overview of Brazil. Schwartz is a good lecturer, the readings are a bit long, and there's a lot of information, it's a bit overwhelming. a good rest of the world credit, really short papers.",
    "I would Recommend it. The lectures and readings are interesting.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. It is quite interesting and if you are at all interested in Brazil is a great introduction to the history and culture. The class isn't too demanding and is quite rewarding in the end."
