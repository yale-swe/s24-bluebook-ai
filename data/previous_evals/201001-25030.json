   "comments": [
    "This course delves into the performance and understanding of early music. It is a great class that I would recommend to singers who are interested in learning and experiencing music history.",
    "Yes. Very Yes.Please see above.",
    "Take it. It's great for students of all levels, Professor Malafronte has a real gift with repertoire, and it's an absurd amount of fun.",
    "I have been doing Collegium since my sophomore year (I'm a second semester senior), so that should say something in itself. This is one of those classes where you get to learn and study for pure enjoyment of the topic. What's awesome, too, is that every semester tackles a different aspect\/era\/region of early music, so it's different every time. Judy is so passionate about the music that you can't help but get excited too. This is one of the few classes I've taken at Yale where I get really happy before every single class meeting.As for workload, the reading and actual schoolwork is fairly light (though I recommend you put time into it, because it's a whole lot of fun). Most of your work revolves around learning music and preparing pieces for 1-2 concerts, which is substantial if you want to put on a good performance. If you take this class for any reason, do it for the opportunity to perform not only with a bunch of talented students, but with some fabulous instrumentalists and often some very, very esteemed guests.In short: I can't say enough positive things about this class. Oh, wait, I can say one more thing -- Beinecke receptions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class. It is a great class for someone interested in music who hasn't had the time to take a lot of music theory or performance classes before.",
    "This is awesome fun. You get to sing (and analyse) early music in a pretty relaxed setting, and you have a couple of concerts each semester during which you perform music you have probably never been exposed to before. If you like singing, and like to be exposed to new music, take it!",
    "Fabulous course! If you enjoy singing I highly recommend that you take this course!!! It was one of the best classes I had at Yale, and introduced me to an entirely new genre of music. You also get the chance to take advantage of some of Yale's greatest treasures: the rare music in the Beinecke (great opportunity!!!)"
