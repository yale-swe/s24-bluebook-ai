    "See Question 1.",
    "yes. It is a great course for students who interested in East Asia.",
    "Definitely will recommend this course to whoever is interested in East Asian archaeology. Reading, discussion and informative powerpoint greatly facilitate our understanding of ancient civilziations.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, as it provided a great background in East Asian archaeology and the readings inspired great class discussions. I loved discussing with classmates from a variety of backgrounds and learned so much through the course."

    "I do have a better background now about a persistent northern cultural boundary in Japan that it seems possible could have lasted, in some version or another, until today. So this course helped to establish a bookend of sorts towards which I might trace later instances of this cultural separation.",
    "Yes. As a student interested in East Asia, I learn a lot in this course and I get new ideas about my research interest.",
    "The second half of the semester is about Japanese Archipelago which I'm not so familiar with. However, the methodology to shed light upon the secondary formation of states in Japan and Korean Peninsula helps a lot because within the Chinese civilization itself there were distinctions between core and periphery states. Investigations of Japanese Archipelago may deepen our standing of the universal part of the process of the secondary formation of the states in the periphery. I really appreciate such precious point of view offered by the course.",
    "This course provided a valuable understanding of East Asian archaeology and offered a number of inspiring topics to explore in personal research. It greatly added to my knowledge of the discipline and was valuable for my research interests."
