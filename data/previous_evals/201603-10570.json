    "I think this is very straightforward - this is a continuation of the Chinese track at Yale. I gained a lot of new information by working through the textbook for third year Chinese learners.",
    "I benefitted greatly from the regular, evenly paced teaching, and learned a lot about contemporary Chinese history and society. My insights on taking oral exams and my confidence in speaking improved. My daily studying skills improved as well, especially in terms of efficiently completing online homework and listening homework.",
    "I found this class incredibly rewarding as it developed my Chinese language ability.",
    "Furthered my knowledge of Chinese grammar, vocabulary, and speaking ability",
    "I definitely improved my Chinese, both orally, written, and with regards to grammar."

    "I really don't like the structure of the class, and I also don't like the textbook. First of all, the section is quite frankly worthless; nobody practices, uses, or even remembers any of the 10 grammar points that the teachers attempt to teach in one day. I think that trying to get through a chapter in 2 days is just unreasonable; in L1\/L2, they'd spend two days on each section of the chapter, which is much better in my opinion. Spending such a short time on each section means that the teachers are constantly rushing through the content, skipping lots of words and grammar, and we practically never have the opportunity to practice speaking our grammar. I have also forgotten an unacceptably large number of words, which is really frustrating.",
    "Strengths - I enjoyed the regular homework load, the high level of in-class participation demanded, and the friendly atmosphere in class Weaknesses - At times I wished the instructors had demanded more complex responses from me in Chinese so I would be pushed to incorporate new grammar structures and vocabulary.",
    "Course is great! More sections would be better, so class sizes are smaller",
    "Excellently taught; loved the alternating teachers style"

    "It depends on what you're looking for. If you want to continue learning Chinese, you have no other choice but to take this course. However, as someone who avidly loves learning Chinese, I was quite disappointed by the course. I think the setup was poor, and I also don't think that the teachers do a great job of facilitating long-term retention of the stuff we learn. For starters, they try to get through all the content of a chapter in 2 days, which means that for two days a week you're learning about 40 new words each night. I went to Harvard Beijing Academy over the summer, and this class has a comparable amount of homework to HBA, but you also have other classes at Yale. This means that the rigor with which I learned and my retention were very poor. Additionally, since they were rushing through the content so quickly, we almost never practiced grammar; I probably have learned less grammar in this semester than I did in two weeks at HBA. Also, our class was far too big; most sections have between 10 and 15 students, which means that you have very little opportunity to speak or practice grammar. I was one of the best speakers in my summer program, and coming back I've definitely felt my language skill and fluency degenerating, possibly an inevitability due to being back in the U.S. but also likely in part due to this course. I wasn't crazy about the class, but I love the language. If you are passionate about Chinese and really enjoy learning it, you can through 150\/151 and get into the fun stuff in one year. That's my plan. It's worth it; the language is worth learning. TL;DR: Poorly run class, great language. Take it if you like Chinese, but don't expect it to be perfectly organized or easy.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course, as long as the student is committed to learning Chinese at a high level and has time to accommodate the workload.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who takes their Chinese language ability seriously and wants to improve their skills in a course that will push them to work hard.",
    "Yes!",
    "Absolutely vital if you want to continue your appreciation for and comprehension of the chinese language",
    "If you've already been taking Chinese at Yale, this class is exactly what you'd expect. If you haven't taken Chinese at Yale, just know that Yale's Chinese department is phenomenal and you simply cannot go wrong choosing a Chinese class."
