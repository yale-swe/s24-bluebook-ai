Using medium format is not much like 35mm - you need to really think about what you're doing. This changes the whole photographic process, and I found myself making very different (and exciting) work that I couldn't have done had I just stuck with an SLR."

But perhaps it would have been nicer to have more seminars like the one about writing for art. Getting people really engaged during those classroom sessions is very rewarding."
