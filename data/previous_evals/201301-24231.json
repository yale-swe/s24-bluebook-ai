   "comments": [
    "The curriculum is well integrated, the key concepts one ought to take away are made clear, and Mark tries to make the class as practical as possible (e.g. though the video-taped assignment).A weakness, to my mind, is the extensive writing-load through the assignments. The assignments are intricate and one might is constrained in spending adequate time with the inherent complexities. Given its the last semester and one has many other concerns besides school, it might be helpful to reduce the workload on the second assignment and place greater emphasis on the third assignment. After all, the third assignment should tackle a formidable policy change - yet is giving the same weight as the other two assignments. Although the task holds the potential to develop something productive beyond the course itself, the course structure seems to not cater to that opportunity.",
    "Strengths:-Covers a few relevant topics like persuasion techniquesWeaknesses:-It's hard to get what we're doing. The concepts are very abstract and the assignments are so contrived that it is difficult to grasp what is being taught.-Not fun",
    "The class provided interesting discussion on a variety of policy topics, and taught us how to look at policy issues in many ways. The class focuses heavily on US federal policy from a government perspective, and rarely addresses small policy issues. As the Capstone for Health Policy and Administration, many students wished we looked at health policy from other perspectives, e.g. how a state could work with federal mandates to set up an appropriate Medicaid program, or how a specific legislation will affect different industries. We are taught how to persuade different stakeholders as though we will all be working for the federal government; it might be useful to have one assignment from that perspective, but another assignment where we could respond to Policy issues from the perspective of an industry official or interest group. Overall, the course was challenging and we did learn a lot, but it could include a lot more diversity in the types of assignments we do. Most likely, none of us are going to be asked to write the next president's health reform platform in our next job.",
    "Strengths: Provides students with a strong foundation in health policy issues and analysis; instructor facilitates interesting discussions and comes with a wealth of knowledge on the subject.Weaknesses: Many students seem disinterested in the course, didn't participate much, and didn't do many of the readings. Class was very work-heavy at the end of the semester, and paper assignments seemed longer than necessary. Because the written assignments had so many readings associated with them, it was difficult to figure in enough time to do the class readings as well.It would be nice to have an option for more international focused material in the course (or a different course with a global focus to fulfill this purpose), as my interest in not as much in domestic health affairs.Finally, it seems that this class requires as much research, writing and time as would be required of a thesis, but it only counts for 1 credit. Students might put more time and effort into the course if it counted as 2 credits, as other departments' theses. It was a lot to be balancing this course and 4 others in the final semester of the program, and for this reason I couldn't give it as much attention asI would have liked.",
    "I appreciated this course - and I do feel like it served its purpose of drilling a few concepts into my head in preparation for the day we walk out of here. I appreciated what the assignments were trying to accomplish, for the most part, but definitely think they could be deliver in a slightly clearer manner.On a purely logistical level - this is a class that is a little dense and I think adding a break into the two hour class would help the attention span issue with a two hour class.",
    "The HPM department needs to take a good hard look at this course and truthfully evaluate (and inquire with students) whether or not the make up this course is really a \"cumulating experience\" that it is a good tool for learning or if it is just the department's easy way out of having to put in the time and energy to mentor students through a thesis or a true capstone\/cumulating project. Most likely it is the latter and in that case, let it be an elective because it is irrelevant for many students in HPM and many of us could have taken much more meaningful and useful courses in its place. Also, between the AP students, the 5 year students and the myriad of people who switched into HPM, the cohort was just way too large to effectively have a meaningful class. Finally, a capstone class should be a seminar, not 95% lecture.",
    "Course needs to be tailored to a wider audience. The course is designed solely for students wishing to be policy analysts and close to none of us are interested in pursuing such a career. Topics discussed are also only domestic. International options, that do not require us to do additional work, would be appreciated. Being able to do an international paper for the final topic is difficult when we never look at any international issues in the class or in any of the required policy classes. The individual assignments are repetitive. You would hope that if we mastered them the first time we wouldn't have to do the assignment again. Also, there are enough policy issues in public health that we do not need to write papers on invented, resolved or impossible issues. it would also be great if we could do assignments that we would likely have to do in our careers- no employers is going to read a 15-20 page brief.",
    "Overall, an excellent course. Assignments were difficult and took a considerable amount of time, but were very constructive.",
    "I think the instructor is excellent and really does care about the students. However, the class was too general and not specific enough. Furthermore, the students did not care about the course and as a result they were no class discussions. Also, the assignments were way too long and not specific enough. Sometimes we were left wondering how to approach the assignments.",
    "The class started off really good - people did the reading and the discussion was lively. As the semester went on, though, the class started slacking a bit more. It can be difficult to run a discussion-based class without full classroom participation, though. This definitely negatively impacted the quality of the class towards the end of the semester. A smaller class size may have been better.",
    "The course material here is fantastic and begs for more class discussion, but unfortunately the lesson plans don't lend themselves to it. Professor Schlesinger is great at teasing out the core issues from the readings, but I wish he gave the class more time to talk about it ourselves. When he did turn it over for participation, it was admittedly sluggish, but sometimes that happens because people get in a zone of listening to a lecture and have a hard time switching gears. I'd suggest opening classes by asking for thoughts on the readings and then letting participation drive the class. A smaller class size would also help a lot.Where this class shines is the assignments. The group assignment wasn't terribly interesting but the two individual ones were a lot of fun. The comments we got back were also great.",
    "Excellent course to provide a framework for future policy analysts. The once per week format made it difficult to actively participate throughout the session. Great topics coveredI would like this course to be offered earlier on since it is the closest thing to a true intro into what a policy student does once they get out in the real world",
    "Very outdated material"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is one of the best instructors I have had in the MPH. He has innumerable strengths in delivering this course (including great lecture structure, responsiveness, thoughtfulness etc). He has no major weaknesses.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Strengths:Very knowledgeableWeaknesses:Very meta (hard to get what he's getting at many times.)",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark provides excellent feedback and is great at encouraging class discussion without resorting to cold calling and guiding answers too much. In a field with many professional options, Mark focuses primarily on big picture, broad scope policy issues that aren't particularly applicable to what many Policy students will be doing in their professional careers. It would benefit the students if Mark surveyed what fields the students were planning on entering, and tailoring the coursework a little bit.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is a wonderful advisor and professor. His passion is unparalleled and he was incredibly helpful on all matters throughout the semester!",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Very approachable and reasonable, does a great job of structuring the course in a way that flows. Provides students with great context for the readings.I would recommend breaking the class up with a 5 minute break an hour into the course, and having in-class small group discussions from time to time on the readings or other material. Although it helps to have the class in a circle, many students still did not participate or do readings. This is a possible solution. Also, if there is some way to incentivize having done the readings, this might help get more students engaged.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Honestly, Mark is probably one of my favorite professors here. I greatly admire the effort that he puts into designing and delivering his lectures, and I am deeply appreciative of the work that he does on behalf of his students. It is abundantly clear that he is committed to helping us learn and becoming well-prepared health policy analysts&professionals. I find this quality severely lacking at YSPH, and so I am grateful that I encountered it twice in Mark.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark is great and very intelligent but has a very narrow scope of what the class should be which is not suitable for a capstone.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Dr. Schlesinger is an excellent teacher. Lectures were engaging and well organized. Extensive and detailed feedback was provided for every assignment.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark really does care about his students and he is one of the few professors at YSPH that shows concerns about his students and care about their learning. He is also extremely knowledgeable and easy to talk to. He is always available to meet with students and provide great feedback.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Mark was a good section leader, but could have done more to force students to do the readings. The fact that there was not full classroom participation lowered the quality of discussion.",
    "Instructor: Mark Schlesinger \u00a0Excellent instructor with great teaching style."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course based on its richness in concepts and being intellectually demanding. The course could cater even more to practical matters a policy analyst likely faces after graduation - especially given it is a capstone course.",
    "Mark's great and he knows his stuff, but I didn't learn much, and I spent a lot of time on the assignments, which I didn't enjoy. I felt like I was being forced to play pretend when writing these papers. It's a requirement so deal with it.",
    "This was a really interesting course - the projects were challenging (even bizarre at times) but I felt like I walked away with a really strong notion of health policy decision-making. I found that a lot of what I learned in this class spilled into other classes, which was sort of interesting. Overall, a good way to wrap up!",
    "Interesting topics and professor works very hard, but lack of interest from other students made it a less than optimal experience. This is required for all policy students.",
    "It is required.",
    "The course looks at several elements that contribute to understanding the role of the health policy professional.",
    "It is a requirement for policy students. But I do hope that the course is modify so that it is more challenging for students and that there is a greater class discussion. I also hope that the assignments are changed so that there are less lengthy and provide more directions to students.",
    "Interesting readings and discussions, so long as you and everyone else in the class actually puts in the time. You get out of it what you put in, so put in a lot."
