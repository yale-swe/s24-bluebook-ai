    "I'd describe it as primarily a research seminar, with a focus on a particular general topic as reflected by the readings. That said, I'd emphasize the research aspect of the course and encourage the student to start thinking about their topic from the very first day of class. I think the class is an absolutely necessity for students in the Asian Religions programs.",
    "The combination of two courses: on one hand the chance to write a paper and be critiqued by the class, on the other hand, a study of buddhist monasticism with an emphasis on economic aspects and really on the re-conceputalization of buddhism present in the work of Greg Schopen.",
    "Yes, for purposes of thinking through how to form a serious research paper."

   "comments": [
    "I think the primary value of this course for me was that it taught me what good research should consist of - what kind of approaches one should use, how one should articulate conclusions, and what sorts of data one should look at. Aside from describing different aspects of monastic life in Asia, each of the readings was the product of a different scholarly approach. All of these served as useful guides as I developed my own research paper.",
    "Quite helpful, both for my ability to create a research project, as well for its contents.",
    "This course has definitely been an exercise in engaging and producing serious research."
