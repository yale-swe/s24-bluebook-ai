   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to a student who wants to learn very specifically about ethnic conflict and take a very well-taught, traditional Political Science class.",
    "I would recommend this class if you're interested in ethnic conflict! It's interesting with interesting discussion but it's almost two hours long which can get a bit dull at times. We do study a bit of history but mostly focus on theories.",
    "Take this if you want to study ethnic conflict from the political science and statistical perspective. You learn a lot about how modeling tracks ethnic conflicts. It's a good balance for less scientific political science courses on conflict.",
    "Yes, I definitely recommend this course to someone interested in conflicts or international affairs in general. This course is a great way to delve deep into an issue and study the various academic answers to an important question. Professor Sambanis is very knowledgeable, and there is a lot to learn from the class.",
    "Awesome class with a really great, knowledgeable professor. Sambanis is wonderful as both scholar and lecturer, though not as strong as a seminar facilitator. Watch the group you get -- we had a few very strong, dominant personalities that ended up taking the class over, at times. If you're at all interested in cycles of violence \/ ethnic civil wars \/ nation-building and post-conflict institution, take this class!"
