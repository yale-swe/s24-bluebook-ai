    "Take it. Take DS. This course alone makes it worth the trouble. Unless you have a considerable background in philosophy, this course is bound to stretch your beliefs and change the way you see the world. It is an intellectual joy-ride, one that is worth every second and every turn of the page.",
    "If you get Aaron, stay in his section. He's fantastic!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The class is not easy by any means, and the papers require a different type of construction and analysis than other academic essays; however, the class provides a strong survey of some of West's greatest thinkers and stokes thought-provoking and timeless questions that I am excited to keep exploring.",
    "I would recommend Professor Norby and this class to another student. It is a wonderful overview of early philosophers and Professor NOrby does a good job trying to explain complex ideas in a short span of time.",
    "A great overview of classical philosophy, if that floats your boat."
