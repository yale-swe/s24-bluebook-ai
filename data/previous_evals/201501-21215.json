   "comments": [
    "The course closely examined a number of late works of Beethoven's, ranging from the Missa Solemnis, to selections from the late piano sonatas, to, finally, the late quartets. The course was especially strong in tracing out the discursive histories associated with these pieces. One of the seminar's primary components was close musical analysis of works, which promoted strengthening one's working understanding of the pieces themselves. I would recommend the course to future students because of its intellectual richness, but would caution that our experience with the course was marked by a particular jaundice and skepticism towards Beethoven research. For us, this was not a course that left us, for the most part, more eager to work on Beethoven.",
    "The course will familiarize you both with some of Beethoven's greatest late works and with the imposing mountains of scholarly literature that surround them. It is a gruelling slog no matter what, but is hugely rewarding if you care a lot about Beethoven and want to get even deeper into his world. Very, very highly recommended if that describes you. If not, I'd be much more reserved in my recommendation, especially if you'd just be taking it because the course has a famous reputation.",
    "This course is designed to probe the major late works by Beethoven and to interrogate the intellectual questions at stake in late-Beethoven scholarship by surveying a variety of analytical, hermeneutic, and historiographic writings on the works."

   "comments": [
    "Beethoven is very central to my own area of interest, and so this course was naturally a huge contributor to my view of the fractured scholarly landscape. It deepened my knowledge both by getting me even more familiar with pieces that are very important to me and by teaching me about some of the scholarly literature and its peculiar issues. I'd say that it made me much more wary about going into the world of public Beethoven scholarship, but I suppose it's best to be aware of what you might be walking into.",
    "In addition to expanding my knowledge of Beethoven's late works and musicological responses to them, this course honed my critical reading skills and my ability to speak articulately while evaluating high-level prose (as mentioned above). It also showed the variety of methodological approaches that can be applied to the same musical material, thus foregrounding the various epistemologies themselves."
