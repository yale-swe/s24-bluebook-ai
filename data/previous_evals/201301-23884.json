    "You learn a lot, certainly more than level three, which was a lot in itself. Ayala is amazing. If you like Hebrew, there is no reason not to take it.",
    "This class puts you on a level to continue Hebrew study either at Yale in more advanced classes or even on your own, as by the time you finish this class you have the groundwork to read, write, and communicate to continue to improve outside of the classroom.",
    "A great way to improve your Hebrew! You learn all of the passives and the future tense of all the binyanim (except pa'al which is covered in L3). There's a lot of writing but you will improve a lot.",
    "This is a course fr those who genuinely really want to learn hebrew",
    "Too much work, not really worth it",
    "If you want to learn Hebrew and make the previous three semesters worth the work, you need to take this class. It can be hard and there's a lot of homework, but if you stop at L3, there are some significant gaps in your knowledge that make it hard to feel as if you really grasp the language (though it's not as if you're fluent by the end of L4). If you're up for at least 2 hours of work for most class periods, do it."
