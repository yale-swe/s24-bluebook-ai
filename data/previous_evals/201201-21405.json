   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend German 140 02 to another student. German isn't the easiest of languages, so it takes time to truly become competent in it. I think that German 140 starts the process of that competency by placing less of an emphasis on grammar and more of an emphasis on expressing thoughts, ideas, and higher level thinking in German. And at the end of the semester when you realize that you can, you get a great feeling inside.",
    "German 140 is about German culture and conversation. You're forced to put to use your German skills to engage in conversation and write essays. It's difficult at first, but it's amazing how speaking German slowly becomes easier over the semester.",
    "This is a fine continuation of 130. You clear up grammatical odds and ends while also being exposed to two TV shows (Tatort and Turkish fur Anfanger), two movies (Sophie Scholl and Kebab Connection) and one full-length (though still fairly short) novel."
