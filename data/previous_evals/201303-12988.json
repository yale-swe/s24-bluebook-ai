   "comments": [
    "Definitely recommend this class. It was a fascinating introduction featuring a wide range of approaches to subjects tangentially related to Early Modern Science.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a friend -- I didn't like some of the books we read, but the course itself was so interesting and informative that I would definitely recommend it.",
    "Absolutely. It was a great way of learning how history books are made and how to discuss them. Plus, Paola is a really wonderful person to get to know.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any student.",
    "This is a good course to read, think, and often materially interact with early modern science and its artifacts. I would do this again, and would also recommend it. I don't 'do' early modern science, but got a lot out of it. My only less positive comment would be, as above, that it gives a very up to date view of early modern science, but without much historiographic depth. Sometimes, that means not knowing what makes new things new, or not, which leaves the historian in a paradoxical position of doing history without history. But overall, a great course with a great professor, genuinely recommended.",
    "I would recommend the course as it is great training in historiography."

   "comments": [
    "This isn't my discipline and is only indirectly related to my research but I loved the course anyway. In particular, it made me far more attuned to issues of craft, artisanal culture and how they relate to and differ from the fine arts.",
    "This book exposed me to many new methods and genres, and made me really consider the use of primary sources. It will be influential in my future work.",
    "It helped me understand the craft of history. Even though the topic was outside my area of interest, the tools I learned will be helpful for my latter work.",
    "I do not study early modern science, but do study history of science. In that sense, this course helped me think about some questions I am interested in through other perspectives. Yet in the course's focus on materiality, it has application to many other fields."
