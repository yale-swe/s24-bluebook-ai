    "Thinking and Writing About the Law is a writing seminar that will actually, and significantly, improve your writing. Take it even if you don't know whether you are interested in law. But be ready for work. Be ready to fall in love with the class. If not, you might end up wasting the time and effort of yourself, your classmates, and Professor Ehrgood. So be ready. This class is too amazing for its smallest portion to be wasted.",
    "121 was by far the best class I took this semester. But don't take this class hoping to learn the law; instead you will learn about the law -- the course (as its title would suggest) is focused very much on legal writing and broader analysis of the law and jurisprudence, rather than substantive law-learning. I thought this was great, and I took a lot from the assignments, papers, and class discussions. The readings are uniformly interesting, and although the workload is relatively heavy, it's entirely manageable. Ehrgood is absolutely fantastic.",
    "You most definitely should take ENGL 121 with Ehrgood. If you are interested in writing, the law, or think you might want to go to law school, you will learn a tremendous amount in this class and improve your writing and legal thinking tremendously. This class is a fascinating introduction to legal thinking and a great way to see if you might want to purse the law. Ehrgood is also an incredible writing teacher and focuses on helping you become a much clearer writer. This class is definitely a lot of work, but the work was very interesting and worth while. He is not an unfairly hard grader and was very as long as you do the work.",
    "Take it at some point in your time here. Take it even if you aren't majoring in English or preparing for law school. In fact, take it ESPECIALLY if you're a science or math major--you're experienced with using logic, but expressing logic in a rhetorical context is eye-opening. Especially because I don't think any other English classes stress critical thinking so much. This is a class that you cannot BS through, and that's why I love it.",
    "Take it. An incredible window into the minds of legal writers, this class is absolutely worth the demanding workload. Be prepared to be challenged time and time again, but also to immeasurably improve both your writing and your way of thinking. The course material is fascinating, the discussions are scintillating and the professor insanely wonderful. Do not enter this class lightly, but instead be resolved to live up to Professor Ehrgood's high standards. You will learn a great deal from a brilliant man. Good luck.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT. I learned so much. It's a lot of work at first, but it tapers off, and it's such a delightful course!",
    "Before spring break we thought and wrote about the Speluncean Explorers. That was great and allowed for lots of moral and legal discussion, as well as refinement of writing style. After spring break, things got less organized and less interesting. The Rowe v. Quad case is *slightly* educational (I changed my mind from thinking the sexual assault case was clearly decided in the plaintiff's favor, to thinking that we should judge the defendant's behavior in the context of his cultural norm and upbringing, which may be much more offensive and crude than what is 'societally acceptable.') and *very* boring. We couldn't talk as much about ethics, legality, judicial discretion...because the case had such clear laws. Also, the assignments were less substantial and thought-provoking; though I would *not* want to be assigned heavy homework about this super-boring case. Other people enjoyed Rowe, though; I am not interested in technical implementations of law, so it was not as engaging to me. The parts I loved about this course were about thinking and writing better, and those parts came in plenty, just less so in the second half. This was a very good class, though. Ehrgood has many important lessons in writing style, and the topics explored in the first half of the course are important for everyone to think about. Be warned that the 2nd half will be less interesting to those who primarily wish to 1) think, and 2) write. It will also be easier, which can be a very good thing. The final two weeks you can spend refining your writing style, so that's what I did. So you can think of it as 8 great weeks + 6 mediocre weeks + 2 great weeks.",
    "This is a great class! The workload is definitely heaviest at the beginning, but it does lighten up a lot toward the middle and end. (I also started this Credit\/D, and I would recommend doing that.) Ehrgood is the most responsive professor I have had at Yale. His attention to detail and the amount of thought he put into critiquing\/editing\/making suggestions about my work always blew me away. I would recommend this class for people looking to get a taste of law school, people who love writing and style work, or people who just want to take a great Yale course.",
    "I took this class because I want to be a better writer. I became a better writer. Success! When I didn't get into this class previously, I figured I would just get the book and do the exercises on my own. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. You will never do them on your own. Ever. They are great for you, but too painful to do on your own for fun, in the same way that math psets are great for you, but too painful to do on your own for fun. And you have to do them. They change your life. And if you're thinking \"pssshhhh style exercises? I bet they're easy I'm a great writer,\" know that they are harder and more time-consuming than you expect them to be. But this means that you learn from them much more. I knew that style exercises would be useful for me, but I didn't think they would be SO useful. Also, be prepared to dive deeply into the texts. Very deeply. Deeper than you think, even though you probably dive deeply into things. The class is run by Professor Ehrgood, the most organized Professor I have ever had at Yale, so you always know what to expect both in terms of the quality of work you need to produce and what will be covered in each class and assignment. The course includes exciting and varied coursework -- 2 large(ish) essays, almost-daily style exercises, 3 style tests, and a final exam. This class was so exciting and great. Very manageable workload. Workload is similar to other English classes. Quite light compared to any computer science class here. More than most psych classes here."
