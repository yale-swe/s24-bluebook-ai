   "comments": [
    "Take it. It's an interesting and fairly easy language class. Professor is awesome. Low maintenance class- great 5th class if you need one.",
    "ABSOLUTELY. Mercedes is such an amazing professor and the course is interesting.",
    "This class is basically an overview of various legal topics (such as immigration, constitutions, citizenship, criminal law, wills, drug laws, etc.), all discussed in spanish. It doesn't really focus on any particular region -- we discussed US law, Latin American law, and Spanish law. Perhaps there is a little more emphasis on Spain than the other areas but not too much. Don't expect to learn a million technical terms or anything like that. You basically just discuss current legal topics and do it in Spanish. Not a hard course, but you learn some interesting stuff and do it all in Spanish!",
    "A lecture based course, with short bi-weekly assignments regarding law in spanish speaking countries. The only reason one might not want to take this course is if he\/she is uncomfortable with their ability in spanish\/wouldn't want to speak in front of others. There is a participation component to the grade and a presentation and the native speakers do come aflockin' to this course, but the professor will help you regardless of your level of Spanish.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in keeping up with their Spanish. It's not a particularly difficult course.",
    "Take it, for sure",
    "Legal Spanish is a very broad, general overview of the Latin American and Spanish legal systems. If you are looking for a challenging course that truly engages with legal material and policy issues, this is not the course for you. The reading for the course is minimal, the daily assignments are easy, and the midterm and final paper are both extremely manageable. Profesora Carreras is a pretty good professor during the class meetings, but she can be quite disorganized with her syllabus. If you're looking for an easy fifth class, this is probably for you. Otherwise, find something else."
