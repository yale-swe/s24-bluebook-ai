    "Really interesting, but be prepared to do all the reading, which is a lot, in order to keep up. Also, think carefully whether you want to be in a class with law students. As smart as you may be, they will still know so much more than you, and it will be hard to keep up.",
    "It's an interesting subject matter but not as exciting and groundbreaking as I wanted it to be. The course was a little disconnected and though it was great to take a course with law school students, I felt that they were better prepared to discuss the topics presented based on prior experiences.",
    "Often this class felt like the professors were positing questions to state their own intellectual perspective. While there is a fair amount of discussion, there was not a lot of debate about the issues brought up, because the teachers often drew students' responses back towards their main points. Combined with the amount of reading per week, this class was very frustrating. Also, the course grade is one paper that you write at the end of the year with little guidance. I would think very long before deciding to take this seminar.",
    "I have deeply mixed feelings about this class, but would probably recommend against.Strengths were the fellow students - it attracted a really impressive group of folks who were always on point in the seminar, spoke with brevity, generally had insightful comments, engaged each other and the readings, etc. In few other seminars would so many students have come to extra sessions (which the profs were kind enough to both organize and provision)Another strength was Prof. Shapiro's ability to simply state and explain the core of a problem.However, Prof. Shapiro seems pretty checked out of teaching by now. WhileI appreciate his insights, he would \"go fishing\" with the students in the seminar, asking for their thoughts on a topic but not accepting or engaging with any ideas other than the one he had in mind going into the discussion. More generally, because Prof. Graetz was rather long-winded, Prof. Shapiro wouldn't speak but once or twice during an entire seminar.Prof. Graetz, on the other hand, was quite discursive in his leadership of the seminar. Prof. Graetz unnecessarily and unproductively dominated our \"discussions\" with long-winded points and irrelevant, or barely related, stories. He could've very easily made the same points in 90 seconds that he instead took 15 minutes on. This made it hard for students to engage in discussion, and led to me checking out of the class at times.Another weakness, though this is partially my fault, is the lack of feedback from professors. The final paper is pretty much only assignment for the entire class, and is the basis for the entire grade, as best I know. We never got written comments on our reading responses (we each did 2), feedback on prospectuses for our papers, or comments about our participation in class. Nada."
