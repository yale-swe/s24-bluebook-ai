   "comments": [
    "Comparative skills, political philosophy knowledge, essay writing.",
    "Learned about all of the main classical theorists, good survey cours.",
    "Overview of Social theory with a special focus on Durkheim, Marx, Weber and Tocqueville.",
    "We learned about social theory. I don't really know if I developed skills or insights - I guess I know how to write papers about complex material I don't understand. Personally I found the material to be inaccessible and dense, and the discussions did nothing to clear it up. I do have more of an awareness of the general idea of what dead white men thought about social theory. To be honest, I have no idea what I was supposed to take from this class.",
    "I got my first glimpse of social theory and political philosophy in this class and was able to navigate those types of texts for the first time.",
    "This course is a great way to delve into the pillars of sociology (Durkheim, Marx, Weber, etc.). Some awesome questions that you will delve into are: what holds society together, what is religion, what are the sociological consequences of capitalism and the division of labor, how did capitalism emerge, etc. As a Political Science major, I found this class very insightful insofar as it is at the border of political philosophy (Marx 3).",
    "I think learning theory is a great way to develop analytical frameworks to approach other areas of inquiry. You probably should read these books anyways, but you could also read some reviews or Wikipedia pages and might be able to get the same out of the class. I guess it is nice to have someone guide you through the readings; however, this might be better taught as a lecture course.",
    "Key review of works in foundations of sociology. Marx and Weber readings were really awesome, I hate Tocqueville, Durkheim is a weirdo, Hegel is God, turns out Adam Smith didn't hate the poor!",
    "An effective introduction to the following authors: Durkheim, Marx, Weber and Tocqueville. I learnt a great deal about the founding sociological theories. The seminar format was a bit tough as readings could be dense and you were expected to have a firm grasp on the material before class in order to contribute in class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Quizzes are horribly misleading and tricky. Discussion is fun and relaxed. Overview of major thinkers.",
    "Courses that are required for sociology majors shouldn't be cross listed with other disciplines. There were times where I found myself wondering why I was in a political theory class. There should have been much more emphasis on the sociological relevance of the readings, situating them in the development of sociological discourse, with much more attention on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the texts in relation to sociology as it's understood today. I spent many weeks reading these classical theorists with no framework for how to interpret them, which is an unfortunate waste of time and intellectual discipline.",
    "Interesting things to learn about but sometimes found it hard to engage in discussion because the material is challenging at times.",
    "This course should not be taught as a seminar. While I thought I would enjoy it more as a seminar, the class was far too large and could not effectively be taught at this size. Prof. Gorski could not teach the basic facts of the text and so I felt like I did not learn anything from this course that I didn't already know.",
    "The strength was that it met once a week. There were many weaknesses. For starters, this is just not a class that should be taught as a seminar. There's way too much reading, and the material doesn't warrant discussions. The class was basically just a lecture anyways - the professor would lecture for the first hour, and then we'd usually split into groups and fumble to find something to discuss, which was always just a waste of time. Several of the classes just turned into 2 hour lectures, which is just miserable. I also thought it was absurd to have weekly reading quizzes count for 20% of the grade. When you're reading close to 200 pages a week, a 3 question multiple choice reading quiz is a terrifying assessment, especially when the questions are difficult. It felt pointless to even do the reading if I knew I was going to do poorly on the reading quizzes anyways. It made me incredibly apathetic about doing the reading, as I felt I was just doing it for the quizzes as opposed to actually engaging with the material. The classes themselves were long and boring and not actually very helpful. This is very complex material, and throwing students into discussion groups is hard when very few people understand what's actually being written about. The class would be much better as a lecture that spent each class digging in to the reading and giving students a better understanding of the material.",
    "Although this was a seminar, it often felt like a lecture, and when students were asked to discuss the reading material, conversation was lackluster and not very meaningful. Almost no effort was made to connect the material to contemporary thought or reality, which made it challenging for students to relate to or invest in the material. I think a lot of the women and people of color felt alienated by the course's overwhelming focus on theories that did not take their existences into account, and the fact that the professor and TA did not address this very much was disheartening.",
    "The course material of PLSC 290 is really great and engaging. The Professor does a great job at making the class interesting, engaging and accessible. I wish we spend a little less time summarizing the pieces and more time critiquing them. It'd be awesome to identify flaws in the theories that we go over and briefly talk about theorists that suggested alternative frameworks. I also thought that the essay questions could be a little more original (comparing theories can be a bit dull at times). They also tend to be very broad (like the final essay question asking to compare *four* sociologists and identify a conceptualization of homo sociologicus common to their works). I also think that the quiz questions could be a bit ambiguous, which is a pain given the weight of the quizzes in the final grade.",
    "Since there were two essays and a final exam, felt like the workload piled up. Perhaps more organized course, sometimes I didn't even know the readings until the day before when the TA would email us the correct page numbers.",
    "The course had its ups and downs. Gorski could provide stronger discussion leading and the weekly quizzes were kind of a bad idea and not particularly helpful, especially since we didn't really get the graded quizzes back. Two essays, weekly quizzes, and a final is a lot, especially considering quizzes and the second paper weren't used as a learning tool.",
    "Some of the course's strengths included the variety of students taking the class, in terms of major and year. In addition, the readings were generally interesting. The main weaknesses were the way that the class was structured and the weekly pop quizzes. Though it was a seminar, there weren't many opportunities to engage with students in conversations that delved deeper into the readings or share ideas that were beyond condensing the material. Since the class was designed as a lecture originally and this was the first year it was a seminar, these issues might be smoothed out over time.",
    "The class's strength is its syllabus. The chosen passages of the books consistently gave me a good understanding of the theorist's work without redundancy or superfluous reading. The classes themselves varied in usefulness. It was at times an odd mixture of lecture and discussion, with either Prof. Gorski or the TA explaining the theorists concepts for fifteen minutes then switching to a whole class discussion, then to a small group discussion, and then back to lecture. At the end of the day, there should be a balance, but overall I thought the directed discussions and the small group sessions were definitely less helpful than free class discussions or lecture.",
    "Reducing the number of students in the seminar. Receiving grades was haphazard. I still have no idea where I stand.",
    "There were a lot of issues with this class. The class was way too large for participation to actually be a part of the grade. With this being an introductory class in theory, it should have been taught as a lecture with sections. It was clear who in the class had prior experience with theory because they were comfortable participating and those who were new to theory had a difficult time. The quizzes were intentionally filled with tricky questions, which is fine. But when so much of the grade is based off of them in a class without a curve, they ended up being very stressful despite the fact that they were only meant to see if the readings were done.",
    "This class is usually taught as a lecture but was instead a seminar style this semester. Given the introductory nature of this course, I think the lecture style much better suits the aim of introducing students to social theory. The readings are dense and often represent only fragments of the larger theory so a more comprehensive overview would have helped me better grasp the authors' ideas and relationships to each other as opposed to discussing selected topics in depth. Additionally I would have liked to see the addition of women and people of color to the syllabus.",
    "Great to be taught this difficult material in a seminar setting, rather than a lecture.",
    "This class should not be taught as a seminar. Since the class is a required intro course for sociology majors, I would strongly recommend that the class be taught as a lecture. The difficulty of texts would best be tackled for beginners in a lecture format as it is confusing for students to sift through the 20 different interpretations of a given text when it's the first time they have gone over the material."

    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who has a strong foundation in Marx and Weber. I'm not sure why you would take this course if you're not a sociology major, but many students did, and they usually already had a background in the authors we covered and did really well without nearly as much effort. As a foundational course for sociology majors, I apologize that this course is a requirement.",
    "Yes but I didn't love the discussion, might be easier as a lecture course",
    "I doubt this course will be taught as a seminar again due to how poorly it went. Don't take this course if it's a seminar.",
    "No. If you have to take it for the sociology major, wait until it's a lecture. Not worth it - way too much reading and incredibly dull and boring seminars.",
    "This course caused most students an unspeakable amount of frustration and confusion. I learned very little and was unable to see the relevance of many of the texts we read. Discussion was poor and broader themes were unclear. Wait until Emily Erikson teaches the class again.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to other students.This course is a great way to delve into the pillars of sociology (Durkheim, Marx, Weber, etc.). Some awesome questions that you will delve into are: what holds society together, what is religion, what are the sociological consequences of capitalism and the division of labor, how did capitalism emerge, etc. As a Political Science major, I found this class very insightful insofar as it is at the border of political philosophy (Marx 3).",
    "Take it if you're a SOCY major, but perhaps use your two credit D classes on these theory classes. You still get the broad ideas from these theories, which are important for understanding foundations of future work, but you don't have to worry about getting trivial details correct.",
    "This is a good overview of the four main theorists the class focuses on. Overall, it's a pretty powerful sociological framework that you can use to analyze today's world. A highlight of the class for me was writing the second paper on Max Weber and Karl Marx's views of Donald Trump. Durkheim, Tocqueville, Marx, and Weber all have points that relate highly to modern society, and the class is a good opportunity to read and critically grapple with their ideas. You'll definitely get out of the class what you put in. It can be a wonderful opportunity to rethink your interpretation of society, if you treat it that way. On the other hand, it would be relatively easy to get by without doing much of the reading.",
    "Good course. Professor Gorski is very knowledgable and has a great teaching style. He makes these texts very accessible.",
    "Yes, an effective introduction to sociological thought! This course will make you question modern society, it is incredible to note the relevance of these authors in the contemporary world.",
    "I would recommend that unless you have a background in theory, you start off the class Cr\/D. I really wish that I had. As a sociology major it was a required course, so I couldn't drop it. If possible, wait until the class is taught by Professor Erickson again or when they change the structure of the course to be a lecture with section. Otherwise, I'd avoid it. I learned a lot but it was a struggle.",
    "Yes -- the texts you read are seminal texts in the development of social thinking on class, economics, and culture. The class was anchored around a really stimulating reading list.",
    "I would recommend this course if it is being taught in a lecture format. The material was all interesting but the seminar format used this semester was hard for me to follow given that this course was my introduction to the discipline.",
    "If the class is taught as a seminar again, do not take it.."
