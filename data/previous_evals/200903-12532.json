    "i loved this class. it's essentially a philosophy class, but the gushiest philosophy ever -- death, love, the meaning of life, non of that analytic bullshit you got so sick of in the philosophy department. in fact, turns out fink and karsten harries are virtually the only professors in this school who teach continental philosophy. i don't think heidegger and kierkegaard are really on any other reading lists, and god knows you're not gonna read them on your own (in all fairness, you might not do all the reading for this class either, which is ok).prof. fink is awesome, totally relaxed. she essentially seems like a mom kinda hanging out in the class, facilitating the discussions a little bit, throwing in her own opinions.warning though, the stuff you read is depressing. anything titled \"the sickness unto death\" and using the word 'despair\" at least twice a sentence is bound to bring you down, even if you can gain salvation by resting transparently in your creator.might just change your life, also. just a maybe.take it, though i'm not totally sure it's gonna get taught again. prof. fink, i heard as a rumor, didn't get tenure, which is a disgrace if you ask me, but no one did.this class runs the risk of being taken over by Ds kids, but you know what, some ds kids got some really interesting stuff to say. some, though, don't.take it take it take it.",
    "This is definitely more of a philosophy class than a literature class and you should be prepared for really dense readings and high-level discussions, but it's really rewarding if you put in the effort.",
    "Great syllabus. Important works. Intelligent discussion. A few short papers and one long term paper. These are all characteristics of great Yale courses. It's a great course.",
    "Read some really, really powerful works and some canonical philosophy. Talk about them with one of Yale's greatest professors. Be happy.",
    "You will regret not doing it. If you are lucky enough to get in, it is your moral obligation to take and love this class.",
    "Yeah. The syllabus should probably be a bit different next time (Kierkegaard and Schiller should totally stay though), but overall it was a great class. Work was interesting but never exhausting, most of the students had interesting things to say once in a while, and, praise the Lord, it wasn't annoying and comp lit-y.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course. I came into it mainly for the literature and found it to be a bit philosophy heavy. This shouldn't have come as a surprise given the syllabus (2 or 3 works of philosophy for every short work of literature), but discussions tended to delve deep into the philosophy without retaining much of a connection to the literature, despite Professor Fink's attempts to keep things on track. It's filled with philosophy buff former DSers, but I suppose it is a humanities class... In any case, the workload is quite reasonable -- you'll probably find yourself poring over hours of boring stuff the night before, but it gets really interesting in class. Your classmates will surely impress you. Don't zone out in class or you'll get hopelessly lost as the discussion evolves.",
    "Russian Lit\/Western Phil is a very good class. I particularly enjoyed the opportunity to read several shorter rather than a few long ones. The syllabus is excellent on the whole. Chekhov's short stories, Dostoevsky's \"Notes from Underground,\" and Kierkegaard's \"Sickness Unto Death\" were particular highlights for me. Prof. Fink is very knowledgeable and gives very good introductory lectures on each work, but she allows student discussion to shape each class. In addition, she is friendly, welcoming, gives creative paper assignments, and very understanding of student concerns. My only reservation about the class was that, given that our class was composed of so many confident and opinionated students, I think it would have been okay for Prof. Fink to push us to articulate our views clearly. Sometimes, I thought we were allowed to get away with being glib. Yet Professor Fink leads very well by example, and for the most part that was enough to encourage us to be good discussants.",
    "I would recommend it to you if you are interested in the material.",
    "A stellar syllabus with a professor clearly very familiar with the Russian literature. Though the class discussion can sometimes meander, probably worth taking for the readings alone.",
    "Hilary Fink is a terrific professor, but this class was somewhat sub-par, mainly because it's hard to discuss philosophical texts well in a lit class. You should take a different class with her instead, because it's more fun to just discuss the philosophical ideas presented by the literature itself, which is what happens in her other classes.",
    "YES!",
    "Yes.",
    "You will not regret taking this course.",
    "This is a challenging and wonderfully thought provoking course - and you need to actively participate and read all the material in order to make it worth your while. We covered a wide range of philosophies in relation to a few very specific Russian texts, synthesizing a good deal of potentially overwhelming material in a coherent and accessible manner. However, I would not suggest this class as an introduction to Russian lit or western philosophy; it jumps around too much, it's not concerned with giving you a \"grounding.\" Instead, it is more of a virtuosic riff on that grounding - so if you've already read some Tolstoy, Heidegger, Dostoevsky, etc. and thought about it, then you are in a good position. All in all, a fantastic lens by which to learn more about Russia: relations between East and West, Past and Present.",
    "A very good class. The reading list is great -- Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, and Chekhov for the writers, and Rousseau, Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Schopenhauer, Heidegger, and others for the philosophers. But what I liked most was the way the class approaches literature and philosophy. We focused on the ideas in the works of literature -- so many times in English classes I really want to talk about the worldview the author is putting forward, and the implications of it, but it doesn't seem appropriate in a class dedicated to close-reading and purely literary analysis. This class was different, though, and we were encouraged to think about literature \"philosophically,\" which I thought was great. Professor Fink did a great job introducing the writers and guiding discussions -- the discussions were very student-led, and she only stepped in to guide things to point us towards interesting and important topics for discussion.",
    "Judged by the reading load alone, it's a fantastic class - the readings are deep and provoking. Prof. Fink is not - she mostly just sits there. So if you like what you see on the reading list, shop the class. Ifyou don't like the people in it, GET OUT, because Prof. Fink will not stop anyone from speaking on any topic, regardless of relevance or intellectual contribution. What you learn is almost exclusively in your hands. So find some friends and take it together - you will have a blast!"
