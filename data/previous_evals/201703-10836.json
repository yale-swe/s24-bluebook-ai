We read a few short stories and short readings about different aspects of Korean culture, and we also used dialogues to see how the grammar structures that we were learning would be used in conversation."

    "More group projects would be fun",
    "I liked that we practiced our Korean in several different ways, through the readings, speaking practice, and written homework assignments. Choi Sunsaengnim is very good about giving feedback on written assignments with a pretty fast turn-around (for a short homework assignment, you usually get it back the next day), and that was something that I thought was really helpful. I also thought some of the culture readings that we did were pretty interesting, so it was cool to be able to challenge myself by doing the readings. The dialogues could be interesting because they were more like real conversations that the other readings, and it was interesting to see how grammar could be modified in less formal settings. That being said, they were a little dated and could feel a little random at times. Sometimes we weren't as engaged as a class as we could have been, and that could make in-class speaking a little awkward, but I still liked that we had the chance to practice speaking a lot in class. I also liked the Choi Sunsaengnim corrected our pronunciation and usually pointed out when the pronunciation of a certain syllable was different from the way that it was written."

    "I really enjoy learning Korean and I think that it's a really interesting language. If you're interested in learning Korean, then I would say that you should definitely take the opportunity to study it while you're at Yale, especially since it isn't widely taught in America. The class size of this course was also pretty small, so you can definitely get individual attention from the instructor and you have the opportunity to ask questions whenever you don't fully understand something."
