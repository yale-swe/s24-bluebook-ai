   "comments": [
    "Great course to take!",
    "The WR without needing tests made this a relatively low stress class, that really allowed me to focus on, be thorough about, and write good papers about what interested me the most.",
    "It depends what you're looking for. It is a pretty painless WR credit, but there are probably others out there that are just as good. The best part of this course were Prof Holloway's lectures, and if you're really interested you can watch them on Open Yale. A lot of the readings were interesting, but there is a lot of reading and sometimes I just didn't get to everything (which I found stressful, but if you're good at that, then you can take this course).",
    "I would recommend this class as a writing credit. There is a decent amount of work (reading response of primary source response every week, 8 page midterm, 12 page final, section), but you don't need to do all of it. You can pick and choose which readings you actually want to do and get by.",
    "African American Studies 162 is a good survey course for African American history. The writing component involves only 2 papers and is not terribly challenging. Therefore, the course could be used for a Wr credit if it fits in your schedule.",
    "Absolutely take this class. My senior thesis topic was born out of it. Amazing and diverse reading list. Also, take the WR section. Two papers and two drafts vs. two exams and one paper (non-writing).",
    "Good intro course for both American Studies and Afam Studies. Take it WR if you don't mind a couple of papers. If you want a relatively easy Humanities credit, this would be a good choice, as well.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course - it will teach you the underlying history of this nation that is either not taught or not taught effectively.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes. This class is a great way to learn US hisotry.",
    "I would recommend this class as a writing credit.",
    "As an Econ major who was interested in taking a class on history and politics, this course was PERFECT! It was interesting, the lectures were cool, the readings were all very different, the sections were great ... supposedly if you are an American Studies Major, this is all review. But if you aren't (like me) than the class is a GREAT crash course in some of the big players (as well as lesser known yet super interesting players) of the last century. Take it.",
    "YES. Everyone at Yale should take this course!! We should all walk away from our college education with this knowledge.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It was not too much work and it was interesting to learn about a topic that not many people have extensive knowledge on.",
    "I would recommend this course--a great lecture on important history, with reasonable exams if you don't do the WR section. holloway brings new insights to a period in history you've likely learned some stuff about before.",
    "would recommend it!",
    "This is definitely a very interesting class and I do recommend it to anyone interested in learning US History from a viewpoint outside of mainstream.",
    "Don't take it unless you have to for AFAM. Holloway just goes through the motions and it is not worthwhile. The TAing is equally bad. If you've never taken AFAM history before, it's so important, and I wish this was more exciting.",
    "Take it",
    "This class is really fascinating BUT I have two pieces of advice for students:1) Do NOT take the non-writing section of this class. Unless you're someone who is really good at IDs, there's just too much to memorize and I never did well on the tests, no matter how hard I studied. The writing section is way easier and I recommend that instead2) Do NOT take this Credit\/D\/Fail. They're too much work and reading to make it a really enjoyable and easy Credit\/D class.",
    "Decent course, but only take it if you are really interested in African American history and specifically African American literature and culture. The course did not cover much \"hard\" history but talked about African American thought and cultural movements. The course was also a bit disorganized and all over the place.",
    "A survey of the history of black Americans within he wider scope of American history. It's not just a history class, but a crucial introduction to relating race as a historically specific concept and thinking about race critically.",
    "As a science major who had never taken a history course before, I would definitely recommend this class either as a writing credit or a glimpse into history at Yale. The glass was engaging and provided an alterative view of history to the narrative we usually hear. The books we read were also very interesting.",
    "If you are taking an WR section, this class is very manageable. Lectures are very interesting, sections center around lecture themes and weekly readings, and the midterm and final paper are very doable.",
    "A wonderful introduction to African-American history, with great lectures and readings. Take it!",
    "Good class if you like the course material definitely take it! Workload is very manageable.",
    "A waste of time. Gave me grief. Anti-white.",
    "Really good and would definetely recommend. However, I thought that some things were left out. Overall a great survey course.",
    "Yes! Take it! Great class. Amazing lecture, great reading selections. Also two papers is very manageable and a great way to et your writing cred!",
    "Everyone should take an African-American studies class, and if you take one, this should be it. It's a good way to get a survey perspective on African-American history as a crucial and understudied part of American history.Some people love Professor's Holloway's style, some hate it. He is definitely not the most engaging or dynamic professor, but he knows his stuff and clearly is passionate about it. Sometimes he is a little... uneloquent. But I still enjoyed this class over all. The syllabus is awesome! Take it!"
