   "comments": [
    "French 110 is a very good way to begin your study of French. All the classes are taught in French and the course moves rather quickly, getting all the way through the pass\u00c3\u00a9 compose by the end of the semester. I would recommend French 110 to anyone who's looking to learn the language, and is willing to put in a decent amount of work. The Capretz method may take some time to get used to especially if you're used to more formal, rigid methods for learning a language. Also it can be challenging if you fall behind in the course, and it's very important that you remain up to date on the material, as if you don't it will show in the weekly tests. Ngame is a very good instructor and he's advice is very beneficial. By the end of the semester I came away feeling I had truly learned something, and I look forward to next semester.",
    "Anyone who is hoping to learn a completely new language at Yale should take this class. While the workload was a bit much, it was completely necessary to understand the material.",
    "If you are even thinking of taking the class, take it. It is a lot of work, but it is so worth it. I cannot believe how much French I have learned over the course of 3 months!TAKE IT",
    "If you are interested in learning a new language, French 110 is for you. You will learn French surprisingly quickly and even have some fun along the way.",
    "If you are committed to working really hard to learn the French language, then absolutely go for this class. The French department is one of the best at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend french and especially with Professeur Ngame. It is a lot of work but it is very well taught and a lot of fun. You follow a storyline and so you always have things to talk about. Ngame is extremely encouraging and a very good teacher. He always just looks so happy when you talk or try out a new tense or something that it is difficult not to try.",
    "After taking French 110, I knew a lot more French than I thought would be possible after one semester. The workload is kind of heavy, but it's definitely worth it because you learn so much of a new language. I would strongly recommend for anyone who wants to be good at French, or just take a really interesting and fun class.",
    "I am a native Spanish speaker and so this class was quite a bit easier in some ways than it was for other students. I had trouble with a few specific aspects of the language, but overall I found this class fun and extremely effective- its excellent reputation is well-earned. This class is a serious time commitment. You need to do the homework every week, at the very least, and you cannot afford to fall behind at all as the material builds upon itself. This being a language class, that makes sense and I expected this going into it. I strongly, strongly recommend this class.",
    "French 110 04 is an introductory course for learning French. Though it is more work, the class is effective for learning French, so I would recommend it to other students.",
    "Yes. Definitely take it. This is an amazing language program. You will learn a lot in a very short period of time. Highly immersive. Take it with Ngame if you can.",
    "I would certainly recommend it. The class is very fast paced and you do need to stay on top of your work to keep up, but I think it provides a very solid foundation for further study and exposes students to a lot of material in a brief period of time.",
    "I love the French language, but it is very difficult to learn. A lot of people in the class have studied Spanish before and picked up French quicker. I had never studied any language before, and I definitely struggled. There's a lot of work every week that is difficult to keep on top of. Please do the workbook exercises before the test! You can even do them all in one sitting."
