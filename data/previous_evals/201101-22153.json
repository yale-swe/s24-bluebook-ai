   "comments": [
    "I think this is a course only for those who REALLY want to be architects.",
    "An experiment in repetition, tediousness, and endurance... but a good experience and a very good course for your drawing skillz.",
    "This is the gateway to the major. If you don't want to major in architecture, take the Analytic Model instead, if you're brave enough.",
    "This is not really a creative art class. It is for people who want to learn how to represent buildings. The assignments are long and tedious. I don't think I would take the class if I didn't have to for the major.",
    "a lot of tedious work",
    "SO MUCH WORK!",
    "I'd recommend this if you want to practice drawing buildings for credit. This course teaches through the sheer quantity of work rather than teaching any concrete method of drawing, but you'll learn a great deal about buildings on campus and elsewhere through drawing them a lot and in a multitude of ways. Also, go to your TAs or Professor Agran for advice, that ensures that you'll learn more about how to draw beyond the more conceptual lectures (which are great, just not about technique).",
    "This class will ready help you improve your drawing skills, and teach a lot about taking the time to complete assignments. Take it only if you plan to be an Architecture major, or really love to draw.",
    "I would recommend it, but not if you are seeking specific instruction in the skills of drawing. It is a lot of work, and requires you to develop on your own. This happens through some pretty tedious assignments with frustrating constraints (enormous plans and elevations with no rulers, for example). But this has a lot of value in that you are forced to produce a large quantity of drawings, which inherently improves your abilities.",
    "DISCLAIMER: I did enjoy this class overall.This class consisted of weekly \"lectures\" and sections. The \"lectures\" actually were 1.99 hours long critiques or on-site drawing exercises, with about a .01 hour long lectures that were often quite abstract. Sections, too, were usually spent critiquing work you had done the previous week. This means that very little instruction actually happened. You would receive an assignment at the end of class each week, and then get thrown out to sea with nothing but one or two examples shown in class and your classmates equally jumbled thoughts to guide you.You will produced a staggering amountof work over the semester. The first half of the class is focused on completely freehand drawings. After spring break, you being drafting hard-line drawings. The first assignment will take you about 4 hours. The last will take you about 40. It's essentially an upward climb in between. If you take this class, you MUST start each assignment early and actually put time into them. Otherwise your work will suck and you will have wasted a significant part of your semester.To sum up, it feels great to pump out 60+ drawings by the end. But I wouldn't take it unless your intending to major in architecture. This is for two reasons - it's a good intro to how much work you will do in the major. Also, as a prospective major myself I wish I had had some more personal critique time rather than the time spent on non-arch majors.",
    "This class should only be taken by those interested in the architecture major. I find the course work load excessive and therefore only those that are personally invested in the major would make the effort necessary to complete the assignments at the standard professor agran expects.",
    "Non-Architecure Majors!!This class will improve your drawing skills from practice, not so much instruction. Although drafting is a waste of time (unless you want know how to draft), this is only the last two or three weeks of the semester. Expect not to gain much from in-class reviews, but you will gain a fair amount for the sheer amount of work you will be required to do. Don't worry! The workload is definitely manageable\/not overwhelming!",
    "Very unique class at Yale--lots of precise drawing work, so you see major improvement by the end, but unless you are interested in pursuing architecture, or enjoy very technical drawing and nit-picking, it will definitely be a struggle for you to justify this class's work to yourself by mid-semester",
    "If you're a non-major looking for an interesting class about architecture, try Intro Architecture or Energy, Environment, Building or even one of the seminars. And no, this will not improve your artistic ability, unless you like drawing straight lines. This class takes huge amounts of time. It is an interesting class, but if you don't have to take it, don't.",
    "This is not an art course, and I would not take it unless you plan on majoring in architecture, severely testing yourself, or attempting to understand why architects never get any sleep. I have always loved drawing, but this class found a way to suck the spirit out of my passion on several occasions. If you do take this class, make sure that you hold onto your soul. Find a way to love every drawing you make - find a way to bend every assignment to your will without straying from the parameters you are given - create something new and unique with each assignment - something that excites you and keeps you going. If you can do that, you will love this course, and, in all likelihood, Victor will love you. If you don't, this class will be torturous.",
    "Victor is a sweetheart. No one could dislike him (at first). Await the day he takes the entire class out in the snow and below zero winds to draw Harkness Tower at sunset --- that's when the class splits into lovers and haters. It's a thrilling ride in the first weeks of class because the classroom never stays in one place. One week you're sketching grandfather clocks in a furniture study museum in some forgotten basement, next week you're drawing the entire face of the British Arts Center. Take this class if you love pencil drawing. But beware Artists! The course is ultimately designed to train you for architectural drafting and analysis. If you love color and can't stand using rulers for every line that you make, this class is not for you."
