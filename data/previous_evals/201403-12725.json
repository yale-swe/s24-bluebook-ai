   "comments": [
    "Calculus. I would not recommend the course because of the flipped classroom model.",
    "Yes, it is a great class for people looking to fulfill a QR credit.",
    "All of Math 115 is still under a lot of development, so be prepared to be a guinea pig and have an unusual and ineffective teaching style imposed on you.",
    "If you're coming out of high school with BC Calculus experience and expect Math 115 to be an easy ride, you're mistaken (at least in my case anyway). There's plenty more material than covered by the AP Program and it's at a much quicker pace. The flipped classroom business is not your friend but it's nice to have videos to review with because class time is usually spent one to two problems based on a concept you learned. While the professors (who kind of act like a group) are considerate and will work with you (offering several review sessions), there's a disparity between the problem sets and the exams but the exams are certainly passable if you study hard and practice. One of those \"don't take it unless it's a pre-requisite for something\" type of classes. Professor Auel is the bomb. He's legitimately excited to teach his students (in a quirky mad professor type of way) and will go out of his way to make sure individuals understand all of the concepts. His teaching style is fluid and demands your attention. He's also not afraid to goof off for a few minutes and tell you interesting (and sometimes relevant) things about mathematics, math history, or current events. He's not the only professor with which the class is enjoyable with but he is definitely the best, try your best to take it with him.",
    "Math 115 is Calculus BC but more intense. The content is generally the same but it crams it all into a few weeks instead of the full year therefore making it hard to grasp the information. Unfortunately because of the lack of in-depthness I would say I just made it through and probably couldn't teach anyone calculus based on what I learned. If you took BC senior year i recommend it but if you took it before senior year the content isn't that fresh so it is not as easy as you may think.",
    "A pretty standard Calc II two course, notwithstanding the flipped classroom approach. Take it with Professor Auel if you can.",
    "Math 115 was a very enriching course and the teaching is excellent. I would recommend the course to anyone, math-oriented or not, as it is a good experience and it can be very applicable to other subjects.",
    "This is an advanced math calculus course where you will learn a lot quickly.",
    "This course covers the second half of single variable calculus, covering integration techniques, series, and some applications. The course requires two midterms, a final, and a weekly problem set. The problem sets are not too long and are very close to the exam in difficulty and so I highly recommend you put the appropriate time towards them.",
    "This class is manageable for someone who has taken calculus before. However, you must put in a significant amount of work. If you took AP Calculus AB only in high school, you will find it challenging.",
    "This course is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in learning calculus.",
    "You learn math. I would recommend it to another student because it was fairly straightforward and there are lots of resources like peer tutors to get help and review sessions before tests. Beware that there is a flipped classroom.",
    "Math 115 is a challenging course if you have not had exposure to BC calculus before. If you have had exposure to BC calc, this class should not be too difficult and you will be at an advantage.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROF. ASHER AUEL. Odds are you need this for a pre-req anyway, so you might as well take it with a great instructor. He has a great personality, is open to questions, and best of all, he won't waste your time with any of the prescribed in-class problems if he sees they're not helping the class. He really just knows how to explain concepts and understands what the class needs as far as help goes. The class isn't too hard. The problem sets from the book are the hardest problems you'll get, so make sure you get an early start so you can grab help from tutors. The exams are moderate in difficulty; just make sure to study using the old exams on classes V2. It's the best preparation. Also, make sure to try out multiple peer tutors because some are WAY better than others.",
    "Math 115 gives you a firm grasp on Calc BC material. I don't think I learned anything new but I am glad I took the class because I am way more familiar with the material now. I feel more confident in my mathematical abilities."
