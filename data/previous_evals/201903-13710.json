    "I learned how to develop excel models to evaluate the profitability of forest properties. Both instructors (Grant & Spalding) were excellent!",
    "I was able to grasp financial analysis models, understand how timberland investments work and engage with visiting speakers in practice. The material was current and practical.",
    "The course opened my mind to how forests are valued. It was a good refresher of time value of money computations as well.",
    "Basic experience with and application of financial tools such as net present value calculations and financial proforma modeling.",
    "I learned core financial concepts and modeling. Specifically: NPV, HBU, discounting, compounding, and continuities.",
    "I learned a lot of new skills about calculating a budget and projecting revenue into the future.",
    "Quite helpful to my focus on forest economics.",
    "I learned about land valuation, developing models for continued resource management, and understanding how discount rates are calculated. A very good introduction to natural resources finance.",
    "I learned some practical information about how to do forest land deals.",
    "I learned some basic skills in forest finance and how to use spreadsheets. This class was very valuable to learning this skills despite being too short.",
    "I learned how to do a net present value (NPV) analysis of forest investments in Excel. I also learned how TIMOs work: invest in land for 10 years and then clearcut it and sell it for real estate development. We did not learn about any ethics involved in large-scale forestland investment, possibly because they don't exist. Nor did we learn any critique of the TIMO model from an ethical standpoint."

   "comments": [
    "Better! the lectures were clear and straightforward, hw assignments were explained well, and information was practical.",
    "Very much. In my practice, I would like to be able to make decisions with financial elements in mind. I was able to learn important techniques and models I can use to evaluate investment decisions, which is a skill I desire to utilize during my professional practice.",
    "Very well",
    "Very well.",
    "Learned lots of information!",
    "Very well as I am pursuing forest economics.",
    "Very well - I don't know if I'm quite ready to do this myself but it is great professional experience.",
    "The skills did align with my expectations; however, I hoped for more instruction from Deborah and more in-depth forest finance analysis and spreadsheet skills."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't change anything. I also like that FF was split from ecosystem finance.",
    "Strengths -I think the course does well to bring in speakers with practical experience. -The case studies are relevant and intuitive -The assignments are engaging and relevant Weaknesses -The case studies could draw a little more on global trends.",
    "Strengths: we discussed real world cases, had guest lecturers, had intimate dinners with the guests if we chose to sign up, and I liked the format of the exams.",
    "The hands on exercises were excellent, as were the readings. The largest weakness I felt was the physical location of the course. There were too many students for the Marsh Rotunda, and the room often got hot and stuffy, which lead to a late afternoon dreariness.",
    "Some classes were super dry, more real life examples would be helpful.",
    "Course is well placed, but few areas of improvement - some discussion on issues outside of the US such as global south, Europe, etc.",
    "Great class - could use a few more problem sets or things which test our understanding of the readings. Sometimes the readings introduced technical Terms of Art which were never included in class.",
    "Strengths: - The topic is sufficiently applied - The final project was interesting Weaknesses: - Sometimes there was not enough time in class to cover all of the material and perhaps this could be re-evaluated - Not enough support to complete the final assignment",
    "Deborah is a wonderful and thoughtful instructor who should be commended for her engaged lectures and approach to the material. Dominick was not a great lecturer and could serve from some public speaking lessons. I think the class could be improved by hosting a lab that teaches more in-depth spreadsheet skills. The class would benefit from a full term that includes more skills in Excel and analysis. Instead, it felt a bit rushed and incomplete.",
    "At the beginning of the course, the professors noted that the model they were presenting was the model that capitalist timber investment companies were operating under. While this may not be a model we agree with, they offered that it was useful to understand the model. I agree with this. However, they proceeded to present the model without any mention of alternatives, under the assumption that all decisions made in the universe of this class were decisions made 'rationally in the eyes of the market'. If I hear the phrase 'highest and best use' one more time I may go crazy. Also, as I said before, there was little mention of ethics, little mention of the environmental impacts of actions, little mention of social values and local communities - just a simple presentation of net present value analysis and how companies make decisions because they have to provide returns for their investors. I guess the professors warned us? Lastly- they assigned us problem sets but gave us very little instruction on how to do them."

   "comments": [
    "go to Ben's (TF) office hours. He is super patient and helpful.",
    "Students need to prepare to challenge themselves with available material BUT should also look forward to research outside content. The material covered is immense in a short time so should be very familiar or atleast willing to learn quickly how to use spreadsheets.",
    "Come with an open mind, ready to learn",
    "Take it.",
    "Readings are really helpful in framing the material and I would suggest doing before or after lecture. Assignments can definitely suck up your time with the different roads you can go down, so try to start earlier.",
    "A must for forestry students or those interested in aspects of forestry (e.g. forest economics).",
    "Ask questions - the instructors are professionals in this field and often offer really useful insights beyond what is offered in the class.",
    "I would not try to pair this class with Ecosystem Finance. It's almost amazing how decent Forest Finance was, and how almost disastrous the Ecosystem Finance class ended up. I was hungry for the quality of instruction in Forest Finance in Ecosystem Finance. I also wanted more time to explore timber markets but moved on quickly to ecosystems.",
    "Type \"=NPV\" in Excel and you will be caught up on the skills I am taking away from this course. Also, if you have learned anything in a social science course at FES, you will need to ignore it for the time period you are sitting through this lecture."
