   "comments": [
    "This is basically the college equivalent of AP Calculus BC and a good way to satisfy any necessary introductory mathematics requirements for your intended major. I would recommend this course - the workload is manageable; there are many resources at your disposal if you ever need help; and having different methods of assessment (weekly problem sets, 2 midterms, and 1 final exam) seems fair and comprehensive. However, if you are only looking for a QR distributional requirement, I would suggest looking elsewhere.",
    "Just a class you take if you have to. Try to take it with Rolf I think he was the best prof from what I've heard.",
    "Take this course with Professor Rolf if at all possible!! He is very enthusiastic, which issuch a large factor in making this class enjoyable. His explanations are quite clear, and I greatly appreciated his willingness to go back and answer questions during and after class. We seemed to whiz through the material, as a result of which I sometimes felt a bit confused, but the homework exercises and Professor Rolf's office hours were usually sufficient to clear up any difficulties I had. I found the focus on theoretical rather than merely example-based knowledge of concepts to be very useful, though I think even more could be done in that respect: occasionally, I would come across a type of problem on the homework (or even, unfortunately, on an exam) that was very different from what we had discussed in class, and so quite difficult. Also, the problem solving sessions and review sessions, while helpful in general, were not very useful on the many occasions where I had one or two specific questions, when I did not have two or three hours to spare in an evening. Thankfully, Professor Rolf was very accessible outside of class, and was happy to assist me.",
    "The midterms were rather difficult. Be sure to go to the problem solving sessions even if you think you understand the material; they help a lot. The final was more breadth, less depth than the midterms.",
    "I would recommend Math 115. It's difficult but manageable with practice and help on the material.",
    "If you're taking this class, it's probably because you have to. You're also probably not going to be a jaded junior who should've taken it years ago, like me, and my bitterness over this course probably doesn't apply to you. I disliked Math 115 immensely, even though Professor Rolf was objectively a pretty good lecturer. The exams were exponentially more difficult than what we were taught, and psets also often went above and beyond what had been explained to us in class. Sequences and series took up half the class and seemed utterly pointless. Don't take this class once you're old enough to know better; get it out of the way as soon as possible.",
    "I think knowing how to do basic integrals is a skill everyone coming out of Yale should have, and this class teaches that in the most interesting way possible I think.",
    "Math 115 is a difficult class. You will start with basic integration and U-substitution and jump straight into extremely complex integration and series. If you have only taken AP calculus AB and you feel a bit rusty after a summer off, take Math 112. Math 115 will still be there next semester. Many people who should place out of Math 115 bomb their placement tests on purpose for an easy A and it screws up the curve quite a bit. Only take this class if you need it for your major.",
    "Math 115 was challenging but rewarding. If you put in the time and studied, the info was clear. If you don't put time in though, the class can get confusing, as it does move at a quick pace with lots of material.",
    "This class is a bear. If you're not a STEM major or particularly inclined towards mathematics, you'd be better off taking 112. (This class was a struggle for people who got 5s in AP BC Calculus, so if you took AB in high school, 112 is the place for you. No lie.) There is such a large volume of homework expected that I never felt like I got anything out of my p-sets. Due to certain events (Hurricane Sandy, etc), we had several weeks of double problem sets - it was a nightmare.Moreover, the structure is different from what I was used to in a math class. You're expected to teach yourself a lot of the concepts or take time out of class to go to independent peer tutoring sessions. The midterms are very challenging (the first one was harder than the second one) and the final is tough as well. This class is definitely not one to take for kicks.",
    "I would take the class because I just think its useful to know math. However, the class really is not that enjoyable. This was Rolf's first year however, so hopefully he'll learn from his mistakes and make the class better in following semesters.",
    "Take the class. It is a great math class and you will learn. If you can, try and get it with Dr. Rolf, he is great. Also, make sure you look over each and every homework you get back as graders often didn't grade questions and would mark you off for them forgetting to grade. I had to give almost half of my assignments back to Dr. Rolf to re grade.",
    "It's a math class so don't expect it to be super easy. But, the curve is nice so it's not that bad",
    "Math 115 is a difficult class unless you excel at mathematics, and requires a bit of work. If someone wanted a challenge, I would tell them to take Math 115.",
    "I thought the class was challenging, but I learned a lot.",
    "I would recommend to anyone who took calc in high school.",
    "Mathematics 115 is a great class if you need to brush up on your calculus skills before heading the multivariable. A warning for anyone who hasn't taken AP Calculus BC before, this class is very fast-paced. Also, the professors are hit-or-miss. Either you get a professor that is difficult to understand or one that has a great format for teaching class. Professor Rolf is the best! Ultimately, you will need to read the book in order to fully understand what is taught in class.",
    "BC Calc AP on steroids. Don't take if you've already taken BC Calc, you'd be much better reviewing the concepts on your own and taking a higher level. Would not recommend unless required; not a particularly rewarding or enjoyable experience.",
    "It's a standard calculus course, and it will be difficult if you do not work at it. The material probably won't just \"click\" for you immediately. You will have to practice it. On the other hand, I never felt the class was impossible. It's a solid course.I would recommended for any student looking for a QR or building a math foundation. The course is never too hard to handle.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course. It is a math Course that challenges you but is taught well. A lot of additional support is added",
    "This class is HARD. If you didn't take BC calculus in high school, maybe take 112 and then take 115. It is not a logical continuation of AB. If you don't need this class for any reason and didn't particularly like math beforehand, don't take it, because it's not going to be a fun little extra. However, I did need this class and I feel like I know more math now, which I suppose is the point of taking a math class. Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger, and I'm not dead, so I guess 115 made me stronger."
