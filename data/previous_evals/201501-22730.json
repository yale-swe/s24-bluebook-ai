   "comments": [
    "I thoroughly recommend this class! It is a niche type of art history, but also very relevant (as you will realize later). The course is fun because many of the sections are in the YUAG. The writing assignments are not too bad, and you feel like you really have learned a lot by the final exam. I do not think this is a gut class, as there is regular work and participation required, but if you care just a little bit, you can definitely do well in the course even if you are relatively new to art history.",
    "Russian and Soviet art was a really great class overall, and I would absolutely recommend it. Each lecture was interesting and thoughtful, and each one built on the next in a way that made it feel like we were really thinking critically about each subject addressed and its relation to other areas of the course. For most people, Russian art is a total unknown, not covered by most survey courses and not really common knowledge. This course was not only a great introduction for me to the material, but it also went in depth enough to feel rewarding and intellectually engaging. Instead of a midterm we wrote a few short papers on the same work of art from the YUAG study gallery - this allowed us to really engage with the object and think about it critically and from multiple angles. The final involved a lot of memorization, but was extremely fair and even a bit fun. As an art history major, I would really recommend this course to other students in the major, or anyone interesting in learning something new and extremely interesting.",
    "This class is a really great overview of 19th and 20th century Russian art. If you are interested in Russia or the Avant-Garde, this is the class for you!",
    "I would tell anyone who asked that Russian art is worth learning about, and that this class is what made me realize that.",
    "As a graduating senior in a non-humanities major I can easily say this has been one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It would be a disservice to yourself if you don't take this course.",
    "It was a great course: Prof. Brunson is a lucid lecturer, and lectures were always interesting, well-planned, and accessible. Section, often held in the gallery, was usually a good discussion while looking at important objects. Can't think of almost any complaints. I'd definitely recommend it.",
    "HSARR 221 is a great introduction to the main Russian art movements from 18th century to present. It will study in depth the pinnacle of Russian art and will provide you a better understanding of Russian culture. Take it!",
    "This is a fantastic class! If you are interested in Russia or Art, you should definitely take it! You learn os much about the history of Russia and how their art is tightly wound to their history. There is definitely a fair amount of work, but that keeps you really engaged with the class. It's very rewarding at the end of the semester to feel like you have such a firm grasp on the material. Section once a week in the art gallery was always a highlight of the week.",
    "A wonderful course! This was a great first exposure to the world of Art History scholarship. What really made this course special for me were Professor Brunson's lectures. They were always engaging, meticulously prepared, and so interesting. During the last lecture, I realized the immensity of the journey I was about to finish. I also came to appreciate the vastness, diversity and interconnectedness of Russia's creative output. Who would've thought that Malevich was influenced by 19th century Realism, or predicted how ideas from 18th century portraiture would resurge in Socialist Realism? (Certainly not me!) I would recommend this course to anyone interested in a first exposure to Art History, as well as someone with prior experience in Art History who wants an overview of Russian art. Take it!",
    "I would easily recommend the course. It provides a surprising amount of information across a vast domain of work. Perhaps the quantity of reading assignment was a bit high, but hey, History of Art has that reputation!",
    "I would recommend the class even if you were not an art history major. The materials were fascinating and Professor Brunson is a superb lecturer. Sometimes I'd write down what she said just because it was so poignant. The course will equip you not only wih knowledge about russian art but essential skills in analyzing any sort of art work. I especially appreciated this class because it taught me the significance and contexts of modern and contemporary art and helped me to appreciate such works which I wasnt too fond of before.",
    "Definitely take it! If you have no prior interest in Russian culture or art history it might not be the best, but if you're at all interested in either go for it! It's a ton of fun and really a manageable work load."
