    "you have to make 20 paintins by the end of the semester, and most of your time is just spent working in your studio. will comes around and talks to you, and occasionally you meet as a group to discuss things. i really liked discussions they were just philosophy plus emotion plus how do i live my life and sometimes they were really helpful. but yeah dont expect structure and you definitely have to know how to make yourself work. but great experience.",
    "Great class! A lot of freedom to figure out what interests you, but you're still pushed outside your comfort zone and produce a LOT of work. You'll be pushed to *paint* art rather than appreciate it (which was a totally new experience for me. I'll never experience an art museum in the same way again).",
    "Take this class it is wonderful. The work is almost entirely independent, so you have the opportunity to investigate and explore your own ideas and put a lot of work into projects that are exciting to you.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a lot of work, and the professor takes your development as an artist very seriously. Take this class seriously, and you will do fine."
