    "It is discussion oriented and really not a class you can hide in the back row. You'll get called out if you don't do the reading& don't think before you speak. But you'll learn a ton and if you're at all interested in climate change or environmentalism this class should not be missed.",
    "I would definitely suggest this course to another graduate student or a thoughtful undergrad.",
    "Paleoclimates is a great survey of the history of Earth's climate and the over arching processes at work in the climate system. I'd recommend it for all majors and even non majors in forestry, anthropology, biology who work with systems effected by climate now and in the past."

    "This course gave me a synoptic view of Mesozoic and Cenozoic climates that I had previously lacked. It is helping me to put my climate-related research in context and to appreciate how similar research in other time periods might be different in the future.",
    "This course is directly related to my major research interests and has given me ideas for a minor discourse research project and will certainly help me with my qualifying exams."
