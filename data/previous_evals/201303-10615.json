    "I would cautiously recommend FREN 170 to a student who is eager to put in a lot of work and do a lot of reading. The readings are hard and long, but some of them are quite fascinating and Mme Girard provides insightful commentary.",
    "This is a good class, but it turned into more of a lecture than a seminar. The reading list makes it worth it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in reading the classic authors of French literature. It's going to be difficult to understand everything, but Mme Girard does a very good job of helping you progress in your french reading comprehension. My main hesitation with it was that it was at 9:00 AM, but it was worth waking up early for."
