   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this class for a student with strong prior knowledge and vested interest in the time period. For students seeking to acquaint themselves with the time period, it might be better to opt for a class with a more canonical syllabus.",
    "Yes, for those interested in soviet film and literature.",
    "Entirely recommended! Even if you aren't interested in becoming a scholar of 20th century literature or film, awareness of this material is absolutely essential.",
    "I would recommend the course because of the wide range of topics it covers. I would, however, encourage the student to pay special attention to the recommended reading list provided by Professor Clark, as the syllabus itself is not all that challenging.",
    "The course is a case study of Russian literature and film between 1953 and present. Each week covers one particular period taking a reading (set of reading) and a film representative of the period. I would recommend the course to anyone interested in Soviet\/Russian cultural history of the 20th century.",
    "Course looks at texts not always commonly discussed, expands knowledge of an important time period."

   "comments": [
    "Learned a lot about Soviet film and literature.",
    "The course gave me a very good overview of Russian literature\/film from the 1950s up until today, and therefore deepened my knowledge of modern Russia. It did not directly help me with my research\/dissertation, but I do sense I know my discipline a little better.",
    "The course gave me an idea of the general periodization in Soviet\/Russian literature and film. It introduced me to several directors\/writers I haven't known before and deepened my knowledge of the work of those I already knew. Since I am still in the process of choosing the topic for my dissertation it is hard to say whether it contributed to it.",
    "My specific research area is contemporary Russian culture, so this course gave me a great foundation for further research."
