    "I learned a great deal about the central shift in 20th century analytic philosophy that gave rise to the importance of ordinary language. I also gained a much deeper understanding of how to deal with skepticism in life.",
    "Cavell is a really expansive and creative philosopher, so lots of exciting connections between, e.g. philosophy of language, social contract theory, Kant, art history, film crit, theology, etc., etc. Also definitely shored up my knowledge and understanding of ordinary language philosophy (esp. Austin), receptions of Wittgenstein, and Kant's 2nd and 3rd critiques.",

    "The discussion could have been a little more structured. The participation by various students was enriching and instructive.",
    "My one comment on course organization would be that it felt like the art \/ film \/ modernism material mostly only came up at the very beginning and very end of the class; it might have been nice to have it more interwoven with the rest of the course (although this is probably also a function of seminar participation).",

    "Yes, a great course for studying Cavell's thoughts in connection with J.L. Austin and Wittgenstein.",
    "Yes, we need more of this sort of philosophy at yale",
    "This course was difficult but at the same time invaluable. Im grateful to have been introduced to the voice of Stanley Cavell and am thankful to Professor Franks for having decided to teach this. Cavells reading of Wittgenstein is deep, moving, and illuminating. I highly recommend one to take this class if it is taught once again.",
    "Cavell was Prof. Franks' advisor, so he obviously brought both a deep understanding and a personal connection to the material, which together made this class feel particularly (emotionally, personally) significant in ways that undergraduate courses often don't. I'm not sure if this class will ever be repeated, but if it is, I recommend it without reservation.",
    "Yes!"
