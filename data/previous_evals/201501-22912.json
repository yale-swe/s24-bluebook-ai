    "Very good math class. Would recommend for any math major.",
    "Not sure if Kaplan will teach it again, but it was a good time. Having a final pset instead of a final assignment was awesome.",

    "Amazing class, but Professor Kaplan won't be teaching it, so it probably won't be as good next year."
