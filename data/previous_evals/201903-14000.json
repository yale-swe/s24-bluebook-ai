   "comments": [
    "The materials were very interesting and it was good to be able to try out different ideas as to how to relate the philosophical texts we read to various aspects of literature.",
    "This was a very crisply structured seminar. More than any other class I took, I had the feeling that we were moving through a long intellectual development together, and I could see the links from Locke all the way to Kant (and beyond). In that sense, even the oldest texts on our syllabus felt live and very important from start to finish. I occasionally wanted a bit more direction on what we should be thinking through while reading texts on the syllabus (in other words, spending a bit more time on the \"Next Week\" part of each discussion at the end of the seminar). I am also a bit ambivalent about the impression I got that contemporary readings were more supplementary than required for the course. On the one hand, they often helped to sharpen our discussion of the 18th century text, but while I was planning my reading for each week, it would have been nice to know how much each of these texts was going to come into play, so I could read in a more slow and detail-oriented manner."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend to anyone who is interested in the subject matter.",
    "Absolutelyeven to other students who, like me, don't believe that 18th century literature is likely to come into play in their personal project. This course did a wonderful job of showing how empiricist philosophy and aesthetic theory are at the roots of exciting critical work happening right this moment."
