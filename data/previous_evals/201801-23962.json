   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths are the number of topics covered, the opportunities to ask questions, and the readings provided.",
    "YAAAY diseases BOOO so many guest lectures",
    "I liked that this course expanded on topics covered in PID I and lectures were given by experts in the field.",
    "I loved this class. Learn about microbial diseases from a broad range of perspectives. The only thing to be improved is posting readings earlier and making sure that they provide necessary background (most of us stopped reading them because we did not feel like they were worthwhile). Grading takes really long though.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this class. There are lots of guest lecturers which was nice because we got to hear from experts on each topic we covered but in terms of structure it was a little confusing.",
    "the syllabus of the mid term exam consisted of too many topics, i would suggest breaking down into two mid term tests + one final exam a microphone should be provided to the instructor",
    "At times it was difficult to know how all of the topics tied together, so the course felt a little disjointed and it was unclear what we were supposed to take from each lecture",
    "My favorite class at Yale yet. Jamie and the presenters he brought in were so fascinating and presented a broad range of subjects and diseases. This was an excellent course and I'm sad to see it end.",
    "This class was enjoyable and covered topics I actually enjoyed. There were thoughtful discussions and I actually learned.",
    "The course brought in a very wide variety of speakers that covered a multitude of topics. It was a little bit disorganized at times. The written assignments were extremely vague about what was expected, how long they should be, or even sometimes what exactly the question was. One thing that can definitely be improved is the lengths of the lectures - I don't think there was a single time that we finished the slide deck in time. As a result, lectures were often very rushed, with a lot of material skipped, and often left us confused about what we were expected to know. This was true of both Dr. Childs' slides and those of guest lecturers. The time allotted for lecture should be made very clear to speakers, and presentations should be done to fit in that time frame, allowing time for discussion and questions.",
    "This complemented Principles of Infectious Diseases I very well, as it focused more on the global impact of infectious diseases. Even though the material in PID I matched my interests more closely, I enjoyed PID II a lot. The variety of guest speakers was really cool, as you got to learn different perspectives on the issues we covered. Some lectures did not cover a lot of material such as those on bioterrorism, evolutionary medicine, and public health surveillance. Since the microbiome is such a hot topic in public health and medicine, I was a bit disappointed by how we did not cover that much. In the future, I think the microbiome can be integrated in other lectures to explain its relationship with infectious diseases. Given that the infectious diseases covered in this course focus more on developing countries, highlighting differences between vulnerable populations in developed versus developing countries could be another area of improvement (ex: genetic predispositions, nutrition, environmental exposures, etc).",
    "I have very much enjoyed both semesters of PID. We have covered so many interesting topics, and the course has given a great introduction into infectious disease from a public health perspective. I enjoy that we learn about each disease in terms of its epidemiology, policy concerns, and biological aspects.",
    "The grading in this class was disappointing. Our teaching fellow was GREAT, but I do not believe MPH students should be grading exams especially when Dr. Childs never checks over them. The cutoff for honors in this class is a 95% (which is not in the syllabus). With a cutoff that high every point counts. With open ended homework and exam questions, point loss can feel subjective. It is frustrating as a student to have such a high honors cutoff when the professor does not grade \/ look at homework assignments or exams and may have had a different take on our ideas. Although exams were fair in the end, studying for them was difficult. With the majority of lectures being guest lectures it was difficult to narrow down what would be on the exam as there was no context as to what the professor stressed. I think Dr. Childs needs to be stricter with the guest speakers. Lectures would have 70+ slides, then presenters would run out of time and start jumping around slides without covering much of the material. This was frustrating when it came time to study for the exams when we did not know what material would be on the exam from these unfinished lectures. Guest speakers need to be aware of their time restrictions. I also believe it was inappropriate to receive our midterm exam grades on the last day of classes. Our homework 3 was not graded before our final like promised, and finals week is now over and we still have not received that grade. These both go back to the fact that our MPH student teaching fellow was grading them on her own. I do not believe this should be her responsibility, especially as the exams were open-ended essay questions with many students needing two test books to finish and the homeworks were also essays. This was a lot to put on the TF, especially as a fellow MPH student.",
    "Covers most to all of the most relevant neglected infectious diseases. Goes into detail but also provides numerous real-world examples. Great course!",
    "Interesting topics, but the way the course was conducted and the way material\/lectures were presented appeared disorganized.",
    "I enjoyed the class, which I found very interesting, and the guest speakers were very knowledgeable about their topics. The class was somewhat disorganized and some assignments were unclear. It should be better clarified what readings are important to read and which ones are not.",
    "I learned a lot. I wish there was a bit more structure to tie in the different pathogens. We seemed to skip around a bit.",
    "N\/A",
    "It is very difficult to give a fair evaluation because Dr. Childs had a medical emergency. I thought the topics were interesting, but I wished he taught more of the classes he attended. I was not particularly keen, however, on our TF having to do all of the grading-including our midterms.",
    "Very interesting subject, wide range of diseases discussed. Could be better summarized towards the end",
    "Strengths: covering the topics concerning the vector-borne diseases which are very interesting. Weakness: less well-organized due to lots of guests speaker",
    "PID 2 covers a great scope of infectious disease topics, including interesting perspectives in the fields of bioterrorism, governance, ethics, and field research. The wealth of guest speakers were a great asset of the class (if leading to potentially unclear learning objectives, given the obvious lack of standardization of the talks). Some of the areas in which the class could be improved would be greater clarity of expectations for homework assignments, which were open ended to the extent that working on them got difficult for us (and I imagine grading got difficult as well).",
    "Strengths: -very interesting subject material, I enjoyed learning the information and the guest lecturers -exams were concept-based and were generally information covered in class -giving options for what day to take the final -enjoyed the Ebola lecture with Melinda Pettigrew Weaknesses: -sometimes the homework could be vague and confusing While not having restrictions on the homework wasn't too much of an issue, it might be more useful to have page limits or something, which may be helpful for the TA grading everyone's homework"

    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0He's awesome and super knowledgeable. If I had to provide a suggestion, it would be to speak a little louder and ask more specific questions. Sometimes the questions he would ask the class or in homework were unclear or could be interpreted many ways. It only became a problem when he was looking for a specific answer, though, which he sometimes was not.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is wonderful. Keep him around.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is an amazing professor, super knowledgeable, and experienced. He obviously cares about us students a lot and wants us to succeed in the field of epidemiology of microbial diseases, and life in general.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is great! Super nice, willing to answer all questions, and really understanding of students schedules.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is so knowledgeable about so many subjects and diseases and I'm so happy we were able to have him as an instructor.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie was great. Very thoughtful and fun to be around. He clearly knows a lot about a lot of topics and is passionate about them, as well. He was very receptive to student needs and clearly cared about his students.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs' has a very loosey-goosey hippie vibe that I think made him very approachable and interesting. He is clearly knowledgable and passionate about his field. He was definitely disorganized, and expectations and objectives were not always clear. We didn't really know what to expect for exams, and the written assignments were very unclear; Dr. Childs' could occasionally seem irritated of our questions about it - I think that he himself wasn't quite sure what he was looking for.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is a really cool guy. He is very passionate about the field, fosters good class discussion, and has a great sense of humor. The homework assignments were worded vaguely, and we often wondered what he looked for in the responses. Upon asking for clarification, he seemed to encourage a broad way of thinking. I like that he encourages this sort of thinking but I hoped the instructions were a bit more clear.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is very enthusiastic about every topic we cover in this course. I really have enjoyed having him as a professor.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is an interesting man who is great to learn from, but I strongly believe he has to do more of his own grading, or at least look over the grades the teaching fellow, who is an MPH student (not a PhD student), assigns. From my understanding, our midterm exams, worth 25% of our grade, were passed back to us without Dr. Childs looking at them. These questions were essay based, so there was not simply a right\/wrong answer for the TF to correct. The written homework assignments (also essay based) were another 30% of our grade, and the TF graded those as well. Dr. Childs is not responsible for the majority of my grade, and this is troubling as a student, especially when the cutoff to earn Honors in this course is higher than others.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0I love listening to Jamies lectures because he truly is a wealth of knowledge. He has so much experience in the field and it really comes through in his lectures. He has a wide breadth of expertise in many disease subcategories, and demonstrates a true passion for infectious disease epidemiology.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Approachable and knowledgeable, but disorganized in presenting material and assignments.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0N\/A",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs has been extremely understanding. I think he's an interesting lecturer, if a bit disorganized. I also find his grading for a required EMD course to be too harsh.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Instructor is knowledgable in his field but could be more organized in terms of assignments and overall theme of the class",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0I think the slides of instructor could be more well-organized.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Jamie is extremely knowledgeable and accommodating to tailoring the class content to students' interest. I highly appreciated his dedication to keeping sight on the public health and human dimensions of infectious disease, something of which we in EMD can never get enough.",
    "Instructor: James Emory Childs \u00a0Dr. Childs is a very passionate and exuberant instructor. It was great to hear the ways the stuff we were learning applied to his own working experience and the advice he sometimes provided. He also encouraged discussion, which was helpful. It would help if he was a bit louder, it was sometimes difficult to hear him."
