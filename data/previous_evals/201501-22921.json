    "Introduction to drawing techniques and concepts such as contour drawing, sketching and value. Work really depends on your professor. I had Prof. Dyson who was new this year and will become permanent faculty in the Art dept. The class was very chill in the first semester with no homework - the art classes really felt like free studio time. Second half of the semester things really picked up, we were drawing 2 - 3 sketches for homework every class. But the skills that you pick up in such a short amount of time (if you put in in the work) is incredible! I would not call myself someone who could draw, but this class equipped me with the skills and confidence to make pretty good drawings!",
    "Great beginner class if your a non-art major. Be prepared to draw a lot and be patient with your progress. I would recommend it!",
    "Good class emphasizing contour, value, and perspective in drawing. The laid-back yet energetic and communal atmosphere is perhaps this section's biggest strength, as Professor Dyson, who was very accessible and easy to talk to, seemed to play a significant role in fostering this environment. The other major strength is how Professor Dyson got to everyone or mostly everyone in every class during drawing, giving feedback right away. As this year was Professor Dyson's first time teaching the course, the course could have used more organization and structure, and homework increased from very little to a reasonable amount (e.g., maybe two hours a week) from the first to second half of the course.",
    "This class varies a lot based on the instructor. Most are a heavy workload (Torkwase's I think is a fair amount less than the others) but all help introduce you to drawing and your improvement will depend upon how much time and effort you put in. I would absolutely reccomend it.",
    "This basic drawing class is probably better for those who aren't looking for structured learning or a work-heavy humanities credit. It was very confusing what what expected of us, especially in the beginning, and compared to other basic drawing classes (I shopped all four this semester) there was definitely less work and less of an emphasis on learning and practicing specific techniques and getting a technical mastery of the material. Towards the end, though, the work and homework definitely ramped up, which may have been a function of Professor Dyson investing more in \/ learning more about how to teach the class (this was her first semester teaching), so it may be useful to shop this class while being wary.",
    "Take it if you want to take an easy drawing class without too much work. But don't take it if you actually want to learn something \/ get something out of it. There are many sections of basic drawing, so make sure you shop around other classes and see which one would suit you best. This one is easy, not too much work, but barely enlightening.",
    "Yes! Especially with Prof. Dyson.",
    "interesting class, and it's good to take this class to acquire basic drawing skills.",
    "This is a course that can help to develop basic concepts and skills of drawing. I recommend those who are interested in drawing and have no experience to learn the course. I feel that realizing your idea into lines, shapes and values do help to broaden my view."
