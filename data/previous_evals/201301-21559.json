    "A great (and necessary) continuation of the Chinese course at Yale, CHNS120teaches you equally useful and necessary structures, grammar points, and vocabulary, as your first nihao in 110. Try and foster a good relationship with your classmates, because your Chinese improves faster when you're comfortable with talking to your sections.",
    "A step up from Chinese 110 in terms of work, but you get a review day once every two weeks, which is pretty nice. The professors, of course, and awesome! (but you know that already)",
    "Despite being a senior pre-med biomedical engineering major , it is definitely the class which I've had to do the most work for my entire time at Yale. Despite that, it is also one of the best classes I've taken here at Yale. Highly recommended. Credit\/D is great choice for this.",
    "Yes! This is a very intensive course, but the professors are all excellent\/understanding\/easygoing and there to help you. At the end of the year, you will be amazed at how much your language skills have improved.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who hopes to become proficient in Chinese.Thumbs up.",
    "You've taken CHNS 110 and know the drill. However, grammar points, characters and vocabulary is harder than L1. I was very diligent in L1 and still found L2 challenging in addition to all my other courses. Everyone's percentage drops compared to L1.The Chinese curriculum at Yale is incredible and is even better when coupled with the Light Fellowship at Yale. Deciding to learn Chinese (I placed into French L5) from scratch was THE BEST DECISION I have made at Yale. Just take it!",
    "Chinese 120 is a lot like Chinese 110, quizzes every day, five chapter tests, tutorial every week, and the same great teachers. Definitely take it! Your Chinese will improve a lot, and it's so much fun."
