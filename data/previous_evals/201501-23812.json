    "The presentations people did before the field trip were very useful to orient ourselves to the South. I would recommend splitting the event into two nights and having everyone present before the field trip. It did not work out having people present during the trip.",
    "This is one of the most valuable parts of the forestry curriculum, by far the most \"real-world\" which is a current weakness in the program.",
    "The opportunity for field observation and on the ground experience is CRUCIAL to a forestry education. This class is a hallmark of the school's program and should be continued at all costs. It adds a tremendous amount of learning to the forestry curriculum. Plus, it offers insight into industrial operations that are impossible to find close to campus. Moreover, our alums in the South love hosting us and showing us the forests and company's they care for. It is a wonderful class all around. Highlight of my time at FES!",
    "I answer this question instead of the initial set because the field trip was a unique class experience. It was by far one of my most memorable experiences at F&ES - both academically and socially. The instructors were incredible as were the speakers and other students. I learned more from this trip in a week than I could have ever imagined. In addition, the trip was a great way to practice the knowledge I had already gained from other forestry courses."

   "comments": [
    "The best aspects of this course were meeting with the people at different organizations. It was fascinating hearing their very different opinions on how forests should be managed. I loved hearing from people ranging from plantation foresters to bird biologists.",
    "The people that we meet with. They give students a great perspective on forestry from a diversity of viewpoints. Also, if the professors are able to keep their mouths shut, the visitors are able to teach very well.",
    "Having the opportunity to spend a week outside with our very knowledgeable professors and hosts was invaluable.",
    "Ann and Mike are incomparably attentive and friendly to students and are just a great team to see in action. Our hosts were well-chosen and gracious.",
    "The value of seeing forestry in practice, on the ground, is unparalleled. To physically interact with a forest managed by field foresters practicing the Stoddard-Neel approach is dramatically better than reading alone. Meeting the various folks on the field trip who work in forestry is amazing and only surpassed by gaining a deeper understanding of classmates.",
    "Getting to spend time in the field with our excellent teachers (Dr. Camp & Mike Ferrucci), with practitioners and researchers. I never would have otherwise gotten to know forestry in the south. Great trip.",
    "The burn was great and good to see how real forestry is done."

   "comments": [
    "Though this course was excellent and I loved every stop we made I would recommend only making the trip 7 days instead of 8. Also, a little bit more free time each day would have been nice.",
    "The professors, Ann and Mike, need to chill out a bit. For the first part of the trip they came off as so abrasive and academic that is seemed very rude to many of our guests.",
    "The next time the field trip goes to Florida and Georgia, the Okeefenokee Swamp would be an easy and valuable addition.",
    "It would be beneficial to have slightly more downtime in the middle of the trip as opposed to the end.",
    "I would not have spent as long in Georgia. The second half of the trip was interesting, but not as good as the first half. I think we should have stuck with more forest management stuff. St Catherine's island was a unique treat, but the rest of the stuff in Georgia could've been scrapped."
