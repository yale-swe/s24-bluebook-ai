   "comments": [
    "The \"doing deals\" curriculum in the first half of the semester seemed somewhat repetitive. Could have moved faster through that section, and\/or done more applied lessons (simulations, etc.) instead of just readings and lectures.",
    "expand a bit more beyond easements. smaller dinners were really nice. this may be a bit hand-holdy, but maybe advice on how to make the most of the dinners? have fun vs. focus conversation on work? some speakers clearly wanted to do one or the other.",
    "I thought that the course felt a bit scattered. I wish that the clinic component and classroom component were separated; I often felt like I didn't really have enough time\/energy to fully discuss or process either.In theory, it would be great to see this split into two courses (perhaps two 2-credit courses; everyone takes the lecture part of the course, but the clinic could be optional)--one could focus more heavily on guest speakers (and also lectures from Gentry--it would be great to have had some of those) and a second component would involve the clinic.As it was, it seemed that we had a high enough classroom obligations (tons of readings and weekly reading responses) that I often felt my clinic project suffered.I basically took this class because of the guest lecturers (I didn't have time in my schedule to audit without credit), but was pretty ambivalent on the clinic component of my semester. As a student who has taken several clinic classes--I find that I'm overwhelmingly ambivalent on them; for every clinic project that's great and useful, there seem to be two more with a disinterested client or uncertain project. As such, I would have liked to have been able to gain the knowledge from the classroom portion of the class without having had to take another clinic.",
    "While I appreciated the notion of client-based work, I wish that we had more frequent interactions with our clients. But of course that varies from case to case. Maybe there's some way to ensure interactions?",
    "One meeting with Brad and project group would have been good to keep us on track and bring up new ideas\/questions\/strategies.",
    "the class should spend more time on discussions, of the readings, of our projects, of concepts, and of actual strategies. the visitors, though very interesting, often rehashed much of the same material or ideas, or they remained in very general overviews. sometimes i felt they were not worth having interrupted the group discussions. perhaps the class can be split into two days?",
    "Sometime the readings seemed to be too much--especially in light of the fact that we were all also working on clinical projects. I found myself sometimes having to prioritize readings over clinical work. I think the readins could be fewer, since a lot of them were kind of repetitive, especially in the latter part of the semester. (The readings for the first several weeks were all helpful.)",
    "While it is useful to learn from each other's experience, I often felt the first part of the class where we shared our clinical work was too long."
