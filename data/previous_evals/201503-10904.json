   "comments": [
    "An excellent introduction to psychoanalysis, the class is beneficial to students of all backgrounds. I would recommend the course to anyone with an interest in psychoanalytic approaches to literature and culture, literary theory, or literary themes of violence, perversion, trauma",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend any graduate student in the humanities to participate in this class, as it introduces an extremely important approach to human culture and its artifacts, and conveyed in a way that makes it relevant and accessible. Even if one is not going to apply psychoanalysis to one's research, the terms taught in the class are a must-have for any humanities PhD. candidate.",
    "Great course for those interested in Psychoanalysis.",
    "This course is excellent for anyone with an interest in psychoanalysis (no matter what their background). We ended reviewing many of the major Freudian and Lacanian texts, along with an abundance of secondary literature of all kinds. With several basic questions running throughout, we had wide-ranging presentation and conversations in which the diverse interests of those in the room were able to come out and enrich the conversation. All of this was grounded by wonderful periods of lecture from Moira, sometimes planned and sometimes not, which was very welcome and interesting!",
    "In depth review of psychoanalytic perspectives on sexuality, subjectivity, perversion, fantasy, and desire. Wonderful, engaging, and helpful course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Whether you are interested in psychoanalysis as such, or simply in violence as a philosophical problem, I think the course is a great mind-opener. However, if you have no pre-knowledge of psychoanalytic theory, I would recommend that you prepare and read a bit on your own. This is not really an introductory course, but rather encourages you to think beyond primary readings, in order to explore physical and political violence on a grander scale."

   "comments": [
    "I plan on incorporating psychoanalysis into my dissertation research, so this course was exceedingly helpful. The class also gave me skills in approaching psychoanalysis from a pedagogical point of view, which will be very useful if and when I end up teaching this material.",
    "As I mentioned in my previous answers, this seminar has provided me with knowledge that I will absolutely apply to my dissertation and other future projects. I can say with certainty that my academic range of thought would not have been the same without it.",
    "It inspired me to take a deeper look at Psychoanalysis.",
    "This course was extremely valuable to me as I consider the uses of psychoanalysis to think about law and politics, a topic I intend to pursue, at least, in several projects. Disciplinarily, it remains to be seem whether it will inform my dissertation research explicitly, but it will be there no matter what!!! Thanks for a great semester :)",
    "This course definitely helped me develop some of my own research ideas, and also gave me a better understanding of psychoanalysis and theories of violence."
