    "Sure. It helps to come into the course with pretty definite interests in some particular site, so you'll know what to write about.",
    "I would say that this class is taught through conventional academic readings and responses, as well as experientially through your own research and the workshopping of your project in class.I would recommend it because in fact this system add much to the class, since you learn methodology and theory from scholarly examples, while also working things out as a class with your own projects. Plus, the content is bolstered, since each student essentially teaches the class a bit about their topic through the workshopping process.",
    "I would tell them that they'll probably have a love\/hate relationship with the course; it will be challenging because it will force them to become more intellectually disciplined (an effort that cannot avoid being frustrating at times), but they will be much better off for it."

   "comments": [
    "I am very interested in exploring sacred space, but it was interesting to discover what that--sacred place--even means and all the different manifestations, both abstract and physical.I thought it had to be a physical site, but as it turns out it can be the idea of a place, a literary place, a heavenly place.This class really expanded my perspective.",
    "I am not sure whether relics and sacred space will figure prominently in future research I do, but these were subjects I had virtually zero background in before taking the course (and, nor had I read any of the Pali chronicles), so the research I did for the paper filled a huge void in my general background. Broadly, the aforesaid improvements to my paper writing skills were probably the most important benefits."
