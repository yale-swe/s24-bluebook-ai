    "This was a great history seminar, more because of the professor and my fellow classmates than the material itself, although I grew more and more interested in it as time wore on, thanks to the great discussions we had in class. Professor Rosenfeld is easily one of the best professors I've had at Yale. She fosters great discussion, and has a special ability to make people really explain what they mean without being intimidating or critical. She was also very committed to making sure everyone produced a great research paper by the end of the semester, and always made herself available to meet with us, look over outlines, and answer any questions we might have.",
    "History 293J is not an easy seminar -- Professor Rosenfeld is not difficult per se, but it is clear that she has high expectations. However, if you are willing to put in the work (reading and participating in class), any seminar with Professor Rosenfeld would be incredible. Highly recommend -- great subject material and a thoughtful and passionate professor.",
    "A solid, if unremarkable class. This course won't change your life, but it does have its share of interesting and thought-provoking moments. The course provides a novel way of looking at some historical moments that you've probably seen before. The downside is that you probably won't actually learn much history per se - in many ways the class becomes more of a philosophy course. But it did make me re-think some familiar history. The workload is reasonable; just don't let the final paper sneak up on you!",
    "The class is an in depth look at the origin of the notion of human rights and how they are (or are not) made manifest during the age of revolutions. We looked at a wide range of primary and secondary texts and got wonderful training gin the are of research and writing. I could not recommend this class highly enough. Any student who gets into the seminar should jump on the opportunity to work with Professor Rosenfeld.",
    "This class is an intellectual history of human rights, with a originial research paper. It rocks. Such important material - and a wonderful professor!!",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class. HIST 293 takes you through the origins and development of early ideas surrounding human rights. It mostly focuses on the Enlightenment, and the readings for class include both primary source material and secondary historical analysis. The reading load each week was on the heavy side, but the only major written assignment is a final 20-25 pg research paper. My entire experience with this class was positive. I learned so much that I didn't know, and was also really introduced to history as a field for the first time. Professor Rosenfeld emphasized viewing sources and documents from a historical lens throughout the course, and I came away with a much better idea of what that lens is. HIST 293 avoids all the typical pitfalls of seminar classes (rambling discussions, lack of structure, boring material, aimlessness, or droning lecturers instead of conversation). Instead, Professor Rosenfeld managed the class perfectly. She would direct the discussion and time spent on each topic, and would steer the conversation towards the important questions that would arise from each text that we were reading. She would keep posing questions to us about the texts that would aid our understanding of the material. I never came away from a class feeling confused or like my time was wasted. This is definitely not to say that we were spoon-fed information, because that is the complete opposite of what would happen. What I mean is that we were pushed towards insightful, precise, meaningful discussions. The course was very well-organized and purposeful. The final research paper was a bit daunting, but Professor Rosenfeld eased us into it. She talked and met with us from the very early stages of our research\/brainstorming, and I found all my conversations with her to be productive and helpful. She was very flexible with the scope of our topics, so I think all of us ended up writing about issues we sincerely cared about. I came away feeling I had a better grasp on how to both conduct historical research and write a fairly long history paper.",
    "AMAZING COURSE!!!! Prof. Rosenfeld is insightful and knowledgeable and SUCH a great seminar leader. She led the class with a great balance, providing a good deal of her own useful insight while still allowing students to play off of each other's comments. The readings were dense but manageable, and the amount of reading each week was relatively light. She gave really thoughtful, extensive feedback on each step in the paper writing process. There is only one major assignment--a final seminar paper--and weekly discussion questions (not full response papers), making this a very very manageable history seminar. Though the origin of rights is not generally something I am super interested in, she allowed us to shape our final paper around our already pre-existing interests. Also, by the end of the class, I found that I actually did really engage with the topic, and I was happy I took something outside of my comfort zone. TL;DR. I loved this course, primarily because of Prof. Rosenfeld! Do not be put off because she is new to Yale and thus has very few reviews--she is an extremely talented teacher and scholar!! Take this course!!"
