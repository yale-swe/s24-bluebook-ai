   "comments": [
    "Interesting course, but the class format and syllabus needs to be better structured. Hudak is a good instructor, but not always as prepared as he should be. Many of the lectures towards the end of the semester felt chaotic and often irrelevant. He can be a bit blunt in answering questions also.",
    "Sure, if you like computer music, and want to get to know Prof Hudak, who is really cool. Lectures can get a bit long, but the book (which is written by Prof. Hudak....he expands on this book even as we're in class!) helps out a lot. Euterpea is a bit buggy sometimes, but the instructor\/TAs really do a good job of working out the kinks for students. 2-8hr\/week psets (depending on how familiar you are with Haskell).",
    "It's a cool class where you learn functional programming (Haskell) and sound synthesis, both great topics. (If you haven't taken a non-Scheme functional class, do it before you graduate!) Especially interesting parts: we synthesize a clarinet from sine waves, make rain and wind noises, and create a equalizer in code. Prof. Hudak is a bit dry at times, but his textbook is great. It's one of the better electives, even if some lectures are missable.",

    "A relatively easy elective, but towards the end, disorganized. Professor Hudak is teaching with an unfinished textbook that he writes as the course progresses, which can be frustrating. Learning Haskell is cool, but the majority of the class (aside from the first few weeks spent on Haskell) is spent covering a lot of (not necessarily related) topics.",
    "I am not sure if I would recommend this class. The assignments were not too bad but we didn't get any back after no. 4\/10 until the last week of class. Professor Hudak focuses a lot on the music part and hopefully there will be a greater focus on Haskell when the class is offered again.",
    "This course forces you to think in a completely different way-- functional programming, Haskell, and signals processing, which is especially valuable if you come from a pure CS background and haven't seen the more EE-like signals stuff. Also, it teaches you a thing or two about electronic music in the sense of how these sounds are produced at the very basic electrical level.",
    "This is a very interesting class, especially since Haskell is a relatively new programming language. I love music, so I very much enjoyed applying my major (computer science) to it. The progression of topics seemed well-structured, with each subject building on the previous ones. The textbook can change a bit over the course of the class, but that's because Haskell is still being developed--by the professor! (He literally wrote the book on this stuff.) Professor Hudak is a very good and sincere teacher. His code and concept explanations are clear, and he is more than willing to spend time helping students outside of class and during office hours. (He is very patient with questions!) I greatly enjoyed being in his class.",
    "This course teaches you about sound synthesis and the sound synthesis Haskell library, Euterpea. You'll walk out learning more (probably) than you did before about sound and sound synthesis, as well as some understanding of Haskell programming. However, lectures are sometimes unclear, so you'll have to often defer to the textbook or the Internet to do the PSETs. Often, I found myself in office hours trying to get a grip on concepts needed to complete the assignments. Generally, the assignments are not difficult, but they sometimes require you to know things you can't be expected to know. The final project is very open-ended and lets you apply Haskell sound synthesis to an interesting topic.",
    "Take this class if you want to learn about Haskell or Euterpea or make cool sounds, but expect to be lost and confused many times.",
    "Yes, take this class. It may be frustrating at first to learn Haskell and the musical library stuff, but after that it's pretty smooth sailing in terms of difficulty. It's a fun class that may not be extremely useful, but the material is really cool and makes you think about sound differently. If you're a CS or Computing and the Arts major, I'd definitely recommend this course.",
    "Often, CPSC 432 is difficult simply because the sections in its textbook (which Professor Hudak maintains) that pertain to a given problem set are incomplete or not quite yet written. Since I took this course this semester, though, those blanks seem to have been filled in. The class is otherwise an engaging introduction to Haskell as well as complex concepts of digital sound creation.",
    "Take if curious about the material. I really didn't like the class very much at the beginning, when we were still working at the \"note level\" of music, but once we got to the meat of the course (sound synthesis, so signal manipulation and sound waves and things) I warmed up to the course a lot."
