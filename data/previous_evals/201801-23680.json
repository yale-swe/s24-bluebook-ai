    "more cultural knowledge and grammar improvement",

    "improvement of reading, writing, and speaking Spanish skills",
    "I became comfortable with using Spanish everyday again after not speaking it (regularly) for two years.",

    "a lot of work but very engaging",
    "There's not much I would change about the course, but I do think the assignments were a little too concentrated in the last part of the semester for no reason. I think things like presentations could have been done earlier, and eased some of the stress at the end.",
    "The course could be a little dry at times\/repetitive. That said, it was strong in terms of learning the language well.",
    "strengths: use of many different materials to engage students in all types of Spanish usage; kind and caring professor weaknesses: daily busy work online with VHL (didn't provide a lot of substance for Spanish practice); workload progressed and escalated very quickly from L3 Spanish",
    "Strengths of the course include learning about Latin American history while learning Spanish. This part of the course was really interesting - it is not just grammar!",
    "I think the content of the course is good and sets people up for success in spanish. However, the second half of the term, after getting back from spring break, had significantly more work than the first half, and I think this could be better balanced (the work wasn't hard, there was just a lot more of it)."

    "I would not!",
    "Yesit's adequate preparation for higher level courses. However, it's a lot of work.",
    "If you need free time during your semester, then do not take this course. Especially towards the second half of the semester, the work load starts becoming ridiculous. It detracted me from my other classes. However, if you love Spanish and have the time, this class is definitely for you",
    "Professor Len is a very good teacher and will help improve your spanish. I am so thankful for her guidance. I was challenged, but wasnt over worked. I learned a ton.",
    "For those who really want a strong spanish foundation, I would for sure recommend the course."
