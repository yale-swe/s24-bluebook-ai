   "comments": [
    "MUCH BETTER LAB THAN CHEM 119L. There's no weekly quizzes and there aren't lab reports due every week.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "Orgo lab at Yale is an exploration of key techniques and concepts in organic chemistry, without a lot of drama. Thus, you learn what you need to learn and also learn NOT to hate it. So many lab courses at Yale play \"gotcha\" pedagogy with ridiculous quizzes or other components that are designed to show that the 1\/2 credit is a rigorous exercise. How novel to have a lab course at Yale, which is about getting students to love being in the lab, teaching them in a supportive way, while getting them to know the basic chemistry and the fundamental techniques to boot!",
    "If you are in need of a lab credit or are just interested in chemistry labs in general, you should take CHEM 222L, especially with Professor DiMeglio. The environment is very relaxed, and oftentimes one of the lab professors will play music on the radio. The class is very low stress, and the workload each week is very light. The exam at the end of the year is also easy.",
    "Great introductory lab. It was a nice hands-on way to learn organic chemistry in a way that lectures simply cannot provide. Improve the course by not grading everything so nit-picky! A lot of the time I would look back over graded reports or EPs and just go \"Really? You took a point off for that?\" Sometimes it just got ridiculous.Labs were short, we almost never stayed the whole time, maybe only two or three times. The environment was more chill than I was expecting, which was a nice surprise.",
    "Awesome class. 119L sort of turned me off chemistry labs, but 222L is an engaging, interesting class. I loved it.",
    "If you're going to be pre-med, a chem major, or a bio major, you'll be taking this course. And for the same reasons you probably took a general chemistry lab course. So, you will likely not be looking forward to repeating that experience. However, fear not. This lab is very organized and professional. Everything you do and learn is directly applicable to developing your skills, and the work environment is very friendly and relaxed. There is always music playing. It's chill. Have fun.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it because it's not that hard and it's a pleasant course. Plus, the labs are usually quite short.",
    "you know you gotta. take it with a positive attitude. it is actually not bad at all. much better then gen chem. EPs don't take more than a couple hour TOPS and there is only one full lab report. NOT bad!!",
    "This is the first lab I have taken at Yale, and I really enjoyed it. I would definitely recommend it; you'll learn a lot. You learn different techniques for the first few labs and then get to apply those techniques in synthesis labs near the end of the course. There are experimental plans and lab notes due every week, with one full lab report near the end of the semester.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it if you need to take it. But don't take a lab if you don't need to!",
    "Much better than CHEM 119L, workload is a lot better you don't have full lab reports due every week, instead you write up Experimental Procedures and Lab Notes which basically summarize the experiment. Towards the end you have full lab reports, but you are also not graded on yield, which is great. Also it feels like you're actually doing science - for example, you synthesize chemicals and then perform a variety of tests to decide if what you produced is what you were trying to get - as opposed to CHEM 119L where all you essentially did was confirm that textbook science was not bs.",
    "OrgoLab is so straightforward and I learned a lot and it was wonderful! 5\/5 all around.",
    "Very well structured lab class. Unlike Chem119, I came away with tangible skills, AND I enjoyed my class, most of the experiments (which are thankfully short). Your grade and pleasure derived from the class all depends on your TA. Mine was a godsend.The class wasn't time consuming, and it was easy. But it was arbitrarily graded (re: points off for writing .4 rather than 0.4, for labeling above rather than underneath your graph). I suppose there's nothing else to take off for because 1) everyone's a meticulous premed anyway, 2) the lab material itself is cake, and you can't give everyone A's...but it feels like you're being graded on how good of a robot you can be, not how well you learned the lab skills and mechanisms.",
    "This lab class was much more engaging than CHEM 119L. You finally get to do more than titrate in a chemistry lab.",
    "I recommend this only to someone who needs to satisfy a requirement. It is a good lab course.",
    "I would recommend taking Chemistry 222L. It was much better than the general chemistry lab.",
    "You probably have to take this course. Just know that it's better than other labs and you won't have a completely miserable lab time.",
    "Chem 222L is the best lab class I've taken at Yale, even though I had it on a Friday afternoon. Soooo much better than 119. I was out by 4 at the very latest and workload was reasonable for a half credit. Preparing an experimental plan before lab ensures you know what you're doing and also helps cut lab time. Lab notes are graded so make sure to be thorough and post lab reports teach you to write a lab report step by step. Only 1 full lab report",
    "It provides a basic overview of organic chemistry lab techniques and is a good class to take if one intends to pursue chemistry.",
    "It is a pretty fun chemistry lab. The grading is a bit strange, and is very subjective to your teaching fellow which is assigned to you at the beginning of the semester, but overall the class is not as demanding as other chemistry labs and you do not have to stay the full time every week.",
    "Recommended as an introduction to organic chemistry labs and research.",
    "The Chemistry 222L laboratory class is a great companion to the first term Organic Chemistry lecture. Even if you do not need to take it as some sort of requirement (which most likely applies to few students), it is a great opportunity to apply some of the concepts learned in lecture to a laboratory setting. The workload is very reasonable and appropriate for a half-credit class, and I would say the level of work is less than that of a general chemistry laboratory class. Professor DiMeglio is very helpful whenever she is available, but the majority of the experiments are prepared\/performed more or less independently. The class can be quite fun too!",
    "the lab to be taken with or after the orgo class. it it quite an enjoyable, chill lab, that follows the orgo syllabus pretty well.",
    "The lab isn't too bad. Much better than intro chem lab! A small amount of busy work, but mostly you just learn a lot of new lab techniques.",
    "If you need to take the lab with Organic Chemistry, then do it. I am not sure why someone would take lab if they didn't need it. I guess it was kind of fun.",
    "Not too much work besides weekly assignments, although sometimes TA's can be harsh graders. You definitely have to put in the time to study for the final. Pretty chill lab overall, get out early most days (usually only 2-2.5 hours).",
    "This is a pretty good lab course, although the prelabs are fairly time-consuming. Be careful not to blindly rely on the examples in the course packet for lab write ups though-- there were a few errors this semester, and you would lose points. Overall, grading is fair, although you have to be absolutely meticulous in the lab write ups.",
    "Nit-picky and demeaning grading, but the lab itself was well run.",
    "Much better class than general chem lab. Everything is much more chill during the lab. However, you still have to worry about picky details in the assignments like in gen chem.",
    "Very good course! Makes you feel better about organic chemistry overall.",
    "It is a lab that most people take because they have to take it. That being said, it is more enjoyable than general chemistry lab."
