   "comments": [
    "My confidence in sharing my work and my confidence in trying new styles inspired by the authors we read in class.",
    "This class taught me how to write essays that are not academic in nature. We focused on five areas, personal, place, portrait, cultural criticism, and humor. My writing definitely improved - I am definitely less hesitant, more willing to use my own voice, and more comfortable expressing myself through writing.",
    "Learned how to write personal, reflective essays. Great insights into life, culture, the world through various readings.",
    "By taking English 120, I learned how to write papers in a college class and the higher standards I would be held to in comparison to high school. I also learned how to create my own writing style by reading and attempting to imitate in a way the styles of many great essayists.",
    "I didn't have a ton of unstructured essay writing in high school. This was a nice start.",
    "This course gave me tools to think critically about written works spanning several genres, how to understand the tactics of the writer and understand why he or she uses the methods that they do. I also feel I discovered more clearly my personal voice as a writer and learned how to use that in different types of writing.",
    "Writing nonfiction is an absolutely critical skill to have in ur arsenal. This class is a necessity for any undergrad at Yale, regardless of year or writing ability. Its a good atmosphere for not-great writers to improve and decent writers to practice and hone their skills.",
    "I was exposed to many modern essayists I hadn't read before. Because of my very engaged and thoughtful classmates and professor, I learned to analyze and discuss texts in a more thorough way. I learned to read more closely and carefully and pick up on different literary tactics that I could incorporate in my own work.",
    "I learned an entirely new style of writing from what I have ever experienced. It taught me that creative writing benefits from clarity, and that figurative language is best used sparingly. Overall, it taught me to be more deliberate with my writing without trying too hard!",
    "I definitely learned the skill of editing, and going over my work not just for small mistakes but to take another look at the whole. I also learned how to speak about and critique my classmates' work."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the consistency (readings, rough draft, workshop, final draft)--it made it easier to budget time and energy for the course in order to get the most out of it Weaknesses: we couldn't always talk about all the readings because there wasn't enough time in the class",
    "This class has many strengths! The reading is interesting and super manageable, the discussions are interesting, and the writing assignments are actually ones that I would look forward to. The open ended nature of the prompts works very well, as it allows students to write about something they truly want to write about. The class is well organized, well structured, and very well taught. The only small weakness is that I wished we had done more writing exercises in class - the classes themselves were almost entirely discussions about the reading, which is important, and definitely improved my ability to incorporate new styles in my own writing. However, I would have liked to do more spontaneous, in-class writing.",
    "No real weakness",
    "I believe this course is strong in the amount of time we are able to spend reading and analyzing the work of others, as that undoubtedly helps your own. A weakness might be that your own work gets reviewed by peers once or twice during the semester. Perhaps the peer review process could happen for each paper for everyone, just not as in depth as a workshop.",
    "I don't think I'm naturally the best writer.",
    "The students are mostly responsible for bringing in their thoughts and discussing them, rather than the professor telling us what to think, which I thought was the great strength of the class. I believe it would have been more helpful, however, if the professor also taught us how to write in the different styles that we move through rather than just having us read works and emulate them.",
    "I think this course is beautifully designed. The reading material is varied, but I found myself enjoying at least parts of every assignment. Five essays is a lot, but definitely manageable, and it is nice to finish the course with five, fairly complete pieces of writing. Class discussions were riveting and that is thanks to to the engagement of classmates.",
    "Strengths are the essays we complete, which are good tools to teach different types of writing. A weakness is that I wasn't engaged by all the essays that we read, and I wish we had maybe a better choice of readings."

   "comments": [
    "I would 100% recommend this course because of its relevancy (everyone should know how to write modern essays that get the point across in a fun, new and interesting way)",
    "If you like to read and write, take this class! My writing improved tremendously, and it was a class I enjoyed going to every day. I really appreciated this class because it was very well organized, and you always knew exactly what to expect. There were no curveballs, you read, and you write. It's a lot of writing, so if you're someone who doesn't enjoy writing this is probably not the best class. Additionally, if you're someone who does not like casual or relaxed writing, this might not be the best class. It's important to be able to recognize the difference between academic, analytical writing, and personal writing. This class is definitely more personal and loose, which some students find frustrating. That said, I loved this class and would recommend it to everyone!",
    "Fantastic course, learned a whole new style of writing and read amazing pieces.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to all freshmen. It gives you a chance to explore your own creativity, develop your own style, and receive a lot of feedback before you have to do \"higher stakes\" writing.",
    "Yes for sure. The class was a tremendous amount of fun, and I think I learned a lot.",
    "This is a quality course. I would recommend it to people who are interested in thoughtful\/creative-nonfiction writing.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in writing and reading, definitely take this class!! There isn't too much work and the articles that we read are very interesting! I would definitely recommend.",
    "Def recommend. ENGL 120 will help u regardless of your writing level. Take it",
    "I would recommend the course to any student looking to improve their writing or build consistency in their practice of it. I would also recommend it to anyone hoping to broaden their knowledge of contemporary essayists.",
    "Absolutely! All of the work that we received was enjoyable and very carefully chosen by our professor. Thus, all work felt purposeful. The essays allowed for a lot of creativity as a result, I felt like I made gains not only in my writing style, but also in how I apprpach writing and my understanding of the topics that I write about.",
    "Yes, if you enjoy introspection and writing I highly recommend this course."
