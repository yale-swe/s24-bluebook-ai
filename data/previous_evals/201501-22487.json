   "comments": [
    "Glad I took the course, but it wasn't entirely what I was expecting. Take physio if you want something more straightforward. The hematology, GI, and cancer units were all very good.",
    "good mcdb class, has a medium workload. not necessary to do all the readings, though it helps especially in hudnall's module. the class format, 5 exams and no final, seems intimidating but actually works quite well. you get to drop the lowest score anyway. you can get away with taking this without taking physio first (i did) but it might be helpful to have the extra background.",
    "This was an amazing class. I learned so much and every lecture was interesting. The tests were challenging but a fair assessment of your knowledge. It's a decent amount of work because you're always studying for one of the 5 tests, but the material is fun to study.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in medicine because the material is fascinating",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone with an interest in learning about GI, vascular development, hematology, and cancer. It was both a survey course, in that you learn the basics of each field, but also get the depth from in-class discussions. The course is a little disjointed, as 5 professors teach the course and the central theme of \"reaction to injury\" isn't always adhered to amongst each of the five blocks. It's a nice continuation of physio, but there's often overlap with physio and the course's focus is very different.",
    "Really interesting if you want a taste of pathology, lots of consistent work but not overwhelming",
    "Yes! not too much work, interesting material",
    "The class material was awesome, but the exams were vague and did not do a great job prompting for particular concepts.",
    "MCDB 315 is an engaging class that examines injury from a variety of perspectives. It is a good idea to examine how topics from different blocks relate to each other; this will be helpful in developing a more thorough understanding of material in later parts of the course.",
    "Absolutely take it if a brief scan of the syllabus piques your interest. The grading is a bit obscure so ask for clarification during the first class. The professors were all great and incredibly smart.",
    "Ok let me just warn you--5 exams is a lot. You literally have 1 exam every other week and on top of other classes, your grades can slip. However, this class was super interesting. Many say it's boring but I really really liked it. Don't expect hand-holding and be prepared to know that the material will be hard. Grading is not very transparent and is at times VERY harsh.",
    "I chose this class initially because I was enticed by the NO FINAL. However this meant that there were 5 blocks of disjointed material. I would have preferred more continuity from block to block.But part of that charm meant that if you did bad on one exam it wouldn't affect the next block much, if at all. You can drop the lowest of the 5 exams and honestly if you try hard it will be okay.",
    "This class is perhaps a good follow-up to physio, but it is not nearly as well taught , structured, or assessed. The different modules don't necessarily have a common thread running through them all, and the grading is not quite as easy as others have suggested. 5 exams of 5 free-response questions each. Lowest exam score is dropped. No curve. Maybe a good class to take Credit\/D, but not a particularly interesting or easy class to take otherwise.",
    "Take this course Credit\/d\/fail if you are simply interested in the biology behind injury. It is not curved and the grading can sometimes feel both arbitrary and harsh. However, the material is indeed interesting.",
    "Do not take this class. There are five tests and five units. All of the professors are unfocused, detail-oriented and boring."
