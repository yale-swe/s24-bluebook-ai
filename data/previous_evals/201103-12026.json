    "Strong writing skills are needed because that is how you will be assessed. The take-home midterm and final are essay questions and not short answer. The questions aren't hard but if you're more of a quantitative person then take the course Cr\/Fail.",
    "I'd recommend this class toanyone who wants to learn about racial tensions, unemployment, and urban development. You learn why cities look the way they do now. Professor Hunter is engaging, personable, and passionate. There's a lot of reading, but as long as you skim effectively and GO TO LECTURE you'll get the point. Also, aside from midterm and final essays, the only work you have to hand in are short response papers.",
    "This class was so good and so informative and so useful. I am so happy that I took it. Professor Hunter is such a great additional to the Yale faculty. I hope he teaches other courses in the future, so I can take them all! He's a great lecturer, a great thinker, and just an overall great teacher. (He learned all our names!) He breaks down complex social dynamics into digestible bits. I love when professors are able to do that. I also liked the formatting of the class, with short papers that keep students accountable to the readings and section discussions (which were awesome, by the way!) and the the focused midterm and final exam papers. It was just an overall great experience. The class was about 40 students this semester, but I suspect that many more students will be taking this class once word gets out on the street about how awesome it is! I feel like a better citizen of the world after having taken it. It's courses like these that make me gush over my Yale liberal arts education.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in gaining a broad understanding of the forces that have shaped American cities. Professor Hunter is a great lecturer and the syllabus is very interesting.",
    "Really interesting material that will give you a better perspective on cities. The class is pretty painless except for the midterm and the final. There was 10-12 pages of writing for the midterm, and 16-20 pages of writing for the take-home final. I don't think we needed to write that much in order to demonstrate how much we had learned in the class.",
    "I would recommend it. The course gets at the history and roots of urban poverty. It's interesting but frustrating at times because it makes you feel helpless that urban poverty is this perpetual problem that is so embedded in our society.",
    "A strong focus on the black American perspective, it nevertheless was a great and engaging class with a lot of interesting course material, ranging from the usual readings to movies and songs. The reading can seem daunting, but if you use the lectures as a guideline, you learn to pick out the important parts and skip the rest. Attending lectures, in my view, is a MUST. Take this class only if you're willing to engage.",
    "Studying the cities and people who make up urban America, from the great migration to today. Looking at issues within cities and their causes and solutions that have been tried. It's an amazing course, all the readings were interesting, and section was even enjoyable. I honestly looked forward to every single class.",
    "Great intro to 20th century urban studies. The reading is very manageable with all but two selections being available free online.",
    "If you're looking for an intro course on urban issues, especially racial dynamics, this is a good one. If you want something very difficult, and rigorous on a narrower set of issues, I'd look elsewhere.",
    "This class provides a good overview of urban issues, but isn't especially intensive (unless you make it so yourself). It was a good introduction to sociology and urban issues.",
    "A survey course of several fundamental topics in urban America's development in the 20th century. Does not go into a lot of depth in any one topic, but very interesting overall",
    "Definitely take this class---it's super applicable and it makes you look at cities, including New Haven, differently.",
    "Take it! Great introductory course on Urban America. If you already know a lot, you may find it too basic, but you will nonetheless be happy with how amazing Professor Hunter is. Very easy to get that A.",
    "Sociology 183 is a very enjoyable class. The readings are interesting and Professor Hunter is extremely engaging and passionate about both the subject and his students. In terms of workload, section meets weekly to discuss readings and class concepts, there are three reading responses due at your leisure throughout the course of the semester, and there is a take home midterm and a take home final exam, both of which are quite flexible. Professer Hunter is never trying to trick you with his exams, he just wants to give you a chance to show what you know in the context of what interests you most about the course. Though this is a lecture course, Professor Hunter really likes to engage his students, so you can expect to be called on at least once or twice during the semester. He also likes to count students off and have everyone get up and move to talk in small groups.",
    "Broad overview of urban studies issues. Great survey course for someone trying to get a feel for the discipline. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would definitely recommend SOCY 183. It exemplifies the purpose of education: to draw out some way of seeing the world that we would not have noticed before. Even simple trips to NYC have become more interesting and fulfilling. SOCY 183 also has a very personal element to every American, whether one participated in the suburban flight or not.",
    "This is a really interesting and not too hard class. Lecture, long readings but you don't need to do all of them, and a take-home midterm and final. A fair amount of writing, in all, but very interesting material. You'll get a good grasp on some of the main problems facing cities, and their historical roots, and you don't have to come in with a ton of sociology knowledge (I know it says you have to have taken an intro sociology course all ready, but I hadn't and was totally fine).",
    "Urban America discusses the many problems plaguing urban America (the inner city to be specific) and how those problems arose. I would totally recommend this class as Professor Hunter is awesome and no matter how much you think you know about race relations or \"the city\", you will learn something new in this class. You'll never go downtown and see it the same way again.",
    "Ya really fun interesting class that relates to everyday life and makes you view cities in a different light. a lot of reading but all that is required is to skim and most of the reading is fun.",
    "The course is about the development of cities in the United States after World War II. It goes through many different points of view this development. It examines the role of segregation, poverty, public housing, policy, etc. I would highly recommend this course if you have any interest in Sociology. The lectures are fun and interesting.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in the matter. There is a fair amount of reading though."
