    "TAKE THIS COURSE!",
    "You will look at the issues and themes related to race and ethnicity and so many other parts of identity and political expression. Tensions in US politics start to make a little more sense, and you really benefit from the other students in the class. take it!",
    "I'd recommend it, but Professor Brown-Dean won't be teaching it. I think it's a very important class, though, and Yale should offer a similar course even if she's not the professor.",
    "I have no idea what this class will look like without Dr. Brown-Dean, but the material will be good for approaching broad questions of ethnicity in politics regardless.",
    "I would recommend this course. The readings were interesting, and class discussions were very lively (many hot-topic issues were discussed).",
    "The material covered in this course was interesting and I think that every political science student should spend sometime thinking about minority politics in the U.S. However,I would not recommend this class because the seminar was too large to have any real discussion and the professor was IMPOSSIBLE to get in contact with. People like me who were writing senior essays in the class barely received any feedback.",
    "This course is fantastic and for someone who never was really interested in politics, it was a great place to become interested because the things discussed in class are so evident today! Great class, awesome professor, take it!"
