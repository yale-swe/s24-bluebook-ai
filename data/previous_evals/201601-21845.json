    "Take it if you have to. The information was interesting, but the exams were too different from the material presented in class to make the class coherent.",
    "If you're looking at this, Biophysics is probably required for your major. A lot less painless than pchem, but still not the greatest.",
    "This is a surface-level introduction to biophysics and structural biology. Physics is significantly de-emphasized (for better or worse) and there is less overall content than MB&B 300, 301, and physics courses. Overall, the class is quite light in workload while remaining intellectually stimulating at times, especially near the end. Do not expect to leave the course feeling well versed in biophysics at all; if you can, take this course earlier in your career to see if you like any of the subjects enough to pursue them further. Prof Sindelar is not a great, nor very clear, lecturer but he is extremely well intentioned, and the TA's we had were very helpful and patient.",
    "Would not take it if I did not have to, but was not a bad class.",
    "Terrible. Avoid if possible.",
    "You will absolutely hate ducks by the end of this course. Ducks will appear in your dreams as well as your feelings and daydreams. Fourier transforms were a beast. X-Ray crystallography was quite a challenge but he final surprisingly wasn't as bad as the midterm which covered kinetics and rates and all those fun things you wished you studied up on more during Pchem first semester. Though by the end of this course I was surprised how decently I knew the content for X-ray crystallography. Cryo-EM was decent too! Your friends will help you struggle through this together!",
    "A survey course of biophysical concepts and techniques. Neither the most challenging or easiest MB&B class. Good to take, but can be boring at times.",
    "I came to Yale thinking I wanted to be a biophysicist; I wish I would have taken this course earlier to know that it isn't the path for me. It's not crazy hard; just really specific\/technical information. As far as MBB classes go, it was more on the enjoyable side.",
    "In our semester, it was a very methodologically focused overview of introductory biophysics. The first half built pretty straightforwardly from Chem 328. The issue in spring 2016 was that the problem sets and tests kind of snuck up on you relative to the lecture--things that seemed confusing but easily glossed over in lecture featured prominently in tests and homeworks, so a lot of self-teaching was required (especially toward the second half of the course).",
    "Way better than first semester pchem. Much more organized and better taught.",
    "You have to take this class. But prof. Sindelar is really nice. Be warned the p sets are not like the test questions.",
    "I would not recommend it. If you are thinking about being MBB, I would run far far away from this major. This class is not well taught, and is very difficult. Psets were difficult and the midterm was way way way out of left field. Teachers were inaccessible. Disregard the other comments about it being okay, because those comments come from the geniuses that destroy the curve and will destroy you if you take the class. Also, do you really want to take a class that is almost 100% pre-med. Yeah, didn't think so. Run far far away from this class, although towards the end of the class I did appreciate the information I learned and thought it was interesting. Just wasn't worth 10 years of my life though. If you're just thinking about taking this class for fun, then take it credit D and also get your brain checked in the meantime. But if you still decide to go through with this, I pray that you will have a good study group and some good TAs, or that you are super smart. Because that's the only way you'll get out of this class in good shape. Otherwise, just be MCDB or EEB, it'll be better for your GPA and life.",
    "Biophysics is a decent course. I would rate it about the same difficulty level as first semester physical chemistry for MB&B. The workload was very reasonable (weekly problem sets, 1 midterm, 1 final, non-mandatory discussion sections). Some of the material was a bit challenging (especially the x-ray crystallography uit + Fourier transforms), but there was a lot of support from the TAs and instructors. Overall I am very happy with this class. It rounded out my MB&B education by introducing me to many different laboratory techniques used in biochemistry and biophysics laboratories. It was also fun to learn about the 'bigger picture' through reading assigned papers (1 per unit or approximately 5 total) and hearing the instructors talk about their own lab work."
