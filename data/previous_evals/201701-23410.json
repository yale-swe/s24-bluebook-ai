   "comments": [
    "The class was good in that the presentations were interesting and well done. I did not like how the class was taught in one way but then the expectations of the final project seemed to differ. i also did not like how the TF and the instructor did not seem to be on the same page on what was required. it seemed as though we were told one thing but another thing was expected. I also did not like how the final project was set up. our groups seemed to work really well together with everyone pulling their weight and the fact that we were able to do everything as a group but then have to redo everything individually felt like a waste of our time. it seemed pointless to make it a group project since all the resources and sources were shared.",
    "Great",
    "Interesting topics but it would be more interesting to incorporate media and not just rely on articles.",
    "Good course to learn the cutting edge of the public health problems.",
    "Outstanding course and amazing format with expert lecturer and student presentations followed by the discussions",
    "This course was comprised primarily of guest lecturers. Students presented summaries of articles in class. The biggest weakness of the course was its redundancy. If you had done the reading, then you sat in class listening to your classmates repeat the main points of the article you had already read. Only a handful of the guest lecturers were effective at stimulating discussion (Prof. Nicola Hawley in particular was great). Many of the guest lecturers seemed unprepared or uninterested in guiding discussions, and accordingly, discussion was not very robust. This is not particularly surprising since the caliber of teaching at YSPH in general seems somewhat low, with research much more emphasized over teaching, but it certainly makes for a less compelling course. Also, Monday nights are a hard time, and the courses that went late until 8 or 9 PM were really difficult. I would strongly recommend rescheduling this during the day, maybe that would improve participation.",
    "Course is an excellent survey of the broad field of public health. The expectations for the Grand Challenges proposal were somewhat unclear, and seemed as though they were above what we initially were told. That being said, it was a good way to think about public health.",
    "very good class. time management is a major weakness- both for weekly student presentation and final presentations. Presenters could have been limited to 10-15 minutes.",
    "I was surprised at the beginning of the semester to learn that most of the class were AP students, since this was billed heavily as the required course for first year PhD students. While I liked the variety of perspectives and expertise contributed by this diverse group of students, I do think the class size was way to large to be considered a discussion class, and certainly for class participation to have counted toward our grade. There was simply not enough time in a class period for everyone to contribute. Overall I liked the structure of the course - short lecture and paper discussion - and the topics chosen. I particularly enjoyed the following topics and guest speakers: pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, needle exchange, tobacco control, and obesity. My main criticism of the class, however, is time management. I think this got better once the discussion questions were eliminated from presentations (anyways, discussion questions posed by the guest speakers were better than those posed by student groups), but it was a huge problem throughout the semester. The third presenting group often had only 10 minutes to present, which did not allow them to demonstrate all the hard work they had put into understanding their paper and preparing a presentation. Finally, it was unacceptable that the final presentations went over the expected time by one hour, especially at such a late hour. We were all under the impression that each group had 10 minutes: 7 minutes to present and up to 3 questions. However, that timeline was not followed and class went over by almost an hour. On the other hand, I did appreciate the Gates Grand Challenge proposal as the format of the final project - I enjoyed the creative group work and learned a lot through the process. Overall, I think this class has a lot of potential but several practical issues made it challenging this year.",
    "The diverse array of topical content covered and emphasis on public health successes and challenges were its greatest strength. The format of the Final project was a shortcoming; why create a group challenge and presentation and then require an individual report?",
    "I think that this course was very good. It forced me to think about problems and topics that I would not have thought about. I was constantly challenged. I also found the discussions to be very stimulating and challenging.",
    "It would be helpful if the instructor could introduce every topic before we read related articles.",
    "This course provided a good overview of the major advances in public health within the last few decades. I liked the overall format, in that each class focused on a different topic, and classes were centered around discussion of original research. I learned a lot outside of my traditional research subject area, which gave me a better contextualization of public health\/my work. I would have liked to see more class discussion of the research, led by the instructor that day, and also a smaller class size. Unfortunately, I think the large class size was really a limiting factor, and I think PhD and AP students had very different agendas in taking the class (although the diversity of perspective was nice). I also would have preferred a longer introduction of the topic from the faculty (especially considering the fact that these faculty were leading experts in their topics) and then only 2 research articles with more discussion. One recurring issue with the class was that it would often go over time, and students were not able to present for their allotted amount of time that they had prepared for, because discussions would go on for too long or get out of hand. In future iterations of the course, it feels really necessary for presentations to be closely and strictly timed, to keep things running smoothly.",
    "Well rounded in terms of over all global burden of health. We touched upon several aspects of public health, but a few papers were very old and extremely long. It was a great learning to read several papers and expand my knowledge. But the weakness was the fact that a few students were made to present on papers that were 2-3 pages long, and others had to present on difficult papers >40-50 pages long. This was unfair distribution.",
    "Overall, I think I learned more about what public health is from this course than any other. The individual sessions are led by different faculty members depending on the topic, so there is variability week to week.",
    "The structure of the class is good and encourages critical assessment of academic papers but classes often over-run",
    "The timing of student presentations could been better organized so that each group had enough time to present their material.",
    "It is a well-balanced course.",
    "Fantastic capstone course focused on a survey of past public health successes and future challenges. Workload was very manageable.",
    "The course is designed so that there are 3 articles to review each week. A very short summary is due prior to class each week. In class, all of the articles are reviewed again via a student power point presentation. I felt that way to much time was given to student presentations. 3 power points per class becomes very monotonous for adult learners. Would have been beneficial to learn more about each topic in class from the primary instructor or expert guest speakers. Also, some more time for class discussion would have been more interesting. I think a strength was having guest speakers."

    "Well, overall this course is good. But as a student in biostatistics, I find the course is not that helpful. Since the topics discussed during the course is not that related to biostatistics and I find it hard to take part in the discussion. Also, the workload for this course is a little bit too much.",
    "its a requirement so get through it.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "I think this class would be more fun if it focuses more on discussions of certain topics (in a debate form) and not the articles",
    "Good course to have a whole picture of the advanced public health field, but the work load is a little heavy",
    "Fantastic format: home reading of the topic, expert guest lecturer, student presentation and discussion on a topic, all topic are highly pertinent to the public health (some more exciting than others). I started the course not expecting much but I was very happy Albert was in charge of this course, even as an AP student I can tell this was a great enrichment for my learning and career FYI the attendance is taken during the classes",
    "Unless you have to take this course, don't take it. And given that it's a required course, please revamp it further so that it can be a useful course!",
    "would highly recommend!!",
    "You may learn quite a lot from this class, I certainly did. However, you will have to witness colleagues hurried through their presentations by the professor due to a lack of time before the next presentation; only for the professor to give a 10-minute monologue on what he deems important despite the lack of said time.",
    "I will recommend it to other students.",
    "This course provides a great overview of the major successes, and future challenges, in public health. Each class delves into very different topics, with a leading expert in the field providing an overview and facilitating discussion of research.",
    "Provides a great overview of all aspects of public health. Great course. Lots of reading and learning.",
    "Recommend - for great overview of public health and a wide spectrum of topics covered.",
    "Iseful to read a large volume and critically asssess papers.",
    "Recommended",
    "An overview of public health topics"
