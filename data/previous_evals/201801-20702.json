   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about postmodernism, post-humanism, and otakus.",
    "Ability to view anime through at least one critical lens, specifically of posthuman thought.",
    "I learned about the idea of posthumanism, and how anime's explore what a posthuman world will look like. I have always been a casual anime viewer, but I never knew that we could analyze anime from an academic perspective. I think this course also equipped me with the tools to become a better film critique.",
    "This course made me reconsider what identity means in the context of a media that I really enjoy watching.",
    "More thorough understanding of history of animation, common tropes in anime, otaku culture, posthuman philosophy, relationship between man + machine + environment,",
    "Learned to look at Japanese animation and culture from a different perspective. Learned to analyze and critique post-humanist works, looking at them from different perspectives. Learned to appreciate new kinds of anime that I had not particularly enjoyed beforehand. I will admit, I watched Ghost in the Shell a couple years ago, and was a bit confused and underwhelmed, but now I understand more of the meaning behind the movie and I enjoy it much more.",
    "I learned a lot about close reading of films and other visual media, as well as explanations of how anime tropes develop and come to be important in the medium.",
    "Philosophy Knowledge; Found new anime; Analyzing anime",
    "I learned what humanities are.",
    "While this might be an anime class, students in this course learn a wide variety of topics. Topics included include feminism, environmentalism, self-identity, etc. Awesome class, didn't expect it to be so good.",
    "Learned the inspirations behind many animes and how they were performed",
    "I learned so much about sci fi in anime, animation itself, and posthuman philosophy in general. This has introduced me to tons of ideas I had never seen before, and also taught me how to read needlessly dense academic texts (though many of the texts were not so dense)."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Larger quantity of smaller writing assignments would be appreciated.",
    "This course was excellent, could perhaps incorporate some more recent anime and readings. Even so, everything was really great.",
    "I wish there was more comparison and contrast between the films--how they represent\/distort identity differently. I also wish we were able to not rush through the very end of the course, but I am biased, because I enjoyed the last films more than the first few films.",
    "I loved watching the anime and discussing our thoughts with the rest of the class. Professor Jacobowitz is also extremely knowledgeable about the subject, and Young's energy was palpable. I wish we had spent more time dissecting the readings in small groups because they were extremely dense. Maybe in the future consider adding a section? Also, Fractal was sooo weird. Not a fan.",
    "Lecture format can be a bit confining, however I understand sometimes it can be difficult to engage a class when the professor asks a question and no one is confident enough to raise their hand to answer. The most interesting classes for me were the days when we had in depth discussions, usually led by Young I think. Overall, however, a very interesting and engaging course.",
    "The main strength is Professor Jacobowitz' and Young's comprehensive knowledge of the course material and their passion about the subject. It makes the class enjoyable and engages the students as well. The main weakness is that I cannot tell my parents I took this course or they will be angry I took a class about anime instead of math.",
    "Course is really boring in terms of lectures because Professor isn't really engaging; Lots and lots of reading (TOO MUCH) which needs to be limited",
    "Great course, not sure how it could be improved specifically. Maybe drop Appleseed? Appleseed was painful to watch.",
    "Strengths: Awesome course content. Discussions of the anime and readings were very engaging, interesting, and more powerful than I'd expected. Supplementary materials connected well with the course-content anime and were interesting. Weaknesses: Bad timing for papers. This might be a personal issue, but considering the weight the essays place on the course, having the paper topics released during the midst of midterm season and (to a lesser extent) finals season really hurt my ability to give the essays the time they deserve. Lectures were also difficult to follow. I wish there had been some structured lecture aid (like a PowerPoint) to follow; although the content was interesting, I sometimes found myself zoned out because the lectures seemed to be bouncing from place to place.",
    "This class was very engaging and well set up. Discussion was helpful.",
    "The midterm prompts were given only a week before the due date, but they fixed that by giving everyone an extension. Otherwise, the course was well taught with the exception of a few days which seemed to focus on concepts that felt less important instead of going deeper into the specific works.",
    "Strengths - discussions in class very lively and had a lot of depth. Also the readings and films were very interesting. Weaknesses - Professor's lectures sometimes hard to follow as he'd make tangents and references to topics many of us were unfamiliar with; in doing this I felt like he could have explained things more thoroughly and clearly."

   "comments": [
    "Yeah.",
    "This class was awesome. The readings were, for the most part, really interesting even to someone who doesn't do humanities whatsoever. If you're an anime fan, this course, or anything similar, should be a must-take.",
    "Yes. The readings can be dense and hard to understand, but the reward from taking this course is tremendous. I highly recommend this course.",
    "If you like anime and are willing to analyze it deeply\/philosophically, yes!",
    "If you're taking this class for the anime, it might not be a good idea. Even with some interest in the posthuman, the class is quite humanities-heavy for a STEM major. Either way, ended up being a lot of work and the concepts were quite abstract.",
    "If you like anime and can write well, this course will be pretty easy and enjoyable for you.",
    "Yes. An interesting take on anime if you are a fan. Some of the terminology may be difficult if you don't know much about film, psychology, or just humanities in general. However the selected viewings are amazing, and the readings are very interesting.",
    "Yes; not only is it very unique by nature of being about anime, it is well-taught and engaging, not to mention that the workload is fairly light.",
    "The dilemma arises when you like anime and this seems like the only class but the class isn't really that great. Honestly since it's pretty much the only anime class I'd still go for it but I barely paid attention in lectures and soon stopped watching the anime and doing the readings just because. Also the class is pretty male-dominated.",
    "Yes. Great class, a lot of fun.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material covered was so interesting (I mean how can you not enjoy a class that makes you watch Miyazaki movies and Ghost in the Shell). Furthermore, I actually enjoyed the required readings for once. The professor wasn't out to ruin our grades and worked hard to make the class as enjoyable as it should be. In this class, you learn about anime, Japanese culture, filmmaking, history, feminism, environmentalism, etc. While you may sign up because it's a class about anime, you'll surely come out of it with more than you expected.",
    "Yes, very interesting class",
    "If you like anime and philosophy, you should absolutely take this course. It's no cakewalk (there's a lot of reading and they expect good papers) but the texts and the ideas are very fun.",
    "Definitely!"
