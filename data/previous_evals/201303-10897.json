    "AMTH\/STAT 361 is a course that is what you make of it. With only 5 problem sets that are graded generously, no exams, and a final project that can be done with a partner, this class requires as much time as you're willing to put in. This class assumes some basic knowledge of R, but really any programming experience at all is more than sufficient as the TA offers several help sessions for R basics, and Professor Chen covers all the functions you need for the classwork. On the other hand, if you are looking for a course that will teach you all the ins and outs of coding with R, you will probably not be satisfied. The final project asks you to apply the tools that have been discussed throughout the semester, but also implicitly requires you to learn to clean and prep data, as all datasets for the homework have been pre-cleaned.Take this class if you want an overview of many data analysis tools as well as the math behind them. Compared to STAT 230, I would say this class is much more mathematically rigorous, and the right step after 241 or 238.",
    "This is the most applicable and useful class for life after graduation. You will explore basic data analysis methods, ranging standard linear regressions to tree-based methods and cluster analysis. I'm not sure if this course will be offered in subsequent years, but if it is, TAKE IT. There are only so many applied courses that are taught (let alone WELL-taught) at Yale. Regardless of whether you are a biochemistry, public health, or statistics major, as long as you have data to be analyzed, this class will be infinitely useful. For those seeking a job, employers love students who have some analytic background. You will be coding in R, but the prerequisites are not very heavy (just know some basic programming, understand very elementary statistics - like what a standard deviation is). The class itself is treated very maturely: 5 problem sets, and a final project. Lisha makes the final project open-ended, so you are free to analyze any dataset you want. Some students had collected data over previous years and were able to finally extract out meaningful relationships through the final project in this class. If Saier is TA-ing, you are in absolute luck. Saier (Vivien) is THE most helpful TA I have ever encountered. She is patient, forgiving, and never criticizes for the most basic of questions.",
    "This is a truly horrendous lecture, with reasonable problem sets, that teach you how to code in R, to some extent. The grading on the problem sets is totally random. I had misplaced pages in one and received 11\/10 points,for example. Collaborate or die. If you want to learn R, take the class, if you must, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really are better ways, like udacity or coursera.",
    "I would only recommend this class to someone who wants a crash course in R. You learn some pretty cool regression\/analysis techniques in R and although she tries to teach the theory behind them, it is often too confusing to understand. During the semester the class is not too much work- only 5 psets. However, there is also a final project at the end of the semester which can be a bit time consuming, so be ready for that. Not an amazingly engaging class, but it definitely gives you the tools to do basic data analysis.",
    "Pretty basic data analysis. You might learn some things, and it's not hard. Lectures can be slow, but try to pay attention because you will cover some neat things.",
    "Good class, you'll be exposed to a lot of fancy stats tools in R that you can refer back to as you tackle problems in a job or in your research",
    "I would recommend taking STAT 361 if you want to learn how to use R. By working on the five problem sets and the final project, you will become pretty comfortable using R.",
    "This class is poorly taught and most of the material can be learned on your own. Not a whole lot of work (5-6 problem sets and a final project). Few people go to class because the lectures are pretty awful. Take it if you must, but otherwise I would not recommend it.",
    "Your understanding of data analysis after math 361 really depends on what you put into the class. It can be easy to pass from pset to pset looking only at portions of the code covered in class, and with frequent visits to StackExchange, but paying attention to in class lectures allow for a richer understanding of the statistical theory behind data analysis.",
    "Take this class if you want an understanding of statistical analysis in R that is more advanced and more useful than STAT230, which focuses primarily on learning how to code. It is one of the easier math classes at Yale, and psets are entirely manageable if you start a few days early and seek help when needed. But be warned that the lectures are not as clear as you might need them to be, and you might be looking to the Internet or peers for clarification quite frequently.",
    "This class is the most poorly taught class at Yale. Professor Chen, though a sweetheart, didn't engage me as a student. As she posts all lecture notes online, many students just don't go to class. The TA, Vivien Ye was great but I don't know if she will TA next years. There are only 5 psets and a final project. It's a light coursework but way too boring. If you can wait one semester, I would take STAT 365 instead of this class."
