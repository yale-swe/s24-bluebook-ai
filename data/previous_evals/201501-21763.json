    "It is most definitely a math class, so please get some experience in proof-writing and graphs before you write \"this statement is clearly true because it clearly is.\" Automatic -10\/10.",
    "Algorithms is an amazing class, and honestly a must-take if you like thinking about challenging problems. The problem sets are by far the best part of the class. Even though it may take you a while to get a solution and write it out, you can take comfort in the fact that Dan has taken just as much time and dedication to writing these problem sets to make meaningful, challenging learning experiences.",
    "Wonderful course, take it, think hard, and expand your mind. Challenging if you aren't used to rigorous proof-based thinking (if you opted for CPSC 202 instead of MATH 244 your perseverance will be tested).",
    "An amazing class that teaches you so much. The problem sets were challenging but really interesting and there's no better feeling than getting it right after thinking about a problem for a while. Dan is an amazing professor and everyone should take this class.",
    "As long as you find a group to collaborate with, it's a doable class. It's what you'd expect from a core computer science class.",
    "CPSC 365 is a rigorous tour of basic algorithms for computer scientists. There are eight problem sets, and most students type them up on LaTeX with the final product being 10-12 pages. Starting the problem set fewer than three days before the due date almost always resulted in an all-nighter. Students were allowed to \"collaborate\" this year, which effectively meant doing the problem sets together for some students. The textbook that we used is Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Tardos and Kleinberg, and I highly recommend reading parts of the textbook before taking the class. Also, learn LaTeX at a basic level before enrolling. Professor Spielman is incredibly knowledgeable on the subject of algorithms. He responds to questions thoroughly and insightfully, and he crafts problem sets that extract the essence of what he teaches. He is also a great lecturer. I would say his greatest weakness is that he sometimes gives off an air of arrogance, which is sometimes the result of humorous jibes on problem sets or tests. That being said, he deserves to have an extremely high level of confidence. This class will challenge you, but it is a rewarding experience. I highly recommend it to anyone who is mathematically inclined.",
    "Excellent class. Lots of work and oftentimes stressful, but you learn so much. Spielman is an excellent lecturer, and cares a lot for his students and the quality of his teaching.",
    "I recommend it to those who are interested in proofs and algorithm analysis.",
    "Overall, 365 is a great course. Though the workload is challenging, you'll definitely grow as a student of computer science and walk away with a newfound confidence in your ability to design and analyze algorithms. Professor Spielman is very engaging and makes difficult concepts easy to understand. He's also very down-to-earth and just a pleasure to interact with. Be warned that the class is a significant amount of work. I typically spent at least 15 hours on each problem set, and there were 8 problem sets in total. The problems were all challenging, and, when I got stuck, things quickly became stressful. The new collaboration policy lightened the workload a little but that was more than offset by the requirement that we complete all 4 problems on each assignment (rather than just 3 of the 4 as it had been in past years). The in-class tests are very fair. If you pay attention in class and understand the material, there are no surprises and you'll do well. All in all, if you're a computer science major, you're required to take the class. It's just about as challenging as 323 is and you'll definitely be rewarded for the work you put in. If the course isn't a requirement, I would still recommend taking it but only if the rest of your workload is light, if you'd genuinely enjoy the material, and if you're willing to put the work and time in.",
    "A great class. I took none of the prereqs, and am actually a biology major. I disregarded what my CS peers told me, and decided to take the class for a letter grade - I learned so much and am so glad I took this class, as it ended up being one of the best I've ever taken. Lectures are okay (I often preferred the book), but the most important part was the psets, which were very interesting\/fun. Basically puzzles. You don't actually need that much CS or math background - I had never written a proof in my life and am pretty weak at math. My previous CS experience was up to 201. Loved the class.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. Every STEM major should be required to take it.",
    "Took it because of the requirement, but would recommend taking it Credit\/D\/Fail because it's pretty interesting.",
    "! This was a difficult but well-taught course that made me more able to come up with algorithms to address many situationsand then, of course, to prove that they work. I think the PSETs were well-designed and lectures, while sometimes fast and confusing, were nothing I couldn't understand after reviewing my notes and occasionally consulting the textbook. All that being said, I put in 1015 hours a week on the class and I would be lying to say that I expect it will take you much less time. You *must* start on the PSETs earlyreally, as soon as they come out. Your proofs sometimes turn out to be wrong and you sometimes discover this the night before the PSET is due. That's enough to keep you from sleeping. Do yourself the favor of making this class enjoyable: Spend the time you need to spend thinking through the problems, testing hypotheses, failing, trying a different approach. You could weasel your way through this course getting answers from other students and manage to not learn a thing about persistence, hard work, or problem solving. Congratulations. And then you'll realize you've bullshitted your way through what could have been one of the most rewarding courses available at Yale. I hope you get as much from the course as I did and I hope you do what you must do to open that possibility up to yourself.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for any students who would like to get a taste in algorithm. It's a great course with tons of challenges and fun!",
    "Take it if you have a good background in proof-based math. CS 202 was useless in preparing me for this class.",
    "CPSC 365 is incredible. Dan is awesome. You learn a LOT. Be sure to take copious notes - exams draw DIRECTLY from lecture.",
    "It's a lot of work and you'll spend a lot of time just sitting there thinking about how to solve the homework problems but it is worth it and you'll learn a lot.",
    "I would recommend this class, even to a non CS major, so long as you are willing to put a lot of time and focus into weekly problem sets, and are interested in math and proofs. Math is not a particular strength of mine, but I still found this course to be engaging. The problem sets are difficult and time consuming, but they truly help you understand the material.",
    "Great course. Don't be scared of the workload, you'll learn a lot. Really would only recommend to computer science and math people who are ready for the workload.",
    "Algorithms is a great class, honestly my favorite CS class at Yale so far. It's all proof-based algorithm design: you have to create an algorithm to solve some problem and then prove both that it works and how quickly it runs. Most of the problems were challenging but were solvable with one or two creative insights, which are really satisfying to figure out. Psets can take a really long time though, and there's one due each week, so the workload is pretty heavy. Even so, this was a great class. Spielman is a great lecturer and really seems passionate about the material. Definitely recommend this class, although it's required for the CS major so you probably don't have a choice anyway. For any other majors considering it, if you like math and proofs, it's a great class.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it, but chances are you have to take it. Problem sets every week, but the exams are pretty straightforward. It's a lot of work, but not as much 323. Start problem sets early!",
    "This course is challenging but rewarding. Be sure to join a good group to discuss the problems, because this can be crucial for comprehension. Exams are almost exclusively regurgitation of lecture, so go to lecture. Also it's interesting!",
    "If youre mathematically inclined, youll find this to be the best course among those required for the CS major. If youre not, youll still love it and really gain confidence in your own ability to solve challenging, proof-based questions because the problem sets are difficult, but doable, and the TAs are a great resource. Its Yale CS at its best, and honestly, this is one of the best courses Ive taken here. I could not recommend it enough.",
    "This is an amazing class! Be ready for a lot of work, however.",
    "Good class and lectures, hard weekly(ish) problem sets.",
    "Good course--I really recommend it.",
    "Probably not to non-CS majors. It wasn't life changing or anything and it is extremely time-consuming and frustrating. 8 problem sets, each takes a couple hours to figure out but a huge amount of (useless) time to write up. Two exams which were both just memorization. The second half of the class (flow, NP, and randomized) is much more interesting and easier than the first half.",
    "Recommend it. Definitely take this class.",
    "If you have any interest in writing code, take it. Every respectable programmer needs some degree of understanding of the topics covered.",
    "You are likely only taking 365 if you have to, but it's a great class. It's a lot of work, but a different kind of work than 323. I liked it better, and although that will vary individually, it's refreshing regardless after the long hours in front of the computer in 323",
    "You will become a master of algorithms, and learn a ton!",
    "Take it if you need to or like algorithms... I recommend a background in CS and\/or taking other CS classes (223 or 323) and Discrete Math before taking it, for a more enjoyable experience.",
    "It's an extreme amount of work (though hopefully next year there will be more flexibility in workload) but it's a very good and interesting class. Dan is a great lecturer.",
    "I really really really enjoyed this class. It's hard, it WILL consume a large part of your life, the grading can be a bit harsh at times (It's not worth 5 points if you get it right, it's worth 5 points if you get it wrong), and you will spend nights sinking into a desperation fueled insanity, but it's worth it. I learned so much in this class. You learn how to approach many different kinds of problems and will feel fantastic when you finally get the aha moment on each problem. Dan is a fantastic professor. His enthusiasm about algorithms is infectious. And now that he has changed the collaboration policy, you will make such good friends from pset nights. TLDR: Hard, but worth it. Dan is the man.",
    "Take it.",
    "Well, shit, you've gotta take this class, don't you? No use reading the evaluations, not like you have a choice. Prepare to be brutally fucked.",
    "If you cut down the workload of this course in half, it would be my favorite class at Yale. Don't underestimate the amount of time this class will take, especially if you are a very slow writer. If you are deciding when you should take this class, make sure you take it with a group of friends \/ study buddies. Being able to talk about the homework and the proofs is immensely helpful to your own understanding of the material.",
    "A rock-solid core CS course: interesting material, great lectures, pretty interesting problem sets. Spielman makes the class a ton of fun and really cares about helping people understand this stuff. Be warned that exams tended to follow lecture much more closely than they followed psets, but even so both tests and homeworks are altogether pretty fair.",
    "Take this class It is one of the best in the department.",
    "0. The collaboration policy, if still in place, was fantastic--it led to bonding (read: struggling) with your fellow classmates late into the night, but when you all got it in the end, it was fantastic. But seriously, the problem sets were really hard, and I'll be the first to admit that I needed a lot of help in \"discovering\" the solutions to some of the problems. Keep up with the reading (the textbook is fantastic). Trust me, you won't regret it. You won't get back your problem sets on time (the deadline for conversion of Credit\/D\/Fail, we didn't even know most of our grades--only 3 problem sets and 1 exam, out of 8 problem sets and 2 exams total). It can be frustrating, because you might be (but probably are not) failing the course and have no idea. This course is fairly understaffed. Spielman can go really, really fast in class (because he's a genius). Ask him to slow down if you're having trouble (or if he hasn't defined something but still wrote it down anyway). Unfortunately I didn't go to his office hours (I wish I did), but his notes are very clear and the textbook is also very clear (and the concepts taught in class are often in the form of YouTube videos).",
    "It's a rite of passage. You gotta burn. As Buddha says, \"The First Noble Truth is that life is suffering.\"",
    "The course is more discrete math \/ graph theory than anything else in the computer science major. Success in 223 \/ 323 does not guarantee success in this class, and you will certainly become frustrated by the subjective nature of proof-based problem sets at some point. However, learning about NP and reduction is awesome.",
    "This is a really cool class and it was a lot of fun to take with some friends. It is a TON of work though, so definitely start early and expect the psets to take a lot of time and thought. I'm so glad he allowed us to work with other people this time and that really helped me get by. The material itself is very interesting and Dan is a great lecturer. One important thing: learn how to write a proof!! They go over it briefly at the beginning of the class, but it's really a lot easier if you know how to do it coming in. I took MATH 244 (Discrete) with Kaplan and that was the class where I learned how to write proofs, which was incredibly helpful. CPSC 202 apparently didn't teach it as well (gathering from my friends who took that instead), though you get a very similar base of knowledge to go off of which is also necessary.",
    "Fantastic class, one of the best at Yale. Take it, but make sure you have the time to devote to it. The problem sets are difficult, but very rewarding. They really help you understand the material and think about it in new ways, plus they are kind of fun to work on, once you get over how hard they are! Dan Spielman is a great professor. He is clearly so excited about the material he's teaching, and he devotes the last day of class to \"all the cool stuff we didn't cover and how to learn it.\"",
    "Absolutely take this class with Dan Spielman. You learn about algorithms in a very math-oriented way, which I really liked, and Dan is a fantastic lecturer. The workload is significant, but you come away feeling like all the work was necessary. The tests are pretty much a regurgitation of material, which is how Dan wants it, but the problem sets are very challenging and provide a great opportunity to learn things more in-depth than they are offered in lecture. If you're not as math-oriented as I am, you may not enjoy the class as much as I did.",
    "If you for some reason are considering 365 optionally: take it. It's unbelievably rewarding. It'll be the hardest course of your semester, but the problems are fascinating, and the payoffs are incredible.",
    "One of the finest courses Yale has to offer. Excellent overview of the fundamentals of algorithms. Required for CS, but has my highest recommendation for any math, electrical engineering or physics students. Be aware that some knowledge of proofs is a must have.",
    "For a computer science class at Yale, this course is very well taught and generally interesting. The material obviously has niche appeal, but Prof. Spielman does a great job of keeping it interesting. He's a very clear lecturer, too, which helps a lot. The problem sets are fairly difficult, but if you work with your friends it gets a lot better.",
    "Take it, but be prepared to work hard.",
    "My favorite class at Yale! Speilman spends a lot of time coming up with interesting problems for the problem sets and lectures and tries very hard to explain things in a way we can understand during class. The problem sets are hard, but very fun and rewarding.",
    "I took concurrently with Aspnes' 223. It was manageable but definitely challenging and time consuming. I mean, you probably have to take this class, so take it. But if you are not a CS major, then I would still recommend it. The topics are very interesting, the homework is relatively rewarding. The texbook is VERY good. Spielman is definitely one of the best lecturers in the CS or math department, but I still skipped most lectures, because I just learn much better from the book. He's engaging to listen to, and he's a great person, but if I get lost for a bit during lecture, thew hole thing is a bit of a waste. So I did well in the class by only reading the book. Grading was too slow though. We couldn't get back psets in time to really remember what we worked on, to review our errors, etc. There were multiple errors in grading some psets, so be careful.",
    "I really wanted to like this class. I've liked pretty much all the core CS classes, and this one had good course reviews and Spielman is a legend. However, I ended up really hating the course. The material was interesting and Spielman was a good lecturer, but the problem sets were the worst and took forever. People lost points seemingly arbitrarily from the graders, and often people would get different points off for the same mistake. They also took forever to grade (we literally got our 4th problem set, which was turned in before Spring Break, the last day of classes). If you're taking it, you probably have to, otherwise I'd recommend auditing.",
    "Have to take it.",
    "It's soon useful and helpful. Definitely one of the best courses taken.",
    "This is a wonderful class if you are interested in classic problems and their solutions. It does not require a computer science background, but a knowledge of formal math and set theory is invaluable. The problem sets are a good mix of difficulty, and will challenge you. It is occasionally frustrating that you either \"get it\" when trying to solve the problems or don't, but with the new collaboration policy that concern is alleviated. I would recommend for CPSC and AMTH majors, and anyone interested in formal math.",
    "I have little experience in discrete math and programming, but I have always wanted to learn the thought process behind algorithms. This was an extremely helpful course. Not only did it challenge me, but it made me think. Some courses are easy to obtain good grades, but it lacks fun and inspiration. This was a wonderful course. I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to learn something. I spent about 30 hours a week on homework, but if you have better background, you should be fine. I wish I learned this course earlier.",
    "CPSC 365 is a really cool class. If you're majoring in CS you have to take it; I'd recommend starting psets early and finding a pset group (if Dan allows collaboration). Also, if the material interests you, as Dan for extra topics\/problems\/papers to look into-he's super knowledgeable and usually happy to help. If you aren't studying CS, I'd still recommend this class if the material sounds interesting to you. As far as math background goes, discrete math (244) is not required but experience proof based math is helpful. Lecture is interesting, so I'd say Algorithms is also a good class to Cr\/D if you don't want to worry about acing every pset."
