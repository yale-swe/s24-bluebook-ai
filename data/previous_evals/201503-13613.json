   "comments": [
    "10\/10 would recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in finance.",
    "Would definitely recommend. My favorite class I've taken.",
    "Highly recommend- even as someone who came in with no knowledge of banking, and zero interest for that matter, was able to walk out of it having learned tons.",
    "If you're interested in learning about banking as an industry and what role it plays in our economy, this is a great class. It goes over everything from what a bank is, to the roles of banks and regulation. I learned a lot, especially about what happened during the financial crisis, that I really felt I didn't know before.",
    "Great class. Knowledgeable, caring teacher. Definitely not too much work (but a consistent amount). More practical than most econ courses, which was nice. A good combination of lecture\/presentations\/discussion. Professor Pascutti clearly puts a ton of time into preparing for every class, and he makes the three-hour roundtrip drive to New Haven twice a week to make sure everyone has plenty of time to meet with him. When he lectures (lectures + students presentations + discussion each make up a portion of each weekly seminar), he lectures clearly (I use the word lecture loosely, because lecture in this sense means him speaking at the whiteboard as he asks for input and questions from students). He has lots of funny and insightful stories to tell, particularly ones that occurred during the financial crisis. Plus, he's just really nice and supportive.",
    "Take it.",
    "Highly recommend to anyone who has any interest in finance. Pascutti is a boss -- he has high energy, is brilliant, and is full of interesting anecdotes which he sprinkles throughout class. I learned a ton about how banks work, the causes\/consequences of the 2007\/2008 financial crisis, banking regulations, housing policy....so much! The work is much less technical than other financial theory classes (papers, not problem sets). And the workload was not that bad at all.",
    "Pascutti is well intentioned and dedicated to getting feedback, also makes time to spend office hours with students - overall solid first class, but can be a bit of a harsh grader without being able to clearly articulate reasons for lowered grades. However, very passionate about finance! Has strong opinions and great stories - clearly someone who knows his stuff. Can be a plus or minus - if you're on that level you'll like it, if not then you can get left behind. Not a beginner class!",
    "Prof. Pascutti is an awesome professor - clearly so dedicated to the course and the material. He is really really brilliant and accessible, so definitely take advantage of office hours. Probably one of the less quantitative econ seminars (workload is reading responses and three papers). Recommended!",
    "This class did attract a lot of students who have worked in or plan to work in finance, but Professor Pascutti also made it accessible for those with very little prior knowledge of finance. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in the banking system, as you'll be reading and thinking about some of the most interesting topics in the industry. Assignments were challenging but not too numerous- three papers, two presentations (each presentation is based on one of the papers you've written so it's only three separate research topics), no midterms. The weekly readings as required as they're discussed in class.",
    "This class has a lot of potential. It doesn't have a lot of work, 3 papers and weekly readings. If discussions of the financial crisis can be turned into a coherent narrative then this could easily be one of the best classes at Yale. However, as it stands, the class kinda sucks.",
    "I would recommend it if you have a strong interest and background in finance. Most of the class is spent talking about the Financial Crisis. Professor Pascutti does make a genuine effort to make himself available to the students and to improve the class.",
    "Great class - got a bit slow at times because of lengthy required presentations, but the presentations themselves weren't that hard to complete. Just took a long time to sit through everyone else's presentations. Pascutti has seen and done it all as an investment banker and hedge fund manager, and has a LOT of great personal anecdotes from the banking crisis in 2008. He also runs the class in a pretty open ended manner, he will teach everything from bond math to bank accounting to financial regulation based on what the majority of the class is interested in.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning the finer details of the US banking system. Professor Pascutti is very generous with his time and is willing to put in the efforts and time to make the seminar more interesting. If you do most of the readings, pay attention in class and go to office hour, you'll get a lot from just one semester of this class. Also, it's a pretty decent workload. Besides, all the readings were on point and interesting. Overall, a solid senior seminar that I'd recommend to anyone, whether or not you plan to go into finance."
