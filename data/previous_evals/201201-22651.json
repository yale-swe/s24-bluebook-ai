    "Great course and Sebastian is a great professor.",
    "If you only took Spanish 1, 2, and 3 in high school, then this course will be challenging because Spanish 110 covers all of 1, 2, and 3 from high school. For me, Spanish 120 was all new stuff.",
    "This class was mostly review for me, but I still feel like I learned and improved a lot. The daily assignments can get annoying, but they're not difficult. Take it with Sebastian if you can. He's amazing!",
    "Definitely recommend. You go from 0 to almost fluent if you are willing to put some work into it. Fantastic course.",
    "Highly recommended.",
    "Definitely, because it is a language worth learning, as nearly 250 million people speak it worldwide. Also, the Spanish Department at Yale is one of the best in the country and so it's the best language class to join if you are looking to fulfill the requirement in a language that is worthwhile and well taught, so that you can actually be able to communicate after college with native speakers.",
    "Yes. I learned a lot of spanish.",
    "TAKE IT WITH SEBASTIAN! He's the best professor ever. Seriously."
