It was also hard when you just assumed we knew people and names, that may have been truer last semester but for most of us this is the first time going through this information.",
    "The sections were well organized.",
    "I took the exemption exam and passed out of this semester of the class, so I cannot speak to the classroom experience. However, I believe that the curriculum is a useful crash-course for any theater professional to be conversant in the Western Canon. I appreciated and would like to see more non-Western texts included.",
    "I think the topic of our first lecture this semester would have fit better with last semester's content.",
    "There is too much packed in the course and so we tended to gloss over certain eras and countries.",
    "The organization made sense, in that it's a survey course that was trying to cover a lot and working chronologically probably is most logical. However, by trying to cover such a breadth of material in one semester, the structure\/trajectory became a bit chaotic.",
    "Materials were mostly organized in chronological order with a few exceptions where important cross-cultural trends were being pointed out.",
    "I wish we had more post-colonial thought reflected in the curriculum, and I'm not entirely certain why 18th-century and early 19th-century practice is something I'll need to think about instead of practice that blends different traditions in the context of the post-colonial."

    "I think it was helpful to require students to pick their essay topic a week early. I thought we had to turn in an intro paragraph that week, so I submitted my outline. It turned out to be really helpful in my essay writing process and I think other students would benefit from having to turn in a thesis paragraph or an outline a week ahead (to help avoid the temptation to procrastinate.)",
    "Please keep in mind that very very few of us are writers, or critics - TA's with unrealistic expectations can make us feel worthless pretty quickly.",
    "The paper didn't have a clear description of what was wanted. I've never had to write a paper from the mindset of being a dramaturg and I felt like that was what my TA (Sam) was looking for. It felt like I was taking a shot in the dark and writing what I thought was correct only to get a paper back saying that I didn't complete what the assignment should be. If the paper is about my opinion based on an article that we read, how can that be? Also, none of us are studying to be literary critics and while it's important for us to learn how they think, asking us to think and write like that can be hard for many in our program.",
    "I was glad we have two very different types of assignments and particularly liked the Elinor Fuchs's small planet essay because it concentrated your focus on the elements that often drive design choices. As a costume designer, I found it a compelling exercise.",

I found I was able to finish all my assigned reading if I finished it on Sunday. I bet other student would benefit from this technique. The only exception was during tech weeks. I couldn't finish reading while we were in tech.",
    "Weekly discussions aren't worth the time they take up - they always digress into off-topic rambling. The TA's try, but it's just not a worthy exercise.",
    "it would help if the readings involved shorter plays or synopsis reads with some articles about the play's analysis etc. some plays were a little too long and it didnt seem like the discussion really needed reading the entire play.",
    "It was A LOT when combined with all of the other work we had to do. At least as a theater manager. I literally did not have the time to do all of the reading. Sometimes it was read or sleep.",
    "Of the assigned reading, I probably read half of them, and skimmed another quarter. I would have liked to do more, but other assignments always had precedence. This seemed to be true for most people, which made weekly discussion frequently very frustrating.",
    "I could have used more time in my work week to focus on these readings. There is just only so much time in the day...",
    "Fine. I should have done more of the reading, but I didn't, as my own courseload got the better of me, and I prioritized my own department's work over that of Drama 6. Perhaps if the plays were shorter, it would lead to more of the class doing them; and thus, richer discussion. Because when we had read, we were able to have some great discussions."

    "To be perfectly honest, this class did a great deal to reiterate knowledge I had already gained from previous education, with some new knowledge gained particularly in 18th and 19th-Century pre-modern theater, and in post-modern theater as well. Other than that, this course largely prepared me for the field as I already knew it, and did not give me much of an opportunity to merge the knowledge of what came before with what is coming now. The lectures on post-colonial theater were of particular interest; it's a shame that we skipped like a third of the slides (all of the slides on the post-colonial British Caribbean). What about post-colonial Latin America? What about decolonized work from the United States?"

In fact, I don't know why that isn't done. If you can require this, why not instead require people to take a certain number of theater studies courses to fulfill this need.",
    "It depends a GREAT deal on the person. The content is very interesting, and if you're someone who learns well in a lecture context then that part of the learning is great. But with the time commitment, and the varying quality of discussion groups, it's a bit of a gamble. I would probably recommend auditing it, so as to take in the material without having to try to cram all of the disparate information into your head for an exam.",

For that, I am grateful. But for anyone who was beyond the absolute basics of theater history, and was looking to put together new forms based on what they knew of the past, I would be more hesitant."

I think clearer bullet points on the slides would be helpful as Paul delves deeper into each particular concept in a lecture, especially for people like me who do not have an academic or dramaturgical background.",
    "I think Paul can allow himself a little more room to lecture off-script. The lectures he reads are beautiful but it is also very fascinating to listen to his unscripted thoughts. I always enjoyed the lectures by the DFA students. I think it's a nice way to keep the semester interesting.",
    "So much information was given out in each lecture it could be overwhelming.",
    "Paul's treatment of non-European cultures showed that he clearly tried to provide as much information as possible, but it still only skimmed the surface. Moreover, there is only so much one can cover in a lecture on Japan and China, or on West Africa and India and the Caribbean (which we didn't even get to). As we shift into a globalized and postcolonial world, a larger commitment to globalized and postcolonial art might be called for in the Drama 6 curriculum."

    "The willingness is there, absolutely. Paul is obviously going to be one of the faculty members most affected by our new EDI training, due to nature of theater history as it is currently presented in our society and the fact that he is an adult white male (Paul is at fault for NEITHER of these things, of course, but it is part of reality today). I appreciate all of the changes and efforts he has clearly made to create a more inclusive, more comprehensive theater history course. It must be one of the most inclusive comprehensive, one-year theater courses in the world. I know that it needs to go further, though, and I get the impression that Paul is willing to take it there. I think that making sure the DFA section leaders and Paul have a common vocabulary with the Drama 6 students will make all the difference in the world. If Paul and all of the DFA leaders participate in Carmen Morgan's workshop, they will be better prepared with the language and terms to answer student concerns in lecture and sections. I did hear a rumor that Paul will not be making any changes to the current syllabus because he will be too busy with the Rep show. I hope the Deans and Faculty will find ways to offer Paul additional support so that he can make changes to the Drama 6 course while working on the Rep show, because next year the EDI pushback will have an even stronger voice (since classes '18, '19, and '20 will All have had Carmen Morgan's workshop.) I also think that Paul and the section leaders will have some miserable in-class experiences if they keep the syllabus exactly the same.",
    "Paul is clearly working hard to expand the reach of his course, and consider voices beyond those currently included. It's a difficult thing, to try to teach a survey course AND make it more inclusive. There's only so much time, and the canon is vast. I really appreciate the work he's putting into it.",

Feedback wasn't \"you didn't support your points\" or anything like that it was \"you're wrong.\" This is NOT the right way to grade things. Tests cover way to many specific details - the only effective way to study is to cram. Rote memorization of playwrights and plays is not helpful to us in the future - we'll never be in a situation where we can't look those things up. Grasping movements and concepts is a great help for us in production work, but that just isn't what the tests are structured to reward.",

    "Why do the dramaturgs not participate? I did not see one in the class. I heard that they have to test out which seems unfair to the rest of the school when this is mandatory for everyone else. Also, I feel the different lengths of exam essays don't work for everyone's style of learning. a few fill in the blanks or multiple choice questions having to write 6 t o7 essays in 2 hours does not seem inclusive.",
    "As a designer, this class was awful to have in my second year. While I find the class very valuable and necessary, the second year is the worst time to have this class. Third year is more free for designers, and first year is the best time to have this material introduced to us. Tests always fall on the same dates as techs, and costume designers need to do notes most of the days and evenings so there's little time to devote to studying. I could never find time to thoroughly read the assignments, I missed several prompts because our big critique classes are on Wednesday. Also, as a costume designer, I need to miss class to shop in New York. At the beginning of the year Paul listed this as a frivolous reason to miss class. As a designer, shopping for my fabrics and other necessary things is something that has to be done in person, and is as important as rehearsals are to actors. As Saturday (a day we also have class) and Sunday are sometimes not within the various shops' business hours, we need to miss class on a weekday. I try to space these trips out so I'm not missing too many classes of one class, but Tuesday and Thursdays are usually the best days to do this.",
    "The syllabus needs to be more inclusive and I think that there is a huge disadvantage of those with learning disabilities to retain information from this class.",
    "Please try to make this class at 10am. Please try to make this class at 10am. Please try to make this class at 10am. I know, I know, I know. Many departments, many classs, TD&P conflicting class, I get it. Something else will have to give. But I can PROMISE you that there will be better results, better participation, fewer students falling asleep in the front row, and we will learn the material better if this lecture is at 10am. You can even put section discussion at 9am on Thursday, just put the lectures at 10am. Just try it. Just for one year. You won't know unless you try.",
    "It's just way too much reading to be feasible for anybody on actual production assignments.",
    "it is hard to cover the vast amount of information in the given number of classes. so the discussions should be used to explore the topics that were pertinent but not discussed. if the discussion sessions could be designed to be more inclusive of diverse thoughts and ideas we would also get to know more modern writings happening in different parts of the world.",
    "To have us take outside history and theater classes. It would be more effective and the people who want to get something out of it will. I say that because many people do the BARE MINIMUM to pass this class without having any intention of using it again. They come on time and either sleep or don't pay attention. Both in class and in discussion. We're just being spoken at. And oftentimes spoken to like a child. In fact, may of the interaction I had with my TA, both verbally in discussion and via email, made me feel like I was back in 5th grade and I was doing well in the class, she wasn't even addressing me. I just think if you treat people like adults and give them a choice in how they take in information (since we all learn differently), this class would be much better for it.",
    "-- It's great how much Paul wants to answer people's questions at the end of lecture, and understandable that there's very little time. Perhaps rather than only having those few moments to ask Paul questions, he could rotate through discussion groups. Each week he could visit a different discussion section, and it would be an opportunity to ask questions about lecture, pick up loose threads from previous classes, and so forth. -- I'd ask everyone who lectures to work to avoid making jokes and\/or derisive comments about sex workers. It happened a lot (as it does in many history classes) and felt casually sexist and classist in a way I do not think was intended.",
    "So much information....",
    "The TA did not help at all. They could not clearly answer any questions we have in the discussion section.",
    "Sorry, the weekly responses don't always get my full attention on top of my seven other classes this semester."

It made sure that I read the play (or some people just Wikipedia it,) but sometimes I felt like I was really stretching to just turn something in for a grade, instead of better understanding the content.",
    "Discussions are unfortunately a waste of our time. I can see how they might have value, but it's not worth the energy it takes and the time it blocks in our schedules. The topics wander, and even when we stay on topic there isn't anything that actually expands our knowledge of the material, beyond discussing how one \"connected\" with characters or situations - that won't ever help me down the road.",
    "Good for knowing what concepts we had to learn for tests but otherwise just okay.",
    "I spent a lot of time trying to fill dead air because so few of my classmates had read a particular week's play. I learned some from the discussion, but it never really felt worth the extra hour a week.",
