    "learned about schools of thought and societal norms that heavily influenced traditional Chinese cultured (with a focus on themes of gender and family), develop the skills to write Chinese essays at the same level of essays written for non-language Yale courses",
    "I greatly developed my reading abilities in this course, because each unit began with reading an excerpt from a novel. My writing skills also improved: Su Laoshi pushed us to express the same ideas in our Chinese essays as we would have done in English.",
    "I gained a much deeper and stronger foundation of Chinese culture and history, as well as better speaking skills. I feel much more comfortable in terms of my speaking and reading abilities as well.",
    "I learned a lot about Chinese modern history through the professor's personal anecdotes and his explanation. My critical reading skills in mandarin have considerably improved. My analytical mandarin writing skills have also gotten much better. The new vocabulary learned in this course have also helped me become a better speaker in my day to day life.",
    "Deeper understanding of Chinese culture and society through Chinese novels."

    "if someone could help prof. su upload the syllabus to canvas, that would help everyone stay on the same page regarding quizzes\/essays\/presentations dates",
    "The only improvement would be to give students more speaking practice.",
    "Professor Su's personality and ability to keep the class engaged was definitely a strength of the course. I felt that it was incredibly easy to pay attention to his lectures. No weaknesses come directly to mind."

   "comments": [
    "yes! but definitely shop it first to decide if your fluency level is high enough for it. but also Prof. Su really encourages steady improvement and i think i've noticed him adjusting in-class discussion questions accordingly for students with different levels of fluency (mostly by deciding which student answers which question in class; we're all supposed to have prepared a response to all the questions the night before anyways)",
    "Yes, depending on what they hope to develop. I had wanted to improve my reading abilities, so the class was a good fit. However, someone who wants to focus on speaking should consider another course first.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student with an interest in gaining a better understanding of Chinese culture and literature.",
    "Yes absolutely",
    "Through evaluating modern Chinese novels, the course explores the Chinese society by discussing values of gender and family in the Chinese tradition. Yet the course itself is designed on the basis of teaching more advanced Chinese language and characters. As a result, it is an rather easy class but encourages great amount of thinking."
