    "Specific stylistic tools and writing a compelling story.",
    "This is the only course I took at FES, and possibly the only course offered at FES, that really teaches you how to craft, research, and write an article for newspaper\/magazine publication. It's a great skill I feel I've learned.",
    "Prof. Strebeigh opened my eyes to so many writing tools, I'm not sure I'll ever read any prose the same! I have learned to spot and play with the significance, drama, scenes, \"snaps,\" and other key elements of a piece. Most importantly, I've learned how to tighten my (oft-verbose) writing and incorporate - truly incorporate! - others' feedback on my drafts. :)",
    "I feel like I have good tools to take steps towards improving my writing.",
    "I feel like I was able to flex my writing muscles.",
    "This course helped me to articulate many things I subconsciously knew, but hadn't thought about in an intentional way. Going forward I will be a better writer, storyteller, and thinker because of this course!",
    "I dramatically improved my writing skills and understanding of effective nonfiction writing techniques in this course. Through the writing and editing of a long-form journalism piece, as well as the excellent supplementary readings by leading environmental writers, I learned how to more effectively build drama, how to establish my authority as a writer, and how to structure a piece to provide focus and entertainment for the reader throughout. I also gained insights into the importance of communicating about environmental issues in a straightforward and accessible way, as opposed to an academic way, and I deeply value the opportunity to apply that in my future environmental work.",
    "I learned how to write well and understood that good writing is an act of revision. Fred pushed all of us to be better,in our thinking and in our writing - a skill useful beyond the constraints of this class and F&ES.",
    "How to read critically, and write an engaging piece",
    "We learned how to construct an environmental article -- along with how to construct the sections that comprise it. We looked at some of the best environmental writers -- incl. some FES alums -- who've been published in the field. Fred showed us what needs to be included as well as different ways to construct those sections. I really learned how to be an effective environmental writer and to deliver hard (scientific) fact without it being overwhelming to the reader. This is a terrific skill to take away.",
    "This course was great for understanding how to craft the different parts of an environmental writing piece and for engaging with a number of great environmental writers, and trying to use some of these techniques in our own writing."

   "comments": [
    "I would have gotten more out of this course if I had a better sense of how I wanted to frame my story early on.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Everything exceeded expectations - from the professor, to the TA, to the group workshopping, to the reading material, and beyond!",
    "They exceeded my expectations.",
    "Knowledge, skills, and insights aligned very well with my expectations of the class.",
    "This was a hard course to know what to expect from, but I couldn't have been happier with the result.",
    "This class exceeded my already high expectations for it. The professor was phenomenal at facilitating discussion of environmental writing during the class meetings, and made himself accessible to students throughout the semester for one-on-one meetings to address specifics of our writing.",
    "This course exceeded my expectations. I have never had any professor care so much about my writing, and for my intellectual product.",
    "This class aligned very well with my expectations and I felt I learned a lot from it. The only downside was I expected to be able to develop my own piece more, but that was more a result of my story itself being incomplete than the class failing to deliver."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Key strengths were the professor and TA's feedback each week on my draft as well as the workshopping set-up for the latter half of the course (which helped me become more specifically familiar with their work and thereby helpful in support its development). The only weakness was losing half the class at midterm... :(",
    "Strengths of the course include Fred's knowledge and feedback. Can't say there are any major weaknesses or room for improvement.",
    "The strengths are that it is hands-on -- you're learning by doing, and with the support and guidance of a very experienced writer. Fred's feedback was invaluable -- he puts huge time and effort into his critiques, and I learned so much from him.",
    "The overarching strength of this class was the opportunity it provided to become an expert on a topic of deep personal interest, and to write a story about that topic that would allow it to reach a broader audience. I have no suggestions for its improvement.",
    "The strengths of the course are the time and care Fred and Chris (the TA) put into our writing. I also liked that we finished a considerable portion of our writing during the first half of the semester. This allowed us to focus on revisions and editing during the second half, which is generous and understanding of students and their crazy, finals schedules. I also appreciated the opportunities to meet with Fred one on one to discuss our writing.",
    "The professor didn't have much time to meet with students outside the class, which considering that it is a writing course was not great. The professor's feedback on writing was excellent!",
    "The course was brilliantly executed all around. Its strengths were in the format (walking through environmental writing and discovering what makes the pieces powerful, successful) and in the workshops (being able to develop my skills of constructive praise and criticism in addition to being stronger in receiving both).",
    "Strengths: Amazing professor and great readings, good peer insight and engaging discussions in class Improvements: Perhaps more time in class to write\/brainstorm on our individual pieces would be good."

   "comments": [
    "Take it, absolutely. It's a fantastic class, possibly the best I've taken at FES.",
    "YES! If only this course would be offered ad infinitum! Take this course if you want to learn to write well for a popular media audience! This is the best writing class I've taken in nearly a decade!",
    "If given the opportunity to take a course with Fred Strebeigh, you should do it. He is one of the best educators I have experienced in my higher education and this course was invaluable to me.",
    "Take it!",
    "If possible, do your research before starting the class. I did mine while writing, which is do-able but not ideal.",
    "Take it. Wherever you're at as a writer, I think everyone could benefit from the opportunity to think deeply about a topic of interest (whether it's your research, a trip you took, or an environmental issue you've always wanted to study closely), and create a story about it that allows you to share it with others in an engaging and meaningful way.",
    "Don't miss the opportunity to take this class and refine your writing. Fred is a wonderful professor. This was by far the best class I've taken at F&ES.",
    "Prepare to read and write a lot! The reading is always pretty interesting. Speak up in class!",
    "If you want to learn the basics of environmental writing, this course is for you. You will get out of it exactly what you put in. The workshopping skills learned in this class will help you with group work at FES and beyond.",
    "This is a great class - Professor Streibeigh is great, such an encouraging professor who really promotes discussion, values student thoughts and voices, and takes the class through a discovery of some of the great works of environmental writing. Definitely worth taking!"
