    "Great introduction to occupational health and hazards! Great guest speakers. Readings were manageable - but wish they were provided a slightly bit more in advance.",
    "The course was a great introduction to occupational medicine. It was extremely interesting and the guest lecturers were a great change of pace.",
    "The course was excellent. I have decided to do fellowship in occupational and environmental medicine after doing my residency for the future. It was very practical and engaging. I am excited to take the course from people with diverse and practical experience in the field.The reference text book was complete and very informative too.",
    "This was a really interesting and enjoyable course. I learned a lot at each lecture, both when Carrie or Meredith was lecturing and when one of the fabulous guest lecturers was visiting. The course could be improved from using better and more reliable computer equipment in the occ med room.",
    "Very fair to good introduction to Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Broad but engaging and certainly informative. Strengths: Instructors, guest lecturers, readings, text-book (somewhat), Weakness: size and configuration of room; technological, limitations. Recommendation: more pre-planned group exercises based on readings",
    "I thought this was a great course. Every week there is a guest lecturer who talks about different areas in the field of occupational health, and gives you a very good overview of the subject. The workload was very light, although there are pop quizzes."

    "I strongly recommend this class for medical students and for people practicing medicine. I can say we hardly know anything regarding occupational and environmental medicine. A lot of the occupational diseases are underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed. We see a lot of patients with complaints regarding social security benefits, work place injuries, etc. Do we really know how to address such issues? then I tell them to sign up for this class. It really helps for everyday medical practice.",
    "This was a really enjoyable and informative course that I highly recommend to YSPH students. Great instructors, engaging guest lecturers, and small class size. Really enjoyed the class and everyone involved in organizing it.",
    "Very fair to good introduction to Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Broad but engaging and certainly informative. Accommodating of even the uninitiated re: environmental and occupational health.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in issues concerning occupational safety and health."
