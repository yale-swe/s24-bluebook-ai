   "comments": [
    "You shouldn't take it if it's not with Professor Cole-Taylor.",
    "This is an incredible class. It offers an exploration of the theory behind teaching and learning using established literature and empirical studies. This work is matched with observation of a New Haven high school classroom, which allows one to reconcile practice with theory. Altogether, this class offers a careful and academic, yet realistic, study of education.",
    "This class is absolutely wonderful, but it cannot be taught without Prof. Cole-Taylor. Really great for anyone interested in education in any sense. I hope that the university figures out some way to continue the education studies program.",
    "The professor will be different than the one I had, but even based just off the structure of the course, I'd recommend taking EDST 190. The readings are all interesting and relevant, and the assignments ask you to form your own opinions, and you get to observe in a highschool classroom which is sweet. Shop it and check out the new professor, I would guess it will still be worth taking.",
    "A great class, but since Linda Cole-Taylor will be gone next year, I'm not sure how wonderful it will be. Most of the course's strength came from Prof. Cole-Taylor as an instructor.",
    "I would summarize the course as an approach to understanding education in the classroom, in the community and greater society. I would greatly recommend the course to another student because it was a great opportunity to really dive into questions relating to education and the community that I'd come across as a student. It is unfortunate however, that students will not be able to take the class with Prof. Cole-Taylor.",
    "I would have, but Linda Cole-Taylor is leaving. I'm not sure what it will look like inthe future. It is a real shame she had to leave. This was an excellent course.",
    "Education studies is one of those classes that makes you think about the subject, how the subject applies to you, and your own personal experience"
