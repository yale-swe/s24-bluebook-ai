    "About general concepts important in environmental engineering! related to meaasuring\/affecting water quality, air quality, etc",
    "I feel like I gained general knowledge on environmental engineering practices.",
    "The introduction fundamentals of environmental engineering.",
    "I think that this course has developed within me foundational elements and principles of engineering, as well as the ability to implement those principles both conceptually and quantitatively for the designed amendment of real-world environmental problems. A great example of this is in learning to perform mass balances to describe water and air quality conditions.",
    "A basic overview of important topics in environmental science such as water quality (including hardness, alkalinity, BOD), air pollution (including gaussian plumes), acid-base chemistry, disinfection kinetics, and a few other topics. Good balance of learning the surface level of a lot of topics and going deeper into problem solving for one or two types of problems in each topic."

   "comments": [
    "it's a good class, could be a little more organized sometimes but overall extremely enjoyable",
    "Really liked this course. It is well structured and the lectures\/psets align with each other well. I would recommend this course to anybody interested in environmental engineering.",
    "Strengths: amazing professor Weaknesses: a bit disorganized at times, made it hard to follow",
    "This course was very interesting and served well as an intro class. The homeworks were challenging but not undoable and the exams were very fair.",
    "Strengths of the course were that the lectures were engaging and the tests were fair. The tests covered material that we learned in class. A",
    "I loved the course and feel it contained more strengths than I can count. The content was challenging but fun, and applications to the real world were always visible. It was a proper commencement into the tools an environmental engineer might need. If I had to make a comment on an area for potential expansion, I feel it would be really cool if the course would further cover global warming and renewable energy engineering.",
    "Strengths - honestly a very fun and engaging lecture to attend. Prof Peccia taught what he thought was important and the psets and exams reflected those topics. Both Professor Peccia and Brenna the TF were fantastic about offering office hours for extra help, which we often needed. Psets were a reasonable length with a few challenging problems a week that would be hard to do on your own but made a lot of sense if you sought out extra help. Weaknesses - the class felt a bit disorganized at times, especially with regards to the readings, which could be helpful but weren't always super relevant or assigned at an early enough time."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, Professor Peccia is good balance of being laid-back and yet challenging as a professor. The problem sets were harder than the tests, which was ideal for preparing us for the midterm and final. I thoroughly enjoyed going to lecture everyday and if I was not a junior, this course probably would have encouraged me to major in EnvE.",
    "yes it's great! peccia is an awesome dude and will help you with everything you need",
    "Yes, although it assumes a knowledge of a large amount of chemistry so be prepared for that",
    "Yes I would recommend this class. Professor is great and hilarious. He is very kind and wants his students to do well. Content is very interesting and applicable.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course.",
    "Yes! Fun, just the right amount of challenging (for those without an extensively strong science background especially), and relevant!",
    "Yes, great class if you're looking for an overview of the topics that environmental engineers deal with. It does a great job of covering a wide range of topics in a way that is accessible to non-stem majors willing to put in a bit of work, but that also provides a brief look into the types of problem solving that would be involved in more specialized classes in the major. It was a great class for me because it helped me decide if environmental engineering was something that i love in practice, or that i just love the idea of."
