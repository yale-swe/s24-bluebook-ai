    "Chinese 110 is a great course with amazing professors! The small size of the class allows the students to participate a lot during class, and so you will improve your speaking skills very quickly. The course is also quite demanding academically, with a lot of homework and daily quizzes. It can be too much workload sometimes but in the end it is worth it because students make great progress after a semester. The weekly tutorials are great too, allowing students to speak Chinese on a one-to-one basis.",
    "yes, if you want to learn chinese, but it's a lot of work. the amount of work probably allows us to learn so much so quickly though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you're really interested in learning Chinese. Remember, it's a lot of hard work and commitment is necessary. You need to put it a lot of time to practice characters and grammar. If you don't feel like you can put in enough time don't take the this language!",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Chinese. Be warned, it is difficult, and there will be a time when you don't know how to go on further. When this happens:Go to teacher office hours. They teach really well.Go to Chinese table. It is fun and you learn a lot of Chinese.Get a tutor if you want help. I did this and it was useful.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course! There is a lot of work, but you will quickly get into the rhythm of it. Every class is entertaining and you will quickly bond with the other students in your section. If you are on the fence about starting Chinese, I highly recommend that you give it a chance!",
    "If you want to learn Chinese at all, DO IT! Besides the workload, which is in fact a good thing in retrospect, it's pretty amazing.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend Chinese 110 03.",
    "I would recommend this class. It's a great foundation for learning Chinese.",
    "Chinese 110 03 is an absolutely phenomenal course for an introduction to Chinese language. Though the workload is very intense, in hindsight it is necessary to succeed in learning the language. I would absolutely recommend this course to another student based on the great teaching, relaxed yet productive atmosphere and useful knowledge gained.",
    "A lot of work and your class becomes very close. Yes I would recommend IF you have a strong motivation and love for the language.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is serious about taking on a new, and very different language. It is difficult, even at the elementary level, but I also think it is highly rewarding.",
    "If you are serious about learning Chinese then this is a great way to start. If you are just looking to get your language requirement out of the way, this will be a lot more work then you were looking for.",
    "It is a tough class, but well worth it. If you are willing to spend hours every night studying, then the rest of the resources are there. The teachers are fantastic and will help you with everything you need.",
    "This course is insane. This can be interpreted in both a negative and a positive sense. I cannot imagine getting a more immersive and thorough introduction to a language. The entire rotation of teachers is excellent. They are understanding, informative, helpful and incredibly consistent. However, you must be prepared for the workload of this course from the very beginning otherwise you will quickly find yourself overwhelmed and behind. And while I know every one of these reviews will say L1 Chinese is a lot of work, I have to reiterate that. It is so much more work than any other course you could find yourself taking. You have to be prepared to dedicate yourself to language study to succeed in this class, and that usually means spending hours on Chinese outside of class on a daily basis. All that being said, L1 Chinese is a blast. You will bond with your section in a way you won't with any other class, and the professors make it the most entertaining 50 minutes you could imagine.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend the course. You enter the semester knowing almost nothing about Chinese and by the end of it you can manage to make some simple small structures and definitely speak in the right tones.",
    "All the Chinese professors are excellent, pretty clearly the best language department at Yale. I encourage you to take it, especially considering all the opportunities to study abroad, etc. HOWEVER, Chinese is ridiculously time consuming. It doesn't matter how smart you are or how talented you are at languages, this class requires two to three hours of daily work, no matter what. If you can't put in that time or have difficulty being that diligent, watch out, because your classmates are going to be diligent and it'll be tough to keep up and compete.If you need the help, tutors are available and pretty useful, just a heads up.",
    "Chinese 110 is a very rewarding class. You put in a lot of work, but by the end of the term you are amazed by how far you've progressed. I highly recommend the class.",
    "It is a fun but intense class. You will have homework each night, and extra effort is required to do well, but it is a fun environment. You will learn! If you are serious, I would definitely recommend it."
