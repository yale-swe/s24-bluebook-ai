    "Great opportunity to apply knowledge from other classes.",
    "It was an excellent and very helpful experience for me to start my career in infectious disease modeling. I knew very little about modeling when I started this research rotation, but the primary instructor (Dr. Dan Weinberger) provided me with instructions and feedback which enabled me to keep this project moving forward.",
    "Strengths-- Great introduction to benchwork and working with insects in a laboratory setting, encouraging and flexible PI (Doug Brackney). Weaknesses-- Along with long training period, not enough time to complete many tangible outcomes, especially considering the dependence on mosquito development times."
