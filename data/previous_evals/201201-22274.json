    "I would recommend it to a student who doesn't have much experience with political thought. I think the course was most valuable for the fact that it exposed me to the major works, and will help me decide which authors I would like to study more in-depth over the next three years. I imagine that a student who already has a general idea of these works would find the treatment too superficial.",
    "a ton of reading, but the best syllabus in the DS program. yes, but be prepared",
    "DS H&P second semester reading material are extremely interesting. If you like historical and political thoughts, you will enjoy this class a lot. You will have a great academic experience with any of the professors here."
