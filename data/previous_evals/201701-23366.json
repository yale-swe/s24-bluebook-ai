    "Good; it would have been nice to have more speakers.",
    "Weaknesses: same kind of lecturer, boring",
    "Strength is that we have different speakers covering vastly different fields in CDE. I love it. Lunch is also a great incentive.",
    "What's relieving is no more pizza! But probably due to funding limit, the healthier food is insufficient. I always got hungry at like 3:00pm on seminar day.",
    "Nice topic coverage.",
    "I enjoyed listening to all the guest speakers! They were extremely passionate about their research topics!",
    "Required lecture series. The speakers are usually interesting. The only weakness is when the speakers are not interesting.",
    "Its strengths are that you can gauge additional research areas in CDE!",
    "The course tried to bring in guest lectures who were interdisciplinary in the chronic disease department which I found a great help to understand how the department fit in the context of public health work. Would have liked to see more lectures on low-income chronic disease research, but otherwise no complaints about the course.",
    "Poor speakers. Find speakers who reflect student interests.",
    "You could have people who only have an MPH in CDE or SBS tell us about their career path. While many people do want to do a PhD, there are a considerable number of students just here for their MPH."

    "A fun lecture series. It is required, but they give you food so all is well.",
    "It was pretty informative!",
    "Overall, a great seminar with interesting lectures. Despite it being a required course, the lectures were extremely interested and I felt I would have attended the talks out of my own personal interests.",
    "I really dont believe it is all that necessary, but if the seminar continues then students should have some input in the speakers or their topics of discussion."
