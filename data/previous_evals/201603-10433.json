   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about basic astronomy and the modern theories. The class is good to help you keep up with modern astronomical theories and is a good marker for whether or not Astronomy is a major for you.",
    "Maybe my math skills improved, but it's hard to say. I had a lot of trouble with the quantitative portion of this class. I learned a lt about the universe though.",
    "I took this course Credit\/D, which kind of affected my engagement with the material if I'm honest, but the material is intriguing and made me want to learn more about the topics we covered. Being a science major in a course not intended for science majors is always interesting, but the material was presented in a way that seemed neither too elevated nor too lowered. It definitely got me thinking.",
    "I got an incredible beginner's look at the basics of astronomy (especially stars, galaxies, and black holes). It's an incredibly cool subject and great to learn about.",
    "I learned a lot about the practice of astronomy and also about how stars work, how black holes work, cosmology. I learned a good amount of stuff.",
    "Learned a lot about the Universe as a whole. Such an interesting class even for a non-science major.",
    "I learned so much about astro which is what I wanted.",
    "I definitely learned a lot about astro-physics and how to think about physics problems. I also learned some really fascinating things about how the universe works.",
    "I brushed up on my physics and such and learned lots about star formation!",
    "Thi is class is a beautiful mix of basic physics (mechanics, work-energy, gravity) and the theory of the universe, which together are so beautiful and fascinating.",
    "I learned a lot about our universe from this class.",
    "I learned how to solve different types of problems and examine the physical universe differently than in previous science and math classes. I also learned how to judge long distances and cross-check my answers with common values, such as the luminosity of the sun or one AU.",
    "A really great SC or QR for non-STEM majors - the physics is a bit challenging, but all makes sense, and the scope of concepts in the course can seem a bit overwhelming, but it gives you a whole other perspective of life and is great context when stressed out about relatively insignificant issues.",
    "I entered Astro 120 with a high school physics background but no further knowledge of the material covered in this course. So, as far as content is concerned, any working knowledge I have about stars\/galaxies\/the universe was developed in this class. I received a comprehensive and enjoyable introduction to astronomy. My physics skills, particularly my ability to understand given equations, have greatly improved through the problem sets. And this class made me want to take more astronomy classes, so I suppose that's an insight.",
    "No skills ~gained~ but I definitely gained a QR credit!",
    "Great overall course.",
    "I learned how to figure out and solve word problems with equations, which is something I have not ever done before. I learned about our solar system and galaxy in more depth than I could have imagined.",
    "I learned techniques for measuring distances to stars",
    "I learned how the different parts of the universe are related to each other and how the earth fits into the universe.",
    "I gained a broad spectrum of knowledge on galaxies and the universe as a whole. I became better at thinking physics problems through logically and applying what we learned in class or in our reading to solve them.",
    "I learned about Newton's laws, star evolution, Einstein's theories of relativity, and the Big Bang theory. I developed the ability to think through problems regarding Einstein's special theory of relativity. I gained insight into some major research questions being asked in the field of astronomy.",
    "I learned a lot about the basics of astronomy and learned how to apply the equations to solve problems.",
    "I took this class to learn about the incredibly large bodies and forces that govern our Universe. It was initially a mostly philosophical question, but during the course I also developed practical skills to mathematically understand these forces.",
    "I developed my fundamental understanding of astronomy as a science. I also feel as if I have discovered a new found interest in astronomy."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This was a solid course that gave students a strong introduction to astronomy. The main strengths of the course were its organization and the excellent lectures by Professor Kenney. Kenney is an awesome instructor, his explanations are clear, demonstrations illustrative, and sense of humor ever-present. The course was very well-organized. No major weaknesses. Only complaint is that the number of grade components could get tiresome; psets, reading quizzes, reading, attendance, observation, etc was too much at times.",
    "Strengths: The professor is extremely engaging, the textbook is easy to understand, and the material is provided for students with the goal for the students to learn! Prof Kenney is hilarious and he's also an amazing teacher. Weaknesses: Very few, except that a lot of the math is taught in the sections, and if you miss a section you may have no idea how to solve the PSETS. The math is easy for those to who math comes naturally. If you're not bad at math but it's not your major\/strength, you will still have to attend section.",
    "The lectures revolve almost entirely around the qualitative aspects of the course, and the P-sets are essentially all math that was very difficult to grasp.",
    "This course is interesting, Professor Kenney is really great and I really enjoyed his style of teaching. While material is not always the most engaging, it definitely sparks interest. Problem sets were always either very easy or unreasonably difficult, and the midterm exam was incredibly difficult because it was really hard to know what to study with such a mass of material.",
    "Strengths: lectures were made interesting and fun by prof. Kenney. I liked the conceptual theories. I think it would be improved by taking some material out. It was basically impossible to memorize all of the concepts for the midterms and final considering we are also taken other courses in a semester. I wish I had been able to internalize more concepts and I think if the material was paired down this would help.",
    "Lots of info and content, but a lot of the time we were asked questions about things we never learned or went over. I had to go to the section in order to learn how to do the homework.",
    "Strengths: brilliant material. Weaknesses: slow pace.",
    "This course is, most likely, easier than most other science classes, but it is by no means a \"gut.\" The problem sets are challenging and, conceptually, the information presented in class can be a lot to grasp. This class is weak in the fact that much of the conceptually difficult material discussed in class (Theory of relativity, radiation, etc.) was not relevant to the problem sets, midterm, or final. I wish the professor had focused more on the information we actually needed to know.",
    "The strength of this course is that it is taught and explained very well. Students that come into the course with very limited understandings of the material should have very little struggle if they take advantage of the resources that are given.",
    "I enjoyed the highly structured and predictable assignments. For any given week, I knew how much time I would need to invest in readings, problem sets, etc. In the beginning, I did take significantly more time to complete problem sets (hours and hours), partly because I wasn't used to them. I could have benefitted from spending more time on physics review. Section ended up being helpful, the practice problems we did mirrored the problem sets. I would recommend going to section, although it wasn't as interesting or engaging as the class itself. You have to be self-motivated to pay attention and understand what you need for the problem sets.",
    "Pretty great class, the reading quizzes were really annoying and didn't feel particularly helpful.",
    "Very interesting lectures.",
    "This course is strong because it is welcoming to new comers who have no experience with astronomy in the classroom. The lectures are interesting and interactive, which always help with engaging students. This course, however, was very difficult to keep up with unless I went to every section. I felt that the lectures did not teach me how to do the psets which are a large part of the course, but moreso taught me overarching information and facts that I would need for exams.",
    "The primary strength of the course was professor Kenny's ability to convey very difficult concepts easily. A weakness of the class was there was a problem with the clickers during one class.",
    "I think it's a really fun course, especially if you're interested in space. The TAs were really helpful with the problem sets and the professor was funny and engaging. Some things felt like they were announced rather last-minute (like the observing sessions), but that's not really the fault of the faculty (good observing weather is hit or miss).",
    "The strengths of this course are its focus on introductory astronomy concepts and quantitative reasoning. A weakness is that the Big Bang theory segment of the course is rushed.",
    "It's a very good course - the lectures were engaging and the problem sets were manageable.",
    "Overall I found the course very interesting and engaging, particularly through the use of diverse teaching methods such as clicker questions and reading quizzes assigned for homework. I can think of no significant weaknesses.",
    "The reading and assignments were generally well reflected by what we learned in class. However, there were often assigned sections of reading that were never reviewed in class."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Many students will complain that it is not a gut and surprisingly hard. I disagree. The course definitely is not a gut but is not particularly hard. If you are comfortable with mid-level algebra world problems and have some AP science experience, you should have absolutely no problem with the math in the course. The concepts at the end of the course are more difficult than the math. However, sections basically teach you how to do the psets and so should not cause any trouble.",
    "I would, if you're looking for a QR credit that also has qualitative aspects that will really make you think. If you liked space as a kid, here's your chance to really work out the math and theories behind it all.",
    "This course is good. Problem sets can range from super-easy to weirdly difficult, and exams are rather hard. The material covered is interesting on the whole but it's easy to kind of zone out in a 75 minute class. Professor Kenney is funny and engaging. Take it as a 5th class if you don't mind the time it takes to do p-sets.",
    "I would recommend this class! It's a great QR or Sc credit for a non-science major, but it's not a gut--you do genuinely have to think and work to understand the material. Kenney is an engaging, funny lecturer with excellent physical demonstrations, and he very much actually listens to and cares for his 70-odd students.",
    "Yes, I took it for a science credit and it was a lot of work but I learned a good amount so I'd say it was worth it.",
    "If you have any interest in learning about the Universe, this class is really interesting. That said, be prepared to do a lot of math. Though it is not too difficult (a lot of unit conversion), many of the homeworks are more math-based than they are conceptual.",
    "This class is for non-science majors so the workload seemed to me to be less than what a QR\/SC is thought to be. However, take this class if you have some interest in astro; it won't be worth the credit if you're sitting there dreading every second of it.",
    "Great science or QR credit for those looking for it. The material is interesting but not hard; the math is pretty basic and the pace is noticeably slowed for non-STEM people. Professor Kenney is a funny, engaging lecturer.",
    "I would recommend it for people who want a QR or Sc credit but don't just want to take a gut. This is not a gut! This course requires hours put in to memorize material and work through psets. The math is not hard and the psets aren't even that hard but you do need to really pay attention in lecture and read the textbook etc. to be able to do them. That said, what you end up learning by the end is amazing! Knowing how the universe works on huge scales is really really cool and I find myself thinking about it often. Prof. Kenney is funny and great.",
    "The topic of the class is very interesting, and if they like math, then definitely.",
    "Certainly - it's a very good balance of fascinating material and reasonable workload.",
    "Absolutely! This class is great fun, and if you're sufficiently comfortable with numerical physics, it's a very good class to have on your schedule if the other ones are super hard. Being regular matters in this class, because there's a short reading quiz twice a week.",
    "If you are genuinely interested in many areas of astro, do take this class, but if you only want to learn about one or two specific things, I would suggest you do that on your own.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have a pre-existing, particular interest in the subject. It is not a \"gut,\" but also not engaging enough to facilitate interest in Astronomy as a major. Additionally, concepts are very hard to grasp and class is long and often filled with irrelevant information. In my opinion, another student would be better off in a QR course that they are already familiar with.",
    "WOULD RECOMMEND. The universe is a wild place and it's fascinating to learn about it.",
    "Yes! I took this course because I thought astronomy seemed cool and I needed a QR credit-- so I expected to be disappointed by the actual reality of astronomy. But I wasn't, and I've already recommended this class to anyone in the same boat as me. It was my favorite class this semester.",
    "It's not what I would call a thrilling class, but it's a really good QR credit. I'd recommend this, but take it with a friend so you can help each other out, sometimes the class will get difficult. You will manage, but make sure you ask for help, the professor and the TA's are all helpful!",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Yes, definitely. It is a subject that wasn't discussed\/explored to any degree at my high school and in my opinion is definitely worth studying.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in astronomy and is good or well versed in math and\/or physics. I would not recommend it to someone like myself who is not that experienced with physics because many of the psets and exams will be difficult and time consuming for someone like that, as they were for me.",
    "Not a gut",
    "Absolutely as it was very interesting and well taught",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because I think there are many misconceptions of astronomy that this course clears up.",
    "I would recommend this course to either a student interested in learning more about space or a student who isn't too good at math and needs a QR credit.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone with a mild interest in astronomy. This class gives you a great introduction to explorations of the origins of the universe and the evolution of stars.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. It's definitely not a gut and you do learn a lot by taking it.",
    "ASTR 120 is a fascinating and detailed introduction to astronomy. If you put in consistent work you'll be fine. Take it with Professor Kenney, he is humorous, engaging, and his passion for the subject flows through! His lectures are also very clear - I felt that I came away from every lecture dazzled by the field, feeling that I've learned learned something new.",
    "If you are a student that enjoys thinking beyond the realms of the world you perceive in every day life, and want to learn more about very large forces, definitely take this course.",
    "DO NOT take this class if you are taking DS and just want to get your QR. I was lucky enough to find people to work with, and made my way through it fine, but it was kind of taxing, and theres a lot more math\/conceptual stuff than I was prepared for. Especially when it came time for exams, I was crunched. If you have experience with good math and physics, than I think this class is fine. It was NOT fine for me.",
    "Great astronomy introduction course. Was suitably challenging."
