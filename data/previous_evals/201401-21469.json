    "You have to take it, so try to be positive about it no matter what.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. Aside from the fact that it is mandatory for all EVST majors, it is very helpful and informative. It helps keep you on track and helps you work at a steady pace for your senior thesis. It is also very helpful in the sense that you receive feedback and ideas from both your peers and professors. It was also very enjoyable to hear about others' projects.",
    "EVST projects are so different from one another that it's sometimes hard to sit through hours and hours of discussion that are not relevant to your own project, but at the end of it, I really enjoyed learning about the cool projects our peers are working on. Furthermore, it was really frustrating to get unfairly harsh comments from people who were not familiar with your field. I would have REALLY appreciated more unstructured time at the beginning of the semester to get cracking on the writing and idea formulation.",
    "waste of time",
    "It's tons of work, but it's worth it.",
    "Colloquium is necessary for EVST seniors. So overall, I think it was great for keeping people accountable and on track, but sometimes felt unnecessary and frustrating.",
    "Something you have to take. But it helps your thesis out.",
    "Very helpful in writing a paper at times, at times can feel unproductive. Helpful checkpoints for the big thesis project.",
    "Colloquium was a wonderful tool throughout the senior thesis process. The multiple professors and weekly meetings helped students stay on task.",
    "I would more than recommend EVST 496 to another students. I think more people should major in EVST to take advantage of EVST 496. I found it to be the most defining element of both the major and my academic career at Yale. In 496 I learned more about writing, critical thinking, and myself than I had in the previous three years at Yale."
