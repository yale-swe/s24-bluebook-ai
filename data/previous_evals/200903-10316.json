   "comments": [
    "It is a background course of the basic reaction mechanisms of organometallic chemistry, with applications thrown in too.",
    "I would recommend it. It was a concise course with lots of useful information.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student. You will learn the basic mechanisms for organometallic chemistry, which will become a toolbox for you to use in your other classes and research. In short, you get out of the class what you put into it, and there is not pressure from the professor to put an insane amount of effort into the class.",
    "An introduction to mechanisms in organometallic chemistry, and their main applications.This course would be necessary for any student conducting organic or inorganic chemistry, and is useful in understanding the literature in both these areas. Also helps in passing cumes :).",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for sure.An organic chemist, or a chemist in general, is not really a chemist without a slight knowledge of organometallic chemistry. With a great and patient teacher, this course is a must-take course.",
    "An in depth overview of the field of organometallic chemistry, starting with the concepts of organometallic reactions and finishing with common and real-world applications. It is an interesting course and I would recommend it to almost any student.",
    "Highly recommended, seems like a good comprehensive course on organometallic chemistry",
    "Absolutely recommend the class for all of the reasons stated above.",
    "With the ever increasing amount of crossover between organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry, the information in this course will be useful to all students."

   "comments": [
    "The kinetics of the course will be extremely helpfully, because although it was taught at a basic level, I feel my understanding has been somewhat poor up to now.",
    "Taught me everything I know about a different field of chemistry.",
    "It is an area slightly outside my research area, but very applicable to certain aspects of my research. Very glad I took it. Thanks!",
    "The course helped me think about organometallic processes in a much clearer way. It also helped me evaluate how to optimize reactions within my own research. I feel much more comfortable discussing organometallic chemistry now than I did before the course.",
    "Already answered. But here again. I enjoyed this course. I am quite confident to talk about organomet. and have the knowledge of the cross-coupling.",
    "I am not focused in this area so it most likely did not advance my dissertation research or knowledge of MY discipline but it did deepen my knowledge of another discipline in my overall field.",
    "After taking this course, I definitely feel I understand organometallics, a topic I was intimidated by before.",
    "This class has introduced me to a field of chemistry that was largely unknown tome. The information will be especially useful in devising projects for post-doctoral research."
