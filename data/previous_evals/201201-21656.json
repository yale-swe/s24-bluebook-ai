   "comments": [
    "It's a somewhat meandering and directionless introduction to philosophy of law. Take it if you're prepared to give the class some structure yourself; otherwise, you'll just flounder around all semester with half-finished thoughts about the Hart-Dworkin debate floating around your head. Yeah, it's a commitment -- but it could totally be worth it!",
    "Would absolutely recommend. This is a class in jurisprudence and seeks to answer the question \"what is law\" versus \"what is the law\". If you are interested in the more philosophical side, this class will be enjoyable. Shapiro is hilarious and is great at explaining the material. Was not expecting much out of this class but it ended up far and away being my favorite.",
    "Great class. Do the readings, which are pretty interesting, and you'll be fine. It really gave me a greater insight into legal matters as a whole.",
    "It's a lovely class in which you have the opportunity to explore meta-questions about the fundamental principles of law without too much work, and Prof. Shapiro is quite entertaining and easy-going.",
    "This class is really great if you are interested in both philosophy and law. I had taken philosophy classes before, even though I did not think I was that interested into it, but after this class it turns out I am. Law merely represents the topic of the philosophical discussions analyzed in this class and we read really few legal cases (maybe 3 or 4). Plus, Shapiro is a great professor and reading his book while attending lecture was a really great way to understand the concepts better. While I took this class I was also taking The Law and Politics of Globalization taught by Prof. Stone Sweet - if you are interested in law you should think about taking them at the same time.",
    "It's an interesting class with some neat concepts, but does get bogged down in minute details of abstract theories at points. With some more organization and a few additional viewpoints, it could be a real home run. I'd take the gamble if you think this is something that would interest you (and if you are sure it will, definitely take it-Shapiro is a leader in the field and is fantastic).",
    "Take it but DO THE READING. It's too interesting to BS your way through and then, when cramming for the final, realize that you're unprepared and missed out on gold.",
    "Definitely a good introduction to the field. Taught in a pretty easy-to-follow way, if only because it follows the trajectory of Shapiro's book, which, to be honest, is a great introduction in itself. You'll certainly be getting Shapiro's take on things, but not in a limiting way. If anything, it just makes the class more interesting. Highly recommended.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. The material will be interesting to most philosophy majors. It's philosophy in one of its most applicable forms and it's great to be able to learn from Prof Shapiro who is the author of the central work read in this class.",
    "I found this course frustrating. It's not quite philosophical enough for the philosophy students and far more geared toward law or pre-law students who want to analyze their subject in more philosophical rigor. The first half of the course is built around three conceptual analyses of law (Austin, Hart, and Shapiro's own theory) and favors the philosophers, while the second half deals with legal interpretation and legal practice (Dworkin) and favors the lawyers. A real philosophical analysis of law would have to have included authors like Aquinas and Grotius rather than contemporary legal theorists. The course is better suited for people who have strong opinions about legal practice and want to examine their views rather than philosophically-minded folks who want to explore the law as a conceptual question. The workload is not terribly hard, however, but the readings (esp. Dworkin) can be laborious.",
    "It's a very good class, especially if you're a philosophy major and want to see the tools used in philosophy (e.g. conceptual analysis) applied to an important topic. The focus of the class is to understand what law as a concept is, and this question has implications for how judges should interpret the law. I was very impressed with the systematic and careful way in which the material is laid out. Prof. Shapiro is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and he's funny and liberal. There was a midterm paper (15 pages) and an in-class final. Both were very fair, and very enjoyable. The course seems to revolve around Prof. Shapiro's own theory (which his book spells out), which was a tiny bit annoying at times, but I did not feel as if I didn't get a fair treatment of the entire field. The readings are very interesting and relatively manageable (and you don't have to do all of them if you don't have time -- just read his book). Take it!",
    "I'd recommend it. If you're looking for a particularly exciting course this isn't it, but it does provide a basic overview of concepts in legal philosophy",
    "Look at Austin, Hart, Shapiro, Dworkin and Scalia. How their theories of law differed from one another and how improvements were made. Very sequential, which was nice because it was easy to follow. Interesting class. I would take it again, especially since Shapiro was such a hoot."
