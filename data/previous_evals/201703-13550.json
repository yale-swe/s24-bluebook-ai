    "I learned statistics modeling",
    "From this class I learned how to code to a more advanced level using R studio, and also how to model data in a way that makes sense for the specifics of a given data set, and that doesn't invalidate assumptions. I also learned about making clear, legible graphics, and when to use different types of regression for different data sets. Finally, I became familiar with model selection and the meaning of different statistical measures.",
    "learned many new skills including development of biomass models for tree species that will enable estimating carbon stock of trees.",
    "I learned how to do basic regression modeling.",
    "This course helped develop my knowledge of regression modelling in the context of ecological research, which was very helpful for my master's thesis. It also honed my skills in R statistical software, which I had only used for basic data analysis during undergraduate studies."

   "question_id": "FS1003",
   "question_text": "How well did the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class align with your expectations?",
   "comments": [
    "it was good",
    "The insight from this class aligned quite well with my expectations, however I was hoping to be able to use data that I had collected in the class, and this turned out to not be possible. I think I would have learned more from the class had I been able to use my own data rather than numbers and datasets that were very impersonal. However, I do understand the point of using different datasets that have different nuances allowing students to incorporate specific class material to different scenarios presented in the data.",
    "All the deliverables of the course were more than my expectation.",
    "By the end of the course, I felt fairly comfortable with linear regression modeling and some of the ins and outs of that. I can run nonlinear models but have yet to see one that's better than the linear one with transformed variables (probably because I haven't delved as deeply into this). And I do not feel very comfortable with the logistic and other types of regressions--even though we technically covered them in the course. I also learned R in the course of taking this class--which has proved to be one of the more useful outcomes.",
    "I expected to have more knowledge at the end of this course than what I ended up with, but that was largely due to not putting enough time into the course outside of class."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "strength: Tim was helpful weakness: class is really really really boring and hard to keep myself engaged during the entire time.",
    "There could be more in-classroom engagement of students, especially since it is a smaller class.",
    "I think one strength of this course is the clear presentation of the material through power point slides and the professor's obvious knowledge and familiarity with the material. Things are presented in a straight-forward way, and the use of many examples, including problem sets that further solidify lecture material, is very helpful in understanding the material. Personally, I felt that the material was presented in an impersonal manner, which involved mostly reading directly off the power point slides. This made it difficult at times for me to keep paying attention, and I would have appreciated a little more interaction with the class, or a more dynamic approach to the teaching style, which would have kept me more engaged. I did think having the power-point lecture slides available was helpful because it allowed me to annotate them and review them as needed.",
    "A big strength is that Gregoire is fairly approachable and is kind, although sometimes unduly harsh in written feedback. He seems to genuinely care about his students and tries to simplify\/clarify some of the more complicated concepts. However, the lectures require a good deal of concentration to keep up, and he seems to expect students to also spend time running the sample code he passes along. One weakness I found was that I had to use data the professor provided for the 7 homework assignments themselves, and only got to use my own data for the last assignment; as a result, I didn't develop as much familiarity with my data from the perspective of the class as I would have liked. One consequence: my final project was rushed and I didn't feel as good about it as I would have liked. A second: I didn't get to try many of the techniques beyond linear and nonlinear--which I would like to have become more adept at. I think the course could be improved by having students submit a cleaned dataset, with description, at the beginning of the course, and then map out a series of models that they can learn to run with that data over the course of the semester. By the end, a lot of the basic R work and data exploration should have been done--and the students would have the chance to do any touch-up, revision, and packaging to create a better final product.",
    "The strengths of the course are (1) it gives you practice with R statistical software, and (2) it covers the basics of linear regression modelling. The weaknesses of the course are (1) the lectures are not very helpful for understanding basic concepts, (2) there isn't an activity or lab portion of the class in which students can work together on homework assignments, and (3) it is probably too challenging for first-year students without previous regression modelling experience. This course could be hugely improved if time were given in class to work together on homework assignments!"

   "comments": [
    "Good regression course",
    "I would advise a student to come to the class and pay attention as much as possible even though lectures can be a little bit dry or complicated. I think taking advantage of the online resources provided (R scripts), and reviewing the notes before doing problem sets is very helpful and saves a lot of time trying to re-invent the wheel. Also Tim is very nice and more than willing to answer questions and meet one-on-one and help out!",
    "Make sure you try each technique on your own, perhaps running his code--and then adjusting with some other dataset to make sure you know what each line is doing--before leaving a topic. Otherwise the class will quickly slip away from you. Don't rely on the 6-7 homeworks alone to teach you all the techniques you might want to learn.",
    "Don't take this class along with two or more additional classes that require a significant time commitment every week! I took this class with two other classes that involved a lot of reading and writing, plus my master's thesis work. That was way too much to handle in my first semester at F&ES, so please don't repeat my mistake!"
