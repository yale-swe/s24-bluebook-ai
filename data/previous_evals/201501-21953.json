   "comments": [
    "This is generally a very good class. Professor Komorowski is very interesting, picks great readings and leads engaging discussions. I learned A LOT during this class that I wasn't expecting to learn during an English class. Two out of four of the papers are entirely based on your own interests... the professor gives you a lot of room with the prompts so you can really explore something you are interested in. Because of that, this class can really be enjoyable to anyone who might find some interest in any topic involving government, economics, development, globalization, health etc. I do wish the class focused a bit more on writing strategies as I took this class almost strictly to improve on my writing before moving on to seminars with term papers. We did talk about writing and I found that mine did improve, but I wish it focused a bit more on writing strategies independent of revisions to our essays. Still, a good course, particularly with this professor and this topic.",
    "Would recommend to those who already have a lot of econ and political science knowledge because the readings and papers require a high level of familiarity with the topics.",
    "If you are looking for a writing credit or a great English class, look no further. This class, while demanding, teaches you how to write. The professor is great. He is very approachable and always provides helpful advice. His feedback on papers is always constructive and extensive and you will never feel like you were given an unjust grade. The readings are also interesting and relevant, especially toward the end of the semester when you start reading current news articles. Take this class, you won't regret it!",
    "This was a really formative experience. This class goes over parts of essays, from topic sentences to transitions. It gets into the structure of arguments and ways to develop ideas throughout an essay. The readings were rarely dull and cover different authors, regions, and ideas. The grading isn't light, however, but having the drafts gives students time to improve and he is always available to help them with assignments. I think every student should take a class like this because it will pay off when their writing becomes clearer and more focused.",
    "This course is made up of a fair amount of readings and 5 essays. Professor Komorrowski is clear, engaging, makes writing well easy to understand and gives great feedback. Certainly anyone with an interest in macroeconomics would enjoy this class, but no background is required in the slightest. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone looking for a solid introductory English course, especially if they are curious about world economic policy and the recent financial crisis."
