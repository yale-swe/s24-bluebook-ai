    "I would strongly recommend CHNS 120 to other students - if you have a chance to learn Chinese, you should do it at Yale. The class brings together a whole set of speaking writing exercises that encourage you to be using Chinese daily and quizzes to make sure you are constantly improving.",
    "I would recommend the class to another student, but only if they are very interested in learning Chinese. It is a very demanding class and it is very easy to fall behind.",
    "I would recommend CHNS 120 to another student. It is a continuation and progression of CHNS 110. The workload is comparable to that of CHNS 110 with an additional Chinese oral presentation at the end of the year (crafting your own monologue of ~500 words, memorizing it and then reciting it in class). Instead of memorizing dialogues for oral presentations, students memorize narratives. The dialogues are longer and the number of vocabulary words is greater. Nevertheless, taking this class is a logical next step after taking CHNS 110 and was overall a great language class with good structure and teaching. Shen Laoshi, Wang Laoshi, and Chen Laoshi still teach CHNS 120 and they are awesome!"
