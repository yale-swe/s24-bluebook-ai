    "I gained a stronger familiarity with the mathematics relating to fluids. The course helped me to better understand the ways in which assumptions are made in modelling physical systems and how these assumptions allow us to draw meaningful conclusions about the physical phenomena taking place around us. The course bolstered my ability to solve problems involving multivariable calculus and differential equations.",
    "I think this was a good overview of the complicated and extensive material involved in fluid dynamics, and I feel like I learned about (or at least was exposed to - sometimes the material was too difficult to really learn well!) a number of different topics and phenomenon in GFDs. I feel generally prepared to pursue GFDs further; if I'm not as prepared as I could be from this class, it's just because it was difficult to synthesize and understand so much and such complicated material."

    "I feel it is a weakness of this course that it's all derivations; I think we should have spent time discussing the topics (every one of them) subjectively and had more real-world examples. There were experiments occasionally though, which were good. It was also a weakness that there wasn't a TA? There has always been at least one TA in all of my classes that were as difficult as GFDs, and I think one would have been extremely helpful, since regular office hours would have been helpful for reviewing class material and for saving hours of time on the homeworks. Maybe we didn't have a TA because the class was small? Still, given the difficulty of the material (and Prof. Timmermans' busy schedule) I feel it was unfair for us not to have that extra help and time of a TA. A major strength of this course was Professor Timmermans herself - she was very nice and very patient! She could be busy, but I felt like she cared about the students and the course despite being so busy with everything else. This means a lot! The experiments were also a strength of the course."

    "If you're not comfortable (or I'd even say strong) in vector calculus (and some diffeqs, but less so), this will be a challenging class, just for the sake of its pace. I found it very easy to quickly become confused by getting hung up on some step that was done or some concept that was used that I wasn't familiar with, and then I would totally lose my context and just get more and more confused as class progressed. And progress class did - like I said this class rarely slows down but rather just plows through concept\/derivation after concept\/derivation, spending little to no time with each to internalize each. Professor Timmermans of course would be happy to slow down (she's a very patient and kind teacher), but its hard to ask the whole class to slow down when you feel like you're the only one that needs it. So be prepared in vector calculus before taking this class, unless you can handle this daily frustration and have the time to review your notes every day! It's a shame\/a major problem with this class is that it never slows down or spends anytime with the concepts we learn. We go through a derivation, and she assumes you got it\/followed it AND understand the concepts behind it. This can be very overwhelming as material builds up and you only have a weak understanding of it or (especially) preceding relevant concepts and equations, and you then move on to the next topic very quickly. OTHER THINGS TO KNOW: **Probably spend 8-12+ hours on homeworks each week. **One midterm and one final, very difficult. **The challenge of this class is in the math, the quantity of material, and in the complicated nature of the material. There is also very little time (actually none) spent reviewing material or even spent discussing or reviewing a derivation, so you will spend a lot of time outside of class just trying to get things straight and\/or to figure out the homework. **No TA. **5 p-sets, usually 1-2 weeks in between."
