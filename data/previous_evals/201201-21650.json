   "comments": [
    "Yes I would. You will get a lot of individual attention to your acting, and will definitely improve and learn about yourself both as a performer and a person. While a great deal of time will be spent watching other people's scenes, it is possible to learn from that time as well, by observing what they do and listening to the critiques the professor gives them.",
    "A great way to get into the knitty-gritty of scene work, character development, and physical exploration",
    "Take this class with Daniel Larlham. He is the best person ever.",
    "I enjoyed the course. I learned a great deal about the body and how bodies interact in space from Daniel's exercises.The scene study was good practice but was poorly executed. Everyone zoned out when other groups were being directed and didn't get much out of watching the other performers. If we had cut down these in-class workings we would have been able to tackle much more information and technique.I also didn't receive any large \"epiphanies\" of acting from this class, while I did in 210. I wish the class had challenged me more.",
    "We worked of physical exercises at the beginning of each class which were liberating and great. We worked on two scenes each. Digging deep in the meaning of each word and embodying the character in every regard. It was great.",
    "Yes, take it if you want to polish the tools in your actor-toolbox, if that makes any sense. TAKE IT anyway if it doesn't.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone with an interest in acting or theater; it's a really valuable opportunity to grow as an artist and a human being."
