    "My only real comment on how the course could be improved is a bit more explanation, from the beginning, of how the Critique itself is structured and what the arc of Kant's arguments is supposed to be. I appreciate that Professor Franks took us through the text, out of order, in a way that was meant to make the ideas as clear as possible to us--but the jumping around left me a bit confused as to how the structure of the arguments are supposed to work in Kant's mind. Other than that, I really loved the small lecture format. The papers were challenging but Professor Franks really made himself available to help us through. I learned a lot and I'm very glad I took the course."

   "comments": [
    "This is the hardest class I've taken at Yale. The material is just intrinsically really hard. While Franks is clearly a total expert, he's not particularly good at imagining what it's like to hear this material for the first time. He doesn't do a whole lot in the way of repeating himself, setting up the lecture in context, reminding us what terms mean etc. He also doesn't seem that interested in helping to teach philosophy writing skills. So I'd say if you're up for a real challenge and already have a good amount of experience with modern philosophy, go for it. Otherwise, tread carefully.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who knows they're interested in a deep-dive into Kant. The text is difficult and it took a lot of independent work\/thinking for me to understand how it all fit together. But for anyone interested in putting in the time and effort, you will certainly get a lot out of it. Plus, I think having a basic understanding of Kant is essential for anyone interested in upper-level philosophy work (even if your primary areas of interest are completely unrelated)."
