    "In this course, I was exposed to a very technical type of philosophical literature of India written in the Sanskrit language. Here, I've learned how to read a complex Sanskrit text within this particular \"shastric\" tradition in which a classical text is commented upon and debated against an opposing interlocutor who objects to its interpretation. I've learned how to unpack the meaning of the debate, to see clearly the implicit rules that govern such a dialogue, and to understand the process of argumentation within it. Even though I've struggled with the advance Sanskrit language, I did enjoy very much the philosophy and the rationality displayed in the text.",
    "reading Sanskrit philosophical comment; typical grammar points, vocabulary; Jain and Sankhya thoughts; scholastic debates.",
    "Learning to read Sanskrit philosophical texts, especially the grammar structure and argument style",
    "I learned how to read Sanskrit texts and different Indian philosophical schools."

   "comments": [
    "The strengths are all related to the unique way of dealing with a Sanskrit text that Prof. Granoff facilitates. Her mastery of Indian languages is so incredible and deep that, during every reading, one feels fully immersed not only in the text itself but also in the culture and world-view that produced it. Perhaps, the weight and the emphasis placed on the philological aspect and the very reading of the text is so great that one may interpret this as a weakness, and even miss a little bit more of a contextual introduction to what surrounds the text.",
    "strengths: excellent teacher,",
    "Prof. Granoff's knowledge of Sanskrit is world-class. Her expertise inspired me to work harder",
    "I think the language challenge is great. I hope there are more time for me to digest the course."

    "Yes, but only if they are ready to read advance Sanskrit.",
    "Yes, if you want to gain a flavor of Indian scholastic traditions, you should read in Sanskrit. And also the professor is perhaps one of the few persons who can speak Sanskrit so fluently.",
    "This is an advanced Sanskrit reading course, so one much come with the necessary training in order to read these more difficult texts in Sanskrit. As long as one has the necessary background, I recommend it highly",
    "Yes, I think if the student is interested in Sanskrit language, I will recommend this course to him\/her. I think it is a great way to hone Sanskrit language skill."
