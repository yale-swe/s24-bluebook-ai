   "comments": [
    "Easy material but food information.",
    "Weaknesses - can be made more structured and the material for the class can be made to include more things.",
    "I am not an environmental health major, therefore I am very glad that this course provide some very basic tools and topics in the area. I found it was quite helpful and interesting. It would be great if we could have discussed the latest news in environmental health more at the beginning of each class.",
    "This class was the biggest disappointment to date. It is a joke. I cannot believe I am paying to take a class that teaches me how to recycle, conserve energy, and wear sunscreen. There are many CONTEMPORARY ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES - the only great part about the class was interesting readings on these issues. The class did extremely well on the midterm, so she plans to make the final difficult to distribute grades evenly. This is totally ridiculous, everyone deserves an honors for having to suffer through the course.",
    "Very interesting and useful info, especially for me (an EHS student), but the workload and tests were like what I would expect for a high-school level course.",
    "The lectures for the course examined a wide range of issues, but I failed to gain a comprehensive and overarching knowledge of environmental health. I would have benefited from broader, and more applicable lectures.Additionally, I gained little from the discussion sections.",
    "This course was disappointing. At this stage in the game, I feel incredibly lucky to be at Yale. But I also feel like I'm paying a great deal of money to be here, and it's disappointing to spend that much money on a (core) course that is taught at the middle school level.Weaknesses: I'm not sure what we were supposed to learn, but I think there is potential for this course to provide an opportunity for students with little experience in environmental health to synthesize current events, trends, etc. with theories, and this course failed to even come close to synthesis. I'm not sure if this is a curriculum issue or an instruction issue, but something must be changed, and last year's solution of making the test easier does not speak to the quality of the course.Assignments for this class included two exams, a powerpoint presentation, a poster, a movie review and several busy-work type homework assignments. Not one of these were challenging, not one made me feel like a graduate student, much less one at Yale.I wonder if a great deal of the issues that are associated with this class might be eradicated if it were transitioned to a discussion-based format rather than a lecture class. Of course, this may cost more money to run additional sections, but I'm pretty sure Yale students are justified in expecting better than this.",
    "The course is more like an introduction of the overall structure in Environmental Health.",
    "The course is relevant to those working toward the public health degree. The material is timely and important. However, I would suggest that the lecture media be better organized. With that said, I believe I learned so much about environmental health and its relevance in public health.",
    "The topics covered in the course were interesting, but they were covered on a very simplistic level for a graduate level course.",
    "I enjoyed the overview of environmental health. Professor Stowe was a great lecturer.",
    "Great overview of the environmental health issues of today. However, its tie-ins with public health are weak.",
    "This course was poorly structured. It was so broad in concept that we did not have time to learn much in depth. Further, the instructor was not as efficient and selective as she could have been to choose what to present and how, so we wasted a lot of time. It is an easy way to fulfill the EHS requirement for non-EHS people.It could be improved by focusing the lectures to be more pointed; get the key basic points out there, give a little background\/context for their relevance using real world examples, and summarize by placing this piece within the larger context of environmental health.Also, she could align the homework assignments better, instead of making them \"interesting\" for us, make them relevant. We calculated our carbon footprint for no apparent reason, we 'made a poster' with no real instructions and no sense of how we would be graded, we listed ways to recycle; things that I could've done as a 10-year-old.It would be helpful if we had some sense of how we were being graded. We had weekly assignments, that came to us 3-4 days before they were due with little instruction, and no sense of how much this would weigh into our overall grade and how it would be graded.",
    "Fun class that doesn't take itself too seriously. But the things in class are very elementary in nature.",
    "Interesting material. Good introductory course. Lecture slides could be more professional. I like that current issues are integrated into the material, but more could be used.",
    "This course provided a very basic understanding of various environmental health topics ranging from global warming to the nexus between infectious diseases and water.",
    "Strength: it provides students with a brief overview of many concepts in environmental health, allowing us to place many different types of environmental health research in some elementary knowledge of the subject matter. Weaknesses: the course was too easy. The slide sets were poorly organized and references were often not included if we wanted to read more about a topic. It was hard to avoid feeling as if this were an undergraduate level course. Very little of substance was required of the students (although the individual presentations were useful, and many of the assigned articles were relevant and useful).",
    "This is a good course to take if you are not a hardcore scientist. The class covers a wide range of topics regarding contemporary environmental issues: climate change, water\/air\/ground pollution, ozone holes, sustainability, occupational health, food safety. etc. You may heard most of the materials before, but you are still guaranteed to learn something new.",
    "I think this was a good survey course regarding environmental health.Not so much a critique but more of an augmentation, but I think it would have been fun to do some sort of group project regarding an environmental health issue.",
    "Covered many topics but none went in depth",
    "This course really helps understand what environmental health is. It also made me more environmental friendly because the course did a great job explaining the importance and impact of the environment on health.The only issue is that we were covering too many topics for one course.",
    "The course was only organized in terms of lectures. All other assignments were disorganized and done at the last minute. Even the midterm was not put together and it was unclear what and how in-depth the studying should be. Also, the grading is arbitrary despite doing well in the class with 25% getting honors, and so forth.At times the content is so dense but not as much is being tested on. There were also no main concepts to learn from the course. Also larger assingments such as presentation and media paper should be graded more (since more time was put into it) compared to daily readings and smaller assignments).",
    "While the instructor did a good job in lecture of covering the important and interesting aspects of environmental health, the assessments did not evaluate our understanding of the information, and there was no grading rubric, example, or clear description for any of the projects or homework assignments.",
    "Good survey course, can present more concentrated information for future.",
    "far too basic. I don't feel like I actually learned anything from this course and thus I felt like it was a waste of my time. I have higher expectations of graduate school courses; this felt like the kind of course I would have taken in middle school.",
    "useful",
    "-broad overview of environmental health-uses a lot of logic. total memorization not necessary.-since it's once a week, sometimes lectures get too long",
    "This course did not provide a great foundation in environmental health. While the readings went well with the lecture, there were many weaknesses of the class. The lectures were not very organized and the assignments and discussions lacked seriousness. I would recommend clearer lectures, more required reading assignments, and more papers.",
    "The course gives such a brief overview of so many different subjects that it fails to read as a graduate-level course. The assignments were extremely simple and the tests were not challenging.",
    "This course was extremely disappointing. I learned almost nothing. The course work was perhaps, barely, on the high school level, but often in lecture I felt as if I was in a middle school classroom. Also, some of the material covered concerned environmental issues only tangentially related to human health.",
    "I enjoyed the broad survey of topics; a good introduction for a novice. Topics were intuitive and the exams fair and well-designed. Of all the classes I've taken so far at YSPH, the Discussion session for this class was the best and had the most actual discussion.",
    "One strength was that the instructor was very aware that most students have no background in environmental health so the course was broad and basic. One weakness was that there were many homeworks that were assigned with not enough time to do them (like 3 days before they were due) and some of them were long. I would have liked to have a textbook or articles that covered the material because it was sometimes hard to study only with the bullet points from her power points. The assigned articles sometimes had no relation with class lecture."

    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Very nice.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith is nice and helpful and I learnt a lot from her lectures and the guest lecturer she invited. However, I think she can improve in her presentation skills by not reading everything on the slide, instead just explain necessary aspects.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0I cannot believe that this professor is at Yale. She has no idea how to teach the subject to graduate students. She fluctuates between expecting so little and expecting too much. Her Powerpoint Presentations cite wikipedia and fail to follow cohesive thoughts. Though she is extremely nice and a very sweet lady, this class was the worst two hours of my week.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe selected relevant and contemporary topics for the course. However, I think the students could have handled a heavier workload. Maybe a term paper to allow us to research in-depth a topic of particular interest to us?",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe provided a broad assessment of environment health, with little emphasis on comprehensive topics. Additionally, her lectures were hard to follow at times. Despite this, Dr. Stowe was my most approachable and supportive professor this semester.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Strengths definitely include passion, kindness, and dedication. Dr. Stowe is clearly very passionate about environmental health, but I think she had some difficulty relaying that passion into graduate-level coursework. In a school where many professors are concerned more with their research than with master's degree students, I find her to be refreshing. She is clearly incredibly dedicated both to her work and to her students. Lecturing is not her strong suit, nor, perhaps, is lesson planning - but I imagine leading a seminar-style class would be another story, in a way that her passion and pratical experience might enable her to lead and guide great discussions on a topic that affects or interests just about every one.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe is very helpful and kind-hearted.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0The instructor is clearly passionate about environmental health. The material was taught very well (e.g., real-life scenarios) and students positively responded to the instructor's desire discuss contemporary issues.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She is very nice and cares about her students, but I did not learn much of relevance from the course. I do not feel as though I gained much from the course, which is disappointing. The lectures seemed scattered and full of a lot of random, irrelevant information.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe really cared about her field, and wanted to have input from the class. The format of the class is fine.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith is a great person but her lectures can seem very long. She's easy to communicate with and knows her stuff.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She obviously cares about the information and is excited about it, but I was not convinced about her level of understanding of topics outside of her area of expertise (occupational health).She seemed to want to get people interested and excited, but went about doing that by trying to appease us or make us happy, instead of ensuring that we were grasping the concepts.The midterm was extremely easy with few content-based questions (as evidenced by the 90+average). She asked questions like, what was your favorite thing you've learned (5 points) or imagine you were creating a new community, what would you put in it? (15 points). Questions like these don't give enough of a framework to structure response in a way that is meaningful. They don't test you on knowledge you should have obtained during this course.Our last lecture was a presentation given by a guest lecturer, and he seemed shocked when we were unable to answer 'simple', 'basic' questions on the environment. And it is embarrassing to us as students to have come through the course and not feel any more equipped to discuss or understand this topic than when we started.Her actual slides were helpful and informative, but she rarely had enough time to go through them all. She could've have worked better to time the presentation to ensure that we got through it all. She would often spend a lot of time 'chit-chatting' about something in the first 5-10 slides, and then find herself flipping through the last 20 slides in the final 2 minutes. Which would leave us on our own to learn the information she glossed over.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Meredith was great. I really enjoyed what she knew and her understanding of the field.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Friendly, engaging, genuinely interested in the course material. Seems knowledgeable about many subjects, but would be more professional to have a greater depth of knowledge about the topics she lectures about.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe was a good professor- passionate and enthusiastic about her work. She was sensitive to students' needs and demonstrated so throughout the course. Initially, the course was primarily lecture based. But due to student feedback, she incorporated more discussion within the lecture period, so that we could have more intellectually stimulating conversations about the topics discussed.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe was very kind, generous, and clearly loved the subject matter. While she has excellent knowledge and experience in occupational health, I often felt that she was not able to offer a depth of knowledge of other topics in environmental health. The course was not only a cursory review, but often excluded key facts that are critical to a certain environmental health topic. She very rarely cited current research in her lectures, but instead used elementary textbook definitions and descriptions.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She is very knowledgeable about the materials, very approachable and friendly.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe was a great teacher with a clear understanding of the subject matter.I think teaching a survey course if difficult considering the breadth of subjects in environmental health but all and all thought she did a good job.Thank you Meredith!",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She is very nice and we can tell that she cares about the students and the course. She was open to feedbacks.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0The lecture slides felt disorganized and often taken from so many resources that it was hard to follow, especially when being asked basic questions about the environment and then going into great detail about an environmental disaster\/incident.It is unclear what grading is given to assignments since discussion\/assignments are 20% of the grade and 40% for both midterm and the final.The instructor often went on tangents during class that also made it difficult to keep on topic for the class.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Really knows her stuff.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0It did not feel like the instructor cared about making this course academically worthwhile. I was disappointed that we couldn't be given recommendations about how to study for the midterm or final because they had not been written yet and that there were no sample questions available. I also strongly disagree with the grading system... it should be objective, not based on ranking within the class. I was very disappointed to hear \"I wish I could give you all honors\" early on... if everyone has completely learned all of the material, everyone SHOULD be able to earn honors grades.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0very helpful",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0-she's nice-usually organized",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Dr. Stowe knows her material well. However, I think she drew material for her lectures from many sources that didn't go together very well. She could have organized the course better and expected more from the students.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0The professor strikes me as a very sweet woman, but her instruction was poor. The slide presentations cited Wikipedia and other inappropriate sources and contained embarrassing errors. The lectures these slides accompanied felt almost patronizing. The course really needs to be brought to a more sophisticated level in order to be worthy of being offered at a graduate school of public health.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0Prof. Stowe was very positive, earnest, and excited about the material. She was very likable and sincere and clearly wanted us to b successful and enjoy our introduction to EHS.",
    "Instructor: Meredith Stowe \u00a0She was a very accessible professor and genuinely interested in our opinions about her class. She did her own evaluation mid-semester and really took into account our comments\/criticisms. She seems really passionate about her work and her passion was contagious. One thing I did not like though was that she was present in many discussion sections so I think that this hindered the TAs leadership of discussion."

I'm afraid the fault may lay in the teaching ability of the professor, not the particular organization of the course. Another marked downside of the course was that the tests were easy but Professor Stowe announced that she intended to cap the percentage who could get a high pass, making it difficult to guarantee a high mark, no matter how hard you study. In sum: I would not recommend this course if it continues to be taught by Stowe.",
