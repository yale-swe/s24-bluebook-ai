   "comments": [
    "Take it, if you have any interest at all in creative writing. Prof. Woodard is a fantastically supportive teacher.",
    "TAKE IT! BEST CLASS AT YALE! My write improved exponentially!",
    "I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS COURSE. It has been one of my favorite courses at yale. You learn a lot and although it can be a lot of work it is fun work.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in exploring fiction writing. I think it would be particularly helpful to people who already either know they want to write fiction or who have ideas for stories that they want to work on -- because it's a workshop, it's helpful to start with ideas and then work on making them into really good pieces of writing. You don't spend very much time brainstorming ideas, you just write something and then jump right into editing it.",
    "Good way to get better at writing fiction.",
    "If you get the opportunity to take this class, DO IT! It is so rewarding for so many reasons. You grow so much as a writer and gain incredible insight into your own writing's mistakes and habits that you never noticed before. The other students in the seminar come from all sorts of writing backgrounds and say the most insightful things that get at the heart of your writing. This, combined with Professor Woodard's honest and knowledgeable critique, produces some incredibly professional writing you never knew you had tucked inside of you.",
    "A legendary Yale course that all your friends will wish they were in. Your imagination will do back-flips, the class discussions will be engaging, and you'll realize that the imaginary world of stories is cooler than real life. Coursework consists of writing a couple of short stories, critiquing other people's work, and a couple of set readings. It's really what you make of it, but you will love it nonetheless.",
    "Introduction to Writing Fiction is a workshop style class, so for the first workshop you write a story, for the second you write another story, and for the third workshop, you revise one of your stories. The schedule is rotating so you have about a workshop every 4 or 5 weeks. The comments from other students are very helpful, as are the comments from Professor Woodard. It's a great way to introduce yourself to writing, and it's not a half bad class if you already know some stuff. I would recommend it to anyone, especially the people who aren't already writers \/ English majors.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "It is a good chance to get some writing done. It forces you to spend time on writing and the peer review is actually quite helpful. If you are interested in writing and looking for an excuse to spend time doing it. This is the class for you.",
    "Lovely - take it if you get in!"
