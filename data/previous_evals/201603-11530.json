    "This class is very broad, and you'll walk away with very few concrete facts or new information.",
    "This class addresses the issues with development aid on both the donor side and recipient side. Looks at conflict of interest among ideological, economic, political and humanitarian goals in aid-giving. Mainly development aid, with main topics including history of aid, types of aid, larger scale aid issues (fragmentation, fungibility, accountability to recipients vs donors, community ownership of aid projects etc.) and concludes with an outlook on what we might expect from aid in the future.",
    "I developed a good, clear understanding of the \"aid industry\" and the fundamental flaws with which it operates.",
    "I learned much more about the development world and the pros and cons of development assistance. I believe I gained a crucial understanding of the dangers especially of aid projects.",
    "An amazing insight into the aid world - every question I had about the political implications of aid giving was answered",
    "This course gives you a good foundation on the basics of development assistance.",
    "I learned a lot more about the aid industry overall and how the whole system works. I was hoping for it to be a little more specific but that is exactly the point they taught us that the aid industry is pretty broad and disorganized.",
    "We were able to make up our own opinion based on extensive research on the future of aid.",
    "This was quite a good writing course even though it is not a WR credit",
    "More knowledge of the practical workings of the aid landscape."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is far too euro-centric in terms of the readings (authors and perspective), lacks information about what can aid recipients think or understand aid to be and generally needs to more carefully consider the politics of development assistance in recipient countries more.",
    "The strengths of the course are that the topic is highly unique but crucial to development aid literature, the professor was highly knowledgable and passionate about the work, and that the lecture setting was perfect. The weakness is the length of the lectures- they were too short for everything that the professor wanted to fit in. That being said, I don't think the course material was too much.",
    "I think it was a good course but not well organized and sometimes hard to follow although interesting.",
    "Strengths - the creative assignments as well as the depth of knowledge you gain",
    "It's a really great class for those who have little to no exposure to the field of development assistance, but it does not explore topics in depth enough for those who already have a background in the field.",
    "The professor and TA are extremely nice and want the students to succeed. The material is interesting but really requires an interest in the material.",
    "It was very interesting.",
    "Good overview but slightly repetitive. The first few weeks were engaging then it was easy to lose interest. Good reading selection",
    "I found it hard to understand what was expected of me for assignments, especially the final. It would be very helpful to be told what marking scheme the grader will be using BEFORE we write the assignment e.g. X points for grammar y points for each valid argument etc. (Not giving the answers just explaining the expectations)"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to another student. Section is helpful in solidifying ideas from readings. This class addresses the issues with development aid on both the donor side and recipient side. Looks at conflict of interest among ideological, economic, political and humanitarian goals in aid-giving. Mainly development aid, with main topics including history of aid, types of aid, larger scale aid issues (fragmentation, fungibility, accountability to recipients vs donors, community ownership of aid projects etc.) and concludes with an outlook on what we might expect from aid in the future. I feel like I understand the motivations and inner workings of international aid to a greater extent now.",
    "No I would not. While interesting if you want to work in the aid industry. I suspect that this class would give you a one-sided take on the nature of aid in the 21st century. And while the title suggests a focus on the political realities of aid, very little of that appears from the point of view of recipient states.",
    "I would recommend this to any student interested in going into nonprofit work. It was a good course for intellectual stimulation.",
    "Yes definitely!",
    "I would recommend this to a student who has had little to no exposure to development assistance previously. It's a good class to build a good foundation in this field.",
    "I would if you are interested in the material. The TA is very nice and lectures arent too hard to follow.",
    "Yes, for anyone thinking of getting into the development sector.",
    "Yes but as a freshman or sophomore",
    "Yes, the topic of this class is extremely interesting and there are few opportunities to cover it. Prof imon is very knowledgeable and Kassandra was a fantastic TA."
