    "This class is awesome! Sarah is the bomb...she is incredibly passionate about video and is a very helpful teacher. She also has a ton of really interesting, varied, and sometimes historic videos that she shows in class. You should definitely take this class. You get to make video and learn about the medium in general.",
    "Take it! This is one of the best classes I've ever taken at Yale, just make sure to put in a lot of work and learn from the countless mistakes you'll make if you are new to video. The access to equipment is great, and you'll find that you can always use Bass Library media services if the DMCA is short on a given day.",
    "Lots of work in a very specific way. It's not as if you'll be drowning in assignments, but you will be drowning in information, and the level of your projects will be determined by the amount of outside time you put in.",
    "TAKE IT! Why prevent yourself from a potentially very rewarding creative experience? You will at least come out of the class with a new appreciation for video art and an enhanced understanding of video as a medium through which to convey information and ideas",
    "The class is a basic introduction to making experimental video art, which means its pretty open to the students doing whatever sorts of videos you want to do. Assignments are technique based, and not theme based, so students can approach the projects through an incredible number of ways. Everyone's videos are super creative and super different, and it's great to see what people make. I would absolutely recommend the class to another student, especially if Sarah is teaching it. Sarah is warm and helpful, and gives you a great sense of the history of video art, what goes into making videos, etc.",
    "Digital video is an odd monster, but this is a good introduction to it. It's about half watching video art and half learning the programs\/making your own -- that can make it feel a little unstructured at times but I think it works. I'd recommend it if you have an interest in video art and want to learn about cameras \/ final cut. The work is very open ended and you often have work days during class. Also, Sarah is the best. I was sort of so-so about the material itself but Sarah is just so cool and fun that I would do it again.",
    "Definitely take it. Great intro class, you learn a lot.",
    "I'd definitely recommend it, speaking as someone who had never taken an art class at Yale. Video art is a weird medium with a lot of flexibility, and Sarah lets you do pretty much whatever you want (within reason) in terms of making your projects.",
    "yes, do it. You'll some great skills and do some really great work (hopefully).",
    "A goodsurvey of video art, contemporary and historical. Three open ended projects with a decent amount of technical instruction, so that you feel proficient in the basics of Final Cut Pro and using camera, audio and lighting equipment. Take it if video is an interest, or if you're an art major. It's a good introduction to understanding and making video as art."
