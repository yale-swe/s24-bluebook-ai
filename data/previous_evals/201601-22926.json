    "This is a great class for getting a basis of knowledge about these techniques.",
    "I would, with enthusiasm! Reasons above.",
    "This class is not easy, but it's really amazing, and if you have even a casual interest in neuroscience, I would highly recommend taking it.",
    "This class is a must-take for those aspiring to run their own research. It covers all the major data acquisition and analysis methods, through a lecture-lab format each class. There are lab reports due biweekly, which is manageable if you start early. The final project allows you to run your own study, pilot or otherwise, and it is a very rewarding experience.",
    "A great introduction to fMRI research methodologies, on both a practical and theoretical level."

   "comments": [
    "This course rounded out the knowledge I had acquired of these methods in a piecemeal way. It also helped me think about teaching these methods to others in the future.",
    "The course broadens and deepens my knowledge immeasurably. I've always shunned any materials in relation to neuroscience, so anything in this course opens a new door for me.",
    "This class was a wonderful way to tie together parts of anatomy and physiology that I've learned in other classes in away that was both organic and interesting. I had no experience with MRIs before this class, and now, I could very feasibly do a thesis on an fMRI project.",
    "This class prepared me to get started on my own research. Now I can not only fully understand the methods and analysis sections in publications, but also write them up and apply them to my own work. Excellent course on all grounds, and definitely a course worth taking."
