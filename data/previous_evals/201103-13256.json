   "comments": [
    "Covered some interesting topics and recent issues. The course did seem disorganized and without a clear focus",
    "strength: interesting and diverse topicsweakness: class is too lecture-based",
    "Strengths: small discussion (5 people), assignments topics are really interesting and timely.weakness: the lectures are a little jumpy. Change discussion class time freely",
    "Weaknesses: truly an intro course. I'm not even a policy student and this was WAY too basic. Gusmano taught us about SCHIP, Medicare, and Medicaid as if we had never heard of these systems. Snooze fest.",
    "Could be more structured, to include more lectures.",
    "This was not a great course and quite honestly, I learned very little in it and to be fair, I put little effort into it. Unfortunately, there seemed to be a vicious cycle of apathy between the professor and the students. The class started off poorly, the small group discussions were a waste of everyone's time, it seemed the professor was never around and only one of the TAs was knowledgeable (Leo) or at least useful. That led to people not engaging and not doing the reading which left the professor frustrated. The group paper topics\/selected articles were completely uninspiring further adding to the drudgery and trials of a group paper. While it was nice to have groups split up so people with policy knowledge could help people who weren't as informed, it meant the knowledgeable people had to carry the work load which was frustrating. People should be allowed to pick their own groups. Furthermore, there should be TA facilitated discussion instead of the Lord of the Flies type organization.",
    "An excellent intro to the issues in health policy facing our nation now and in the recent past.",
    "The course was disjointed and disorganized. The instructor was only present for about 50% of the class meetings, which rendered the course much less useful than it should have been. The \"group discussion\" format was unhelpful and did not lead to any good discussion because no one was facilitating the discussion. As a result, the course was weak both in content and instruction. Since the course is required, it could be improved greatly.",
    "Lot of readingslots of assignments; too many papers, individual, group..Even with all that cant say that i know about politics...",
    "it's good, especially given that I'm international. it's a good way to broaden your understanding of the US healthcare system and policy,though in a painful way:)",
    "I don't have much of a background in domestic health care policy, and I think that some level of knowledge was assumed - and this caused me to often not understand what was going on in lecture. Some of the lectures (Medicare and Medicaid specifically) I found to be informative, but generally speaking the lectures did not follow a clear agenda.I think that for people without much of a policy background, the readings were also confusing and out of context. Having some sort of basic introduction or textbook, supplemented by articles, would be preferred for providing a basic introduction, as I thought this class would do.I thought that the small discussion section time was poorly used for this class. It's not necessary to provide time to work on the group papers during class. I had group papers for other classes where the papers were required to be planned and written outside of class time. I feel that I would have gained from more opportunities to discuss the material covered in class. There was one day when the small groups were provided with discussion questions, and I really enjoyed this. However, without a TA present for our conversation, we ended up with more questions than answers. I think that the most helpful thing would be to have one or two more TAs, and to break the class up evenly among the TAs to have a traditional discussion section, similar to the ones that we have in Professor Ickovic's SBS class.There also seemed to be a number of misunderstandings and logistical issues and changes with the class. There were at least four versions of the syllabus. I think that these issues caused many students to take the class less seriously.",
    "The course was a very cursory examination of main topics in health policy. It didn't seem to be well organized and the lectures seemed rather disconnected. Also - it is very unclear where the 25% participation grade is coming from. And, there were not clear guidelines for what was expected in the group paper.",
    "I took this course hoping to gain a broader understanding of health policy, but don't feel like I really learned too much. The lectures were mediocre, but they did improve as the semester progressed. The \"small group\" discussions were worthless - no one in my group ever came to class.",
    "The subject is very interesting, but readings are often too theoretical to understand. Instructor is obviously very knowledgable but I think students would benefit more if the class was taught on a less theoretical level. Would be great to learn the structure of the u.s government and how bills are passed through each govt entity, learn details about specific health policies and how it is being implemented, etc.",
    "The course was virtually the same course as \"Healthcare Finance and Delivery\". I only learned a few new concepts that I did not learn in the previous course.",
    "The course could use a little more organization and firm guidance from instructors. The course seems more suited as a seminar-style course for students with some policy background, and was not quite as transparent as I had hoped for students like me with no policy experience whatsoever.I felt a bit thrown into the deep end, although grading was very fair and seemed to be adjusted to individual skill level.",
    "The course is too general. It doesn't hit any one topic in depth, and does a poor job at providing big picture themes.",
    "learn a lot",
    "The course was a broad overview. I would have enjoyed some additional coverage of recent events in health policy covered in detail (PPACA). Health policy in the developing world may have been interesting also.",
    "The subject matter is interesting and the professor's lectures are also interesting, but he set a bad tone at the beginning of the class by not showing up to the first few lectures, thus leading people to believe that the course didn't need to be taken seriously. There is also very little way to assess if we've done the readings (no mechanism for measuring participation), so there isn't much incentive to do all the readings and\/or participate in lecture discussion.The group paper project was very difficult, because only a few of us in our group ended up doing the bulk of the work for the paper. It would be better if we could choose our own groups for that project. I understand the value of learning to work with others, but too many people in that class are taking it just to get the requirement out of the way, and don't have enough interest in the subject matter to want to partipate in any kind of meaningful way. It makes it difficult for those of us who are actually interested in the subject matter, but feel like we're the only ones speaking up about anything.",
    "While professor gusmano is an excellent orator, his lectures rarely corresponded with the slides he provided. Similarly I felt the readings did not help with basic concepts but assumed a level of preexisting knowledge that is unreasonable in an introductory class.",
    "Strengths: Throws light on the current health care scenario in US.Weakness: Basics or theory is not covered. Also no skills are gained out of this class.",
    "The course was not quite what I expected. I expected to learn some of the nuts and bolts about health policy and health systems. What I got was a few nuts and bolts, and a lot of the professor's thoughts on health policy and health systems. The papers and final were very helpful in gaining more knowledge.",
    "The course material was fine - a good introduction to comparative healthcare systems and the major institutions in the American healthcare system.",
    "Class was very disjointed...where you wondered where the lecture material was going sometimes and whether your assignments matched the material and the purpose of the class",
    "This course has been the most disappointing course of the semester, which is particularly troublesome being in the policy concentration.Strengths:Syllabus is promising, selection of topics appears to cover the important components of health policy, different forms of media were used (partly because instructor was not present as planned).Weaknesses:1. The course presents almost only problems: issues in the policy process, with Medicare\/ Medicaid, the shortcomings of other concepts like pay for performance etc. However, possible routes to answers were almost never provided which has been quite frustratingThis point stands out for me personally as being really disappointing. Even if there are no off the shelf solutions, one would hope to be able to engage on promising concepts for the future.2. The structure with alternating lecture and TA session does not seem to resonate. I felt this is true for many people in the class. The TAs are not set up for success in their sessions; there is no particular structure that could guide students or TAs in their engagement - sometimes the instructor tried to provide that in emailing an open ended question that should bediscussed. This quality of course delivery is simply not a Yale experience.3. The frequent absence of the instructor, or the change in TA vs. lecture timing is simply hard to understand. If scheduling issues cause trouble for the instructor, these could arguably be expected to be internalized by him and not on the back of the students.4. In combination, these factors might have been the cause for a large part disengaged class during lecture and an instructor responsible for 99% of the talk in class. I am sure this is not a good experience for anybody. I hope, future courses are again a more mutual and productive experience.",
    "Not what I expected. Not enough \"nuts and bolts\" of policy-making. May be it is sufficient for those with a background in political science, but not to medical professionals. Lacked certain structure in presenting the information.",
    "I learned a lot about health policy and the government\/ policy process, but only because I was very interested in spending time doing so. The majority of students did not feel the course was taught well. I think the course would have benefited from being SIGNIFICANTLY smaller (more like a seminar class), or a very different format for class (lectures starting with basics of the government and policy making process in America, including introduction to Congress, etc., maybe following the path of one bill in the system, analyzing the different inputs\/ influences, etc., maybe even a textbook, instead of the theory of policy-making for the first few weeks).",
    "Strengths: the assigned articles were interesting and gave a great overview of theories and current debates in health care policy in the US.",
    "I'm going to answer questions six and seven together, as it's difficult to separate them in my opinion.The course has a lot of potential. Professor Gusmano packed his lectures with interesting and useful information, and he's a good lecturer. The readings were extremely informative and well chosen. The subject matters of the papers offered terrific learning experiences.However, I think it would be better if Professor Gusmano were able to be there for both lectures every week. For the days that he wasn't there, we were expected to discuss readings and our papers with our fellow students, but my fellow students don't know any more about policy than I do, and vice versa. So, those days were less fruitful, in my opinion, than they could have been had Professor Gusmano given a lecture.Also, regarding group paper, I think we could have learned a lot more from the experience had it been more like the real world, where group projects are born of, and therefore with, a leader or leaders, and where other group members are chosen to participate because of what they can bring to the table. In other words, I think that it would have been even better had the group members been assigned roles, because it would have been more reflective of real world experience.In the absence of assigning roles, since this was meant, at least in part, to be a learning experience of how to work in a group, it would have been helpful if we could have gotten more instruction on how to do that, and if we had had more opportunities to ask questions about the dynamics of groups and that sort of thing.",
    "Course has potential to be inceredibly engaging and informative. Lecture hall style with a large group did not lend itself to such. Overview of material was good but sometimes not thorough enough.",
    "Weaknesses: The course could have been structured and taught better. In the beginning, a foundation was established by learning about the different healthcare systems that were practiced in different countries. However, as the course progressed, I felt lost because we were no longer learning about the basic foundation of health care in the US. Rather, the instructor lectured on health care topics that were in-depth, which made it difficult to grasp and learn, especially for a student that only had a limited amount of knowledge of the US health care system. For instance, I expected to learn more about the similarities and differences between Medicare and Medicaid. Only the different parts that made-up Medicare were discussed; and even with this information, I did not have a clear understanding of this social health care and its difference from Medicaid, other than that Medicaid is for those who cannot afford health insurance. Lastly, more problems were addressed about the US health care system in lecture rather than the possible solutions to solving the health care crisis.",
    "Not organized, papers were unguided, discussion sections were useless, and the professor only came to class one time a week (if that). I was really excited for this class and my very first intro to health policy - but the \"intro\" class assumes you have much background on policy, politics, and health care systems to begin with - from day one I felt lost. I think the professor is very smart and very charming - extremely fun to listen to - but I did not get anything concrete from the course.",
    "The greatest weakness of this course is its lack of structure. Lectures were all over the place and did not really follow a logical pattern. There were not clearly defined objectives on learning material for this course.",
    "Animated prof.Doesnt show up to class",
    "A good course that provided both information and instruction as to how policy is made and why.",
    "Interesting readings and lectures, but discussions could have been much more organized.",
    "I missed 90% of the classes. That should say a lot about the class.",
    "I found it really interesting, though it's not my primary area of interest. A good overview, introductory course.",
    "I felt that I did not learn very much from the course, other than the Garbage Can Model and the history of Medicare\/Medicaid. The readings were not as helpful as I would like, and were not helpful before coming to lecture. The articles did clarify some concepts mentioned in class once read after lecture. So, I felt there was not a good way to prepare for the class.",
    "I wish we explored health systems of the developing world more. Most of our coursework focused on the US and other industrialized countries.",
    "Strengths:interactive lecture styleoverview of the US healthcare systemWeaknesses:more thorough background on healthcare system structure and policy making proceduresthe instructor's availability for students",
    "Even though the lectures were interesting to listen, I don't feel that I learned all the basic and crucial knowledge I should know on health policy as a public health professional. This course type\/professor might be good for upper-level course, but not as an introductory course.",
    "I thought the course was very interesting, but as a person with no real background in the subject, I felt like the lectures were at times hard to follow. The group work allowed for more in depth discussion and I felt they were helpful for the overall comprehension of the topics. The lectures could have been more structured to help facilitate a better understanding of basic concepts vital to health policy.",
    "Poorly taught. Because of lack of commitment of the professor to the course material was not relevantly presented.",
    "The Professor was very knowledgeable but did not did a good job of engaging the students. The class schedule changed instantly and the lectures made it hard to feel like we were learning anything concrete. I inhertently enjoyed the material and writing the paper, but feel like I walked away from this class with the least amount of knowledge gain compared to other courses.",
    "I thought this course was great - but lacked a bit of organization. The syllabus was relatively well-organized but we often didn't stick to the syllabus, and having two class sessions a week when the professor was only available for one seemed like a waste of time. The group class sessions lacked direction and were not very productive.",
    "I greatly enjoyed the lectures, but often gained little from the discussion section.",
    "Class lacked focus and was disorganized.",
    "this is a good class on selected topics in the us health system. it's by no means comprehensive, but it's a good introduction. the class is a bit disorganized and the team project was allotted significantly more time than may have been necessary, but overall a fine class."

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0the teaching style is a little jumpy, not so logic and systematic.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Really nice guy, but clearly too busy for us. From what I understand he commutes from NYC. Examples galore: Didn't show up to the first class and provided no explanation the next week, missed at least two other class meetings at the last minute and he left us to watch YOUTUBE videos (totally unprofessional and a waste of our time and tuition), would regularly change the syllabus to meet HIS schedule (IE: he would switch our group meetings with lecture at the last second), and he had us scheduled to meet during the whole Thanksgiving break (didn't know we had the week off). Seriously, for a guy who only needed to be there for 2 hours once a week, it wasclearly too much to handle for him.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Weakness - would not be able to make it to class every now and then.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0It is hard to tell if he is agood instructor because the class got off to such a bad start with him being MIA, the TAs being clueless, technology issues and the directionless \"discussion groups\". As previously mentioned, it turned into a vicious circle in which both the class and Dr. Gusmano contributed to. Students didn't put in the effort so it turned into just a bad class. There was a lack of structure which made it hard to engage or take any real interest. Part of that was the combination of circumstances, but part of it is probably becuase it was perceived that this class was not a priority to Dr. Gusmano and therefore, it wasn't a priority to us. His skills and teaching method would be more valuable for a small seminar than a lecture class. He is a very interesting speaker.Despite this, he did go out of his way to be helpful and accessible in terms of offering instruction and advice on writing the paper. It is too bad that the class turned out the way it did because I think I could have learned a lot from him and it is refreshing to have a professor who has a wealth of experience beyond the ivy towers. The readings were actually really good and I learned a lot from them when I finally read them for the final. I think there is probably a better class in which to capitalize on his strengths.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Amazing to hear this prof. lecture. a real pro, and keeps attention of students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor did not seem committed to the course or the students. This was clear when the instructor set up the course so that he did not have to attend.",

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He's good in general other that the fact that he commute to teach and is responsive in email",

    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Instructor is knowledgable, but all the material taught in this class was exactly the same as the health care finance and delivery class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is a lively and rather engaging professor but I do feel his commitments lie somewhere else (i.e., not at Yale). I think he should have more concrete slides with information as opposed to ranting about his opinions.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor was clearly knowledgeable and a dynamic speaker. I enjoyed the conversational style of the lectures as well as the dry humor. However, I think the instructor could have been more involved in discussion sections. Section was not very structured or organized during weeks when we were not working on our group papers.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I thought the instructor seemed like a bright man, and I appreciated many of the readings he chose for the lectures. However, I was slightly offended by his flippant attitude towards the students and how often he cancelled lectures.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0inspiring",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Excellent lecturer, clearly had a command of the knowlege of the material he was teaching. Course organization could have been better, many changes in the schedule.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0See above comments - knowledgeable, but difficult to reach at times because he was part-time, and didn't seem too invested in the course due to his outside work, which came accross as much more important to him than students.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Interesting to listen to but fairly erradict teaching style",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is a dynamic speaker and makes his lectures entertaining. A bit more theory could be included in class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He was very accessible, but obviously not that keen on teaching. By that, I mean, he set up the course to lecture only once a week, and had us meet in unstructured small groups the other weekly meeting time. The final consisted of some identifications and a brief essay, which is not much grading for him.His lectures were not well structured; they didn't have a clear objective. It was just a topic that he talked about in a casual 'I'm just chatting with my coworkers about this' kind of way. Many of us left confused about what he was talking about, and with nobetter understanding of health policy.He also didn't give enough instruction for the papers, so it took a lot of prodding and questions of TAs to get at what he was actually looking for.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was very knowledgeable about the course material and overall, did a good job lecturing. Occasionally during lecture, the discussion would go off on seemingly unrelated tangents, making synthesis of the material challenging. I believe the lectures became more focused as the semester progressed. Dr. Gusmano was very available to students by e-mail and offered helpful feedback on questions and when grading.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I think he starts off thinking we know just as much policy as he does. I think that he does a poor job differentiating policy from economics, health management, and all the other topics we talked about. Majority of it was just not well organized.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The above critique is even exacerbated by an instructor who is clearly good and in many instances personable. I hope these points are received in a constructive spirit and might lead to a better experience in the future - also for the instructor himself.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Good speaker. However, did not feel that information presented added to my knowledge of the subject. Very frustrating.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I highly enjoyed Prof. Gusmano's lectures. He is an incredibly knowledgeable academic, and an amazing resource for health policy, but the large class format doesn't mesh well with his teaching style. (Sometimes it seemed he didn't really want to be there...) Prof Gusmano would thrive\/ shine in a much smaller classroom format, and I would love to take that type of course- one-on-one he is very helpful as well.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano was clearly passionate about the subject matter and had much experience to offer; however, he often seemed uninterested in his students and even frustrated that he had to teach the class. He failed to give a basic overview of health policy architecture in the US. Such an overview should be a requirement for this course, where many students have never taken a policy course and many students are not from the US and have no framework for understanding the issues. Gusmano was an enthusiastic speaker once he go into a lecture, but often started class late and often spent far too much time explaining and re-explaining paper assignments. Gusmano changed the syllabus many times, and often decided to switch lecture and group-work days without alerting the class more than 24 hours beforehand. It almost seemed as if Gusmano would rather be teaching an upper-level seminar class than an intro health policy class.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Answered above",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Clearly informed and an expert in the field however lecture hall did not seem to be the best setting for his 'conversational' style.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor seems to care about his students and he is fair in his grading. His lectures could be more structured and his teaching style could be improved. Sometimes the topic that he discussed does not relate to our readings and he would use health-related acronyms that the students did not understand because it was not covered in our readings or we do not have the background to understand.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0great lecturer; great materials for reading",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Strengths- really intelligent guy, knows his stuff on health policy. He is very accessible and will call and email immediately if needed.Weaknesses- expects a lot from his students though he fails to teach the material. Powerpoints were unhelpful- he never really used them anyways. In addition, the group paper was a disaster. All the work and 4 others got credit for the work I put into it which seems rather unfair.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Professor Gusmano is very knowledgeable in his field, but he lacked organization an structure in his slides and teaching content. Perhaps more projects and assignments can be added to the class to enhance students learning experience. There are a lot of things affecting health care system but there can be specific focuses for the instructor to narrow in on.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0A real shame this man is teaching this course. I couldn't believe he thought it appropriate to give this class almost the exact replica of the exam he gave to the Health Systems course last spring. Extremely lazy and made me question the quality of professors at this school.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He's an amazing lecturer! I think this is the strength of the course. However, I think the class was constructed in a weird way. The \"section\" type days were very amorphous and unorganized- for instance, there was often not enough room for everyone's group, and I think having so few TAs meant that no group got as much attention, or worked as hard on those days, as they could have.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor had a lot of enthusiasm, but I feel that he could not convey the material very well. Policy is a difficult topic to teach, and I feel that I did not really learn it to its full potential.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0I wish he wasn't away as much. But at the same time, I learned a lot when he lectured.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0The instructor provided the overview of the US healthcare system. However, more discussion on healthcare system structure and policy making procedures would be helpful for students to understand the system fully. It would be helpful if the instructor had more office hours for students during the week.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0He is very knowledgeable on the field and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Doesn't care about the course. When teaching would go off on rants and tangents. Missed multiple classes because of his own other commitments. Clearly was not committed to the course. Very knowledgeable on the subject but didn't care to teach it to us.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Prof Gusmano is very informed and does his best to accomodate students. However, you can tell he is a busy man and does not have the time to really dedicate to teaching this course. I did enjoy his lectures and the format of the assignements, but felt that most of the class was frustrated by the teaching format and style.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Personally, Gusmano was probably the best lecturer I've had here. Bright, captivating and knowledgeable, he made this class a great one. I know that lots of people disliked this class because of the class structure, but also because they felt like the aims of the class were not clear, with which I disagree. Gusmano made the aims very clear, but does not constantly outline his lectures, does not tell you what you should get from his lectures, rather, leaves the learning up to you. Though he was only in class every other session, he's incredibly accessible and dedicated to students - qualities that a few other YSPH professors sorely lack. He's certainly committed to making sure you getsomething out of the course.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Dr. Gusmano is a wonderful speaker.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0Instructor is clearly knowledgeable but seemed preoccupied.",
    "Instructor: Michael Gusmano \u00a0professor gumano is obviously very knowledgable about his subject matter, and is always available for questions from the class."

    "great TA",
    "Christina: nice. Give me a lot of helpful suggestions when I was writing individual paper",
    "There were TA's in this class?",
    "The TAs were fabulous and on top of their game -- they were doing extremely well with a very large body of students with huge differences in previous knowledge, and stayed organized and responsive.",
    "Leo seemed to be the only one engaged in the class and confident enough to answer questions and provide guidance. All of my questions to Christine who was our assigned TA were just directed to Dr. Gusmano or Leo. I sometimes felt like I knew more about the US political system than she did. I don't know anything about the other TA.",
    "The TAs were helpful and seemed to try hard to contribute in the best ways that they could. However, the TAs were often as confused about the requirements as the students, so they were only able to be so helpful. In the classes facilitated by the TAs (almost half), the students sat around in groups talking while the TAs sat in the back.",
    "TA helpful at times..Appeared forced to answer questions at timeswere approachable",
    "TAs are nice!",
    "Leo Quigley was very friendly, approachable, and responsive to requests and questions.",
    "Leo was very helpful and gave us a lot of helpful feedback.",

    "Great TAs",
    "The TAs were all fine.",
    "TA: Laurie GrahamLaurie was very helpful in guiding us in our group papers. She was able to offer advice from a student's perspective as well as tips for approaching assignments that caused some of us great apprehension.",
    "The TA's were helpful, but I had very little interaction with them.",
    "leopatient",
    "Little contact with the TAs",
    "Leo and Laurie - both great, very friendly, knowledgeable, approachable and helpful.",
    "Helpful",
    "The TAs: Leo and Laurri were responsive when I had doubts.",
    "All of the TAs helped lead discussions and help us with our papers. They were all great and tried to provided insight about what Gusmano was looking for in the papers.",
    "The TA's, particularly Leo, who worked with my discussion group the most, did a good job of keeping us focused and helping to explain unclear concepts.",
    "I don't really know why we had TAs...and the sessions where gusmano was not teaching felt more like study hall than discussion group.",
    "Limited interaction.",
    "Nice people^ not much of assistance at all.",
    "The teaching assistants were very nice, and as helpful as possible, but they don't have the breadth or depth of knowledge in policy to supplement the types of topics we covered during class. Also, sections were still too big to have successful\/ productive discussions about the readings- 8-10 people would be ideal.",
    "Each and every TA for this course was excellent, and handled the many, unexpected changes throughout the course with grace.",
    "The TAs were friendly and were helpful when addressing questions posted by the students.",
    "Very accessible",
    "Leo Quigley- I did not really get much out of the discussion section, but he was always on time and helpful if needed. He was also quick to respond to emails and readily available. Nice guy.",

   "comments": [
    "The lectures are good, and small group discussion makes everyone get lots of chance to speak out. And the individual paper and group paper are really helpful letting you explore deeply into health policy and system. Highly recommend it.",
    "If you are not a policy student and want to save yourself a ton of time and work, definitely take this course. Zero percent of the class time was valuable so you can skip it entirely. Otherwise, there is an individual and group paper (10 pages each) where you are assigned members. Take home final took about 10 hours to complete. Really sad there isn't a better into policy course.",
    "It is a very low stress class that doesn't have copious amounts of busy work like most of the core classes. If you understand US politics and policy, it is interesting. If you are trying to learn about US politics and policy, you might be frustrated or leave feeling unsatisfied. If you have no interest in policy but have to take the class, he is interesting and knowledgeable. If you are a policy student, expect to be disappointed or somewhat worried about the policy division.",
    "The course was quite poor. I would not recommend it to another student.",
    "Extremely vagueNo precise information presentedAt the end of the semester, cant have an intellectual discussion with anyone on policy.not recommended class",
    "It's a lot of reading and writing, painful in the process but fruitful in the outcome:)",
    "If you're an MPH student, you have to take this course. It could be worse, but you won't get much out of it.",
    "No",
    "The course was a mirror of a past course with few new concepts that were interesting.",
    "This course has interesting content, but seems more suited to those with a policy background than those who are policy virgins (so to speak). Be prepared to feel like your knowledge is inadequate to complete the assigned papers, but you'd be surprised at how accessible the content is. Going to lecture and absorbing the manner in which Dr. Gusmano talks about health policy issues is essential.",
    "I would not recommend that anyone take this class. It is too general with those who have health policy backgrounds and too scattered for those who don't.",
    "have to write two papers, so not easy, but gain a lot",
    "A good overview of health policy in OECD countries. Some more detailed lectures on the above noted areas would have been welcomed.",
    "Yes - interesting subject matter. It would be great if the professor could restructure the class to have a mechanism for measuring participation and doing the readings, which would prompt more than a few people to actually do the readings and partipate in class discussions.",
    "I was disappointed with this course, I do not feel I greatly improved my understanding of the topic.",
    "All in all an Okay Class.",
    "I would probably recommend that they try another intro-level policy course if they are looking for the basics. You won't get that in this course. If you are familiar in enough with health policy and health systems (which I thought that I was having worked in the field for years) you can take it, and use it as an opportunity to trade opinions with the prof. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "I believe that this was a good introductory course that, while occasionally difficult to interpret, particularly for someone with a limited background understanding of health policy, did a good job introducing the American healthcare system and its major institutions. I am pleased with the course overall.",
    "recommend it if you have some level of policy knowledge and then can engage in conversation. Otherwise, you may be like a majority of the class, dazed and confused about the purpose of the class",
    "I do not recommend this course in the way it has been delivered and structured. Neither do I feel the syllabus to be at the level of current thinking. The latter point is only my subjective sense, and I hope this does not come across as presumptuous. At the very least, the course did not convince me to provide me with the knowledge necessary to make a difference in health policy.",
    "Very frustrating course. Do not feel that I have learned what I needed to learn. Would not recommend it.",
    "Provides a high-level view of the policy-making process in America- you'll get out of this course what you put into it, especially with the weekly readings.",
    "This course is a seminar-like, intermediate domestic health policy course with emphasis on theory and current policy debates. It does not cover health policy architecture in the US. The giant, lecture-hall space that this class is held in (Winslow) does not lend itself to the type of seminar-like discussion that Dr. Gusmano clearly wanted.",
    "Its required... worth going to class and listening, minimal work required.",
    "Despite a somewhat negative review about my expectations for the class, I would recommend this class to fellow students. The paper assignments and the exams are fair and manageable. Although I wanted to learn more about Medicare and Medicaid, this does not mean that I did not taking anything away from this class. One does get exposed to the various health care systems practiced in different countries and one also comes to understand the complications that entails our health care system; and why its VERY hard to implement a universal health care plan for Americans.",
    "recommend; relevant to today's healthcare environment; great discussion about healthcare in general",
    "Worst class ever.",
    "Although I was provoked to think, and I learned quite a bit about the healthcare system, it needs work. If it was restructured I would recommend it.",
    "This class is formatted so that each week, one class is a lecture from Professor Gusmano and the other is a discussion section. The discussions are pretty loose, and the homework is pretty minimal. You read for class and spend the rest of the semester (1) writing an individual paper and (2) writing a group paper. So overall, reading + 12 pages of writing each week. Things might get repetitive if you've taken a class on US health policy before though.",
    "Skip it if it's not required.",
    "This class is a good policy overview. I would recommend it to people who have a limited knowledge of policy work- with too much experience or knowledge I think it would be less interesting and fun.",
    "You leave with a good understanding of the role access, cost and quality in the delivery of health care primarily in the industrialized world.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed the papers and the final exam. This is a good introductory course for US healthcare system. However, more thorough and detailed discussion on policy making procedures and current healthcare system structure is recommended.",
    "You learn interesting bits of knowledge on health policy, but it is not a good introductory course.",
    "I would recommend this course for someone with little understanding of policy, but with the reservation that the lectures are not focused and can be a bit confusing at times.",
    "Course is fine, professor is not. Do NOT take this course with Gusmano. Wait for another professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It wasn't incredibly challenging, but I did learn a lot. A basic introduction to health policy, would be better if you had a working knowledge of economics, but it's certainly not necessary. Great lectures, manageable course load.",
    "this is a good class on selected topics in the us health system. it's by no means comprehensive, but it's a good introduction. the class is a bit disorganized and the team project was allotted significantly more time than may have been necessary, but overall a fine class."
