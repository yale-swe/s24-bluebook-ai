    "Yes. Very interesting and useful regardless of how much\/little background you have on the topic. Definitely take it if you get in!",

    "Great class. Engaging professor, interesting discussions, reasonable workload, fair grading",
    "Would recommend this seminar, surprisingly perhaps, both for those familiar with international politics and norms, but also those looking for more of an introduction to intervention. Very comprehensive but also manageable, great class discussions.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn about different humanitarian interventions, theories surrounding intervention, and have great discussions with classmates (assuming your classmates do the readings, etc).",
    "A Must take. Period. Will change lives"
