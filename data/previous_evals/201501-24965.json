    "ABSOLUTELY!!!! AHHH!!!! WHAT AN IMPORTANT AND WONDERFUL CLASS. Juliet isn't teaching next year, but if the course gets revived in any way in the future, absolutely take it. Great readingsyou'll learn so much about histories that you didn't even know existed. You'll also have a repertoire of methods of cultural and historical analysis for a wide variety of objects, from films to tourist attractions.",
    "Great class that talks about topics that probably no other course at Yale covers. You will learn a lot about America's role in the world as a military power both historically and currently, specifically in the Pacific. This course talks a lot about memory and the erasure of history, and by the end of it, you will feel like you reclaimed parts of history that were swept under the rug.",
    "If you're interested in learning about US history from the other side - then you should take this course.",
    "Absoolutely",
    "Great course! Take if you have a chance. It's like another look at a history not often taught, which makes you realize how much the voices of other people have been suppressed throughout time. Cool ER&M seminar. Not sure if they'll offer it again, especially since Professor Nebolon is still finishing up her graduate studies. However, the course material is so important, Professor Nebolon is a great human being and does a great job of taking it, and it will make you a better person as well. Take it if you can!",
    "I loved this class! It put me in touch with a history that I never would've otherwise studied. Readings are totally manageable.",
    "Often unknown\/downplayed histories of Asia and the Pacific. A set of readings every week, blogs due on Monday nights, and discussion during seminar.",
    "This class changed my life. If it's ever offered again, TAKE IT.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The material that this class teaches and covers is so important yet rarely taught in the classroom, which is so sad and indicative of the pathetic state of Asian American studies at Yale. Take this class because it is amazing, because it is important, and to support Asian American studies at Yale!!",
    "Yes, we need more Asian American Studies courses!"
