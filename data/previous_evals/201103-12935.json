   "comments": [
    "I actually dropped this class--I guess by some administrative fluke I'm able to write a review. I had mixed thoughts. I took the class because I wanted a science credit that wouldn't make me feel like I was in 6th grade. I wanted a real science class that would also be interesting. This was sort of close, but it wasn't quite that. It was a lot harder than I expected. That said, a diligent approach to the class could make it manageable. The class often seemed to dwell on the more technical aspects of things we were talking about rather than the ideas themselves, which were very interesting at times--but I guess that's what science is supposed to do.",
    "Yes i would definitely recommend this to another student, as long as they are interested in this topic. I took the class because i wanted to learn more about the universe. If you take it thinking it \"might be cool,\" it'll probably bog you down because there is lots of science behind it, its not just descriptions and pictures.",
    "Amazing class. You don't need that much math\/science background to take this class and you learn so many amazing stuff that really will make your semester. Lectures are very nice, highly engagging and Professor Glikman is a phenomenal lecturer. Problem sets took me about an hour to two every week, and I read the textbook throughout the year (takes about 3 hours per week), albeit you don't have to. The material is fascinating, the lecturer is fascinating and the class is fascinating. Take it, or you're missing it out.",
    "It's not worth it. Take the easier Into ASTR course instead. It's boring, more difficult to get grades in, and the professor isn't the best at explaining her stuff. She's very friendly though.",
    "I would recommend the course solely for the amazing professor and interesting subject matter. However, the \"not for science majors\" thing is pretty misleading. The class is actually very difficult.",
    "This class is great for non-Astronomy majors looking for a science credit. It involves some real science (some majors do take it), so it's not for those who detest science. At the same time, you learn about the cutting edge of astronomy, and I feel like I came away knowing more about the area (unlike some non-major science classes).",
    "I would recommend it because I learned a lot of interesting facts about the universe.",
    "Take it.",
    "If you are a hardcore science person like me, this course is probably not for you. You will find the math and physics tedious and not challenging, and the more interesting qualitative material will not be enough to outweigh this side of the class. If you are looking for a way to satisfy a QR requirement with some pretty interesting material, then this is more the class for you.",
    "I've recommended this course to all my friends. It's a great basic QR without being a useless GUT.Galaxies and Cosmology is an intro level astronomy class that covers all the basics of the universe, from Newtonian physics to nuclear fusion, relativity, and dark matter.Professor Glikman is a wonderful teacher. She's very passionate about the subject and knows a lot, but at the same time she doesn't let her expertise get in the way of explaining things in beginners' terms. She covers all the material in her lectures, and if you have questions after class, she's more than happy to answer them.The work for this course is very manageable-- readings (which aren't critical-- the material is covered in lecture), a weekly problem set (about 3 hours), and an observing project. Also, the course only really requires math through precalculus, with the occasional calculus-related bonus problem.If you're looking for a relatively easy QR that's interesting and worth the effort, Astro 220 is the perfect class.",
    "I would recommend this course only if you are actually interested in the subject. If not, you may find the material a little dry at times (especially during the first half of the semester). Take it if you like doing calculations. In the second half, you learn about the Big Bang, black holes, dark matter, and other interesting stuff. Great introduction to astronomy!",
    "Good class. Not great class. For the non-science major who's good at math and interested in astronomy. Glikman is very enthusiastic, but the lectures can be boring at times. The homework is basically plug-and-chug.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It isn't too math intensive and the subject matter is absolutely fascinating and well-presented.",
    "I'm glad I learned the subject matter of the course. I now know much more about the origin of the universe and how we know what we do about the universe. This isn't an easy class, and the midterm caught a lot of people off-guard. I took only one year of physics in high school, and it would have been helpful if I'd taken more. I'm glad I stayed in the class after the midterm, though, because it got much more interesting and less about pure physics.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking the class. If you are a Science person, it will be almost a gut class in terms of difficulty compared to most Science classes, yet not actually a gut course because you'll actually do real astrophysics problems. It is a really great class because you learn so much about the Universe and it is for the most part very low-stress. I would highly recommend it for anyone, and if you are not a Science person you would find it a reasonable and fascinating Science credit.",
    "If you are a mathematically skilled person, I heartily recommend this class. If not, I still recommend it as an interesting class, but warn that the math is fairly difficult and you don't get taught any of it in the class, just the formulas.",
    "Dark matter, dark energy, the universe is flat and expanding! The topics covered in the course are amazing, specially the second half. However, beware. The course is not an easy, gut science credit. It has an actual science curve and because of this many students dropped off after the midterm. It might hurt your GPA.",
    "Consistent class, just make sure to do every extra credit, double-check everything, MAKE SURE YOU'RE CHECKING FOR ONLINE ASSIGNMENTS (I lost 2-3% of my grade this way, even though I was fully aware quizzes would be assigned on there). Midterm threw me for a loop (mostly because it felt so time-compressed), but final was fair.I'm a non-science major who has trouble learning from the blackboard\/lecture model--if that model can work for you in retaining not just information, but concepts, I say go for it. Material is not more or less interesting than any intro-level astro class.",
    "This course is veryinteresting. You learn all about the Big Bang, Dark Matter and Dark Energy. The lectures were always quite interesting. The problem sets could be somewhat difficult, but they were not too time consuming. I would recommend this course because the subject matter is very interesting and Professor Glickman does a wonderful job of explaining it.",
    "ASTRO 220 is a good survey course in astronomy. What we learned the first half of the semester was fairly dry because we had to learn all the basic methods astronomers use for calculating distances. However, the second half of the semester, we really focused in on galaxies and cosmology, and that was very interesting. The lectures could be pretty boring, and the professor wasn't always great at explaining difficult concepts in class, but she was very helpful if you asked her for a more detailed explanation after class. The problem sets aren't too difficult, and you work with fairly accurate data. The answers to the p-set questions often tell you some pretty astounding information about our universe.If you aren't sure to take this course because it is \"math-based,\" know that Professor Glickman went over any math or physics that we would know to solve the problems. However, because it is math-based, much of lecture was spent covering how to solve p-set type problems, and less time was spent covering the qualitative concepts behind those problems.",
    "I would not recommend this course. The professor was confusing and inaccessible. Take a different astronomy course. I highly recommend Professor Faison.",
    "Okay class, very easy and good for fulfilling QR or SC. It's all just plugging in numbers into equations and using basic algebra to solve for unknowns. I expected an eye opening journey into the cosmos and that's not what it is. Eilat is passionate, but a lot of times she made exciting topics boring. I probably wouldn't recommend it.",
    "if you're good at math, it's really easy, you just look up equations on an equation sheet for the most part, and only need some conceptual understanding of the material.",
    "Highly recommended as a first astronomy course. The first few weeks teach basic concepts and formulas (which don't have to be memorized) and the class gradually increases its scope from there, so you get a good overview of the foundations of astronomy and how it can be used to come up with cosmological theories.",
    "Astronomy 220 is a great course for non-science majors looking for a non-gut science course. Although the course requires only basic algebra skills to complete the problem sets, they're sometimes tricky, and the concepts get increasingly difficult to grasp. Still, I never attended a boring lecture, and many of the ideas (particularly in the second half of the course) were simply mind-blowing. Need a QR or a Science but don't mind doing a little work for it? Take this course.",
    "Yes if you do not want a gut course.",
    "Definitely take it. It's not a gut at all but it's also not too bad.",
    "Yes I think you should take it if you need a science credit and are decently strong in mathematics, i.e. arithmetic and a couple integrals here and there. If you don't like doing hundreds of unit conversions, look elsewhere. For someone who wants a science credit without having to kill themselves, this a great class to take. Beware of the first midterm however. I personally did fine on it, but many people dropped the course after receiving a grade they did not like. The weekly problem sets are pretty straight forward, just having to be careful not to make and calculation errors.",
    "This is a fascinating class for anyone who is interested in the Big Bang, galaxies, General Relativity, quasars, or astronomy in general. It does a great job of covering many different topics of interest, and I would absolutely recommend it to science majors and non-science majors alike. The course will undoubtedly pique your interest in astronomy.",
    "I came into this class expecting an interesting but non time-intensive way to fulfill a science credit - it had been highly recommended by the previous year's evaluations. My experience in this class, from the beginning, made me regret that decision. Prof. Glikman's lecture style was relatively dry, and the way the material was presented in class was confusing and fairly boring. Problem sets, though labor-intensive, were helpful with the material in general and for the exams. The biggest problem with this class, though, was its huge disorganization. This manifested itself both in little ways (constant typos and revisions on homeworks, TAs not knowing how to answer questions about homeworks), and big ways (substitute professors not showing up for class, having to guess completely about what type of material was important for exams, and a lack of a clear trajectory for the course laid out from the beginning). It's really a shame, because the material (as I learned from the textbook readings) is fascinating.Try to stay away from this one.",
    "Great class to learn about the galaxies and cosmos. Definitely recommended, especially for a science credit."
