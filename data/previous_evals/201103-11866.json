    "This was my favorite class of the semester, and I very much enjoyed both the material and the class. The premise is to explore radiation from its physical basis, its applications in medicine, energy, weapons, etc., and then discuss some astrophysics (supernovae, gravitational waves, etc.).Our class tended to pursue tangents (neutrinos!), and Professor Parker was extremely accommodating of that. If you're interested and invovled in the discussions, you'll probably enjoy it quite a bit. Its completely possible to sit at the back of the table and not say a word the entire semester, but you really won't get much out of it then.There are two papers, a 7-10 page midterm (on an alternative energy source) and a 15-20 page final paper (on basically anything mentioned in the class). I can't speak as to the final, but the midterm was quite doable and graded well. As far as writing credits go, this is about as good as it gets!",
    "This class basically comes down to the midterm and final papers. Although both are a bit lengthy, they're not unmanageable. The class discussions are what you make of them.",
    "Chill class. Professor Parker is a cool dude. One guy sat in our class and didn't say anything unless he had to present something, just hung out and texted people.",
    "PHYS 095 is a broad overview of pretty much any topic in physics or astronomy that you want to learn about (aside from your standard mechanics, ENM, quantum, thermodynamics, etc.). Essentially, this class covers all those things that you won't really get a course devoted to in undergrad. I think it's a wonderful experience for those deeply engaged in the sciences but may be a little too much for non-science majors who are simply looking for some exposure. You can ask professor Parker anything! He probably knows the answer (and he will tell you!).",
    "Yep, take this class. Other than the two papers, we had four assignments. One was a page long paper that was graded on the \"check\" system. Another was easy dimensional analysis that was never collected. The other two were presentations, one of which was about the midterm paper. The papers were tough, especially the final one so START THEM EARLY!! My reading week (until Friday morning) was filled by that paper, so plan for that or start was in advance!",
    "I would summarize it as a class that sparks an interest in physics and educates you about radiation and its importance in our universe.It wasn't a problem set class in the sense that we didn't learn how to solve that many things (we did a few) but it was educational and inspiring.",
    "It depends what you're looking for. IF you're really interested in the topic of radiation, neutrinos, and the universe and you think you'd understand it, TAKE THIS CLASS. IF this doesn't interest you and you just want a writing credit, it's not worth it. There are many more manageable classes out there that would interest you more."
