   "comments": [
    "H&P is perhaps the most challenging, and certainly the most schizophrenic, of fall DS curricula. Nonetheless, the syllabus is packed with excellent texts, and nowhere will you find a better or more expert guide than Anthony Kronman, whose keen insight and brilliant leadership in discussion was itself one of the best parts of the term. Kronman is seriously interdisciplinary and is, unlike most DS teachers, willing to apply the ideas of the texts to the modern world. The course is not really very cohesive, being something of a grab bag that better be titled \"Other Great Books We Couldn't Fit Elsewhere\", but the books are, after all, great.",
    "Truly extraordinary, in every respect. Take this course with Kronman if you possibly can; all the superlatives you've heard applied to him are true.",
    "The class itself is OK. I'm not a big fan of the reading, I thought most of it was boring, but Kronman made up for it. If you don't have a great professor, this class could easily be very draining.",
    "Yes, take it. Professor Kronman is awesome at teaching H&P, and DS is something you'll never forget.",
    "Professor is incredible. It was always clear that he loved the material and loved teaching. Many sections were intellectually inspiring and he always had lots of energy (maybe thanks to the amount of coffee he drank). Grading on papers was fair, though the comments were not particularlyconducive to becoming a better writer. Overall he did a great job at revealing to us the value of historical and political inquiry to our own way of thinking and to the political condition of our time. He made us engage with the material (which was all really great to read) in a way that went far above simply recounting histories or arguments.",
    "This turned out to be one of my favorite DS sections. I've heard that Prof. Kronman has taught all the different classes within DS (Literature and Philosophy as well as His\/Pol) and his encyclopedic knowledge of the Western canon makes section discussions fantastic; it really showed me the connections between the different subjects we were studying, which was something I hoped to get out of DS. He also met with us all after our first paper and is helpful with questions. The subject matter of Hist\/Pol can seem a bit arbitrary, a mixed bag of philosophers and historians, but it's all worth reading and a good teacher like Kronman will explain why.",
    "Yes, if you get Kronman, DS is worth it (at least for History).",
    "DS is a wonderful and challenging program that incoming Yale students should certainly consider. Professor Kronman's section was the most rewardingYale experience that I have had thus far!",
    "A great class. The reading was long but great. Kronman was fantastic. Most of the lectures on the Greeks weren't as good as the other DS lectures, or the H\/P lectures after, but it's still worth it. Getting Kronman is definitely different from getting someone who is specifically a historian or political philosopher, but he's great to have, especially first semester, I would think.",
    "Take this class. if you're in DS and get this class, don't drop DS even if you're other sections are kinda mediocre (in general, the rule is that at least two of your three sections should be good). Do the reading, or you'll regret it in class because the discussions are that good.",
    "You read the earliest historians with an eye to how they do history and what they see as the relation between history and politics. You read history more as literature than as you might read a modern history book. Factual accuracy is not the focus. I would recommend the course because you gain a broader understanding of the themes of the Western tradition and how it's changed.",
    "This curriculum DS H\/P is somewhat of a mishmash, but it contains some of the most interesting readings of the semester. You read the great ancient historians--Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, etc.--alongside the great political philosophers. It is sometimes difficult to draw connections between the two kinds of works, although there are certainly overlapping themes.As far as the recommendation:First, there is the question of whether or not to take DS. It's a personal decision, and there's no right answer for everyone. I recommend it, but with reservations. The seminars are slightly too large to be as effective as they might otherwise be; you read each work so quickly that you don't really have time to contemplate it and write each paper so quickly that you don't have time to revise it. But the lectures tend to be exciting (the big question among the DSers is always, \"How did this week's lecture compare to last week's?\"), and the professors are excellent. The DS community is a wonderful asset--it's as if you're part of a second residential college, and you have instant conversation material with any of the other students. And of course, there is the fact that you are reading the greatest works of Western Canon...Anthony Kronman might be reason enough to take DS. He speaks in sentences that are poetry, and his discussions of Aristotle\u0092s Metaphysics (which is on the Philosophy curriculum, not the H\/P curriculum, but he brought it into the discussion) were transcendent. One of the best things about Kronman is his ability to draw connections across disciplinary lines. (He\u0092s taught all three DS sections in the past.) He is a master at leading the discussion and asking questions that draw out students\u0092 thoughts, although he does tend to lead the discussion towards the particular interpretation he favors, rather than allowing students\u0092 ideas to push it wherever it may go. Still, he raised questions that inspired the class to think harder and explore further, and class conversations would often spill out onto old campus (or at least into the hallways of LC) after section."
