    "Take this class if you are interested in military history or European history. Professor Tooze is amazing and his lectures are never dull!",
    "Wonderful, wonderful class. Tooze is a brilliant lecturer and made each and every class worth going to. He provides intriguing narratives on the course of Germany over a period of nearly 400 years, each of which highlighting a new perspective that I had never before considered. Really changed my view of Germany as a society and in a global sense. Section for this class is also great and was filled with exciting discussion. The readings can get a bit lengthy each week but they are often quite interesting and easy to read. It is also not a necessity to fully read each reading. I started the class Credit D after hearing Tooze was a very harsh grader. However, I ended up switching to a letter grade because the midterm and section discussions are very doable. Definitely would recommend this class to anyone and is a perfect Credit D. Even greater if you want to knock out a history credit while also learning about some sweet stuff.",
    "I highly recommend the class. Tooze is brilliant and the material is really interesting. But be prepared to do a lot of reading. This class was one of my favorites, but also one of the most difficult that I've taken.",
    "Take war in Germany if you like military history and enjoy thinking about old problem in new ways. I really loved it and Professor Tooze style (what you see during shopping is what you get). And if you're not a writer, this history class is definitely for you.",
    "A very interesting thematic exploration of militarism in Germany. Fascinating lectures and readings, but often the readings are too long and you end up skimming or, later in the semester, skipping. Definitely worth taking even if you've never taken military history before, it's a great introduction into the field.",
    "Great, interesting course without too much work.",
    "Since this is Tooze's last year, I'm really not sure about this class. The material is pretty fascinating, but half the reason to take it is to listen to Tooze lecture. Let's see who replaces him.",
    "You are a WWI era soldier stuck in the trenches of Verdun, AKA LC317, and Tooze is the enemy artillery, constantly bombarding you with genius. Unlike WWI, you actually enjoy the shelling. It really is a shame that Tooze has to leave, I can say without a doubt that this was my favorite class I've taken at Yale. A big part of that was also my great TA, Jonny, who made attending section both useful and enjoyable even though it was at 8pm.",
    "Definitely take this class. Unfortunately, I think this is the last year that prof Tooze is teaching it (and he is a huge reason to take the class) but the material is also very interesting so I still recommend it. This class isn't too difficult. A fair amount of material to learn, but with the amount of choice you get on the tests, it's not bad at all.",
    "A very interesting class, which would appeal greatly to any student regardless of major. Also, a great chance to take a class taught by one of Yale's most well-known professors.",
    "Take it for sure. The first half of the class might have you wondering why you're learning about 1640's warfare, but it gets tied together, and the second half is fascinating.",
    "A rapid sprint through German history focusing on military episodes that perhaps only re-enforces pre-existing stereotypes of the nation and its people.",
    "Very good course. Tooze is an excellent lecturer. Very prepared and knowlegable. The information is interesting and not very useful. Also, the class is very little work.",
    "War in Germany is a really great class that I would definitely recommend to another student. It integrates German military history, IR theory, and a historical narrative through a very broad period of time. It's not much work - section, a midterm, and a final, which allows you to get out of it what you want. Overall, really interesting class - take it if you can. Tooze is great.",
    "yes.",
    "Take this course. You're Yale education is incomplete without it. You'll learn more about war in Germany than you ever thought you wanted to know, and love every minute. Leave behind all your preconceptions, especially regarding the World Wars, and come to class prepared to take very controversial stances. It's all part of the experience.",
    "Fascinating overview.",
    "Absolutely yes",
    "A thorough overview of German history from 1618 to the present with some of the best lectures I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. The readings are somewhat lackluster, but I highly recommend the course overall.",
    "Absolutely take this class!! Tooze is phenomenal and you will learn so much. Even if you're not super interested in War or Germany Tooze is fascinating and will make it worth your time. Tooze present in-depth and detailed historical analysis that teaches you a lot.",
    "Absolutely brilliant.",
    "A cool pairing: take this in conduction with Kennedy's Military History for two very different approaches (and two great courses) on the same topic. If you have any interest at all in the subject, I can't recommend this course enough. Lectures are awesome, and though they are revisionist as all get all, if that's not your thing the readings Tooze samples are balanced and present all sides of the issue as equally valid."
