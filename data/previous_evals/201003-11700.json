   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "It was difficult to relate lecture materials to lab - it didn't seem like what we learned in lecture was important to actually using ArcMap.",
    "The labs are the best and most important part of GIS, as this is where you learn how to actually use the program and how the ideas taught in lecture are applied. The lectures are less useful and many people pay little attention or do not attend by the end of the semester. This is especially true because after the midterm exam there are no additional tests. The powerpoints can be used as references and hearing the lectures can be useful primers for the material, but I found it difficult to pay attention or absorb the material in lecture format.",
    "Great skill to have. However, class should be structured so that class can follow the program that professor has on powerpoint. This is a hands-on skill, so the book itself was not very useful.",
    "Labs are extremely useful, lectures are not as useful.",
    "Very useful in our field.",
    "Dry lectures. Good, relevant lab assignments.",
    "This course is straight forward and clear!However, I hope the professor could make the classes more interesting.Also I hope the powerpoint slides would cover more explanations on the concepts.",
    "The lectures were more theoretical and not very related to the practical lab skills, but I guess you need both. I felt I developed a decent base knowledge of ArcGIS software as a result of this class, and, and even more useful unexpected bonus was that I got a bunch of extra Excel skills in the process. There is also some SAS involved, but not much.",
    "i feel that the methods should be explained more clearly.Lab should be slower.",
    "This was a great course on learning both theory and application of GIS. Strengths:- the shorter class times (50 min, 2 twice a week)- learning how to use ArcGIS,- and having a final project instead of a final exam allowed us to apply what we learned from lab section.Weaknesses:- Labs were long",
    "The labs were much more useful than the lectures. After the midterm, the lectures were pretty pointless since we were not tested on the material. The course should consist of one one-hour lecture per week plus the two hour lab. Two lectures are not necessary.Although learning GIS is useful, I'm not sure I can really apply much of what I've learned beyond the basics. This is because during the labs, the TAs go step-by-step through the lab and tell you exactly what to do, so you don't have to figure out anything on your own. Although this is helpful, especially for the more complicated labs, students are not encouraged to work through problems independently. Thus I have no idea how to do use of the complicated statistical methods (kriging, etc.) that we used during lab.The final project was a good and useful way of applying what we have learned to real public health issues.",
    "The course overall is very good and I feel the material is applicable to my future career. The laboratory sessions are the best aspect of the class and I feet that I learned much more through laboratory exercises than through lecture. Perhaps we should do mini-lab exercises in class where the students can follow along with GIS on our laptops?",
    "The labs were the most useful part of the class. It would almost be a better format if the lectures were apart of the labs.",
    "Overall, this class is very good. I learned a lot of introductory level spatial statistics concepts and walked away with a fair amount of technical knowledge about GIS.",
    "This course provided a good overview of the possible uses of GIS, and students had the opportunity to apply concepts to practical data situations. This is a good introductory course, and the student can expect to acquire basic GIS skills.",
    "strengths: Labs integrates topics learned in class allowing students to apply topics to real data.weakness: In class lectures don't always seem applicable. Difficult to teach GIS in a classroom setting. Should be taught exclusively in the computer lab.",
    "The main problem with this course was that the lectures emphasized spatial statistics too heavily, and formulas that we would never have to use, rather than teaching\/explaining to us the ways to actually USE GIS, and the tools within the program. Since spatial statistics is offered in the spring, it would've been nice if the lectures had focused more on the logistics and practical applications, since we never dealt with the more complicated theories in tests or homeworks.The lab assignments were useful, but they weren't written very clearly. It would be more useful if all of the computing steps could be written out for us, since these are the only guides we have for actually using the program.",
    "Dr. Holford is an excellent professor and was really fun to have as an instructor. The labs were very helpful to me personally, as I learn by doing rather than through lectures. No major weaknesses, the TAs were very helpful as well.",
    "GIS software is very useful for public health, it is good to master this skill.",
    "It gave a good overview of the GIS software and was useful for further applications of GIS.I felt at times the lecturer wasn't engaged enough with the class and most of the information could be gained without ever attending class but just looking at the powerpoint slides.",
    "I loved the class and think it was overall interesting and helpful. My only request would be to have the option, if working alone on the final project, to close off the subject. Another student ended up signing on to the same subject I did, so I worked with her but felt the work was unevenly distributed. Instead of doing everything, I left some tasks to my partner but overall felt that my final project was not reflective of what I learned in the class. I would have liked the option to close off the subject after I signed up for it.",
    "The strengths of the class are that it is application based. We are able to learn how to use GIS which can be used for our own research or for job application. The downfall of the course is that you have classroom time for a class that is computer based. The class time is a bit of a waste and it should be completely in the lab.",
    "Could have had more focus on lab sessions",
    "The course was a good introduction to GIS. The instructor provided useful guides on how we can apply GIS in public health. However,the lab hours were not adequate for beginers. In the end I still do not feel competent to handle GIS independently.",
    "The final project was a particular strength of the course. It allowed us to practically apply skills we had learned throughout the semester. The labs were also very helpful and well-structured."

    "Owais was my lab TA and he did a fantastic job leading the labs. He is very patient and was careful not to leave any students behind as the lab progressed. He was also able to answer almost any question or fix any problem that arose.I also worked with Keita for help with the final project and other questions throughout the semester. Keita has clearly done this before and knows the class material backwards and forwards. He is a very valuable resource for this class.There was a third TA whom I did not meet.",
    "Keita was my TA, and he was great. He was always able to answer questions, and his help walking through the labs was crucial.",
    "Keita was an excellent TA- very readily available to help students.",
    "Very helpful. Personalized.",
    "Owais Gilani was a pretty good TA. I liked it when he explained the purpose of what we were doing and the tools we were using in GIS rather than just having us do the lab without really understanding the functions of the program.",
    "Keita is very serious and patient. He would spend lots of time to solve problems with every students.",
    "Lixun Zhang - Thank You, you were GREAT. Answered questions, were nice, even stayed late a few times to make sure everyone was on track. I really appreciated your facilitation of the lab.Keita Ebisu - also went to your office hours and was grateful for your help.",
    "The TA is nice!!But I feel he should slow down ~",
    "Most of my interactions with TAs were with Keita Ebisu. Keita was really helpful with labs and the final project. He was also very responsive to e-mails and very knowledgeable about ArcGIS.",
    "Owais was an excellent TA. He was helpful and responsive to student concerns. He was also willing to help students as much as possible outside of class.",
    "The TA's are extremely helpful and knowledgeble about GIS theory and practice.",
    "TA's were helpful in lab.",
    "The TAs for this course lead a weekly lab section in which students must follow along. Each TA had an adequate skill set and understanding of GIS especially when consideration the new software updates. They were always helpful and ready to answer questions.",
    "Both Owais and Keita were excellent TAs! They were both always open to answering questions and providing troubleshooting assistance. Both were very organized and prepared for lab sessions, and they were both very knowledgeable about the GIS software. Keita went the extra mile and held an open lab session for the project -- we really appreciated his time and dedication, especially since he stayed late for additional questions.",
    "Oais was great.",
    "Some TAs were definitely better than others. Keita was a great TA, by far the best for the course. Keita should definitely remain as a TA for this course. He was very helpful, willing to literally stop on a dime and help a student lost or having difficulties with a procedure.",
    "The TAs were good overall, always available to promptly answer questions by email and in class.",
    "Our TA was very helpful - he went through the labs with us very carefully to make sure that we were learning not just how to use ArcMap, but the concepts as well.",

    "My TA Owais Gilani was not a very good TA. He was inpatient and did not seem confident in the information he taught in the lab.",
    "The TA for my session was very supportive, and contributed greatly to what I learnt from the course. But the practice of letting other TAs grade our lab assignment was not helpful, because they had varying competence in the use of GIS and had different expectations from us, sometimes assuming our familiarity with techniques we did not cover in our session.",

   "comments": [
    "GIS is a useful tool to be familiar with and a relatively painless class to take. The labs infrequently require additional time to finish outside the 2 hour lab session each week. There are twice weekly 50 min lectures that will be as useful as you make them. The midterm is a piece of cake, requiring some simple short answers and basic calculations. After the mditerm, the focus of the course is the remaining labs and the final project. You have the opportunity to use your own data set for the final project (can be very useful if you need to use GIS for your thesis) or to do a piece of a larger class project. The latter is definitely the easier way to go. The project culminates in a 2 hour poster session during reading week during which you share your project with Dr. Holford and others. I spent many hours working on the project to get all the details correct, from pulling the data from the web to mapping it in GIS and smoothing it using a SAS program, but overall it was not too difficult and is not a time-consuming class.",
    "I would say GIS is a great skill to learn, and that the labs are especially useful.",
    "If there is a skill to take from an MPH degree, learning how to use GIS will prove to be very useful.",
    "Necessary. A must-take course.",
    "Good introduction to GIS. Definitely would like to learn more about it because there is so much about GIS that I definitely don't understand still... And plenty of stuff that we just didn't even cover at all, I'm sure! Not sure if learning GIS is something that needs to be more of a \"learn-by-experience\" sort of thing.",
    "Its a good class to get expose to making maps,understanding disease distribution, etc. Although I don't know how much I will remember, I totally recommend this class.",
    "I'll recommend this to any students who are interested in the spatial analysis of diseases.It will give you a general view of this technique and tell you how to apply it to practical problems.",
    "Good basic class for GIS if you don't have the motivation to get a book and learn it on your own. (But if you do have that kind of motivation, you might want to do that instead!)",
    "GIS is a fun class to take if you love softwares~~>",
    "I would summarize this course as a fundamental course in learning about geographic information systems and the statistics involved in analyzing geographic data. I would highly recommend it to students interested in using this process for data they collected for their thesis.",
    "I would recommend this course as a way of learning GIS, but just taking a GIS workshop through the Yale workshop program may be just as useful and less time-consuming, and you wouldn't have to sit through numerous unnecessary lectures.",
    "This course will teach you the basic theory and practices of GIS software. I recommend it for other students. It teaches you methods to examine spatial data and ways of analysis.",
    "Useful, but mostly because of the labs.",
    "Highly recommended for those with a genuine interest in GIS.",
    "I would recommend this course for students wanting to obtain a general understanding of and basic skills for GIS.",
    "Wonderful",
    "Great course. Provides useful information for using software, a necessary skill in the filed of public health.I do warn however, in class lectures aren't always that attention-holding.",
    "I would recommend it to other students because GIS is an important tool in public health. However, the emphasis on using the program isn't represented enough in the lectures, and the heavy theory and complex equations that you don't end up using can be distracting and make the lectures less useful.",
    "This course teaches students how to use ArcMap software, how to plot out maps using appropriate projections, and teaches some basic statistical analyses that can be used within ArcMap and SAS. I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It taught me how to analyze the part of the data that I collected this summer on my internship.",
    "This class gives the student the opportunity to learn the use of the GIS software in a class setting. Class lectures and lab exercises tie together to give the student a solid foundation for use of the software in any setting.",
    "I would recommend this class to most people in the program as GIS can be applied to so many spatial analyses.",
    "Great class, be careful of who you sign up to work on a final project with! My partner did not even realize our map was of the Southeastern US until I told her.",
    "This course is a great introduction to GIS, in which you will learn both theoretical and practical skills."
