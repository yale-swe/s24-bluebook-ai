    "I've taken ALOT of psych classes at Yale, and this was not one of my favorites. The information is relevant, and valuable to learn, but the class itself isn't a great one. Sorry to say, I didn't really learn much in lecture and section--most of what I learned was from studying for the exams. Frank Keil is very knowledgable in the field, but I didn't find him to be a very engaging\/interesting lecturer. His powerpoints were difficult to follow and seemed very haphazard--I stopped taking notes in class after 2 weeks and just showed up to listen. In all honesty, I don't even think going to the lecture is necessary if you read the textbook (written by Keil)--I think I would have done just as well on the exams had I never gone to class and simply relied on the book. Also, section felt pretty disconnected, almost like a separate class. The section assignments are also very annoying--participate in two debates, plus weekly responses. There's also a long final paper (4,000 words) in which you must design your own study. The exams arealso in a horrible format--he claimed that people generally like them, but I hated them. For the midterm, you get a list of around 30 essay questions, must prepare ALL of them (in 5 days), and then 5 of them are asked on the tests. Not fun AT ALL (but I will say that everything I learned in this course I learned in preparing for the exams). The final is the same--30 questions, 5 are on the test, plus he pulls two from the midterm set, for 7 total. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it if you don't need it, it's kind of a hassle. If you want to take it to learn the material, I'd recommend CR\/D.",
    "Development Psychology is a lot of work. There is about 100-150 pages of reading per week, and it really compounds towards the end of the term when we go through the chapters very fast. The lectures are at 9am, and the book is sometimes much clearer than the lectures. In section, we have weekly debates, and also work on our paper which proposes a novel research project. In addition to the graded debates, there are 2 tests, and the 16 page paper.",
    "Great course! Professor Keil is a fantastic lecturer. Lectures got less enjoyable, as fewer videos of cute kids were shown and more information was included in each lecture. Most of the information given in a lecture was impossible to absorb because so much information was thrown out. The exams (midterm consisted of 26 short answer questions we had to prepare, of which 5 were asked during the actual exam; final consisted of 31 questions, of which 5 were asked and 2 were asked from the original 26) were a nice way to go back and think about what we were supposed to have learned. SO MUCH work to prepare for the exams and to write the 4000 word term paper, but the assignments were fun because the material was interesting, and prepping\/ doing them was enjoyable. Be prepared for a lot of work in this class, but if you accept it\/ get over it, you will (sort of) enjoy doing it.",
    "Developmental Psychology is a difficult class, but certainly worth taking if you are interested in children or in becoming a psychology major. The lectures and the material are interesting, as is the final paper. It is only studying for exams and trying to read through text book that are downsides to this class.",
    "I would not recommend this an upperclassmen. Or to someone who has a really heavy workload and does not like 9 am.Nonetheless when studying for the test read the book because there are headings that clearly refer to each question, which is much easier and faster than trying to go through disjointed notes from lecture.",
    "take it if you have any in interest in developmental psych. Don't take it if you don't like to do work.",
    "I would recommend this class, but probably only for psych majors or people with a particular interest in the topic. The lectures are very straightforward and focused. You will get sick of it if you are not really interested in developmental psychology.Professor Keil is very good.",
    "I would recommend this class, but MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE AMPLE TIME TO STUDY FOR THE MIDTERM AND FINAL EXAMS. The format of both exams is that he gives you a long list of essay questions, a few of which he'll pick for the exams. It's easy enough to get a great grade on the exams if you have time to answer and study all of these questions, but if you don't have enough time to do this, you're kind of screwed.",
    "Try to attend every lecture. The essay questions are handed out one week before the exam so start preparing well ahead of time.",
    "Developmental Psychology with Frank Keil is one of the more difficult psychology classes that you can take, but it definitely one of the most rewarding. Keil is very knowledgeable, and organizes the material in a very comprehensive way. The course packet is big, but if you are really looking to learn then this is a class to commit to.Two cautions: too early in the morning! I missed a couple of Keil's great lectures because I slept in. And TAKE GOOD NOTES!! It will help you on the exams later on, as his powerpoints don't always have a lot of words to help out (but the pictures he posts will correlate if you take notes).",
    "This class entails a deceptively large amount of work. That said, attending lectures is not necessary (as you will learn after the midterm), and by the final class there were about 5-10 people going....or so I heard. Professor Keil is a very good teacher, but his lectures are basically summaries of the book, and he is kind of dull at 9AM.Speaking of the book, it's 1000 pages of Tyco copy. It's Professor Keil's own textbook, but it's a rough draft so there is no index and the page numbers are all whacky.This is a problem when it comes time to study for the midterm or final. For the midterm, you get a set of 30 essay questions, 5 of which will be on the test. These aren't questions that having read the book will enable you answer -- even if you vaguely know the material, you need to hunt down the answer to every single question, which is difficult considering the rough draft format of the book. This wouldn't be so bad if you had more than 3 days to prepare. I ended up spending all of those in the library. For the final, he gives you 30 more questions, combined with the 30 from the midterm, and 7 will be on the test.There's also a 10-12 page paper you need to write.So...overall, there's a lot of work to be done. But it's done in spurts right before the midterm and right before the final. Other than that you don't even need to go to class or read the book. Also, the material in the class IS INTERESTING. I genuinely enjoyed learning it. So if you have an easy finals week and want to learn a lot about howour psychology develops, take this class.",
    "Yes, if you are interested in child development. If you don't like the material you probably won't like the class, but as a psych major interested in children, I loved it! That said, hour and fifteen classes so early can be a little hard, but Professor Keil is generally a good lecturer. Sections can be stressful and\/or boring, but still worth it. For the midterm and final, Professor Keil gives you all possible questions which makes for a lot of studying, but no surprises.",
    "Not even cloise to the best psych class but it is important material to know. Even so, I wouldn't recommend this class.",
    "Learn about a child's development and how environment and genes affct development. I would definitely recommend this course.",
    "DEFINITELY take this class if you're interested in developmental psych AT ALL. It's a must for any psych major. Professor Keil is an incredible lecturer, and if you go to lecture then you don't have to do the reading. That being said, the class is a TON of work - preparation for the exams takes forever so make sure you don't already have a crazy workload. If not, and if the topic interests you at all, then I say definitely go for it. But get ready to put a lot of work into it.",
    "If you are really interested in developmental psych take this, because you will learn a lot, but if not, 75 minute lectures at 9 am are going to be painful.",
    "I think the lectures would have been interesting if they weren't at 9 am. I skipped a lot of class and still did really well because the format of the tests makes it so you can literally not go to any class or do any reading and just cram before the tests. Great material though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in psychology, parenting, teaching, social policy or understanding what was going on in their own childhood. There's a lot of reading to do, but otherwise not too much work from day to day. The midterm and final involve a lot of preparation-I think there were 57 possible essay questions to prepare, 5 of which were asked on the midterm and 7 on the final. But when you think about it, this class covers so much material that preparing all those essay questions is less work than it would be to effectively study for a normal exam on this material. Just be sure you keep up with the reading and don't save it for the last minute. Personally, I thought preparing the essays was a good way to review and finish off the course.",
    "Lectures and readings covered very similar material. Sections were pretty separate from the class, and required some extra work, but were enjoyable. Tests were very fair. I think the class is structured very well, covers an impressive amount of material, and still manages to be fun.",
    "Even though it's a 9am class, it was worth getting up for. The material is fascinating and Professor Keil was fantastic. We definitely cover a lot of ground but sometimes the amount of information can be overwhelming.The midterm and final exams are brutal in that he gives a list of 26 (midterm) and 31 (final) potential essay questions and he picks 5 for the midterm and 7 (2 are from the midterm list) for the final. It takes so incredibly long to prepare all of the essays beforehand (which is how he wants you to study) and it's just a pain.The final paper is also unnecessarily long, asking for 16 pages when the topic could have been written in 10 pages muchmore concisely.The section demands are a little extreme too, with debates each week where debaters have to prepare a 500 word statement+15min speech and non-debaters also have to send in a shorter position response. They're graded pretty harshly (at least my TA did).",
    "This is a good course, and you feel like you really want to go to lectures because you learn so much and Professor Keil is engaging. The exams take a lot of studying, but they help you learn the information and the exams themselves aren't difficult if you have prepared.",
    "This class it great. I would definitely recommend it!The only tough part is when a midterm comes up. Prof. Kiel gave us all of the test questions ahead of time. While this felt fair I found that both times I had to drop everything else was doing in order to put in a decent study for this class. Just make sure those tests work in with the rest of your schedule!"
