   "comments": [
    "Overall an excellent course. The course covered the full range of material from the Edo to Tokyo period whilst maintaining a relevant and interesting cultural angle. Class discussions were thought-provoking and passionate. Prof. Drixler was also an extremely passionate instructor who encouraged but did not insert himself into class discussions--rather leading us through the conundrum of Tokyo's tumultuous history. One of my favorite seminars this semester.",
    "This class is a fascinating survey of Tokyo's history that anyone interested in Japan or history in general should take. The readings were always interesting, the class discussions lively, and the workload relatively light (the only major assignment is a final research paper, which was actually quite fun to do).",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone with any interest in Japan's history and enjoys connecting history to culture. It is a fantastic choice of a freshman seminar.",
    "HIST 030 is great introduction to college-style seminars for any student interested in East Asia, Japan, cities, or history. I recommend for a student interested in history looking to improve his or her writing.",
    "Yes, definitely! Personally, it was difficult for me to adjust to the standards of the class, but as the course progressed, I truly appreciated being in this seminar. At the end of course, I realized how much I had learned\u00e2\u0080\u0094not only with academics and the topics about Tokyo, but valuable life lessons as well. This class is so rewarding, and I encourage others to take this course.",
    "Tokyo is an excellent class, and provides exactly the sort of experience a freshman seminar should. I would highly recommend it without question. The topic of the class seems narrow, but you'll learn a tremendous amount-- by approaching Tokyo from an interesting and diverse array of angles, you'll put together an interesting and deep picture of the city. The class really helped me, as a freshman, learn to think critically, analyze texts, and synthesize information. The readings aren't usually difficult or excessive, and are for the most part very interesting. Be warned; one large research paper is required-- but this isn't a big deal because you have weeks to do it.",
    "A fairly intensive history course with a good amount of writing and a ton of reading. I would definitely recommend it to other students, it wasn't like any class I've really taken in the past.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Asian history. Having a background in Japanese history does not hurt, but is not necessary to taking this course.",
    "I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to students. This course, though centered on Tokyo, reveals the history and development of Japan throughout the latter half of the previous millenium. It provides a great introduction for those who have not studied much about Japan and expands the knowledge of those who have. The reading is fair and the written work is not light (3-5 single spaced essays ranging from 2-10 pages), though Professor Drixler responds to the feedback of students both about the type of work we are doing the texts used. As a class, we had the chance to not only delve into a variety of texts about Tokyo\/Edo, but to also visit the Yale University Art Gallery to look at prints and watch a fascinating documentary\/have a sushi party outside of class. Professor Drixler is extremely understanding, knowledgeable, and helpful during class and office hours. Class was never a dull affair, and I can truly say that at the end of the course I learned a great deal about Tokyo, Japan, and the understanding of history."
