    "You learn how to do basic coding for websites and you learn some web design ideas. You don't really learn much interactive design except for a week in java script, so it's not any kind of video game programming. Was pretty chill and fun.",
    "A course that teaches you to approach interactive, web-based design in a critical way: how to create a work on a web platform that is both functional and uses its inherent interactivity in a crucial way. Aesthetics were not heavily commented on; the ability to use coding to create and effective user interface\/experience was the focus.",
    "Interactive design encourages students to learn practical tools like Javascript, PaperJS and HTML. Take the class if you're already a confident graphic designer or other type of visual artist who is trying to branch out into an interactive web-based medium. Beware though, sometimes, nothing happens for like two hours of a four-hour-long class."
