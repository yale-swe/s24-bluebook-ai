   "comments": [
    "Came in with very little knowledge of climate change and geoengineering other than 'the world is burning.' Left with a wealth of evidence, information, and perspective son the two.",
    "I learned an incredible amount about climate change and geo-engineering. I feel as if I can talk about it ad nauseam and actually debate my points because of the readings we did.",
    "I learned a lot in this course about climate change and the role geo-engineering has in prospect of climate work. We learned about climate science, what is being done now and what can be done in the future.",
    "I learned so much about climate change and our ability and options to respond to it. I never had a true appreciation how nuanced the topic is, especially in practice.",
    "The class is kind of informally split into two sections. The first half is a sort of survey overview of climate change, discussing the physics, economics, governance, etc... of the problem. I came into this class not knowing much, so this broad perusal taught me a lot about the basic outlines of climate change in a way that was really informative. The second half focuses on geoengineering, both in terms of practicality and larger governance\/ethical questions. You get to learn in-depth about this crucially important aspect of our response to this existential problem that is hardly discussed. I feel like I learned so much it's kind of shocking everything fit into just one semester.",
    "Science and impacts of climate change, climate negotiation; second half focused on various forms of carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management with modules on ethics, governance, and communication",
    "I feel like I learned more in this course than in most of my other courses at Yale. It was a survey course to be sure, so we didn't get to go as deep as I would've liked on certain aspects of geoengineering and climate change in general. But as someone who isn't going to study this topic again in college, I really am happy I have a wide understanding of this topic, even if it isn't exceptionally deep. The concept of geoengineering is quite interesting, and the Wake is one of the world's foremost experts on it.",
    "In this class, we learned about the current issues in climate policy, economics, and technology and how geoengineering would fit in as a tool in stalling climate change.",
    "I feel like I have a deeper understanding of geoengineering as a field and can more confidently participate in the discourse surrounding climate change technology.",
    "The course was wonderful because it gave me invaluable knowledge about geoengineering, a field few people have an extensive understanding of. Prof. Smith took us taught us from the ground up; he went through the basics of climate science, economics, politics, and media coverage before introducing us to the pros and cons of various forms of geoengineering. Towards the peak of the course, we focused more extensively on his own research in solar geoengineering. It was truly a wonderful experience to get to speak to him directly about his own work and to see how willing he was to engage with us and get our opinions on the viability of the solution he is proposing to the world. Overall, the course was both quite insightful and thoughtprovoking!",
    "I learned about climate change in general (the science behind it, the projections for the future) and from an economic perspective, as well as geoengineering approaches. A wide variety of mitigation, adaptation, and negative emissions technologies were covered, with special focus on stratospheric aerosol injection, since that was the instructor's area of expertise.",
    "I learned a lot about the current state of the fight against climate change and the way that geoengineering connects to that fight."

   "comments": [
    "Wake is wonderful and caring. He gives fair feedback and above all else, he does his best to help the class learn.",
    "Strengths: - Workload is a bit, but is evenly spread out and doesn't feel crushing at any point. You'll get used to it. - Professor Smith is incredibly knowledgeable and kind. What a guy. - Readings are, for the most part, engaging and not too tedious. - Class discussions are usually interesting. - Guest speakers were awesome. - Final doesn't feel hard because of how much work you do over the semester. Weaknesses: - Class can tend to drag during the last half hour, just because it's long.",
    "The readings were very good and informative. I learned a lot about a topic everyone should learn about! The class discussions were sometimes redundant to the readings and could have been more organic. The weekly responses were quite long, but helped to solidify my thoughts.",
    "I enjoyed how flexible the course was in terms of class discussion and what we found most interesting to focus on. Oftentimes, we as a class would find a topic that we disagreed on or wanted to discuss more and Professor Smith was very open to pursuing it. I also enjoyed, specifically for this class, the format of having a response due each week instead of larger papers since it allowed me to engage with the topics each week, which were varied and built on each other.",
    "There are many strengthsthe readings and sections are both fascinating and stimulating, and the weekly brief\/relaxed final exam structure really helps you to learn a lot in a way that's manageable and doesn't really feel stressful. Prof. Smith is great and super receptive to meeting with students. It's easy to tell he really cares about this topic and about teaching this class, and the passion really comes through and is what made me enjoy this class so much. The only weakness is that the reading load is pretty heavy, but I think he's planning on changing this and even lightened the load for us later on after we brought it up with him.",
    "Prof. Smith has put together a great syllabus. I thought the in-class discussion could be led a little better, but overall still a great class!",
    "Strengths: you will learn A LOT, Wake is a great discussion leader, grading is fair. Weaknesses: sometimes class discussion did feel dominated by a few people, and Wake didn't always do as much as he perhaps could've to stop this at the beginning of the semester. Yet by the end of the semester, he had recognized this problem and largely solved it.",
    "This course is new so it is a bit disjoint, but there were very interesting discussions.",
    "A major strength was how comprehensive the course felt. For once, it honestly felt like we were approaching the subject from many different angles and undergoing an interdisciplinary education. Very few weaknesses! The one thing I think could have enhanced the experience is perhaps including a field trip or some other way for students to get a firsthand understanding at what geoengineering looks like, especially considering how niche this field is. It would have been a cool added touch and I think if this course is brought back, which I think Yale should do!, it should be given some kind of budget that would allow Prof. Smith to do something of this sort.",
    "Strengths: The topic is definitely important, a lot of the readings were interesting and relevant, and I left with a fuller understanding of the different perspectives at play. Weaknesses: The class meetings were sometimes more lecture-y than discussion-based, which could be boring. Also the grading could be quite arbitrary - or at least it felt that way since no real justification for points lost was given."

   "comments": [
    "Wake is a wonderful professor! Very knowledgeable and patient with his students. Definitely a great seminar for anyone.",
    "Absolutely. This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Professor Smith is a super nice guy and you learn a ton. Even if you aren't planning on majoring in EVST, take this class. I looked forward to going every week, and ended up really enjoying doing the readings (I'm not exaggerating). The weekly briefs are tough, yes, but you get used to them and Professor Smith will meet with you to give you advice on how to do better. Once you get into the groove of this class (about 3-4 weeks in), it is one of the most rewarding classes at Yale. 10\/10.",
    "Yes! You will get out of it what you put in, so put time into the readings! Its not hard to do well if you try.",
    "I would recommend this class because it was low-stress and I gained so much perspective on climate change. I fully did not realize how little nuance my understanding of climate change contained before this class.",
    "YES. This is literally the only course in the world currently offered on this subject (climate engineering), but as you learn it's probably going to have to play a large role in our future climate change response. The structure of the class and Prof. Smith are both great. Easily one of my favorite classes I've taken herecannot recommend it enough. Anyone who wants to learn about this under-discussed aspect of arguably the biggest problem of our era should take this.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in a broad overview of what technologies exist to combat climate change outside of reducing emissions.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, I really enjoyed learning about climate change from a professor outside of the academic community.",
    "This course is a great overview for any student who is looking to gain a wider and deeper knowledge of geoengineering.",
    "100%! Prof. Smith very clearly cares about this subject and uses a combination of a great curriculum and a wonderfully engaging personality to make students care about it as well! I hope anybody who is even a little bit interested will take the class and learn so much more. The class will actually leave you with more knowledge than most of the world on geoengineering :)",
    "Maybe? I was taking it Credit\/D so I wasn't really engaged, and that meant that I probably had a worse experience of the class. I liked many of the readings that I did do, and I do feel like I learned a lot about a really important topic. I appreciated the light workload - ~100 pages of reading per week (skimmable), a 700ish word weekly reading response, and a final exam (essay format). This was the first time the course was taught, so of course it wasn't perfect, but Wake was very earnest and will genuinely do his best to make improvements for next time. I thought it would have been better to integrate the science with the geoengineering methods rather than talking a lot about wind for a reason that was not apparent until we covered SRM much later in the course. I also found the grading to be a bit all over the place - the weeks when I did all the readings, I often got a lower reading response grade than the weeks when I skimmed the readings and wrote the response in 30 mins - and they seemed arbitrary due to a lack of clear feedback accompanying the grade. I also sometimes didn't have faith in Wake's expertise - I felt he should have told us from the beginning that he was actually pretty qualified as an expert on SRM, and that would have made me trust his knowledge more, but regardless he did not have a ton of knowledge outside of the scope of the course and sometimes stumbled on science things.",
    "I would highly recommend that students take this course to get a better understanding of how geoengineering relates to the world's current efforts to fight climate change."
