   "comments": [
    "Strongly recommend.",
    "TAKE IT if your interested in any aspect of military power.",
    "This class focuses on military theory; if you care anything for national security, Professor Monteiro will school you in the great thinkers you need to familiarize yourself with before leaving college. He assigns heavy reading and expects frequent response papers, so make sure you are willing to do the work before signing up. The work is worth it, though! Take it, or take another class with Professor Monteiro, before you graduate. He is great!",
    "Absolutely. Take any course with Nuno.",
    "Truly excellent seminar. Reading list is superb, and is a far more serious look at Clausewitz and military history\/theory than, say, the Grand Strategy program. Monteiro is thoughtful, engaging, and very open to students' concerns and questions, and he strikes a great balance of running a very tight discussion that stays on track without ever letting class become a lecture. The class definitely drew out some very impressive students, both grad and undergrad.",
    "If you're at all interested in foreign policy, then this course is a must-do. The readings and discussions gave me a whole new perspective on how we use our military as a political tool.",
    "I would strongly recommend this class to a fellow student who has knowledge in politics or national security or has served in the military. The veterans of the class were invaluable and provided good perspective, but the other students were also able to offer valuable insight."
