   "comments": [
    "If you are someone involved more in sociology and need a statistics-like course, I would recommend this class. It teaches you the math while applying a sociological research approach.",
    "People interested in sociology or in need of a truly interesting QR credit should take this class! It is certainly not a gut, and you will spend a good amount of time on the problem sets, but help is abundantly available, and the problem sets count for 40% of the grade. People who want to understand the basic mechanics of social science should take this as well. It changes the way you see data, and is extremely engaging. Professor Maralani is a great lecturer (funny, gets students to work in groups and give examples). By far this is the best lecture class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. It was very nice that my QR credit was connected to topics I am actually deeply interested in -- the study of inequality. The fact that Professor Maralani is a sociologist and not a \"pure\" mathematician makes this the perfect class for social sciences and humanities types who want to use math in their own fields. The p-sets were difficult but forced you to learn, and the lectures were long, but usually punctuated with interesting segues and side-stories. The only thing to warn about: the last three weeks of lectures were pretty hell-ish. The topics were very difficult to understand, and based on the organization of the course, Professor Maralani has to rush through them. Go to section and ask lots of questions, because the final was almost entirely on these later topics and was harder than anything we had talked about in class.",
    "This course is for students looking to use statistical analysis to understand phenomena in social settings, particularly what that phenomena says about socioeconomic conditions in a given society. I would highly recommend it to all who do not mind math.",
    "This is very strong class. If you're interested in a rewarding qr credit or in being a better reader of those 538.com.",
    "I am a sociology major but also a pre-med student who was deciding between taking this or just the basic intro stats module. The first few weeks seem like standard statistics, then it veers more into using the STATA computer program and understanding the values it gives and how to provide sociological interpretations for the values. You are never really doing math though as you would in a typical class, and you only use formulas really in the first few weeks. I am happy with the understanding of statistical methods that I have gained and feel like I understand the purpose of using statistical methods in real-world applications, which is going to stick with me much longer than formulas would have.",
    "Yes I would recommend SOCY 162 for those who wish to learn statistics and its basic applications for sociology.",
    "A great way to gain a statistical sensibility and learn how social data is analyzed using relevant statistical methods. Professor Maralani is an absolute queen, and makes the class enjoyable and engaging. The homeworks range from being very easy to a a little challenging, but you always feel like you've learned something when you're done with them. The midterm and final are both take-home, which feels very appropriate for the material. I was recommended this class last year by a friend of mine after I told him I wanted to take some statistics before graduating, but wanted them to be relevant to my interests in public health\/sociology. I was told I *had* to take this class, and I'm glad I did. Not exceedingly difficult, very rewarding.",
    "The best taught class I have ever taken at Yale. If you are a looking for a QR in which you actually learn useful quantitative reasoning skills (statistics are important!) and learn them WELL but in an incredibly low-stress way (the final and midterm are take home, the homework is collaborative, and there are so many office hours and opportunities for help), take this class.",
    "A lot of work--but well worth it for all the statistics you learn!",
    "I would say that this course is a foundation course in basic statistical concepts with a heavy application to sociology and real-world contexts. I would recommend this to a student who is studying social sciences and wants to understand how to interpret studies in papers.",
    "A lot of work. Make sure to go to sections, start the psets well in advance, and know that having a solid understanding of how Stata works is integral to succeeding in this class. The work is definitely worth it in the end, as I got a good grasp of Stata and statistical analysis by the end of the course.",
    "This is a basic statistics course for people who don't want to learn too much math. If you know math this should not be too hard. and if you know programming it will probably be easy. however without those two skills this is in fact a great class as you get the basics in a easy to understand way with a professor who tries her utmost to get you to understand.",
    "Class is as enjoyable as the subject matter can be, but be prepared to digest a lot of information each lecture.",
    "Challenging but probably more interesting than any other stats class you'll take. Really focuses on how stats relates to the social world, and Professor Maralani helps you to understand how to read\/understand statistics in academic papers and the general media."
