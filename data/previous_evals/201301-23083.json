    "I recommend it. It's a great way to learn about the Caribbean and the readings are all very interesting.",
    "This course was fantastic in terms of what it covered and how, and Professor Lambe is an incredible source of bottomless knowledge about Latin America and the Caribbean. The course's only weakness was in its students - two or three had some experience with the Caribbean, but the depth of the material covered required this background knowledge and the conversation was often slowed or stymied by the other students. Otherwise - a must-take and definitely worth learning about.",
    "Survey of under-studied topics in Caribbean history, with an emphasis on re-analyzing topics from a lens that grants agency to the people who actually inhabited these islands.",
    "If it ever happens again...",
    "Modern Caribbean History was a seminar that provided a really in-depth look into the political histories of the major Caribbean islands and I would highly recommend it to any student with an interest in the region."
