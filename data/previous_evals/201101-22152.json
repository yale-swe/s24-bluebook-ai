   "comments": [
    "Stressful. VERY stressful.",
    "Yes. Take it creditd fail if youre not majoring",
    "This is the single best class I've taken at Yale (and this is only the second time I've written that on an evaluation). Petit is a genius. It's a s***ton of work, but it's so fun and worth every minute.",
    "Take this instead of drawing architecture.",
    "There's no getting around it, you have to take this class to major in architecture. It's surprisingly worth it.",
    "This is a great course, but only if you really think you will enjoy it and have time for it. It is the most intensive course I have taken at Yale thus far and it requires an obscene amount of work. I still recommend it though.",
    "the professor knows what he is talking about. i would only take this class if you are possitive i want to do architecture. it's a lot of work and quite stressful. you have to also pay for all your materials and spend roughly $100 every model",
    "I could not recommend The Analytic Model more highly. It is absolutely phenomenal. But be ready to jump in headfirst, and hold your breath, because you resurface in the middle of whitewater.",
    "You must understand that the Analytic Model is not a class - it is a way of life. I was surprised about how much time it actually took up in my life, but I was also thankful for that. It was the best introduction I could get into the life of an architecture major. You do everything - laser cut, use the woodshop, draw, work with graduate students, spend an entire day in the studio, etc. It showed me that I was ready and willing to submit myself to the architecture major.The class is difficult but manageable. You select an architect from a hat, and will choose one building to analyze throughout the entire semester (diagrams, 4 models). At the beginning, you are basically thrown headfirst into the world of architecture. It starts of frightening, exciting and unknown. But I promise that you will thrash around for a while and then start to figure it out.Emmanuel Petit is amazing and a strong, strong draw for the class. Also, the TFs are unreal. So smart and so helpful.Bottom line - if you need to decide if you are interested in studying architecture, this class is a must (and not just because it's a requirement to apply to the major). Even if you don't want to major - still take it, but definitely credit\/d so can keep it from taking over your life!",
    "I would only recommend this class if you plan on being an Architecture major. Otherwise, the effort needed to do well in the class won't be worth it to you.",
    "You will be terrified of Emmanuel in the first weeks of class. He, without saying anything, will convince you to wear heels and suits and present projects with professionalism like no other class. His criticisms can be stabbing but extremely effective. You will go from tracing pictures of buildings to laser cutting Bass wood, gluing plexi-glass, whipping out computer drawings, and photographing models. The learning curve, with all the specialized equipment and software programs, is unquestionably high and demanding. This class is not for the weak. If you are testing the waters of architecture, decide by the third week, to keep or drop this class. Or else be prepared to face weeks and months of excruciating masochism.",
    "I entered the semester planning to major in architecture, and enrolled in this class and ARCH 154, the sophomore spring prerequisites. Halfway through the semester I dropped the major and ARCH 154, but stayed with this class because I liked Emmanuel and, despite the intense workload and frequent bewilderment over assignments and expectations, I found the work fascinating and enjoyed the model-building process. I absolutely do not regret sticking with this class over ARCH 154 -- I learned a tremendous amount about how to think about a building in a sustained, rigorous way, and was able to feel truly proud of the work I had produced. While I wouldn't necessarily recommend the class to a non-major looking for something \"new and different,\" I would say that if you are genuinely interested in the material and willing to pour your heart and soul into the process, this class will offer you a truly rewarding experience. Also Emmanuel, while scary at first, is an incredibly cool guy."
