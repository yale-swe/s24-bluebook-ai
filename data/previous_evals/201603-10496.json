   "comments": [
    "I feel like this course covered a lot of great material--some of which is covered in other psych courses; however, it was with a different set of lenses that we examined topics such as language acquisition, perception, cognition, etc. The course emphasized that we as humans are readily blinded by our own perceptions and instincts.",
    "I learned how to study for intricate multiple choice questions that covered broad concepts.",
    "I learned a bunch about Cognitive Science base knowledge.",
    "I developed a better understanding of ways of describing how the mind works. Especially interesting\/important to me was our discussion of the modularity of the mind, and I found the introduction to fMRI to be intriguing.",
    "This class exposed me to Cognitive Science as a broader field and showed me a bunch of cool illusions. I came in with a background in a lot of what was discussed in class, so I found the broad nature of the course frustrating. That being said, it is an introductory class, and it does a good job of that.",
    "This course provided an introduction to many fields within Cognitive Science, but had a particularly heavy focus on computer science due to the Professor's interest in computer science.",
    "The things we learn about in class are all quite interesting and can be applied outside of class. It provides a new perspective on the world.",
    "I learned a lot of fun facts and think I ended up with many more questions about the mind than I started with.",
    "Taking Cognitive Science helps you see how a number of different disciplines can come together to contribute to a scientific body of knowledge. A lot of this course is about learning principles of the various different cognitive science disciplines and applying them in different contexts to different problems. I wouldn't say that I've learned anything that will stick with me, though.",
    "This course was really helpful in acquiring the skills necessary to read and understand research-level papers.",
    "I developed a fair amount of knowledge on the field of cognitive science. This intro course did a good job of teaching me the basics of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, and helped me better understand the many different theories on how our minds work. This course also sparked my interest in Linguistics which I hope to pursue in future semesters",
    "This second half of this course is really interesting and great!! The first half can be difficult to grasp so make sure you do the readings and pay attention.",
    "I learned a lot about cognitive science, both as a discipline (what it is and why it exists) as well as interesting information that is relevant from many different fields. The first half was dedicated to cognitive science themes and tools, and the second half was about specific applications of cognitive science to things like babies, linguistics, perception, and decision-making.",
    "I learned about how the brain operates in ways of which we are not consciously aware.",
    "I learned in this class how to look at obvious parts of life through a new perspective. Brian Scholl challenged me to look at simple things in my life that I took for granted, such as mundane everyday routines, and question why I did them. This class gave me a more inquisitive look on my life while giving me cool tidbits of information that I can apply to real life.",
    "To realize that I have instinct blindness: lack of access to the subconscious algorithms that our minds make constantly, and to learn the role of cognitive science in uncovering that blindness.",
    "All the knowledge learned was pretty thematic and was about the study of cognitive science itself--about realizing what we don't understand and studying it in interesting ways.",
    "Learned more about the interdisciplinary study of the human mind",
    "I have a general view of different cognitive topics. it is useful for me for technology management and user experience design, it is also useful for my further pursue in AI field.",
    "I learned a crazy amount of information about various fields I'd never had much exposure to before: linguistics, infant cognition, folk psychology, philosophy's impact on cognitive science, language acquisition, etc.",
    "We learned a broad overview of concepts and themes in cognitive science and its research. There was a strong focus on reading papers and articles to explain how the body of knowledge has been developed through research.",
    "I got a decent sense of what the field of Cognitive Science is like and learned a lot about their research methods. I also learned about some specific cognitive processes in more detail. I became much more comfortable reading academic papers.",
    "Basic knowledge of Cognitive Science.",
    "This class taught me so much about the way I process information and the inherent biases I have. Cognitive Science sounds like a weird class because the name is so abstract and unknown and kind of sounds like a pseudoscience, but I honestly could've taken this class in lieu of a therapist. But I didn't because I'm responsible.",
    "This class is very much about learning facts (rather than skills, etc.). I learned some fascinating things about the human mind -- some more interesting than others. First we learned about the general theories about the human mind that guide the way we study it, then we learned methods for studying it, and then we learned some of the applications in various areas like language, reasoning\/decision-making and sex\/attraction.",
    "I learned interesting concepts about how our minds work, got a sampling of the field of cognitive science and the various disciplines that it calls upon, and finally I was exposed to current research in the field and various research methods.",
    "The class was excellent for developing new studying skills and essentially creating a self-understanding in students being newly exposed to how they think, act, and make decisions.",
    "I learned a lot about how the mind works, as well as how to read high level scientific writing.",
    "I learned to appreciate the remarkable complexity of our mental processes and understand the importance and real-world applications of cognitive science, a rapidly emerging field.",
    "I learned the very basic and overarching themes and concepts of the field of cognitive science.",
    "I was really surprised by how much I learned, especially by the amount of depth with which we were able to delve into a number of the subjects, considering this was an intro level course. I got a general feel for cognitive science as a discipline, while also getting the opportunity to delve into specific subjects within cognitive science in greater detail, which I really enjoyed.",
    "I learned more about what we known (and don't know!) about the mind, about how we can go about trying to learn more about it, and why my mind works the way it does.",
    "I learned a lot about the different aspects of cognitive science in general, and some details about specific aspects. However, for much of the course (until I was studying for the midterm and the final) I honestly did not feel like I had learned anything concrete. This class gave me interesting insights on human cognition, morality, and language, but a lot of the details that I learned were from studying for the tests rather than really picking them up in class.",
    "The course gave great insights on how the mind works. It was a great combination of both depth and breadth of cognitive science in general",
    "The methodologies of cognitive science, its interdisciplinary nature, and some incredibly interesting and intellectually rewarding case studies.",
    "I learned about techniques that can be used in cognitive science research, the broad areas that cognitive science can be used in, and the underlying concepts important in all those areas.",
    "An authentic appreciation of the complexity of the human mind and all that is left to be explored of it. You don't get weeded down by the detailed science but rather focus on the fascinating effects and implications of many brain processes.",
    "I learned a lot about how the human mind works and the complex ways in which it both succeeds and fails to interpret information from the world correctly.",
    "I learned a whole lot about Cognitive Science. It was un-fucking-believable.",
    "-Better and faster note-taking -This was my first big lecture class ever, so I had to be more autonomous in my learning than ever before - I learned a lot from writing the thought paper",
    "I look back on this class and honestly do not know what I learned. Aside from learning how to film birds for documentaries (you get them to imprint on the little plane), all I have are a bunch of buzzwords and a few vague concepts in each of about 20 areas. I know one lecture's worth of psychology, one worth of computer science, one worth of linguistics, and so on. The way the course is designed is as a very broad overview of cognitive science as a discipline and all the topics that you could study within. The whole point of the course was that cognitive science was interdisciplinary, and that you needed all of the disciplines to inform each other, and yet very few of the disparate topics in the class were actually linked together in any way. That said, you will learn some cool facts about birds, and I'm still thinking about the lecture on attraction almost two weeks later. At the end of the last lecture, a boy sitting in front of me quietly said, \"What the fuck did we learn in this class...\" And that was the most accurate assessment I could give of why exactly it wasn't great. I know some fun facts about birds and attraction and I can explain visual illusions, but I do not think I needed to spend an entire semester at Yale learning that.",
    "This course provided a nice overview of the field of Cognitive Science. I found the lectures on attraction, cognition, and attention\/perception to be the most interesting, although the actual course covered much more than that. Throughout, the course not only taught me how to question certain principles and look for exceptions but also how to properly read research papers in the field and think critically about them.",
    "I learned a lot about the mind and the way it works, as well as a lot of theories and case studies.",
    "Thinking about the social sciences in an analytical sense and seeing how topics like computer science and neuroscience factor into the study of the mind. This was one of the coolest and most enlightening classes in terms of how I see myself\/others.",
    "I gained a lot of knowledge as to how the mind works and why that is. I gained insights into the many areas in which the mind is flawed, from visual perception to decision-making, as well as the flaws in the ways we study the mind.",
    "I think that part of this is due to the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science and the fact that this is a survey course, but I felt that I came out of this class with a lot of random facts and case studies that, although they were very interesting, didn't represent any real knowledge or skills that I had learned. However, this course did make me more familiar with reading scientific papers, and I do feel that I now have more of an understanding of how the mind works.",
    "Inter-disciplinary knowledge and more about what cognitive science is and how research is done. I feel like I am able to use the knowledge to make sense of real-world issues like sensationalist news reporting, optical illusions etc. It has also given me an appreciation for how fascinating the mind is.",
    "I gained a greater appreciation for the brain and a greater understanding of it's processes and complexities.",
    "I now have a much better appreciation of the mind and its processes.",
    "This course provided me with an overview of some of the fundamental theories and methodologies which contribute to the field of Cognitive Science. Since taking this course, I have gone through the process of applying to two different laboratories on campus, and each time I chose an experiment undertaken by that laboratory and discussed potential additions to the line of research or follow-up studies. Both times I was able to use insights that I had gained in Intro to Cognitive Science. I believe that my ability to apply the things I have learned in the classroom indicates the quality of this course.",
    "No new skills, frankly. Almost purely memorization and regurgitation.",
    "Gained a good overview of cognitive science concepts. Learned interesting factoids about tricks our mind plays on us.",
    "My first social science course at Yale. It was definitely very interesting. I think that it was a more enjoyable class than Intro Psychology, as instead of adhering to a textbook, we spent the vast majority of the class reading really interesting papers, that allowed us to see what actual studies in this field look liked.",
    "Gained a broad understanding of what cognitive science is. Familiarized with major topics of study in the field.",
    "I liked how this class taught a variety of approaches to understanding the mind. This class showed how blind we are to many aspects of our nature (instinct blindness) and how to use various disciplines to understand more about the mind. I also learned how to read a scientific paper and learn things from it without knowing much about the topic begin discussed.",
    "The most important skill that this class helped me to develop was how to see connections between things and understand the deeper\/global implications of scientific studies. Because cognitive science is an interdisciplinary course, it requires that you make connections between different modes of study. You have to know how to take something that may seem unrelated to what you're studying and see the implications of it to what you are studying. This is a valuable skill for when I am doing research and having to evaluate how other sources could apply to my own research.",
    "I learned a lot about the way the mind operates",
    "I had previously never even heard of the field Cognitive Science so this class was a perfect introduction to the subject. I learned about many different aspects of the mind that I had never really considered before and we dove deeper into features that I always took for granted.",
    "My mind was blown 2-3 times every lecture. Course was extremely dense in insight.",
    "I learned about how different disciplines such as, linguistics, robotics, philosophy, computer science, neuroscience, and psychology, can be applied to the study of the mind. Another insight I acquired is that we really don't know that much about the mind and that there is a lot of opportunity in this field. Personally, I discovered that cognitive science is not for me.",
    "Re: knowledge - a refreshing point of view on how to rethink our day to day thought processes. Learning about the limitations of the human mind was oddly reassuring; at the same time, learning about the vast, unplumbed mysteries of the human mind was entertaining, exciting, and inspiring. Re: skills - I learned how to skillfully skim readings, especially scientific research papers.",
    "I really look at the world in a different way now and am much more analytical. Nothing is (or should be) taken for face value. Overtime, I became familiar with how to read dense research papers and understood how to better study for tests in a college setting.",
    "The class was a really effective introduction to a lot of topics within the field and furthered my interest in pursuing the major.",
    "A broad-based, fascinating tour of topics and themes in cognitive science.",
    "I learned how to be more punctual and efficient in this class. The class taught me a lot about the theory of the mind.",
    "I learned a lot about the interdisciplinary nature of the mind. Through this course, I got a better understanding of why we make the decisions we do, how we perceive the world, and what cognitive science really is.",
    "Cognitive Science",
    "I learned that it takes many disciplines to really understand the brain and how it functions. Though this notion never really interested me until halfway through the course, once it did, this class became quite fascinating.",
    "I learned a little bit about the basics of cognitive science and how to study in a lecture class in which the content is not very cohesive.",
    "Intro to Cognitive Science has given me a working understanding of the field. I have a better sense of cognitive scientists goals and the methods used to achieve them. I also learned about cognitive sciences component disciplines, and about how cognitive science depends on insights drawn from many fields. The case studies we learned about in class were also fascinating. The course was extremely well taught, and I am sorry that we didnt have time to cover more of them.",
    "Came to really understand what cogsci is and the roles various disciplines play in developing it; learned a lot of how the human mind works and is studied",
    "I learned a lot about the brain that I knew nothing about before taking this class. As far as skills go, I learned how helpful group study is in order to fully understand difficult concepts.",
    "The course was an overview of some case studies in cognitive science that demonstrated theories in the field. It looked not only at theories and concepts in cognitive science, but the methods used to uncover those concepts.",
    "My note-taking skills progressed as I had to learn to synthesize material at a fast pace as Professor Scholl ran through material very quickly.",
    "This class was a great survey of cognitive science. I learned to question how I think about minds and gained a greater appreciation for how scientific studies can fundamentally change the way we think about ourselves. Due to the size of the lecture, I did not learn the writing skills and discussion skills that come with a seminar setting, but rather focused on the material and big picture questions.",
    "I gained a general ida of what cognitive science is and learned some of the principles that govern the investigation of the mind.",
    "I took so much away from this course. Generally speaking, I have a much better understanding of what Cognitive Science *is* as a result of taking this class, and I am very excited about all the possibilities for future research in this field. More specifically, I feel like I would be able to give a layperson a pretty acceptable mini-lecture on various subjects we covered, such as the cognitive science of sex, love, and attraction, infant cognition, and language acquisition.",
    "Knowledge 1. How the mind works 2. Computer science 3. Linguistics 4. Neuroscience 5. Perception 6. Game Theory Skills 1. Experimental design and empirical analysis Insights 1. Very broad and surface understanding of multiple disciplines",
    "I learned that the simple mental processes that happen in our everyday lives are often much more complicated than we think. The mind is much more complicated than we perceive it to be and I should be aware of how my biases affect how I see the world.",
    "I learned a lot about the investigative process into the brain, the most recent discoveries of the field, and part of the process of how the brain operates.",
    "I really learned how to communicate information and my own personal knowledge in a nuanced and sophisticated manner. Initially I was able to regurgitate answers on homework or exams, but this course really taught me to go to the next level and really actively dive into the material so that I both understand it better and can answer questions about the information to the best of my ability. I also gained more insights about human nature and cognition; this course taught me to look at the mundane things and actions in life that I often take for granted and reexamine them to discover that they are not as simple as commonly thought.",
    "As a freshman, I wasn't used to reading so much. I think cog sci had a more than reasonable course load that helped transition me out of high school and into more academically rigorous environments.",
    "The complexity and nature of the mind, and the attempts to understand it, are the focus areas for CGSC 110; above all, I gained insight in the variety of fields that cooperate to form new questions about the mind and develop new techniques in order to have a clearer sense of how and why we acquire language and do or do not perceive visual inputs, for example. Guest lectures revealed the many opportunities for research.",
    "I learned several things about the human mind and how it works as well as recent discoveries in the field of cognitive science. Many of the concepts I acquired are applicable in everyday life such as the reasoning behind peoples decisions.",
    "I had a overview of cognitive science and its topics of study. I realized that cognitive science is even more diverse than I had thought.",
    "This class teaches you a lot about the mind from a very interdisciplinary perspective. You learn to think about what you know and challenge these insights. You are tasked with thinking about what you learn, in order to write a 8 page thought paper. Through this class, you learn to understand yourself.",
    "Gained experience reading actual academic papers in a lot of different fields, from robotics to linguistics to philosophy, as a result of the interdisciplinary nature of cognitive science. Learned a general overview of the themes of cognitive science as well as some more specific methods and questions pursued.",
    "The workings behind cognition. How the brain works. How to take notes for a large lecture course.",
    "Well I learned a ton about how our minds work. And how to diagram a turing machine",
    "I learned what cognitive science is, why it is important, and a lot of interesting theories about how the mind works.",
    "Intro cogsci taught me to think about the mind and how we experience the world differently.",
    "I got very good at reading lengthy and dense scientific texts and weeding out the information that I didn't need to know.",
    "This course was a broad survey of the field of cognitive science. I learned about the disciplines, domains, and methods\/tools that constitute the science. In class and through the readings, we covered topics from Marr's three levels to modularity to linguistics and beyond.",
    "I learned about a lot of worldly phenomena and their inner workings along, from the little things to the grand incredible ones.",
    "I gained an intro to the methodological approach of cognitive science and the depth\/breadth of study the discipline encompasses. An interesting survey of the related fields that comprise cognitive science!",
    "I learned a lot about the way the mind works from a broad standpoint.",
    "Gained knowledge on diverse topics related to cognitive science that I see present in everyday situations.",
    "I learned about different concepts in Cognitive Science, as well as discoveries that have been made in the various disciplines of Cognitive Science.",
    "A broader understanding of the cognitive sciences, and an interest in the general subject matter.",
    "I learned a lot about how the mind works, its complex mechanisms and concepts such as instinct blindness.",
    "You definitely learn a lot in this class. Each day is basically something new. In the beginning it gets a bit overwhelming, but at the end, you will be able to summarize all of the material by topics like perception, cognitive architecture, etc.",
    "I got a very basic intro to linguistics, neuroscience, and psychology, which was a pretty good deal for one course.",
    "I learned a wide range of things under the umbrella of cognitive science. I also worked on the skill of skimming long scientific papers for relevant information",
    "I felt this was an excellent course and a terrific foundation for Cognitive Science. The course splits the balance extremely well between depth and breadth. No matter your major there will be a topic of interest to you. The concepts covered are very interesting and are applicable in many different fields and in everyday life as well.",
    "Learned the basics and some experimental results of cognitive science.",
    "It was definitely a helpful overview of brain science, and got me thinking about various important topics in the cognitive field. Certain parts of the course, especially in the latter half, were also very widely applicable to how we view the real world.",
    "This course gave a really great overview of the many various routes one could take in studying Cognitive Science. I feel it truly explored the larger concepts that connect several quote different fields of research, while also giving a fair amount of detail of current studies and their implications.",
    "Course has a diversified range of topics including vision, perception, decision-making, etc. Besides talking about the mysteries of the mind, the course explores different concepts from economics, biology and computer science that help us think about cognitive science.",
    "I gained a very solid survey of what Cognitive Science does, and how it does it, as well as current research inquiries and critiques against them. I learned the powerful insight that Cognitive Science is guided less by a method of study than by a goal of understanding the mind that uses whichever methods it can. I also learned about a conception of the mind as computational and modular that makes it actually feasible to study scientifically.",
    "I learned a lot of interesting concepts and insights from a lot of different fields. The whole point of this course was to better understand a little from multiple different fields of cognitive science, and I must say I did enjoy it quite a bit. In fact, I would even dare to say this was may favorite course of the semester.",
    "I learned a lot of information about various aspects of cognitive science while taking this course. I definitely liked the last section of the class the best (we discussed some of the DOMAINS of cognitive science like perception, attention, and decision-making). It was definitely a good class for figuring out what you do and don't like to learn about. I realized that I wasn't a huge linguistics fan, for instance. I also learned how to manage my time for a course structured like this (nightly readings and responses). One of major takeaways was that cognitive science is all around us, and I do see aspects of the class in my daily life.",
    "Better understanding about what cognitive science is and what it's aim is.",
    "I learned a lot about cognitive science at a general level",
    "For the most part, I expanded my understanding of what cognitive science entails, and the many aspects of life, learning, and behavior that it touches on. So much stuff.",
    "I learned basic concepts in cognitive science, including the exploration of nature vs. nurture, perception, attention, and the cognitive science of infants.",
    "I think my biggest takeaway is about the discipline of cognitive science itself. There are so many different approaches to understanding how the mind works.",
    "I thought that the course emphasized and taught observation, since a lot of the concepts discussed could be witnessed in real life if we were to pay attention to them. The course also required reading research papers and articles and responding to them, as well as writing a final paper at the end, so it helped develop skills relevant in the social sciences and sciences. Good overview to cognitive science as a whole, but did not go in depth in any particular field."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lecture was taught very well; however, at times it took too long to actually begin each lecture. There were too many announcements at the beginning of class which cut out 10 mins of lecture each class period. So my suggestion would be to cut back on those announcements and rely on other means of disseminating that information! Overall, it was an interesting course with incredible breadth.",
    "The course should have less readings and a more specific syllabus. I think there should have been a textbook.",
    "Because it was a big lecture it was tough to engage and the only feedback we received during the class was a grade on our midterm.",
    "The lecture is incredibly disorganized, and Scholl goes on incredibly long tangents (the worst of which was a 30 minute explanation of why every book on consciousness was bad, complete with a full tour of their names). These tangents are sometimes entertaining, but also suck massive amounts of time up, so when he says things like \"we're not gonna be able to get to all this other interesting stuff\" towards the end of the class, those tangents become irritating and disappointing. Grades on the paper were not received before the final exam, which makes it so no specific feedback on our understanding of the course material was introduced before the exam. The exams were given pre-named, which meant a massive line formed at the door before the lecture. Scholl told us we could arrive early in order to beat the line in, and so people started lining up as early as 20 minutes before class time to get in, and those people would get significantly more time to complete the exam. I understand the thought behind pre-naming exams, but there's no reason this is the only class at Yale that gets to require kids to show up 20 minutes early in order to receive an advantage over the rest of the class, especially when some people are coming from other classes and so could not arrive at the same time as those with freer schedules. Extra credit was given one day in class based on students self-reporting their performance in a game, several of whom very obviously could not have gotten the scores they did without someone deliberately tanking. This is fine just to get a sense of what the game is like, but when Scholl tells the class beforehand there's going to be extra credit, people are going to lie. Grading seems bizarrely distributed. The paper topics are hardly topics at all, and a lack of any type of rubric made it difficult to gauge what was or was not worth including in the paper. This kind of paper also lends itself especially well to TF variance, which is atrocious for equitable grade distribution and consistency within the class. More generally, lectures were very focused, and it was often easy to lose sight of the broader themes we were supposed to be talking about in the class. Reminders a little more frequently would be helpful.",
    "Professor Scholl wasted time during a lot of the lectures, and always kept us late after class. The class was challenging, but it covered a lot of material in a short amount of time.",
    "Weakness is its huge class size. Strength: I appreciated the guest lecturers!",
    "It was rather broad and general, so that although we covered a good deal of material, I felt like I hadn't learned that much actual substance. Maybe that's because this is an intro course, but it still felt like we failed to go in depth on most topics.",
    "The strength of this course is Professor Scholl. He gives incredibly interesting lectures in a very well organized way that makes you see how interdisciplinary cognitive science is. He goes through lecture pretty quickly, which can make it hard to understand concepts right off the bat, but he will usually supplement this by sending emails to explain things, holding frequent office hours, answering questions in class, or directing students towards TAs or other resources. Also, the TA's are wonderful. It's a poorly organized course though. It's hard to know how to prepare for tests, or in general the type of thinking that is necessary to approach them.",
    "This course was engaging, enjoyable, and taught a surprising amount of material. It really fosters interest in the field of cognitive science. However, the biggest weakness was probably that we did not keep to schedule (especially towards the last few weeks of the semester, where we almost never finished a full lecture...)",
    "I think it was hard to get a deeper understanding of the material because the course is so broad in scope. I think adding sections to the course might help aid this issue.",
    "Strengths: Material is well taught and interesting; Professor Scholl is very passionate about what he teaches Weaknesses: Sometimes there is too much information crammed into one lecture, making it hard to follow along",
    "This course was really awesome, and it had many more strengths than weaknesses. Strengths include the reading responses, which I thought were a very fair way to motivate doing the reading with a little bit of forgiveness (and the readings were another strength! Usually a very fair amount, and always interesting and\/or relevant to the course.) The exams were great too, with a mixture of broad and specific questions, both in class and both covering only 1\/2 the material. I liked how broad the paper was, although I personally should have talked to my TF for more guidance. The TFs were another strength of the course, they were all amazing and the review sessions they led were great. The professor was also a strength, he was funny and knowledgeable and helpful.",
    "Its Strength is its breadth, its weakness is its depth.",
    "With regards to strengths, I believe that this course did well in presenting a wide range of introductory material, covering a wide breadth of the material studied in cognitive science. I felt that the knowledge was very applicable to real life and I felt that Brian was a great lecturer (albeit coming off as self-centered at times, he did well in making the class more than just a mundane monologue). With regards to weakness, I believe that the class' main flaw was its impersonal nature; I would not have minded having to attend section (or at least have it be an option, as is the case with other large classes such as Econ), because I felt that, although the material was interesting, that I was unable to engage with the content fully.",
    "Strength: Breadth: we went through many aspects of the cognitive science Weakness: Spent too much class time on linguistics' case assignment. Should have spent the time to cover more topics in cognitive science.",
    "The lectures are fun and interesting, but are difficult to parse what information is important to memorize, and what is meant to illustrate topics. The paper, exams, and reading questions are all very fair.",
    "Strengths: engaging, well-prepared Weaknesses: big, strange procedure causes delays in entering the room on exam days",
    "Brian and all the TAs are so dedicated to the job. I got lots of help from them. If I can have a memo of every lecture keypoints since no textbook available, it will be helpful as I am a reader type of learner. the slide shared sometimes did not include all.",
    "Informationally, this course provides a fantastic overview of the general topics cognitive science covers, why, and to what degree. The structure was conducive to the type of material being taught. My only point of criticism would be the numerous times when the professor spent time on things that weren't exactly...productive.",
    "Strengths: Very well organized, clear structure Engaging lectures Not an excessive workload No textbook Weaknesses: Some topics not explained fully in lecture Too many topic covered, so they were less in-depth No feedback for final paper",
    "The strength of the course is how well it exposes you to the field. It gives one a good idea of whether or not they are interested in cognitive science. The weakness is how big the lecture is and that it isn't very personal, but you can always go to your TA's office hours with questions.",
    "I feel like Prof. School tends to teach his view of cognitive science rather than simply giving an introduction to the cognitive science field in general; maybe make the course seem less biased?",
    "The teacher has been teaching this class for many years, and the class is really good!",
    "Scholl is a great lecturer\/entertainer. There's a flourish to his slides and the way he paces the class. The tangents that he goes on are all planned (they are IN his slides), but it somehow ties back into the course material. It's very evident that he's done this class many times before, but it hasn't lessened his excitement for the material. This course was really Scholl. But with the student submitted reading questions and the essay, there was no feedback beforehand. There were sample essay questions, but I think devoting a couple of minutes in class to go over organization and structure would have been very helpful. Also there was no feedback with the reading questions afterwards. It is a large class though, but if someone really missed the point of a reading, I don't know how they would've been corrected.",
    "Strengths: Prof. Scholl is a fantastic lecturer and keeps you engaged the whole time. Weaknesses: Every time lecture ended, while I had been really interested during it, I usually realized that what I learned was not particularly helpful to my life and other interests. I think this could be improved if lecture included more of the \"why is this important\" aspect. (I know this is the purpose of our final papers, but in the papers we only look at one topic so they don't fix this problem.)",
    "I know the class is an intro class, but in a sense I felt that it was too intro-y and I would have liked to delve deeper into real science. Also, the most creative and thought provoking stuff was thinking if experimental setups, and how to isolate exactly what you're investigating. If more of that kind of thinking could be integrated into the course, that would be super cool.",
    "The greatest weakness of this course was the that Scholl's presentation slides had little to no information on them, making it incredibly difficult to study and understand key concepts in depth, considering we did not have a textbook.",
    "This class is engaging, but poorly organized. There are not enough resources available to students to gain further understanding of the material covered in lecture and in readings.",
    "Some of the lectures did not fit together very well, and I wish we had been able to get through a bit more content. I think that having a section, if possible, would be very good to help us see how the course fits together.",
    "The course did a fantastic job of making cognitive science relatable and exciting. Professor Scholl brought relentless enthusiasm to every topic we discussed, connected each topic to fascinating real world examples, and showed the incredible variety of areas for potential future study. I think of the course as a \"hook\" into cognitive science more than anything else. On the other hand, I often found the lectures were presented in a manner that was difficult to process. I wish the slides contained clearer \"core concepts\" that we had time to discuss at length. I often felt I could remember a few anecdotal examples from the class but had trouble articulating the scope of what I was learning.",
    "The nature of the topics were very interesting and as a result allowed for more engagement (especially the in-class exercises), but the final paper was not the best idea. It was hard to understand why it was assigned and felt like \"busy work.\"",
    "There is a lot of assigned reading. I did fine in the course while mostly just focusing on the readings for which reading questions were assigned, however, I feel that perhaps if there was a bit less reading on the syllabus overall, perhaps I would have been more inclined to try and read it all! I think a major strength of this class is that though it was huge in size, it felt small. Professor Scholl's casual but informative and engaging lecture style gave the class a more seminar-like feel, which I really enjoyed, and which kept me paying attention.",
    "Strengths- Low workload, interesting topics (for the most part), low maintenance class Weakness- No sections, so some students may find it hard to be engaged by learning through two lectures a week (somewhat curable through going to office hours)",
    "This course was interesting and fun, although it seemed very vague and abstract rather often (I frequently found myself wondering what I was actually learning in class). The readings were interesting and varied, and gave a good look at academic research papers, but I think any kind of regularity and concreteness that a textbook (or one textbook-like excerpt for each topic) could give would be helpful. A common thread among the readings would help keep them in context and keep track of what the important points were from each group of readings.",
    "The biggest weakness of the course is the size of the class, which limits interaction between the professor and students.",
    "The only weakness I think is the size of the class. A class of 300-ish people cannot be very personal and interactive. I don't know if it's possible but I really wish to see this class become more like a seminar kind of thing, and if there are too many students enrolling in this class why don't they take a lottery just like what they do for MATH 120?? And divide students into sections??",
    "The topic material was very engaging, but I think it could be improved by introducing the more real world applications sooner. Dr. Scholl has a background in vision science, which is where most of the real world examples came from. However, if you are not as interested in that side of cognitive science, the beginning of the course was harder to be engaged with. Using examples from other topics earlier would have been helpful.",
    "Excellent lectures that were extremely engaging. The readings were interesting and relevant to the class. You get what you put into this course, allowing you to engages as much or little as you want with the material. I would like to see increased real world connections to the ideas discussed, even though there are already a significant amount.",
    "The content was overall pretty interesting!",
    "Strength of this course is in Scholl's lecturing.",
    "-We were behind in the material because I think the class got easily side tracked in lectures",
    "I think a major strength of the course is that there was no textbook. Reading actual scientific articles made much more sense to me for a class that was about how all sorts of scientific disciplines inform each other and teach us how the mind works. Instead of reading a summary of the research in a dull textbook, we read the actual studies and conclusions firsthand. Many of the readings were very interesting, especially the non-scientific articles intended for public readership and the more scientific ones that explained everyday human behavior phenomena that I would never otherwise think about. That said, a weakness of the course in this regard was that readings were often tangential to what we were actually learning in the course because it was incredibly unorganized. We often fell several lectures behind the syllabus, meaning that what we had been assigned to read had no actual relevance to what we were learning in class. I think it could be improved by staying more on task (not trying to \"finish things up\" the next class and falling even more behind, and many fewer tangents in class). The class was also too much of an overview to get anything out of many of the topics. In theory, this makes sense you get a little taste of each of the facets of cognitive science and want to learn more. Instead, it felt like we were getting some nitty-gritty facts about each aspect but not really enough to form any sort of conclusions with. The two exceptions to this were the guest lectures both Laurie Santos and Scaz gave incredible lectures on each of their disciplines (animal cognition and robotics in cognitive science) that gave a great overview of research in the area and how this applied to our understanding of cognition. I left both of those lectures wanting to study what they were studying and believing that they were on the forefront of studying the mind. I found that much more relevant for a course in intro to cognitive science than being able to explain a specific study about bees or assign case to verb phrases in a grammatically incorrect sentence. Maybe case assignment would have made more sense if we had spent more than one hour learning about why it was important to linguistics, but that was not the case (no pun intended). I also had no interaction with my teaching fellow or professor, which would usually be a bad thing in a course where you need to learn material and use what you've learned. However, in this course that wasn't a problem, because we did not learn anything, we were just fed a bunch of information, which we then regurgitated for a multiple choice and short answer test. I've taken other overview courses at Yale where the entire final grade is based off of only exams, but have never just memorized and spit out lectures.",
    "Strengths of the course included the fact that it is engaging material that is accessible for an audience of students that may have never had cog sci experience. I enjoyed the reading questions as well as the guest lecturers. A weakness was that the material sometimes felt rushed, and it might more properly be taught with an extra class per week.",
    "I really like all of the material taught, it was just said too quickly for me to take good notes.",
    "I wish the TFs would hold sessions outside of class to talk more about the topics since many of the case studies went by very quickly, or, there was some way to have smaller discussion sections.",
    "I really enjoyed the concepts taught in this course, as well as the order and style in which they were taught. I would have enjoyed more opportunities outside of the two examinations and paper to apply the material I have learned myself. It often felt as if I were blindly absorbing information, which led to feeling overwhelmed in preparing for the exam.",
    "The strength of this course was that the lectures were very informative and understandable. If this course has a weakness it would be that not all of the readings seem to be directly related to course themes.",
    "The class is incredibly interesting, keeping my attention more than any class has before. The work, though relatively tame, was engaging and effective, and even the paper presented an opportunity to forge your own paths and satisfy your own interests.",
    "The material is very interesting, and Professor Scholl really knows his stuff. However, our classes were often interrupted because students were encouraged to ask questions. Of course, some questions helped the entire class, but most did not. Perhaps next time this course is taught, it might be helpful to limit questions to a maximum of 10 minutes. (30 minutes of questions is simply too much!)",
    "I loved that this course provided an overview of basic themes and concepts essential to the field of cognitive science while also providing in-depth analysis of particular case-studies in order to enrich the experience. I think this is the ideal structure for an introductory level course and I would not change this element of the course whatsoever. The only suggestion I have relates to the midterm. I felt extremely prepared for the midterm in the sense that I had studied, understood, and retained all of the relevant information. However, I wish that I had been more familiar with the style of the exam questions. Specifically, my tendency was to provide too much detail and too many examples when answering the questions, when I should have been writing much more concise answers. I wish that the course had included at least one quiz or test prior to the midterm that included questions of a similar style to those on the midterm and final.",
    "The course has a lot of interesting material to work with and Professor Scholl is visibly passionate about the subject, but it feels very disjointed and more like we are learning about cool things we've discovered about the mind, now actually how the mind works.",
    "Making the instructions for the paper more clear - and probably changing the prompt honestly. It was really. to connect the prompt to what we were learning in class.",
    "I think the strength and weakness of this course are one and the same. The course presents us with very interesting topics about the mind. Each of these topics were quite interesting, and being able to read the actual literature definitely made me feel like I was learning the most up to date information about these topics. However, because we learn so many interesting things, in a way the course seems to lack a unifying framework. Everything we learn is related to the mind, but there isn't necessarily a strong force that brings the whole course together.",
    "Strengths: engaging material and lectures Needs Improvement: organization within lectures, more feedback about learning throughout the course",
    "The course was very interesting and lecture was never boring (especially with Professor Scholl), and the tests were good at assessing understanding of the material. Some of the readings were a bit long and didn't necessarily lead to a better understanding of the material discussed in class afterward. The midterm paper might be improved if the prompt were different.",
    "As the professor noted, the greatest weakness of this class is not having a discussion section where we could talk about what we were studying. I think having one could improve the class, but I understand that as of this date, that is not possible. The strength of this class as an introductory course is its balance between breadth and depth. I felt as though we learned about a lot of different aspects of cognitive science, but studied them in a deep enough way to really understand them.",
    "This course is a great broad overview of cognitive science and it was strengthened by demonstrations and the use of specific examples to demonstrate concepts. However I really thought there were meant to be sections to accompany the lecture, or at least some kind of meeting that reinforced what was learned in class.",
    "Strengths: The material was fucking fascinating Weaknesses: I wish the course was longer",
    "Because it was a lecture, I sometimes found it difficult to focus during class. At times, it felt as if class just kept on dragging on. It didn't help either that the lighting in the auditorium we were in was less than ideal. The professor likes to plan tangents to go off to during lecture which is sometimes funny, but also a little annoying. However, the material we studied was very interesting, especially when it involved in class activities. The first half of the semester focused more on theoretical and literal ways to look at how our minds work. This was sometimes difficult to grasp, but the second half of the semester was much more engaging and involved actual ways in which our minds work.",
    "This course did very well in terms of keeping me engaged during lectures; however, I tended to have very ambivalent reactions to the reading responses, often finding them tedious or unrelated to the material. Perhaps integrating the material of the readings more smoothly into the lecture (or having forums on which we could discuss the reading responses) could be more helpful.",
    "I learned a lot of interesting information in this course about how our minds work, but it seemed somewhat disjointed at times. I'm not sure if this is because it is a survey class and necessarily jumps from topic to topic or because of the nature of cognitive science itself.",
    "The class has really good content but sometimes it feels scattered as it can get unclear as to what fits into a certain umbrella, and can therefore make it hard to study and learn.",
    "As usual for a lecture class, material was well organized but there was little room for personal input and the exchange of ideas.",
    "The course has a relatively low work load and some of the second half of the class's topics were pretty interesting. However, the content was sometimes conflicting and there were many readings that weren't really necessary for the class.",
    "This class covers really interesting applications of cognitive science, but not until the end. The first half of the class feels abstract, and while it may be necessary for a foundational understanding of cognitive science, I felt as if that section of the class could be made more engaging. That being said, Professor Scholl did a good job of providing real-world examples of these abstract ideas. However, it would have been great if the second half of the class, which more specifically covered applications, could be expanded. It felt as if we rushed through big concepts like reasoning, morality, and love, despite the many interesting cognitive science topics inherent in them.",
    "It was a good course! However, WHY are most of the posted lecture slides empty??? Can they please look like the slides we see during lecture?? This made studying much more difficult, even though I went to EVERY single lecture and took notes. However, if my notes said \"the color illusion indicates blank\" I couldn't see what said illusion looks like when studying, making it more difficult to understand the concepts.",
    "I personally did not particularly like how the paper was structured - it seemed a little bit too open ended for my taste. Also the TAs for the most part were appallingly bad. I don't usually like to write negative reviews of professors and TAs, but this was something else. At the review sessions it became all too apparent that the TAs simply did not not know the material. They argued in front of us about the proper way to define a concept without bothering to clarify and answer the original question. When one question was asked, a certain male TA suggested that we \"just go google it,\" then proceeded to read out the first result from google incomprehensibly fast. In fact, I often found myself far more confused after leaving the review sessions than before.",
    "The lectures could be a little more structured.",
    "Strengths: Interesting lectures, great professor, readily accessible teaching fellows Weakness: The readings. They were often either too long and\/or boring. Professor Scholl mentioned he does not like textbooks, but I think more interesting readings should be assigned, since direct questions from the readings were on the first exam in particular.",
    "The strength of this class resides solely in its content the mind is truly interesting and appealing to a wide variety of people. However, the material jumps around and does not follow a clear narrative. The structure of the class is very weak, and could be improved with a weekly section. Additionally, Professor School intentionally makes vague slides to confuse students who dont attend lecture, but this ends up confusing students who do attend lecture and struggle to write down essentially everything he says, given that anything he mentions in class is fair game for the exams. Your grade in the class is based entirely off these ridiculous exams ridiculous because they are both vague and obscure, based on content that literally doesnt exist because of how Professor Scholl structures the class. Also, the readings are pretty random and there are too many.",
    "The course lectures are engaging, and the reading selections were great. I also liked the case study format, and I think it provides a better introduction than sacrificing breadth for depth. However, I think that they should hand back work in class instead of requiring a special TF appointment. (My TFs office hours were during another class.) I would also like to have another essay. I really enjoyed the one we did, and it helped me clarify my thoughts.",
    "Really entertaining lectures, interesting readings, very manageable homework that added to in-class learning, large amount of diverse information well-taught in such a short time",
    "The strengths of the course is that most of the time, it was very interesting and relevant to my daily life. However, the weaknesses of the course were a lack of structure in the daily lectures, limited\/partial information included on the uploaded slides, and sometimes very irrelevant information discussed.",
    "Strengths: Interesting material taught in an engaging way by Professor Scholl. The class is organized rather well in terms of topics. Weaknesses: Somewhat annoying how often we couldn't finish lectures, but it's nice that this was taken into account when composing the exams. The exams, however, were completely disorganized... The lining up procedure is completely unnecessary and unfair. Some people actually have classes beforehand and can't come early, giving some people way more time on their exams than others. It was better the second exam than the first but still an issue that should be addressed nevertheless. Moreover, I think this class should consider three exams like Psych because there really is a lot of material that is covered and if the exams are going to be annoyingly tricky, then they could at least have less weight attributed to each of them. The essay was also weirdly timed and came up unexpectedly, and more guidance would have been appreciated. To be clear, I am quite satisfied with the grade I received but still wish this class was less strict and overly \"professional\" for an intro class.",
    "This course was highly unstructured and offered no opportunities for the students to participate, whether in lecture or in a separate section. It often felt very disjointed and it was difficult to see how the topics related to one another. However, it was a broad survey as promised, and we were exposed to a multitude of fields in cognitive science. The class would be greatly improved if more effort was made to structure the course and offer sections so that students could engage with the material more directly outside of lecture given how large the class is.",
    "The course gave a good overview of cognitive science, but at times I wish there was a little more depth in certain areas. The reading responses were sometimes tedious and I wished there was more guidance on the final paper. Also Powerpoint slides were unreliable when trying to study off of them for tests.",
    "The course presented diverse material under the umbrella of big themes. I could see such a broad swath of topics getting jumbled, disorganized, and hard to follow, but Professor Scholl did a good job of relating topics to each other and making it fairly cohesive. He was always prepared for lecture and made sure to keep expectations clear.",
    "The lectures are very engaging and interesting. Brian Scholl and the TFs are very approachable and willing to help. I cannot think of any weaknesses of this course.",
    "I feel that that the course is quite \"showy\" I often feel as though Cognitive Science is being marketed rather than taught. I feel this way because we focus on certain phenomena and then discuss them but we skip over anything that initially seem less attractive.",
    "Overall, this course has a lot of strengths! I like how thorough the lectures were and how easy it was to be well-organized in the class. (The slides helped significantly with this). Although we covered a wide variety of topics throughout the course, I never felt like we sacrificed depth so much that I couldn't say very much about a given topic. I also really enjoyed the guest lectures-- these added variety to the class, as well as a sneak peek into other wonderful work done at Yale. Really, the one weakness that I can think of right off the bat is the venue for the class! I often left class so frustrated at myself because the warm, dark, room with cushy seats made me a little sleepier than I would have liked during the lectures. Had the course been held in a bright lecture hall, I think I would have enjoyed the lectures a bit more! This should be a relatively easy fix, luckily.",
    "Strengths: Awesome lecture, reading responses make sure we stay engaged Weakness: None really",
    "Strengths 1. Broad coverage of multiple disciplines 2. Interesting readings 3. Final paper that is broad and own topic Weaknesses 1. Superficial understanding of the broad disciplines 2. Very large lecture course - difficult to stay engaged",
    "Since it's a large lecture and a lot of information to take in, kindly consider discussion sections for this course as that would really help with the understanding and retention of what is being taught.",
    "We had to skip over a lot of material and end sessions late because the lectures started late and were not well timed. The demos in lecture were infrequent, but were cool and helpful for learning the material. The system for entering the room for exams also slowed things down.",
    "The lecture run a little too loose - we lose a lot of time in lecture. However, the material is engaging and interesting for the most part.",
    "Strengths: - The subject material covered in the course; a wide range of topics were covered creating wide variety in the material discussed - The use of scientific articles in the class - The number of review sessions (two before each exam) was very helpful Weaknesses: - Only using scientific articles (while they were often engaging and gave me a lot of information, sometimes I did wish we used some sort of textbook for the class as the articles could get confusing at times) - Possibly limiting the amount of topics intended to be covered throughout the course of the semester; although there was great diversity in the amount of topics, I think there were a few too many, as we had to rush through some topics in order to get to others, which didn't allow for acquisition of as much information as possible",
    "The lectures were always engaging and varied; these were the entirety of the course outside of the readings and were its definite strength. The readings did not overlap the lectures much and were equally interesting; combined, I got a sense of the many ways cognitive science attempts to understand the brain with computer science, linguistics, and scientific methodologies. I suppose the weakness of the class is its introductory nature and that it is impossible to go into great depth in any one topic. Yet this, to me, is not a weakness, but part of its nature and what makes it a comprehensive and invigorating class- it shows you the world of the mind is out (or in) there.",
    "I believe it would be more interactive to have separate sessions for asking questions on topics covered in class.",
    "It is a large lecture course but Professor Scholl was extremely engaging.",
    "This class is blessed with a professor who is engaging and TAs who are readily available. There were many readings, most of which were quite dull, but they are not necessary to do well in the class. One weakness is that there is no way to normalize grades given by TAs, so having a certain TA can impact your grade significantly.",
    "This course covers extremely interesting information, however, the large lecture format and lack of discussion sections make it hard to actually learn the information.",
    "The lectures were always very interesting and engaging. I also thought the structure of the course was well-designed, with a focus on reading primary literature, an open-ended final essay and two non-cumulative exams. One improvement I might suggest would be to add some kind of section to the course, even if it were just an optional weekly TF review session, as there are in some other courses. It would be helpful to have some small group dialogue about the topics presented, something not possible in such a huge lecture course.",
    "The course is definitely more abstract than I had expected. You don't receive most of your grade until the very end of the school year, which is annoying as it makes it hard to gauge where you stand.",
    "Strengths: Great professor, very well organized, interesting course material. Weaknesses: Test grading seemed overly harsh. The TA Anton was obstinate and unhelpful, often rude.",
    "Overall the class was very organized and interesting. The TAs were incredible and always accessible for help with any course material. The assignment breakdown: weekly reading responses, two exams, and a final paper seems pretty standard of PSYC classes. I found the greatest weakness of this class to be the assigned readings. Many of them were quite difficult to understand while others seemed completely irrelevant being that they were never discussed or mentioned in lecture.",
    "This course has a very interesting subject matter. Even though it is a large lecture course, it involved a lot of interactive hands on involvement. The assignments could be improved significantly.",
    "Professor School goes off topic a lot and we don't cover all of the material.",
    "I thought it was a very interesting course and the subject material was great. It had the inevitable weakness of being an intro course so we couldn't go in depth into a lot of things.",
    "This course covers highly interesting materials, and the lectures not only informative but captivating and surprising. The only weakness is that there is no discussion section, which would be helpful. Also, the reading responses are perhaps a bit excessive.",
    "The information taught in the course was all extremely interesting, however the course itself was somewhat disorganized. I didn't feel as though there was always a clear connection from topic to topic so sometimes it felt as though each lecture was simply a compilation of random but fascinating and important facts. This made it somewhat difficult to study for the midterm and final. I think creating a more clear outline for the class would help clarify and organize the course.",
    "I felt like the course was much too vague. By the point of every exam and going over the course lectures and readings I felt like I hadn't actually learned anything. It was really interesting though but I didn't find it informative.",
    "The weakness of this course is the arbitrary final grading of the paper, which is extremely frustrating as it can throw off an entire semester of hard work. Clear expectations and consistent grading across all sections would be much appreciated!",
    "The essay topic was annoying.",
    "Maybe having section for the course would help develop a greater undertstanding of the course material, seeing as though the class what lecture style and we were expected to recall a lot of information.",
    "The course was engaging and interesting, although the more abstract concepts at the beginning could be better explained.",
    "The professor wasted a lot of time at the beginning of each lecture and then had to gloss over too much of the topics. The way they graded the exams was also badly managed. Overall the lectures were very interesting to begin with then got gradually worse.",
    "The main strength of the course is that it is fascinating and contemporary. It is great that Professor Scholl discusses breakthroughs in Cognitive Science that happen even days before the lecture and constantly updates his lectures throughout the year. The main weakness of the course is how disconnected students are. It is a big lecture with no discussion sections, and the class is so large that I went for months without knowing I had friends who were also taking the course. This made it harder to compare notes and study effectively (though the review sessions were helpful). The incomplete pdf slides also added to this challenge, so it would be helpful to either have more complete slide notes or a way to connect with others in the class to help fill in the gaps.",
    "The size of the class made it more difficult, but the professor's ability to engage with his lectures and the interesting content of the lectures made the class very absorbing.",
    "Strengths are that the class is very interesting, and you actually feel like going to the lectures. The weakness could be that since the course is a wide survey, there maybe be some specific content that one is not interested in.",
    "Have a different professor teach this into class. Scholl is not engaging nor does he focus on the material he teaches, making it difficult to grasp and understand topics.",
    "The lectures are very engaging, enjoyed each one of them! However, the slides could be improved, they were not very informative for most of the time.",
    "Strength: Learning new information in this class that you would not be able to learn anywhere else. Some people like Scholl's goofy personality. There are some good TFs (which are assigned by last name). Reading responses (RR)-- get 20%(?) participation for doing them all; can miss 2 throughout the semester. They're pretty short (~ paragraph per question; usually one or two questions due before each class). Get full credit on RR if completed. two 2-hour review sessions before each exam-- TFs are very willing to help Weaknesses: It's held in the YUAG which is poorly lit (especially for exams), and the class was from 2:30-3:45. It was so hard staying awake and engaged. Also, there is a lot of material to learn. Midterm exam wasn't the easiest, but I did SIGNIFICANTLY better on the final exam.",
    "The strengths were in the interesting lectures and varied readings, while I think the weakness was the lack of a real narrative flow in favor of a more eclectic topic selection which made it tough to connect what we learned (though there were core ideas that persisted and organized)",
    "For the most part the course covers interesting topics. The weakness is there's so much to be covered that there were lectures that were very rushed and didn't give the necessary time to certain things that were eventually tested.",
    "I felt the course was really well structured towards one's learning of the material in both the overall structure of lecture and order of topics along with the supplementary readings and exams.",
    "The material started off interesting but quickly became either trivial or useless information that generally doesn't apply to daily life.",
    "Strength was that material was very interesting, however it was just all over the place and had no structure. Furthermore, the exams were rather difficult, and even if you studied days for them, you could do bad. If you received a B on the midterm, it was nearly impossible to receive anything higher than a B+ in the class.",
    "The lectures were excellent, though it would have been enormously helpful if the lectures were recorded and posted online. This would not only have helped in understanding the material after lectures and when reviewing for tests, but also after tests when questions about material came up.",
    "I wish there was a discussion section! This course inspired my interest in Cognitive Science, and office hours are wonderful but I wouldn't have minded hearing more of my peers thoughts and done more in depth analysis about the readings. That said, I think a section could create too much of a workload... In all other ways I loved this class. Brian School is not only entertaining but a skilled, articulate lecturer.",
    "Brian is an engaging professor and manages to keep the attention of the students, but at time the course is scattered and it is easy to muddle the topics together. Overall, it is an interesting class and enjoyable.",
    "Great choice of topics and instruction.",
    "By virtue of being a survey course, there is of course the problem that the survey tends to be brief, and I am not sure that can be improved. I do think that although the course was scheduled well, the actual class time could have been a lot more effective, and I think this mostly had to do with the professor. I did really appreciate the attempts to make the science seem less monolithic by showing the comments critiquing Scholl's experiment and the lecture on the limitations of the FMRI. I would have liked to see this same level of critique on other subjects, especially the Love, Sex, and Attraction lecture, as it seems to be a lot more controversial than was let on.",
    "Strengths: All material is incredibly interesting and worth the time of student. I found myself excited to go to every class and found myself fully engaged. Professor Scholl did a great job of making the course enjoyable and educational.",
    "The class was generally enjoyable and fun. I also thought the class was structured very well. One of the weaknesses was that SO MUCH information is squeezed into each lecture and it was hard to figure out what facts and details were important, especially when preparing for examinations. I wasn't a fan of the daily write-ups. At times, they were certainly helpful for gaging your understanding of the material. But having them so often was VERY challenging. Having two days to read upwards of 50 pages and write response was difficult for me, especially because I had to tend to other classes too. Honestly, some of the readings seemed unnecessarily long, especially because they weren't particularly emphasized during the lectures or tests. Sometimes, Professor Scholl would tell us what to pay attention to in the reading, but not always. Doing the homework took me several hours. Perhaps the responses can be structured differently. We didn't receive feedback on our responses either, so there wasn't a huge gain there. In order to get feedback, you had to go to office hours and that's not easy for people with mandatory commitments. I also thought some of the slides had far too many words on them. In order to take notes properly, having a copy of the slides in front of you was almost essential. Although said slides were (thankfully) provided, printing them out uses A LOT of paper. Not sure how to avoid that issue. In addition, it was hard to see how everything we learned fits together until near the end of the course. Finally, I think we should have been given more opportunities to showcase what we understood (more grading opportunities). What I learned from the first test was that you can understand a topic, but if you don't phrase your answer a certain way you won't get the points...that seemed unfair.",
    "The class struggled because of location and how the tests were set up.",
    "Way too much information for one class but very interesting",
    "Strengths: Excellent, wonderfully prepared and funny lectures. Great teaching fellows Weaknesses: None that I can think of? I think it's everything a great intro course should be",
    "One strength of its course is in its focus on a different concept in cognitive science for each lecture. I was able to gain insight into the many different, complex facets of cognitive science. I think the course could be improved by having discussion sections, perhaps even optional discussion sections. I think discussing the material with a teaching fellow or peer tutor would be very helpful.",
    "Strengths: Professor Scholl was very approachable and he was great at office hours. He was such a character and he made lectures fun, even with topics that weren't as interesting to me. For example, he made me intellectually excited about evolution and studying other species. I think it also does a good job of introducing to us a lot of different topics in cognitive science. Weaknesses: I wish we could go over more topics and that we can go over topics more in depth. But I think some of the short-comings in the course is also because the field is still so young and because as Professor Scholl explained, much of the mind is still a mystery and we still don't know how to go about unraveling that mystery. Sometimes, I wish Scholl would stop trying so hard to persuade us how interdisciplinary cognitive science is."

   "comments": [
    "I would readily recommend this intro cogsci course if only because it is so broad and covers so much material. There are a few very neat guest lectures which relate cogsci to other disciplines here at Yale. It is very entertaining and the workload is light. The midterms are tricky, but you can do it!",
    "Yes, but I would explain that, since the course is a survey\/introductory course, the teaching style is not for everyone.",
    "Take it for fun as a social science class or obviously take it if you're interested in the major.",
    "This class is not great, but take it if you're interested in the cognitive science major. Several of the classes in the department are much better than this one, as it suffers from the most serious case of an intro class I've seen. Lectures are spread out and only loosely connected to one another, grading is strangely allocated and there's little transparency about what qualifies as a good paper or not. Scholl rambles a lot, and especially the first 5 lectures feel like a museum talk on some cool stuff without any real in-depth explanation. He does eventually get to in-depth stuff too, which is often interesting, but Scholl will ramble so much that he ends up never getting to anything he wants to, often leaving the students confused and without context for the highly detailed information he has given.",
    "If you want a broad introduction, take it. If you want more organization and a clearer focus, skip it and take a non-introductory class.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student, especially if you're also taking intro to psychology. It's an interesting course in that you learn a lot about a bunch of different fields, but there is a lot of overlap between the two classes.",
    "I would recommend this course to gage whether or not you want to study psychology, cognitive science or anything related. This is a survey course; none of the topics are covered in much depth at all, and the course is largely structured as if it were a series of Ted talks with a couple of common themes in between. In that sense, you probably will come out feeling as if you didn't learn anything because you don't cover anything in depth, but throughout the course you'll probably look forward to lecture because Prof. Scholl is such a dynamic lecturer. It's not terribly hard; you'll probably do well if you did well in AP Bio (it's largely memorizing concepts and applying them) and the curve isn't that bad. Warning, a ton of people drop after the midterm, so it might not be a bad idea to take this as a 5th course because it's very little work to begin with. The TA's are all spectacular so I recommend you get to know yours as well as all of the others. SPECTACULAR.",
    "Before taking this course, I was extremely hesitant because there were many reviews that portrayed it in a negative light. It turns out, yes, the course does have its faults, but overall it has been one of the best I have taken to date. You will learn a lot by taking it, and all while having fun.",
    "Yes. I think for anyone even mildly interested in the social sciences, this is a great course to introduce to a variety of topics that you may find yourself wanting to explore more in depth.",
    "Yes! It is really interesting material.",
    "I would absolutely recommend Intro Cog Sci to another student, especially a STEM major looking for a social science credit. This class was incredibly interesting and the workload was very manageable. In fact, I would often enjoy doing my cog sci readings and paragraph-long responses as a break from problem sets from other classes. The exams are very fair (and the final is non-cumulative) and as long as you actually study, I think you can do very well. The paper is a bit tricky but the TF is a great resource, and I deeply wish I had talked to mine more- I think my paper and my experience of writing it would have been much better. This class is great because there's almost guaranteed to be something for everyone. I like computer science, and seeing the overlap of that with cog sci was super interesting! And one of my good friends in the class is a hardcore humanities major and she also found it super interesting- specifically the philosophy and language parts! So even if some part is boring, there's definitely something that's going to make it worth it (although I personally was fascinated by pretty much everything).",
    "Yes. It is an engaging and easy survey course that lets your dip your toes in the field of cognitive science.",
    "I think that Cog Sci is one of those classes that you should take at Yale just because you can. I've learned many things in Cog Sci, such as the basis for visual illusions and the propagation of racism through language learning, that allow me to look at circumstances in the world through a more informed lens. I feel that much of the information learned in Cog Sci will have some sort of real life relevance at some point, such as learning about the development of cognition in children being used in one's own experience as a parent. This would work well as a gut class since, relative to most classes, this class doesn't require much work except showing up to class, doing weekly reading responses (which take 15 minutes to do max) and studying a little bit for the exams. Well worth the class. Highly recommend.",
    "Yes. The mind is mysterious and interesting, and the insights from the course help you understand yourself better too.",
    "I took AP Psych in HS and did not want to take intro psych and I think this was a great alternative. It's super chill (a couple reading questions a week, a midterm, a final, and one thought paper) and the lectures are fun. I found the material interesting but the dynamic of lecturer-audience annoying. Prof. Scholl thinks he's very funny--I just ignored that and it was fine. In addition, because the class is so large, there's a pretty big disconnect. The TAs are there but I didn't really have a chance to connect with mine particularly.",
    "It is pretty good, probably geared more towards freshmen or those who have less STEM experience",
    "Yes, everyone could take the course and it will be helpful in different scenarios in your life.",
    "It's definitely a good course for people like me who are exploring CogSci as a potential major. The information had great variety and was very interesting, covering a range of topics in a unique way that other traditional courses in those respective fields probably wouldn't have presented.",
    "CGSC 110 is an excellent alternative to PSYC 110. I took both classes simultaneously (as did many students), and I found the material in this class to be far more engaging and interesting. The lectures are clearly well thought out, and Scholl has been teaching this class long enough to know every little detail about his presentation. Just beware of the reading responses due twice a week. There were 29 in total for the semester, and while they are graded essentially pass\/pass, they are more time consuming than I was expecting. But definitely a class worth taking, probably the hardest but also most intellectually stimulating intro class I have taken.",
    "I would recommend the course if it is something that seems interesting to you. Prof. Scholl does a good job of making his lectures relatively entertaining. It is worth taking out of curiosity or if you are considering it as a major. It isn't a huge time commitment outside of class. The homework is reading academic papers or articles and completing simple reading questions. Their is one 7-8 page paper (double spaced), a midterm, and a final.",
    "No way! This course is just a way for you to bask in Scholl's unadulterated genius. Except he's not a genius, just an asshole. The slides suck (he takes out all the important information from them so you're forced to listen to him), he's wrong on many many things; even the TFs have no idea what's going on and they have no understanding of the material (at times I was wondering if Scholl did) and it's held in the YUAG so there's no way to fact-check him. The exams are pretty unfair with dumb questions that ask for his version of reality. The material isn't even that entertaining, unless you consider photos of his hideous daughter that. Oh well, wouldn't recommend this course to anyone. Pretty easy to get a good grade, though.",
    "No. I thought the class was going to have a fairly low workload-- as well as be interesting and enjoyable. However, Prof. Scholl did not organize the course very well. The absence of a textbook, in favor for articles Scholl personally selected, further added to some of the confusion in which material was most important. For half of the course, we were behind on the syllabus, so it was hard to tell which information was most important and would actually be covered on the two exams.",
    "Very cool class. Not a gut. Great credit d.",
    "It is so interesting, both the content and the way the professor taught. I would recommend it to my friends who are interested in this area.",
    "Yes. This is a class you take to talk about in parties afterward to show how cool and learned you are.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes! I took it because I needed a social science credit, but it's a great course. The study of the human mind is obviously fascinating and Brian Scholl is an awesome, engaging lecturer (although some students in the class disagree) who also seems to be quite an impressive cognitive scientist.",
    "Absolutely! This class teaches you a lot that you can apply in the real world.",
    "I'd recommend the course as a fun introduction to cognitive science that makes the field seem relatable and exciting - Professor Scholl is enthusiastic, the classes are entertaining, and the workload is light. As someone who learns best from clearly structured lesson plans, I often found the lectures hectic and hard to process - though they were always interesting.",
    "It might be an interesting course if you are interested in the subjects. Only take it if you have an interest already.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because the material was so interesting and there was not that much work week by week.",
    "I would. At the end of the course, when Professor Scholl recommended some books to the class, I immediately went to order them on Amazon. I think that's testament to how much I enjoyed the course. It made me think critically and differently about everyday phenomena.",
    "Yes-- overall, I feel like what I learned in the class was important from any perspective. And this course was worth my time.",
    "I would recommend this course, especially to anyone interested in the cognitive science major. It gives a good overview of the general topics and concepts that could factor into the study of cognitive science, as well as an idea of the great variety in topics that cognitive science includes that the class did not cover. While it seems vague and abstract at times, such that you're not really sure what you're learning, you come out of the class with some specific knowledge and a general grasp of many of the important aspects of cognitive science. Even for non-majors, this class was fun and interesting, and offered some insights into real-life situations and aspects of how humans think and work in general.",
    "Yes, the course is manageable, yet a wonderful opportunity to get involved with cognitive science.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course to students interested in cognitive science, and you may really get to know some cool stuff in this rapidly developing field. For those who know for sure that they won't take cognitive science as a major, I still recommend this class because it will blow your mind. However, for people who dislike impersonal classroom settings like a large lecture, etc. I think you won't enjoy this class very much.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student. I think there are topics that can interest almost anyone, so even if they aren't interested in cognitive science as a major, they can still find the material engaging. Dr. Scholl focuses a lot on vision and computation, so be prepared to get through that part of the course (which is harder if that isn't something you are really interested). The end of the course definitely makes it worth it though.",
    "This is a great course for learning about the amazing processes our brains undergo without us realizing it. This is what I wish my high school psych class was.",
    "I would recommend this course, as it's very engaging and will cause people to think differently about the world.",
    "Into to CogSci is a fantastic course to take, regardless of your year. You will learn so much about the mind. One of the only classes I've taken that's really changed how I understand myself and the world.",
    "Yes, it's a good, interesting course to take if you're looking to get a social science credit, however, there are definitely other classes that go more in depth if that's what you're looking for.",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course unless you're considering the cog sci major and need to take it as a prereq. It was aggressively ok. It's not a lot of work (weekly reading responses, one 8-page paper, and a midterm and final that are non-cumulative and based entirely off of lecture) but you probably won't get that much out of it. The class is too much of an overview to get anything out of many of the topics. In theory, the survey approach makes sense you get a little taste of each of the facets of cognitive science and want to learn more. Instead, it felt like we were getting some nitty-gritty facts about each aspect but not really enough to form any sort of conclusions with. The exceptions to this were the guest lectures, which made a lot more sense as introductions to disciplines (animal cognition and robotics in cognitive science). I found that much more relevant for an intro to cognitive science course than being able to explain a specific study about bees or assign case to verb phrases in a grammatically incorrect sentence. That said, you will learn some very cool facts about how to film birds, and I'm still thinking about the lecture on attraction almost two weeks later. If you want to take this course, I recommend taking it with Brian Scholl because even though he is very disorganized, he is an engaging lecturer and tries to make his students laugh. He is also known to put adorable baby pictures of his daughter on the powerpoint. At the end of the last lecture, a boy sitting in front of me quietly said, \"What the fuck did we learn in this class...\" And that is the most accurate assessment I can give you of why it wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. You get to take 36 classes at Yale, are you sure you really want this to be one of them?",
    "Yes I would recommend because learning about the mind is critical to understanding ourselves but be aware that Professor Scholl is a controversial and provocative teacher. He likes to get under students' skin--even if it has nothing to do with CogSci--by making off-hand comments that sometimes unfortunately fail to acknowledge sexism. His class is strongly white-washed and heteronormative but then again so is the field of cognitive science...",
    "I recommend this course if the student was interested in the mind\/brain and is willing to do a lot of memorization.",
    "Yes, especially if you are interested in learning more about the study of the mind and essentially reverse engineering your own brain.",
    "Yes, I loved taking this course and now hope to pursue further studies in Cognitive Science. Brian Scholl is terrific and the workload is very manageable.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in gaining a better understanding of how their mind works.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course, but mostly just to a student who already finds the mind extremely interesting.",
    "I definitely recommend this course to everyone, even those who are not looking to pursue a career in the subject for it is so interesting and eye opening.",
    "I would because the material is fascinating and Professor Scholl really knows how to present it, but the class itself could make better use of the 150 minutes per week...",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was an especially crucial class for me to take because I intend to major in Cognitive Science, so I wanted to survey the field of study. However, I would recommend the course to students who are not planning to major in Cognitive Science as well as those who are. It was an introductory level course, and yet the inclusion of in-depth case studies prevented the course from being too boring, too rudimentary, or too theoretical. Throughout the entire semester, I felt that I was being exposed to \"real\" cognitive science along with the basic principles and methods associated with the field.",
    "Take if you're actually interested in cog sci and looking to pursue the major. Don't take as a gut or because you think it'll be fun - it's neither of those things.",
    "Personally I do regret taking the course because I feel as though it was somewhat of a waste of time given the other classes I could've been taking. However, if a student is confident that lectures based more on interesting ideas rather than a coherent discipline interests them, then I would say go ahead.",
    "Yes! Prof Scholl is a really good lecturer. The midterm and final weren't super easy - but there's only two of them and it's not hard to do well if you sit down and study.",
    "I think that this is definitely a great course for someone looking for an interesting social science course to take. I think that the course does lack a bit in its breadth, and thus may not be as much for someone who is actually looking to take this class to gain background information. However, this class in unique in that it is one of the few intro classes that I've taken that was actually interesting.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in cognitive science. Do not take Intro to Cognitive Science with the expectation that it will be a course in psychology (it won't), or that the material won't involve science (it will). Be prepared to take responsibility for organizing all of the information you absorb. I found the material interesting and applicable to daily life; I loved going to lecture, and I learned a lot. That being said, some of my friends hated this course, and described it as a chaotic \"data dump\" of all sorts of information somewhat related to cognitive science. A better comparison, I think, might be to a biweekly podcast about cognitive sciencean interesting exploration of a few general themes. But tricky to take a midterm on or write a paper about if you haven't been paying attention. Workload is very light, but you won't get any feedback along the way about how much you understand.",
    "Yes! Really fun and interesting class. Take whether you're interested in majoring in the field or want an engaging class.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student, because it was super fascinating. I understand how the mind works much better than I once did, although I know I still have a lot to learn. Anyone who is intrigued by how our brain does the things it does would find this course very interesting.",
    "Interesting new perspective on the mind, interesting topics, interesting professor. Also cute pictures of his daughter.",
    "Yes, literally a firmware upgrade of your mind",
    "I would recommend it if you want to understand how cognitive science includes many different areas of study applied to the mind. This class will tell you whether cognitive science is for you or not. The lecture can get pretty boring, which might get in the way of interest in the actual topics. However, overall, it involves a manageable amount of work and does teach you about the mind.",
    "I'd recommend it to students who are interested in various social science courses, since cognitive science falls neatly on the intersection of so many intriguing disciplines. The study of the human mind is certainly enlightening and necessary, and the course itself wasn't too demanding for a non-cognitive science major. It offered a refreshing breath of fresh air in my seminar-heavy schedule, but didn't give me whiplash from being too distant from the rest of my humanities-oriented studies.",
    "If you're even relatively interested in how people think and want to learn how the brain specifically and how it takes things into perspective, you should take this class. Professor Scholl can be a fun teacher at times and presents really interesting content. The workload is really manageable (a few reading responses a week) and the tests are relatively easy (which unfortunately does mean that the curve sucks, but you can still do really well in the class if you study).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who's even slightly considering the cogsci major. There are so many incredibly interesting ideas that you get exposed to. Like any other intro course, you don't get a chance to do a ton with any given topic, but Professor Scholl did a really good job of going into a fair amount of detail into certain topics while still providing a good overview. The class isn't a ton of work while still being really interesting, which makes it a good choice for exploring some different topics.",
    "Take it! It will develop a newfound fascination toward the evolutionary wonder that is your mind.",
    "Overall I don't think that I would recommend this course to another student. The topics covered in class were not what I was expecting, and the class felt more like a philosophy class than a cognition\/mind\/brain class.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. CogSci was an engaging class, with relevant and interesting readings as well as real world applications. It has helped me think more clearly about my instincts and intuitions, and it has given me a better understanding of the way humans think. I feel that a lot of the information is applicable to life and to other professions, and because CogSci is so interdisciplinary, this course gives a good overview of many different applications, so different people can find different things to love.",
    "Yes, it is a requirement for the cogsci major.",
    "It's an okay social science credit. Some of the topics were really interesting, but as the course dragged on I felt less and less engaged with the material, to the point where the class started to bother me for some inexplicable reason. The workload is fine, not horrible but you do have to at least skim the readings for the reading responses. The paper assignment was kind of odd, very broad with limited help from TA's and such.. Overall, if you need an SO credit, you can probably find a better one elsewhere, but this one is fine.",
    "Yes, I would particularly recommend this course to someone interested in acquiring a cohesive understanding of how the brain works.",
    "Definitely not. I entered the class with a strong interest in cognitive science, and left without wanting to ever take a cognitive science course again. If you are interested in it, know that you are only getting through it because it is a necessary pre-req. Do not take it otherwise it will ruin your life!",
    "This is a great course. I think almost every Yalie would benefit from taking it, and I have recommended it to my friends.",
    "Highly recommend. It's a great way to get exposed to something new and changes how you think of your mind entirely. Lectures really are entertaining, not tiresome, which makes learning more natural. Homework is always to read one or two articles and write short responses to questions about them and is graded on completion. The readings are interesting and support what is taught in lecture without being redundant.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in learning more about the subject matter (the brain), however I would not recommend this to someone who wants an interesting, structured course with each lecture being very enticing.",
    "Definitely an interesting class that I would recommend, however, it is rather challenging! There is a heavy workload with the reading responses but you don't necessarily have to read all the readings or the ones with responses thoroughly (I generally skimmed and was able to answer the questions). The exams require a lot of studying and you will likely only do well if you attended all lectures and took detailed notes because the questions can be tricky. Don't let this deter you, though, because it really is a great class! If you're deciding between this and Psych, I would probably recommend Psych more just in terms of more engaging content unless you're specifically interested in the brain or are more scientific\/mathematically inclined. Psych also seemed much easier because it was more about straight memorization. I would still highly recommend this class.",
    "In that the subject is interesting and exciting to learn about, I would recommend this course, especially for the informative readings. However, in that this course is difficult to follow and there is little support provided for the students, I would not recommend it. It depends on the nature of the student and if they're willing to take up most of the learning on their own.",
    "I think it's a good overview of cognitive science class but the student should expect not much help and it is a bit disorganized.",
    "I think this is a good class to take if you're interested at all in cognitive science. I gained more from the material than I did discussion or writing skills, so I think it's important to like the subject. If you do, though, you'll like the class!",
    "This is a fascinating course that serves as a great introduction to cognitive science. Brian Scholl's lectures are often very engaging and interesting. The workload is very manageable as well.",
    "I would recommend that take it if they're not really sure if they're interested in cognitive science. It isn't a bad way to test the waters, but if someone was interested in a specific part of cognitive science I would advise them to skip this course.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I found the material fascinating and very relevant to nearly all other subjects I am studying. Perhaps equally important is how much I enjoyed the professor. Prof. Scholl did an excellent job of making the class humorous and engaging, and it was clear that he loves what he studies!",
    "Awesome lecture, super fun",
    "Yes but maybe not with Scholl Course Material Interesting and broad treatment of how the mind works. If at all interested in this, then take it. Instructor Unable to keep track of time while lecturing, leading to content that is not covered because of time and even whole lectures taken out of syllabus because of that. Otherwise very interesting lectures",
    "I have mixed feelings about this class. The material was interesting on the surface, so take it if you are really into cognitive science or want to learn about interesting processes. There was a lot of overlap with biology topics, so maybe take it if you're interested in biology. That being said, the class often went over time during lecture, the lectures weren't always the most interesting, you will have to do the readings (at least the ones for the reading responses), and the exams are a bit difficult.",
    "This course is a great introduction to cognitive science, with broad overviews of the different ways a variety of fields and methodologies may be used to understand the mind, and even the idea of the mind. It is even a great standalone course, as I would describe attending the class like attending two TED talks a week, with readings that are usually thought-provoking and new. I would recommend this course to most people, including those who have taken AP Psychology in high school, as the overlap is extraordinarily minimal.",
    "Yes, I believe it offers an excellent introduction to the field of cognitive science.",
    "Definitely! Not only for students who are potentially interested in cognitive science as a major, but also for anyone who wants to understand the human mind in general, Intro to CogSci is a great class to take. It provides you insights into the nature of the mind that you can use in daily life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to others. If you want to be a cognitive science major, you must take it and chances are you will enjoy it, minus Turing machines. If you've taken Intro to Psych or other Cog Sci classes, some of the material might be redundant, but hopefully that is to your advantage.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes, definitely! The course material itself is really interesting (a lot of different perspectives on how to study the mind and how the mind works) and the workload manageable - weekly readings and reading responses, one final paper, two exams. There are some tougher subjects that you'll encounter (eg. Turing machines, syntactic analysis), and the exams aren't easy and really do require you to know and apply the material, but I thought it was really worthwhile. Professor Scholl's lectures and sense of humor are really engaging, and I always looked forward to this class!",
    "Yes. I think this course was very interesting. The course material was captivating and exciting to learn. Many of the concepts are applicable to everyday circumstances.",
    "Take this class if Scholl isn't teaching it.",
    "Definetly. I think Cogsci and Psychology are essential things to learn. The class was both fun and the material is incredibly interesting. This probably more than any other class significantly changed my worldview.",
    "The course is very challenging but very interesting and highly applicable to many other fields. If you are looking for an easy class or are not willing to put in effort do not take this class!!",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the mind from different perspectives. Even though I am interested in studying cognitive science, I think there is a lot to be learned for non-majors as well.",
    "Yes, it's a cool different way of thinking.",
    "Introduction to Cognitive Science is a great course! Professor Scholl has a very engaging and unique form of oratory, and I never found myself bored or disinterested in the material he was teaching (save for Turing Machines, but I'm not alone on that one). The readings were not terribly dense, and though there were a few longer readings, they were definitely fantastic edification for the class itself and further research into Cognitive Science (especially since we were required to submit reading responses - these were VERY crucial to maintaining student engagement with the course material. I'd love to see this applied to other courses as well!). Some of the papers we read were even written by Professor Scholl himself! Professor Scholl is surprisingly available as well, opening himself up for office hours as well as time after class to answer questions about lecture material. I definitely enjoyed his teaching style (although it may not work for everyone, so definitely shop it to see if he's a good fit for you! If you appreciate levity mixed in with a few tangents that keep things interesting, you'll probably love it; if you prefer more straight lecturing and less laughs or deviation from explicitly tested material, you might find yourself annoyed by his tangents. All personal preference.) The TA system is a critical part of any large lecture course, as you'll often spend most of your engagement with the TAs for things like writing papers and submitting reading responses. All of the TAs this semester were just really cool people - there weren't any weirdos or people who didn't know what they were talking about, and they were all very competent and helpful. I personally feel that the grading of the papers was unnecessarily harsh (the grades were all normalized around an 80 grade, with points added or removed based on a very arbitrary grading scale), I definitely enjoyed the time with my TA and the effort they put into helping with understanding the concepts explained in class (shoutout to Clara Colombatto, she's great!). Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the cognitive sciences - be that perception, theory of mind, and things like intuition bias or experimental psychology. There is a surprisingly broad area of topics discussed, and while the scope is wide, there is a lot of care taken to make sure that the broader topics of cogsci are regularly reinforced. It's by no means a gut, but it's a worthwhile challenge that will get you really interested in the mind!",
    "Yes! It is incredible fascinating if you are at all interested in how the mind works! You learn a lot about a lot of different disciplines.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone at all interested in how the mind and brain work, in human nature, or in the field of cognitive science in general.",
    "I would recommend this course to someone who is truly interested in cognitive science, however I would not suggest it to someone who simply wants to try something new.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student. Although engaging due to the professors teaching style and manner, it wasn't very informative nor did I find it intellectually stimulating.",
    "I would recommend the course, but would caution them to be aware of the grading system employed and be present during lecture!",
    "Sure. Interesting material, entertaining lectures, very manageable workload.",
    "Yes",
    "It's an interesting class in in terms of material, which I think would interest anyone since cognitive science studies how our mind works,and presentation (Brian Scholl and the guest lecturers were fantastic). It demands less work, as far as I know. I caution against procrastinating on the reading questions and the final paper (for me, it was a \"thought paper\" which was basically rambling about a topic of your choosing in an organized way and coming to a conclusion.The exams were also reasonable.",
    "I think this class was a good starter if you want to know whether you are interested in cognitive science.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. The topics are fascinating and relevant, and you learn a lot of fun facts that change your view of the world.",
    "Yes. This course provides some fascinating insight, both scientifically detailed and socially relevant.",
    "One of the best intro classes I've taken.",
    "Take it if you are fascinated by ways in which we think, perceive, see and believe!",
    "Yes-- BUT only if you are a Psych major who wants to fulfill the natural science core credit and you don't want to take something like human brain. OR if you're going to be a cogsci major down the line. i wouldn't just take this class for fun.",
    "Yes, I think that it was a pretty interesting course with good resources, lectures, and guest lectures.",
    "It depends on what they are interested in. I would not recommend it to a student who is similar to myself but that does not mean I think it's a bad course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student no matter their major. You will learn an incredible amount of new and interesting material that can be applied to many different aspects of life.",
    "Although the class may start off interesting, be warned that the class can quickly become dull. The workload is probably less than other classes e.g. intro psych, but unless you really want to learn cog sci, I wouldn't recommend this course. This class discouraged me from learning cog sci and psych in general.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're truly interested in the material and don't mind receiving an average grade. You could complete all the work and try your hardest, and still receive a B.",
    "The lectures in this course are excellent, and many of the topics (especially in the second half of the semester) are really applicable to how you might view the real world. However, the size of the class is certainly a drawback.",
    "Absolutely!! You will never see yourself, your mind, or your environment the same way again.",
    "Yes. All students should take time to learn a little bit about the way our brain works.",
    "Absolutely. Brian is a brilliant lecturer and a master of the material he is teaching! What you learn in this course will forever change the way you go about your daily life.",
    "Yes, topics that will interest everyone. The course will provide useful knowledge even if you are not interested in majoring in anything like cognitive science.",
    "A very enjoyable course for literally any student. I would recommend that every student take this course at some point in their career as there is a little something for everyone in this course.",
    "Favorite class of the semester. Take it with Brian if you can. This will open your mind to many new exciting concepts!",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class, especially because you need the class for the major. I would just make sure the student understands that the class is quite involving and time-consuming. You have to put in the extra effort (going to office hours, reading many pages efficiently, etc.), and doing some of the work might not seem\/be worthwhile.",
    "If you are interested in the fields of Psychology or Cognitive Science then take this course.",
    "Even thought this course was extremely interesting, it was not structured in a way that facilitated learning or success",
    "I would fully recommend this course to another student, especially if they are not already experts in this area. People of all ages and backgrounds wonder about these topics already; why not take a course that is sure to enrich one's existing understanding and broaden one's horizons about what the goals of cognitive science?",
    "I would highly recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting, and I found Professor Scholl to be a talented, intelligent, and engaging lecturer. It was my favorite class of the semester, and I am even considering becoming a cognitive science major.",
    "I would recommend this course be taken credit-d. Lectures are interesting, and I was never bored during class. Reading responses are pass\/fail and some can be done without doing the reading. However, tests often test specific, small things and it felt more like luck of what bits you remembered. The paper was ill defined (I went to two different teaching fellows, and one said the idea sounded great, and the other said it wasn't on topic for the paper) and harshly graded. With a credit-d, the class would be a minimal amount of work and interesting. Professor Scholl is no doubt an incredibly entertaining lecturer. That being said, some of his comments are extremely inappropriate (particularly regarding looking at female students, touching female teaching fellows, and the like). In addition, he starts lectures late, spends significant amounts of time on what amounts to stand up comedy (for instance, making the same joke about how scientists don't understand consciousness by showing book covers for literally 23 minutes).",
    "It's a great introduction to the field if you're curious. But I know that some people were disappointed with the field itself, not the course. Professor Scholl is a great professor who's very engaging. He's very approachable and you can tell he really wants to make us excited.",
    "I thought it was a good overview to the field of cognitive science and touched on a lot of interesting and cool topics. The workload is definitely manageable and Professor Scholl is very interesting, so I would recommend it to another student."
