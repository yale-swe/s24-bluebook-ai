    "Not at all like a traditional physics course. Hard. Confusing lectures. Need to know a bit of calculus, despite the fact that it's not supposed to be calculus based. Most concepts seem relevant to medicine, but sometimes it felt like we just picked problems that could really be applied to anything, and happened to choose medical examples. Go read evals for 180- I don't know how students found that, which was the alternative to this course for a lot of people.",
    "TERRIBLE - AVOID AT ALL COSTS",
    "I was deciding between 170 and 180, and I should have taken 180. This class, although easy grading, took a lot of time for the problem sets and the lectures and problem sets were often unclear. No one really knows how to do those problems Mochrie comes up with, TAs included. If it wasn't for the easy tests, I would say definitely don't take it.",
    "This course is not going to be a piece of cake. Attend help sessions if you want to do well.",
    "We were the guinea pigs for it, but given that, I think it was a moderate success. Sure, it was crazy talking about diffusion of molecules, etc. but at least we weren't always talking about balls rolling down inclined planes.",
    "I took this course as a senior and it was hands down the worst class I've taken over 7 semesters here. The problem sets are impossible, lecture is confusing and often useless, and the quizzes are just annoying. Professor Mochrie somehow manages to make even the simplest concepts more difficult than you thought possible. Take any other physics class. This was a complete fail in every sense of the word.",
    "I really don't know.At first it seemed like tons of work, but it was actually do-able except for problem sets.If you actually want to learn physics, take a different class. A lot of the concepts and stuff were not properly explored or explained. We learned a few, specific things...",
    "More difficult that it seems. This is not a general physics class-- you cover lots of material that is not relevant to the MCAT or what used to be in PHYS 150. Problem sets are really hard, but midterms were a lot better. If you love physics, hell take the class, but if you are just looking for the basics, perhaps try a different course.",
    "It's definitely not the best science class but it's pretty good. Professor Mochrie is really nice and genuinely wants the class to do well so if you need help it's really easy to ask for it from him. In terms of work, it's not that difficult (other than the psets). He'll usually give a heads up as to what might be on the quizzes or exams so that we can prepare for them which is really great.",
    "Yes...it isn't teh best for MCAT preparation though.",
    "I would recommend this class for pre med students looking for a slightly easier alternative to physics 180. A word of caution, however, you will still put in a decent amount of work to do well in the course, and you will come out knowing less physics than you would like.",
    "I don't know much about physics 180, and I'm not sure how physics 170 is going to change next year since this is the first semester it has been offered. I would look at evaluations from the spring semester course because they will probably be more accurate as to what will happen in the future. That said, I thought physics 170 was fine, not too hard except for problem sets but if you go to section and help sessions the TAs will essentially tell you how to do most of the problems so they become manageable.",
    "Yes, the material is fairly interesting and it's not a brutal class. Problem sets are really long, but there's a lot of help along the way and the class itself was not too taxing. I really enjoyed it.",
    "I would recommend this class only if you need to fulfill a requirement for Pre-Med. Even so, though, there's a lot of material that is not covered on the MCAT, so taking 151 might actually be more helpful. However, Professor did say on problem sets next semester that he would have a section of relevant MCAT problems for our benefit that we wouldn't have to do, but he would offer and provide solutions to as well.",
    "Intro physics with a bit of calculus, but not too scary (no hard integrals). The problem sets are hard, but the tests are relatively easy so if you have it one way this is better. Interesting and relevant to biology",
    "At first Phys 170 seemed much harder than Phys 180. But once you get used to Mochrie's teaching style, the class becomes quite doable\/easy. If you like the type of course where you can do well on the exams by only studying the lecture notes (don't need to read a random phys textbook), take this class--you only have to apply what you learn in class (at least on exams, problem sets go more in-depth). Mochrie is really good at explaining things, really considerate of students, and quite entertaining. I rarely had trouble paying attention. Mochrie integrates the concepts in the class quite well.",
    "It's not good if you want to learn classic physics. But if you want a physics with biological applications, then this is the class for you. Beware the professor is not that great at teaching so talking to the TAs definitely helps",
    "This was an incredibly engaging physics course. For someone with a very distant calculus background, the professor did a wonderful job of using mathematics where appropriate without demanding extensive calculus review from the students. The biological applications were relevant and very interesting. This course covers physics concepts that every biologist should understand - some of which are not even addressed in PHYS180. This was a wonderful course and an excellent replacement for the dull and superficial PHYS 150.",
    "Interesting topics but not that well taught, but it was it's first year. Next year I think it will be far improved.",
    "Physics with some calculus, a little bit different than 180, though not that much different. A lot of stuff kind of goes over the heads of most people because there are a lot of biology topics that get complicated.",
    "Yes, I would.",
    "Physics 170 focuses a lot on physics with biological applications, so we cover other topics like probability, random walks, etc as they relate to actin polymerization and other processes. The psets this semester were pretty long and hard, but Professor Mochrie said they would try to change that. The midterms were also fair, if you knew the material then there was no problem. If you're premed and looking to prep for the MCAT, Physics 180 might be better.",
    "I hesitate to recommend or not recommend being that it's the first time it's taught.",
    "This course turned out to be more stressful than I thought. The problem sets were very difficult and took a lot of time -- but efforts are being made to change this for next semester, which is nice. The quizzes\/midterms\/finals weren't bad but were a cause for lots of weekly work. We covered a lot of material, but I wish we had spent more time learning classic \"physics\" before jumping into applications such as actin polymerization or Boltzmann. I felt like the applications distracted from the physics a little bit. But Simon Mochrie is a kind professor and I really believe he wants us to succeed. Overall, if you're thinking of taking this class it's probably because you need to for pre-med -- don't just assume that 170 is going to be easier than 180 -- it probably isn't. Really important to shop both!!",
    "Physics 170 does try to be the physics of life sciences, and it does succeed in that the examples are chosen from the realm of biology. However, if you'd like a solid background in introductory physics, I would recommend another course. You will learn basic physics concepts in this class, but some of the topics covered are at the expense of what would normally be covered in an introductory physics course.",
    "This class takes a lot of time, but is fairly interesting. The problem sets are excessively long and hard (go to the extra TA help sessions-- they're super helpful), the weekly quizzes were sometimes annoying, but were overall a helpful way for me to stay on top of the material, and the midterms often cover a lot of concepts but are manageable. The biology applications make the material both more confusing and more interesting.",
    "Awesome, awesome, amazing course. First physics course that actually had material I cared about. You will learn so much in the class if you want to actually learn instead of just freaking out over grades.",
    "I would recommend this class. As a biology major and a pre-med I was dreading having to take physics. I really enjoyed the biological applications and could finally see why it is necessary for biologists to study physics. Mochrie became a much better professor throughout the semester and really cared about all of his students doing well and understanding the material.",
    "Great course, definitely recommend it! The tests this semester were very doable and content interesting overall. If you're deciding between this course and 180 for premed requirements, I'd probably choose this one.",
    "It has a lot of potential to be a great class that can fill a very unique niche.Strengths: Covers interesting applications that you wouldn't really see in any other class. The weekly quizzes at least keep you somewhat accountable. The tests were also not impossible, and if you studied and understood the material, you would be okay. You did not need to memorize silly complicated formulas, as they would be given to you on the test. But this makes sense, because in real life, you can look those up anyway. Some of the TAs were also very helpful, especially in the midterm review sessions. Also, the course seems to be curved around a B+\/A-, which is awesome because everyone in it is already an intense premed student. There is also a great policy that if your grade on your final exam is higher than your grade in the course, your final exam grade will just become your final course grade. It is good for late bloomers or procrastinators, but they say it's because they don't want to penalize for people who work really hard and finally understand everything in the end, which is after all when it counts.Weaknesses: The problem sets were toodifficult, too esoteric, or too poorly written (However, I hear this is a problem they are addressing for next semester in 171 and for 170 next year). This initially caused the problem of each p-set being all-nighter worthy, and people eventually just waited for their TA to go over all the problems, and sometimes they didn't even know the answers or couldn't understand what exactly the question wanted. The lectures were also not the best, as Mochrie is not very clear and makes a lot of oral and written mistakes on the board and when explaining. However, this improved throughout the semester, and he used more videos to really explain what we were learning, and also became better at lecturing and making sure to explain more often what he had just written on the board.I don't think it is the best class, but I also think it might be the lesser of two evils, between 170 and 180. The tests were also relatively easy. It was very easy to overstudy for our midterms and final. Hopefully, past exams will be available, just as an example. It was hard to gauge how hard the class would be without a precedent.",
    "great!",
    "This was the first year so the material was a bit confusing and complicated. You will learn about the physics behind biology, which is pretty cool. It isn't that hard of a class overall \u0097\u00a0definitely manageable. Just know how to do all the practice problems thoroughly.",
    "NO. The lectures are very confusing. It's not real physics. You blow through the material. The problem sets are impossible.",
    "Physics 170 is a physics course that puts basic physics in a biological perspective - I would recommend it.",
    "If you are interested in medicine, I advise taking it. If you want a physics course that is more applicable to biology than regular physics, take it. If you took regular physics in high school and want to learn some new material, such as diffusion, DNA stretching, etc, take it.",
    "If they offer phys 150, take 150 or else you have no choice but to take 170",
    "This is a fairly basic intro physics class with a focus on the life sciences. It's not super enjoyable, but it could be worse. Professor Mochrie is very approachable and eager to make the class better, which I appreciated. His lectures can be rambling and sometimes boring, but they improved over the course of the semester. There were weekly quizes that weren't so difficult, but really kind of a pain. The weekly problem sets were very difficult and took a lot of time to solve. I ended up spending over three hours a week in section to work through the problem sets. I would highly suggest setting up a study group early in the year. On top of this, there were two midterms and a final. All the tests were very reasonable and much easier than the problem sets. As an added bonus, if you do better on the final than your average grade through the semester, your final score becomes your final grade. Do I recommend it? Not really. But if you need to take physics, this isn't such a bad option.",
    "I don't know really. I think it will be revamped, but I would say yes take it. It is not too difficult of a course and you really do learn a lot. That said, you have to put in time, and also put up with some abstruse teaching. Though frustrating, it is also rewarding.",
    "Its an okay course. I would recommend it if you want to take a relatively easy physics class. Life science applications are interesting but hard to understand fully, especially within the scope of this class. If you want to learn how to solve basic physics problems, this course won't provide much practice in that.",
    "It's an intro physics course with bio applications. This makes it sometimes harder than straight physics but also sometimes easier. Overall, not a terrible course.",
    "Problem sets were extremely long and difficult. Lecture was confusing.Exams were fair and on the easy side. Notes for important concepts were typed up and posted. Material was interesting once you understood the material enough to apply it.This was the first year the course was offered, and I'm sure some things will be changed.",
    "The class covers interesting topics, it is just difficult to learn them in class, since the topics presented tended to go over my head. It took sitting down and learning with a tutor to actually grasp them. Also, problems of the appropriate caliber were difficult to come by to prepare for the midterm exams (problem sets and practice problems always seemed a little bit too difficult). However, for the final exam, that all changed. The final problem sets were helpful for catching up on a semester's worth of physics. I think this indicates that as the semester went along, the professor also got more in touch with the needs of his students.A lot of help is available for this class (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday TA teaching sessions, 5 review sessions before the exam, residential college Math and Science tutors, the professor himself), so make sure you take advantage of them.",
    "Yes, I'd recommend this class. It's uite a good course if you're not looking for a pure physics class. Mochrie isn't a bad professor although some of the examples we went through in class were a little difficult. Long hard problems sets but the final and midterms were very manageable.",
    "If you're a bio major or premed, then you don't have many other choices for an introductory physics course other than this one or 180. I feel that physics 170 is a mixed bag...sure, there are a lot of biological models presented, but I feel like I still don't really understand basic physics after this course. The problem sets were useless to me because they were so difficult that I would not eventry to do them. When exam time came around, I was so stressed out because I was completely lost in class, but the thankfully the homework problems were not necessarily reflective of the exam questions. I feel that Prof Mochrie tried to make the class interesting and relevant, but I don't feel like I learned much about physics or biology in this class. Too much of the class time is spent on complex derivations, and not enough on making sure we understood what was going on. Prof Mochrie seems receptive to feedback, though, so hopefully next year will be better.",
    "I came into this class with no prior exposure to Physics and it started out as a bit of struggle, but bear in mind that this was the first semester it was being offered so hopefully by the time you take it all the kinks will be worked out. That said, overall, it was a satisfying course. The title is a little misleading; it's actually Biophysics. You're learning about Newton's Laws and Rotational Motion and all that, but you're learning about it as it applies to biological applications such as actin polymerization and diffusion of molecules in your body and blood flow through arteries, etc. The problem sets were definitely very challenging and time-consuming, but I've heard they're going to be easier so that'll be good. Prof. Mochrie is very passionate about this field and it comes across in lecture, though lecture tends to be a little derivative-heavy. It's not that the math is difficult per se (the exams are meant to be able to taken even if you haven't done calculus before) but that most of class is devoted to derivations and not enough is devoted to problems. Again, this might be changed in the future. Aside from the problem sets, the midterms and final were definitely much more feasible and reasonable. If you do all the practice problems assigned, you should be in great shape for them. The curve was pretty high (the average on the final was a 90) but it's doable class, as long as you have the time to commit to it. Although I was pretty bitter about the class as I took it because I'm not pre-med and have never taken Physics before whereas everyone around me was pre-med and\/or had taken Physics before, in retrospect it was worth it. What I learned was fascinating and can be applicable to many areas of research.",
    "Physics 170 is a good choice for premed students looking to take an introductory physics course. The topics presented are geared towards those aspects more related to the medical professions.",
    "DO NOT TAKE THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE TO.",
    "PHYS 170 is an introductory level physics course--most premeds take it. If you're looking for an \"in-depth\" intro physics exposure, take 180 if you can, but 170's not bad. There're a lot of biological applications of physics, which is cool, explaining actin polymerization and diffusion of proteins and such. Not quite sure how well it's prepared me for the MCATs, but I feel like a much more knowledgeable scientist after having taken the class.",
    "Physics 170 is probably more interesting than a traditional physics class. The lectures are difficult to follow at times and the problem sets are difficult. Definitely take advantage of the great help sessions.",
    "This class evolved as a replacement for Physics 150 for the premed student who needs physics but should be exposed to the basics of physics with calculus. The physics department did a fairly good job integrating biology and medicine into the course, which kept it relevant for those of us who were not particularly interested in physics. Professor Mochrie was funny and engaging and is very much interested in improving his teaching and the class structure through direct student feedback. If you want a good physics class for the biologist \/ premed, take this. If you want pure physics, take 180 or 200.",
    "in retrospect this was a very cool classi think people are being to hard on Simon, i really appreciated the online notes he posted and the effort he gave in making physics relevanti really appreciated the covering of probability and statistical mechanics, i did not expect thisand the final was very reasonablei have no complaints, good job",
    "Interesting goals as a class- unfortunately, it's completely ruined by the 98% of the class that is pre-med. Do not take this class.",
    "The ONLY people who will be taking this class are Pre-med and biology majors who are not Pre-med. Thus there is point in recommending the class to anyone. If they are offering 150 as well I would say shop both and take the easier one. From my experience though Phys170 was stressful outside of class, the midterm and finals were extremely easy.",
    "I would recommend it over physics 180 because I think it's less calculus based. If youre interested in biology more than physics, 170s better.",
    "Psets take a long time. Really budget a lot for them. It sucks that they don't even apply to the exams much. Professor Mochrie is such a bad lecturer so get ready to be lost 50% of the time. He also messes stuff up and says embarrassing things.Without prior physics, this class was really challenging. For me it was a lot harder than orgo but I'm sure plenty of people felt the opposite. The class was just a little weird.180 sucks too I heard but I think they're about even now. Where did you go 150 when I needed you so?",
    "Not like MCAT prep, but watch for the syllabus: they may tweak it after feedback from the guinea pig group. If you're interested in how phys applies to things like diffusion, actin polymerization, DNA zipping\/unzipping, etc this is the class for you. More work than I bargained for.",
    "PHYS 170 is a solid physics course. No, it's not an MCAT prep course. No, it's not AP physics all over again. However, it will help you if you're interested in Biochem or Physiology, more so than phys180. Prof Mochrie actually wants you to succeed and is very receptive to student comments, which is incredibly refreshing after 2 years of feeling like my profs were encouraging a \"dog eat dog\" mentality.",
    "Yes, the problem sets were harder than the work actual exams.",
    "You learn a bit of MCAT physics and more simmple biophysics.",
    "The best physics for pre-meds. All of the applications are biological, which makes the class much more interesting. You only have to do basic derivatives and integrals, and a strong physics background isn't required. The curve is generous and exams are pretty easy, though psets can be tough and time-consuming.",
    "no",
    "If you have the math background to take another class, DO IT. This course has a good curve on tests, but everyhting else is so arbitrary and so far from physics that it seems a waste of time. I am not learning to solve problems or to use physics, but simply to memorize and mimic. This is not worth taking if you can avoid it.",
    "Take Physics 170 if your premed and didn't do AP Physics in high school. It's not a great class and it can be very time-consuming, but the tests are very straight-forward. Don't take it if you don't need to, though.",
    "This course is alright although this is only the first time it's been taught, so things will certainly change. I question how much real physics you end up learning (and how much it will help you with the MCAT if you're pre-med, I guess), but I think the material is more interesting than standard physics since you have some biological applications like diffusion in there instead of constant rolling of objects down inclined planes or something. The homework way too much time especially since the professor makes up problems about non-standard physics that not many other people deal with so you can't really just go to another textbook or something for additional help, but the TAs' help sessions were amazingly helpful for that, so it'll be okay. Plus the professor says the homework will be better next semester, and the exams are actually not too bad. I suggest shopping both 170 and 180 to see what you like.",
    "170 is a great course! It actually does help with problem solving skills because many of the questions are intuitive so you have to think through things. Professor Mochrie actually cares about students so I highly suggest asking about things you don\u0092t understand or going to office hours. It doesn\u0092t teach to the mcat like 150 did but it covers the basic concepts so you will have to study more on your own if you are premed. If you follow during lecture, you will do well in the class so worry less about your grade and more about understanding the concepts each week in time for the weekly quiz. It will also serve you well on the final. Take the course, it\u0092s not that hard but you learn what you need to in an intro physics course and it is pretty interesting."
