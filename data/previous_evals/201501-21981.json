   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend ENGL 126 to another student, particularly after finishing ENGL 125 (that was another slightly frustrating, if unavoidable thing about the class - I always felt constrained in bringing up things from ENGL 125 because some of my classmates hadn't taken that). The booklist is great and so are the discussions.",
    "Take English 126 if you're eager to get a sense of more recent English poetry. If you haven't yet read Paradise Lost, come find out what you've been missing out on. Professor Richards is an excellent section leader and will help foster great discussions about each of the works you'll read. She's also really interested in modern poetry, so you might get exposure to the unique styles of Langston Hughes and Gertrude Stein as well as the standard Major English Poets syllabus. I took the course as a prospective English major, but if I wasn't, I could honestly say I would have probably taken it regardless. Our class was composed of Sophomores and Freshmen, and everyone was very engaged every day.",
    "I understand why this course is a requirement of the English major; the poems we read are important cultural reference points. However, I'm not that big on the canon, so I didn't always enjoy the readings. My interest in the English major comes more from an interest in literature than in poetry. That said, Professor Richards is wonderful. She has a real enthusiasm for the subject, she teaches it engagingly, and I feel like I grew a lot as a writer. Also, she's really cool in the traditional sense.",
    "ENGL 126 was an excellent introduction to the art of close-reading and a tantalizing taste of six major poets: Milton, Pope, Wordsworth, Eliot, and, in Professor Richards' case, Langston Hughes and Gertrude Stein. The syllabus provides a necessary background without which it would be impossible to do more detailed and specialized work in a particular era literature. More importantly, Professor Richards eased us into close-reading techniques, and we spent much helpful class time going over the basics of meter, rhyme, stanzas, ambiguity, etc. As we sharpened our analytical skills, the assignments became gradually longer and more complex. Unfortunately, Professor Richards sometimes had trouble upholding the same standard of analytical rigor in class that she expected from us in our written work. In addition, I found her organization of the syllabus to be really unsatisfying in its giving of Pope and Eliot short shrift. Still, Professor Richards was always an upbeat presence who exuded genuine enthusiasm about what we were reading, and her efforts to put an interdisciplinary spin on our approach to the texts made her section stand out from the crowd. I hope she can tweak the syllabus her second time around to better serve that approach and to do more justice to the likes of Pope and Eliot. If she can do so, and if she can maintain a consistent standard of analysis across our writings and discussion, her section will be pretty unbeatable."
