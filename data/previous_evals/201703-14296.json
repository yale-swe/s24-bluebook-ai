    "I gained a more nuanced perspective of the research design process and steps that can proactively be taken to develop and execute research projects. Additionally, I learned about tools and techniques to effectively communicate research findings and theories to a academic audiences. Furthermore, Balazs helped me develop concepts for two survey experiments that I anticipate moving forward on in the Spring 2018 semester and in my dissertation research.",
    "-different research methodologies -different approaches for research design -literature supporting different methods -pros and cons to quant vs. qualitative research",
    "I gained valuable knowledge on foundational Sociology and research design.",
    "I learned about all the different aspects one has to be aware of in order to create a good research design.",
    "Introduced with various research designs to answer theoretical puzzles"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "One strength of this course is that it teaches students about how to effectively think through research projects from concept to execution. Second, it provides students with an opportunity to learn new tools of academic research and the mediums that enable us as researchers to apply those tools. Furthermore, as a first semester PhD, I found this course to be a great way to learn from the experiences and perspectives of early career scholars (or PhDs in training) in ways that have and will continue to enrich my own research projects.",
    "The 3 hour block is a bit long, continuing to break up lectures with group work would be great.",
    "I can't think of any weaknesses. The class was well organized with a tremendous amount of reading material.",
    "The major strength was the instructor's ability to make a relatively dry topic fun and engaging with in-class exercises. The class atmosphere was always friendly and thought provoking, everybody felt comfortable asking questions any time and three hours felt like much less. I personally would have liked more sessions on qualitative methods but over all, it was a great course!",
    "Strengths - gained both conceptual and practical knowledge - balanced mix of lecture and discussion - learned various research designs Weakness - feedback on the assignments would have been helpful",
    "A great class to learn different research designs. The hands-on approach was very helpful."

    "I would recommend the course for anyone who wishes to learn more about social science research design.",
    "For anyone who wants to refine their research design skills, Balazs' course is highly recommendable because it is not only informative but also enjoyable!",
    "Yes - essential course to take for those interested in social science research",
    "Yes I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in conducting empirical research in the field of social science."
