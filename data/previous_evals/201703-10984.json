   "comments": [
    "I learned an incredible amount about how weather has been represented in literature, art, and the media throughout history, from biblical times to Hurricane Harvey. I improved my writing skills, and also my ability to analyze poetry benefitted greatly from this class.",
    "I was able to experiment with writing styles and techniques in ways that were beneficial to my development as a writer. I also learned a lot about the history of how weather has been understood, and modern thinking about climate change.",
    "Interdisciplinary thinking, literary analysis and media theory, writing skills.",
    "This course provides what I've been told an excellent seminar always should: a new way of studying and examining a question, phenomenon, or idea. Of course, the class also gave many opportunities to improve writing skills, but (for me) the most exciting part of the class was examining sometime seemingly mundane (weather) from every imaginable angle.",
    "I learned a lot about how to view media. I thought a lot in this course about why do we talk about certain subjects in certain venues whether it be on TV or in a Newspaper etc... We used these new skills to examine how the weather is talked about. Additionally, I learned a lot about how the weather operates, which was a bonus.",
    "I gained new knowledge about the history of meteorology and about definitions and history of media; I gained greater exposure to literature and art from all ages and all genres; I gained a new lens through which to consider art and science, as well as a greater awareness of the presence of weather (and all that it implies) throughout the history of humanity and human interpretation--as well as ideas of time, scale, control, chaos. I also gained writing skills such as becoming better at revising by being willing to be more critical of my own syntax and learning to balance poetry and clarity. I also improved my ability to read and gain value from diverse types of writing.",
    "t isn't Underwater Basket weaving, but when I first described M,L, & the Dub to people outside Yale, I realized it might sound pretty darn close. They were skeptical, perhaps rightfully so. (Yes, I know that I mistyped the title; I've been misnaming this course all semester, and I'm not about to start now.) But their skepticism was okay. One can't judge a book by its cover, nor a course by its title. I took the course hoping to receive an introduction to college seminars and to improve my writing abilities. Anything I learned about media, or weather, was just a side note. But for me the course succeeded on all sides. I now feel much more comfortable with the idea, logistics, and procedure of a seminar -- I think I have a fairly good idea of how to do readings with an eye towards constructively participating in class discussions (in my opinion the key is to annotate with an ANGLE). My writing DID improve. On simply hearing the title, people thought \"Media, Literature, and the Weather\" sounded like a gut, but this is one course which requires 5 papers for a grand total of 28 pages -- and a highly-thought out, detailed, and polished 28 pages at that. Because each paper is of a different type and should optimally be done in a slightly different style, I could never settle into a rut of writing -- just like how the rest of college will be, and hopefully real life as well. Producing 28 pages, while being kept on one's (writerly?) toes? CERTAINLY Media, Literature, and the Weather is not easy. And lastly, I of course, learned a lot about how weather and media intersect, and my opinion, this is how it happens: At its broadest definition, we humans disseminate and absorb information through media. In a round-about way, this information can affect our emotional state. Through even more round-about means, this information can also materially affect our lives. Weather is the same; it influences, it changes both itself and everything else, and it MATTERS. But because the weather is far bigger than us and quite literally nebulous (it's partly made up of clouds -- the naysayers can't say that I didn't learn anything of substance :) .), it's difficult to understand. As I tried to broach in my final essay, media about the weather is a way for us to know what we can't know -- to eff the ineffable. Eventually, I also think hit on a way to sway the skeptics. This is why: We breathe air, but we live in weather. (There's also a more verbose subscript, and it's this:) We breathe air, but we live in weather. In this air conditioned age, we might think we can escape it, but our air conditioners also warm the planet -- in cooling us, they simply worsen the inevitable. Like King Lear, our inner weather reflects the outside both physically and emotionally. We might think we can escape it. We can't. And of course, while the semester lasted it kinda also seemed that we also couldn't escape weather media. But again, that was fine. I didn't want to leave Media, Literature, and the Weather, and I was saddened to see it end. Thanks for a great, beneficial, fun, and thought-provoking course Professor Peters."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think this class is taught incredibly well. Sometimes, the class doesn't have time to address all the readings from the assigned list for the day, but other than that, I think this class is strong.",
    "Strengths included an incredible and engaging array of readings, and excellent in-class discussions. Sometimes, the reading load was a bit heavy, and it was difficult to give as much attention to each reading as I wanted.",
    "One of the biggest strengths of the course was the class size. We had only 9 students by the end, and this meant I could make new friends and really get to understand my peers and their thoughts. The work for this class did not feel like traditional coursework because I felt like I was preparing to talk with my close friends. Another big strength was the Professor of this course. John Peters is not only a brilliant thinker and writer, but he is one of the most entertaining teachers I have ever had. His commitment to making sure the course is relevant and engaging was definitely apparent, and we were all so lucky to take part in this course.",
    "Strengths: interesting and diverse content, wide-ranging discussions guided by the ideas and interests of the class, varied writing assignments, relational setting, interdisciplinary topics Weaknesses: not always enough time to discuss all readings and topics, occasionally some ambiguity in writing assignments or in writing feedback. Ways to improve: let each student take a turn compiling a reading assignment to bring new topics to the table, streamline reading assignments, offer writing conferences earlier",
    "Strengths (as a WR): Varied writing, varied readings Great leadership in discussions Interesting (and EXTREMELY topical) course material Weaknesses: (Perhaps this applies to all undergrad seminars at all universities...): Variation can also make it hard to pull substantial benefits from course if student effort\/engagement is low In the moment, lengthy readings that are un-referenced-in-class can feel like wasted time"

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. And I have! This is one of the most absurd, interesting topics I've ever studied, and I think many students should share the same experience I did.",
    "If the person has an interest in the way we as a culture think about weather, climate, etc., then yes. If that doesn't appeal, I would not. I enjoyed the class because I think a lot about how weather influences out society, and how climate change will affect everything in that regard.",
    "I'd recommend this class without a doubt -- I'll never view weather, or for that matter, the world, the same way, but I think more important than what this class teaches regarding the subject matter are the ways it teaches you to think.",
    "I highly recommend this course to any student! More than any other class this semester, this course consistently invigorated and excited me, and led me to examine the world around me in a different way. This class introduced me to all the best of Yale -- excellent professors, amazing discussions, and genuine, enjoyable intellectual challenge.",
    "Yes! It was fun and an exciting way to learn while contributing.",
    "The weather is a topic not many people try to look deeply behind, but when you do take the extra time to learn about it and about how we discuss it then you will learn some great things that will stick with you forever.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The reading was manageable, diverse, and engaging. As we explored different media, genres, and topics, we built up foundations of of profound ideas that went beyond the specific pieces we were working with, which allowed us to make many valuable and exciting interdisciplinary connections. We got to work on a variety of writing styles and got personal feedback. Most of all, the class encouraged individual passion and facilitated relationships--I always looked forward to coming to class, and left at the end of the semester with new friends. Professor Peters not only brought a wealth of knowledge about diverse topics, but also a knack for encouraging rich conversation guided by students' own ideas.",
    "I believe my answer in the \"what I learned\" section provides enough."
