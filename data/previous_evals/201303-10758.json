   "comments": [
    "I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. This is a great course to mark credit\/d\/fail at the beginning of the semester and decide later on whether to switch it. I found my grades steadily improving from B+ range to high A range throughout the semester, and Terry is very good about seeing this improvement and adjusting final grades to reflect true improvement. This isn't an easy class at times, but very very manageable if you are interested in Spanish.",
    "I would recommend Spanish 243 especially for those students who are in L5 Spanish but still want to be taught the Spanish language, rather than being taught another subject in Spanish. It is also a great brush up if it has been a while since your last Spanish course.",
    "SPAN 243 is an intense grammar course that is extremely enjoyable if you are truly interested in mastering the Spanish language. It is a lot of work and requires students to be very diligent in order to do well but it is also very enjoyable.",
    "Take it. You will improve.",
    "I would say, though not particularly exciting subject matter, it's a good course to brush up on your Spanish. I would recommend it.",
    "Spanish grammar seems easy, but it's very tedious and requires a tremendous amount of homework. There are only 2 tests the whole semester, which can make or break your grade.",
    "This class is good if you want to improve your Spanish speaking\/reading\/writing skills and finish your language requirement. The material is kind of boring, but Professor Seymour makes the class much better with her sense of humor.",
    "For me, this class was just to polish my Spanish language skills. I didn't really learn anything new conceptually, but rather I learned about the intricacies and nuances of what I have learned in previous Spanish courses.",
    "I would recommend it for students confident in their Spanish that also want a concrete understanding of advanced and sometimes difficult grammar",
    "this is the basic type of spanish language class that you're probably used to. great if you just need to do L5 or want to improve your spanish. there is a large volume of work, but its all easy and doesn't take too long. i enjoyed it"
