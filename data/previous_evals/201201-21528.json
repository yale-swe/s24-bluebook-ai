    "I would recommend Fr145 provided your other courses are not too heavy a load! Take it if you want to smash language requirements early or want to take further advanced classes here at Yale! Oh and its an easier gateway to the L5 program over the summer in France!",
    "French 145 is a fast paced class for students who want to learn French and speak French. I would recommend this to anyone who really wants to improve their skills in a fast-paced environment. Don\u0092t take the class if you just want to speed towards fluency, because you\u0092ll only learn as much as the actual work you put in.",
    "A great way to learn French! You progress much more quickly in an intense environment, so the gains from this course can actually amount to more than the gains from a year of L3-L4. And Professor Sherak is always super helpful!",
    "This class is great if you want to learn French quickly. It is a huge time commitment but it is completely worth it if you're invested.",
    "It's a lot of work, mostly reading, but the readings are all very interesting. It helped improve all aspects of my French by a lot. I would definitely recommend the class to someone who loves French, but I wouldn't take other reading-heavy classes with it.",
    "Of course I would recommend this class to another student! There is only one way to really learn a language: INTENSIVELY. This class forces you to learn a lot of material at a very fast rate. The time commitment for watching movies is something I wish could have been lessened--perhaps if we could have been allowed two nights to watch a movie instead of just one--but overall this was an incredible class. Take both French 125 and 145 and you will amazed by how much you can accomplish in a language in just one year!",
    "I would recommend French 145 to another student. However, I would definitely warn them that this course requires a lot of time not only in official class meetings but outside the classroom. Those who wish to take this course must be willing and ready to devote a considerable amount of their semester to studying french."
