    "CHNS 151 is hard, but it is definitely worth the time. I would definitely recommend the course to another student. It is a lot of work and the daily quizzes can be hard to keep on top of but the work definitely pays off. I have learned so much this semester and am excited to continue taking Chinese at Yale in the future.",
    "I would recommend CHNS 151 to anyone interested in continuing their Chinese language education. Both Wang Laoshi and Zhan Laoshi are great professors, and the class size is small enough for students to participate and learn a great deal. I enjoyed CHNS 151 more than CHNS 150 since its lessons were also more practical \/ applicable to real life.",
    "A continuation of Chinese 150, take it if you are interested in pursued study of Chinese. If you are not serious about Chinese, it is not worth the amount of work",
    "Chinese at Yale is like a drug, but with no high yet the same addiction and withdrawal symptoms. It's a great class that requires huge workload, but once you start you can't stop (otherwise you'll forget it all). Ultimately it's up to you whether you want to go down this path or not."
