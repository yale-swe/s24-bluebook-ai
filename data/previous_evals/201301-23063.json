   "comments": [
    "I love psychopathology, but would have liked to learn more about the disorders themselves. I think we read too many studies and didn't reach enough conclusions. Most of our discussions seemed to be mere speculations. If you're hoping to get a better idea of how people with these disorders act and how it affects them, etc, this is probably the wrong class for you. This class is true to its title -- it certainly is about the DEVELOPMENT of these psychopathologies, and therefore focuses on young child and their environments that make them more prone to developing these disorders. That said, certainly is a great class with a wonderful professor.",
    "Highly recommended! Prof. Kim-Cohen is great - she clearly cares about her students and is great and getting class discussions going. The course material is fascinating and the workload manageable (though the reading is on the heavier side). there are weekly reading responses, a midterm, a final and a one-time discussion section, overall very manageable and highly rewarding class. The class discussions were always lively and fun, definitely take this class if you get a chance to!",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It helps to have a little background in abnormal psychology, but if you know enough, it's really interesting material and the class has great discussions.",
    "Developmental Psychopathology is concerned with taking development into account when deciding what abnormal is. We got to tackle several interesting topics, such as the causes of the rise in the use of ADHD medication, how to handle psychopaths at a young age, how to improve the classification\/diagnostic system we have at the moment, and others.If you are interested in taking a developmental approach to understanding mental illnesses, then this class would interest you. Do not expect the lectures to help you come to definitive conclusions on anything; it seems that there are no answers, just possible models. That said, some of the readings were particularly interesting. Prof. Kim-Cohen cares about her students and always tries to keep us interested by including an activity each week and fostering stimulating discussions. It all depends on the makeup of your class, as is true for any seminar. It is not too much work, though the readings can be long and (very rarely) not all that novel in the conclusions they propose.",
    "Good class covering various topics about pathologies as they relate to children and adolescents; teaches important themes of the developmental psychopathology perspective like multifinality\/equifinality, biological sensitivity to context\/differential susceptibility, and other important relevant ideas in this field. Seminarsessions consisted of a perfect combination of lectures providing further background information and then discussion on the topic. Discussions could sometimes obsess about certain points (e.g. DSM-V and how it's so very evil...) and a select group of the same people harping on said points but overall a very good class widening my knowledge on this field. Probably not as hardcore and fearsome as some of the other psychology senior seminars. Definitely take if you're into psychopathology (abnormal psych) and developmental stuff (children\/adolescents).",
    "Developmental Psychopathology is an excellent course. I highly recommend it. In the class, you get an introduction to a fascinating field, and learn about the complex development of various mental illnesses. You read a lot of literature, and learn to analyze a lot of information at a high level. Professor Kim-Cohen is a great professor, and taking her course is a wonderful way of wrapping up your experience as a psychology major at Yale.",
    "An okay course that's not very much work and with a mediocre reward (in terms of knowledge learned and discussion)",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Especially those interested in clinical psychology.",
    "a hugely important, informative course that sets the groundwork for many important research questions. students are profoundly aware of the need for a developmental approach to mental illness by the time the course is over. the topics are very relevant to current events, and the class provides a good environment for discussing even controversial topics in an open setting. this is one of the best classes I've taken at yale, and I would take it again in a heartbeat. it was the best way to end senior year.",
    "Take this class if you can get in! The only work are short reading responses weekly, a short film review, and your long final paper. Definitely worth taking, and you'll have some great discussions.",
    "It's a great senior seminar. Professor Kim-Cohen really wants her students to do well and is there to help you if you need any support writing your senior thesis. The class is half lecture and half discussion which is a good balance. Some of the topics might be repetitive if you've taken Abnormal Psychology, but this gives you the chance to go into more depth and discuss the topics with other students. The workload was also fair (weekly responses, five page film analysis paper, and senior paper)."
