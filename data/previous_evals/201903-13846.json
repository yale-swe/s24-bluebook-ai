    "A thorough understanding of how to read scientific ag papers-- how to read between the lines on conclusions presented and better understand how they came to their findings.",
    "I learned a great deal about agroecosystems as well as how to more effectively read and understand scientific articles.",
    "A review of statistics as used in agricultural research, methods of AG research, best practice on reading and evaluating academic papers, and a deeper knowledge of historic and current trends in environmental impacts of agriculture.",
    "A broad overview of technical agricultural concepts and trends. I feel much more comfortable reading agricultural journal articles and discussing scientific agricultural related concepts.",
    "Broad review across different forms of agriculture and related issues. Good knowledge of the literature and emerging concepts in the space.",
    "This course was awesome - I really liked learning about this topic from a \"grounded in science\" approach. I also think the homework was interesting and realistic. I liked Steve's way of teaching - some technical concepts, conversation, and personal guidance on our projects.",
    "Close reading of academic papers. A view into the current agricultural research being published.",
    "How to read scientific and technical articles. How to analyze a region and develop a theory of change.",
    "I learned so much about agriculture, such as conservation agriculture, perennial agriculture, soil health, and more (had no background in agriculture before this) . I also learned how to efficiently read and synthesize scientific papers."

    "Very well, the curriculum aligned exactly with what I hoped to learn in the class.",
    "The knowledge, skills, and insights I gained aligned well with my expectations, though I would have liked to have a more well-rounded understanding of agriculture and particularly regarding the environmental issues that need our attention and efforts now and in the future.",
    "very closely",
    "I thought it was well-matched. I knew that the class wasn't going to teach me everything I needed to know about agronomy and it was going to be very based on reading and understanding scientific literature.",
    "Very good class which covers a lot of material. The class aligned with my expectations although at times I expected the class to dive deeper into specific topics than it did.",
    "Very well - exceeded expectations.",
    "I had expected to learn more foundational details about agriculture in general. My other exceptions aligned well with the class.",
    "Very well!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of the course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course is thorough in its exploration of different areas of research in ag, and Steve and Dan are both just awesome and dedicated to helping students learn. It was at times just an unfeasible amount of work.",
    "The course could be better structured to emphasize quality over quantity as far as weekly summaries and assigned readings. At times, the workload felt heavy and more like busy work than intended to teach us how to engage with scientific articles effectively. I think that by delving into one article and reviewing other articles for the purposes of supplementing the content of the main article, perhaps also with discussion questions and activities included in the class, students would have a more manageable workload and better understanding of scientific reading\/research.",
    "One of the main weakness was the large class size- this made discussions challenging occasionally though the instructors did a good job of creating space for small groups and trying to bring that back to the lecture and discussion as a whole.",
    "The end of the course had SO much work. A presentation, final paper, and a final exam is a lot. It felt unnecessary way to evaluate our progress with all three of these components. I didn't like how during the last class when we gave our presentations that some students weren't kept to the time limit, which is unfair to those of us who did keep our presentations short. Also some people didn't even give their presentations - which is also unfair. It should have been on Steve and Dan to actually know how many people needed to give their presentations and how long that would take so that everyone could present.",
    "Very good build towards the final assignment. It becomes an organic and meaningful project intertwined with the class. Very strong professor and TA who provide prompt feedback and guidance. Good range of topics and perspectives on agriculture provided. I enjoyed my classmates who took the class - professor and TA helped provide a congenial atmosphere. The class spent too much time reviewing readings as a peer group which they had read and written about the previous week. At times this becomes redundant and less engaging. This portion of the class could be shortened in order to cover new topics in class. The weekly reading responses become too tiresome\/repetitive by the end of the semester.",
    "Strengths: - The coursework is very applied - Steve is awesome - Steve draws from his personal work experience and provides a practical grounding to the topic - The science-based inquiry approach - Quite a bit of student-driven learning and openness to feedback - Student interaction and discussion Weaknesses: - The classroom was not big enough for our group and the table and chairs are uncomfortable - sometimes the homework was a bit overwhelming but Steve made efforts to cut back on this halfway through class",
    "Strengths: Insights into current topics and scientific discussions. It was very valuable to learn how to read scientific papers and summarize them. Weaknesses: Statistical methods should have been discussed in the beginning of the class to prepare students for the papers. Longer lectures instead of discussions among students to allow students to benefit from the lecturer's and TA's knowledge and experience. The assignments could have been clearer and it would be nice if they should be uploaded to canvas earlier. More extensive feedback on assignments would have been appreciated.",
    "Pros: Steve and TA Dan are incredibly knowledgeable and such a great resource. I wish they had lectured a bit more (instead of long discussions on the papers we were assigned) since they know so much. However, the class discussions were also very interesting and valuable. Dan and Steve also sometimes had in class data exercises which were valuable and engaging, and not too daunting. Cons: I felt like the expectations for the final project could have been made a bit more clear at the beginning of the course. The workload was also a bit heavy, although Steve adjusted for this after mid semester reviews."

   "question_text": "What advice would you give to a student considering taking this class?",
   "comments": [
    "Make sure you have enough time in your semester to take the class! Myself and other students all found that we regularly spent a good 10 hours a week trying to get things done for this course, and it was really frustrating to want to do well on our work but just not have the time to devote because we had other obligations.",
    "I would advise other students that the course is a lot of work on a weekly basis, but you would certainly gain a lot of knowledge about agriculture and the environment as a result.",
    "Take it if you want to learn how to read and interpret research and literature on the topic",
    "I'm not sure what the next iteration will look like but as long as you're clear on the expectations of the class and know what you want to get out of it, I think it's a fabulous class.",
    "Take it but be prepared for a large work load.",
    "Take it! This class was both interesting and formed a group of students who are interested in furthering our learning on this topic that I hope will continue into the rest of our time here. The homework was a bit heavy for this class so make sure you have time in your schedule.",
    "Don't expect a classical introduction into agriculture. Some pre-knowledge about agriculture and statistics is very helpful.",
    "Take this course if you're interested in agriculture and want a solid background on the subject."
