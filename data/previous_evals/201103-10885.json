    "Yes.",
    "This is a great course for learning about microfossils and microscopic life. In particular, you will realize how many of these organisms are cooler than you would think was possible for a single celled organism. I would highly recommend this course to any interested student.",
    "Yes i would recommend to others, it was an interesting overview of the topics.",

    "It deepens my knowledge and contributes to my research a lot.",
    "This course filled in one big missing chunk of my paleontological knowledge: microfossils. It is not very directly useful for my dissertation, but gave me the basics in a way that would allow me to begin a micropaleontological research project, if I ever wanted or needed to.",
    "This course gives me a better understanding the marine life diversity especially these microfossils and how to use them to reconstruct the past climate and environment change. Besides, this course involve large amount of reading which is really helpful to get a snapshot of recent research developments."
