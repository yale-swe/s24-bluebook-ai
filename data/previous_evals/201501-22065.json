    "Yellowstone & Global Change is the best class at Yale. I wish I could take it again. If you don't take it, you are an idiot. You'll learn some fascinating facts and make some even more fascinating friends, not the least of which is Professor Susan G. Clark. Be prepared to work; the readings and weekly writing responses will keep you busy, but you'll be learning so much you'll hardly notice. The 15 page paper at the end can be a challenge, but learning the policy process and getting to apply it makes it well worth it. Take Yellowstone and Global Change!",
    "Take this class! No regrets. Class is always interesting.",
    "Take this class. That is all.",
    "This is a great class. You will learn a lot about Yellowstone and management. However, some of the material can be confusing, even if you do the reading in depth. There is more work than there might seem, especially at the tail end of the class.",
    "Yellowstone is definitely one of my favorite classes this semester. There's a fair amount of reading and the class is primarily discussion based. The workload is pretty light. There's a reading response every week, two presentations and final paper. The work is engaging though and I've been told the field trip is great",
    "Take this class! Like Yellowstone, it is truly a gem. It will change the way you view the world, and a free trip to Yellowstone isn't bad!"
