    "Global Black Power was the best seminar I've ever taken. Professor Magaziner is so bomb - a great facilitator w\/ a flexible personality. The class was a great group too; you definitely don't have to be a History major or have background knowledge in Black Studies to contribute to this class. The material is comprehensive & important, & you'll see how relevant it is & how thoroughly you'll go through it. I felt I was learning more from this class than any of my other classes from the class's deep engagement with the material, how we somehow reached consensual conclusions from texts we sometimes struggled with going through on our own. Every week I was making connections between this class & my other classes, which is only possible if you have a good understanding of the material & it's made interesting to you. At the same time, the reading was challenging much of the time, & work for this class took more time than any of my other classes this semester. We did suggest more focused reading, so maybe Professor Magaziner will fine-tune the reading load for the future of this course, so the texts will be more to the point. There's one 1-page reading response per week & a final 15-page paper; most of the work is earnest participation though. I definitely recommend this class & other classes Professor Magaziner teaches!",
    "It's a seminar that surveys the history of black power movements and conflicts around the globe. I would highly recommend it.",
    "Take this class to learn. This is the kind of class that is integral to the Yale experience. If you not a lot about the topic or nothing at all, it is worth it. This class will make you think differently about yourself, those around you, society and nations. It is a life changing class.",
    "Definitely a great class, participation is really important so you should definitely do the readings. There's a lot of reading so it's a significant time commitment.",
    "I would definietrly recommend this class.",
    "Great class! The readings were relevant and provocative."
