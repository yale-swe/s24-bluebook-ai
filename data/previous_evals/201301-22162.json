   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The workload is fairly light, the economics rather logical, and the content interesting. It can, at times, seem to get a little repetitive, as most addictions are relatively similar and lead to similar policies. Still, It was a fun class, and Jody is absolutely amazing as a professor and a mentor.",
    "Very interesting topic and great coverage of the issues through the readings. Discussion was underwhelming",
    "Take it",
    "I recommend Econ 461. Interesting material, weekly assignments that are not too difficult, and a 10 page final on a topic of your choice.",
    "take this class! sindelar is very nice and knowledgeable, if you are interested in public health (or just addictive substances and how society deals with them) this class will expand your thinking and possibly change your views on how government should approach public health issues. The economic backbone for understanding addiction adds just enough structure to make this class to those with a casual interest in economics. workload is completely manageable (moderate readings, straightforward reading responses, a group presentation and a finalpresentation and paper). sometimes discussion flounders when students haven't done the assigned reading but the reading is interesting enough that if you have any real interest in the subject you will take something away from it if you make time to read it all. definitely pre-register if you are an econ major or you will have a tough time getting a spot.",
    "Take it, it's not that work intensive and yet you learn a lot",
    "This class is great for those interested in economics and public health. While a bit light on the economics side, it was so great to actually be taking an economics class on a topic that is relevant and interesting. Take this class if you are interested in medicine or public health and are an econ major. I really loved it and am so glad I took it!",
    "I enjoyed it. The trek over to the School of Public Health is not fun at all, but you only have to do it once a week. Take the course if you're interested in the material, and do the reading! It's really easy to get away with not doing it, but you really won't get anything out of the course that way and the readings are actually really great and interesting.",
    "It's an interesting course if you are want to know more about addictive substances and the policies used to control their use!",
    "Take it, it's interesting and unique"
