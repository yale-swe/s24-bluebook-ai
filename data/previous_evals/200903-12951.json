    "yes",
    "Yep. But it will be infinitely better if you have a great section Professor.",
    "probably the least enjoyable of the three DS classes--there's too much reading and not enough time to fully grasp all of it. Also, sometimes its difficult to tell whether the class is primarily focused on history, historiography, or political theory, which makes it more difficult to get a handle on the \"big picture\". All in all though a good class",
    "Yes.",
    "Recommended for those who know what they are getting into. A LOT of reading. Some texts are not the most interesting ever, but others read like storybooks. Do not expect to \"learn Western History\" as much as learn the works of some Western historians and political thinkers. This is a class in texts, not events.",
    "This was a solid section, and discussion flowed smoothly and was interesting enough. Professor Semmel is thoughtful and gives competent criticism, though I suppose if you absolutely insist on having your papers returned to you promptly then this is not the class for you.",
    "I would recommend DS History. You learn so much, and you'll be glad for it by the end.",
    "Yes, I would. The reading load is a lot, but it is worth it, and some (like Polybius and Tacitus) are really great.",
    "I would definitely recommend history and politics itself to another student but I would warn against taking Semmel's section at all costs. It really made it much more difficult to appreciate and understand the material.",
    "DS History and Politics provides an interesting introduction to political theory from historical and philosophical perspectives. It provides a refreshing and stimulating challenge to rarely challenged assumptions in American political life (e.g. that democracy is a good idea). Few students love all the texts we read (I wasn't a huge Thucydides fan) but most liked at least some of the works (I particularly liked Aristotle's \"Politics\" and Polybius' history). First semester H&P is also an investment - the second semester reading list is incredible. You get the most out of DS by doing all the reading, but you can still learn a lot by doing only parts of the reading if you choose which passages to read intelligently. Professor Semmel is an expert on material we read second semester - he's a really nice guy, but I don't particularly recommend his section over that of the other H&P professors.",
    "Directed Studies History and Politics is a study of the great events in history as told by the greatest Greek, Roman, and medieval writers, as well as a political analysis by thinkers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas. DS allows a close reading of the text and a discussion of the ideas presented with a professor and a small group of some of the smartest minds at Yale in an intellectual introduction to the Western canon."
