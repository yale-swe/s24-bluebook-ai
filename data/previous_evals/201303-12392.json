    "I would summarize the course as an overview of astronomy, a course that gives one the gist of the field. For a new student, this would be an ideal course to take up as it would summarize in one semester the fundamentals of astronomy and give the student a flavour of the field, and inform him\/her of what to look forward to in this field.Despite that, I would not recommend a beginner, who is new to the field of astronomy\/astrophysics, to take this course since the syllabus was too wide and hence learning eventually became a more daunting task than an enjoyable experience.",
    "As I mentioned before, it's a broad sweep of a lot of topics. This could be useful to incoming students, but again, could be tailored more carefully to the individuals.",
    "I would say that the class is an effective way to introduce you to topics that you may not have seen in your undergrad, but not an effective way to become proficient at these topics. I would advise the student to take the class, but spend a significant time on their own reading up on subjects they find challenging and finding problems to work through instead of focusing on homework problems that might not challenge them or problems that they have done before."
