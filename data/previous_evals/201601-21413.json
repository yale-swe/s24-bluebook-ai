   "comments": [
    "Do not take this class unless you have to. Homework and exams are painfully computational and dry, especially towards the end of the semester, and grading is random, since it is based on homework and two in-class open book exams, the second of which is a little too long for the time given - expect yourself to be rushing through mindless computations, solving different versions of the same problem multiple times. Lots of computation and calculation; this is not a course that a Mathematics major will find interesting.",
    "Yes; the workload is light, exams\/grading very fair, take it if you need it for your major or simply love math",
    "Dry math class with a lot of proofs that confuse you in class and a lot of straight forward but absolutely tedious problems for homework. Most of the grade depends on the exams that are hard considering nobody goes to class because reading the textbook is so much easier...",
    "Good introduction to diff eq. Exams were long but material was reasonable. Clear expectations and organized lecture. Does not cover in-depth proofs.",
    "Fine class. Take it if you like math, its harder than Linear but easier than math 120.",
    "A pretty ordinary class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in problem solving in any capacity.",
    "Pretty chill class, the type of math class where you learn stuff for the pset then forget it right after you do the pset, then when tests come up you cram all the stuff you forgot and do fine. If your schedule's not too bad you should probably take the ENAS one, but I had a rough schedule so this was fine",
    "This was a fine course and a requirement for several majors. It wasn't mind-blowing, but I did learn the material. Show up to class--even if the first couple are a bit confusing, it is helpful. The homework and tests are reasonable.",
    "I would recommend math 246 if you need to solve ODEs in your field of study.",
    "I would recommend the class to a fellow student because it is a good introduction into ordinary differential equations.",
    "It's not easy of a class. THe final was long and hard. You're not gonna learn much to be honest, or at least you're gonna have to learn by yourself.",
    "A good elective math course. Not too hard but the exams are worth a lot and hard to finish. Definitely recommend.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. If you don't, please don't. It's not too heavy of a math class - with Moncrief it was psets straight out of the textbook.",
    "Basically, you take this class if you have to for your major. Pretty basic stuff. It's nice if you like writing a lot of equations. The book is super important because not only are the homework answers in the back, but he takes most exam questions from the book (meaning those answers are also in the back). Weekly psets take a few hours or so. Two midterms, both open note and open book.",
    "I would recommend MATH 246 to anyone looking for a straightforward math class, as I found the course to be both interesting and manageable. Professor Moncrief is a good professor, and has clear notes and explanations.",
    "This class has many applications in multiple fields and should be taken to get comfortable with those applications."
