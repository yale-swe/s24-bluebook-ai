   "comments": [
    "You'll probably be required to take this course, but if not, don't take it.",
    "I would recommend it due to the usefulness of exposure to these methods.",
    "If they are to learn more about current biophysical\/biochemical research progress, I would recommend.",
    "I would never recommend this class - the information was conveyed poorly, it was extremely disorganized, and felt irrelevant to the field the MCGD track is geared towards.",
    "This course provides a beneficial survey of biophysical\/biochemical techniques which you will undoubtedly encounter sometime in your graduate\/scientific career. Yes, I would recommend it. It provides you with an enhanced knowledge set to tackle future problems\/experiments in lab.",
    "I would recommend this course to other students, partly because it's required for my track. I think the subject matter was really important to learn, but you would be able to get through the class without understanding of any of the concepts.",
    "I good introduction to these techniques. I learned the names and general ideas\/applications behind a lot of techniques, but feel like I never really went into any depth on any of them. Some of the sections are better taught than the others - I wish there was more consistency in this respect.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this course unless the person has a large interest in biochemical concepts",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class if someone was looking for an elective. I liked the visits to labs and actual demos and tours of the equipment rooms. I didn't feel like I was learning a lot in lectures and though homework. Although I have to admit that somehow I did absorb some information on each of the subjects.",
    "Useful, but you won't be an expert when you're done.",
    "This class gave an overview of relevant and cutting-edge techniques available. Relevant papers were discussed and reviewed.",
    "I would not recommend this class to a friend. The demos were interesting, but most of the lectures were not suitable for an introductory class."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "Not so related to my future research but is really interesting !",
    "I did not feel that this course was relevant at all to the work I was doing in lab, or will eventually do in my thesis work. It was hard to get a sense of how this would actually be related to work I would be doing for my thesis, it only seemed relevant to those interested in structural biology.",
    "This course definitely deepened my knowledge of many of the techniques other researchers use. Considering this is a competitive research environment (research in general, grants, etc.), it is essential to stay on top of the available resources to investigate your area of research. I think this course helped me currently be updated. It is likely I will use one of the techniques we learned about for my dissertation research; I don't know yet.",
    "\u00ef\u00bf\u00bcI think this material is really important to our scientific careers, especially to my classmates who won't work with any quantitive data in the next few years. Without this course, many people would slip by without knowing how x-ray crystallography or EM works.",
    "This course definitely introduced me to some of the instruments and techniques available, although I definitely don't have a deep understanding of the subject matter.",
    "Sections on mass spec and equilibrium binding were most useful. Microscopy also great. X-ray section was good to but no matter how many times I hear the mathematical principles explained they never really sink in.",
    "This course gave me a variety of ideas on how to answer biochemical and biophysical questions.",
    "Introduction to methods was good for knowing techniques exist, but nothing being this"
