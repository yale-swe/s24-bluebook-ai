   "comments": [
    "A great survey of Chinese anthropology from the eyes of an archaeologist. Very approachable subject matter with interesting material, even for those without any background in archaeology or Chinese. The papers were somewhat difficult, but manageable.",
    "This course is a good overall survey of the cultures of Ancient China. The topic is one rarely studied outside of a specialized course such as this, and the archaeological lens through which the material is examined provides an interesting and insightful perspective.",
    "Needed it to fulfill the arch requirement of the Anthro major. Workload wasn't bad at all (2 short papers, a take home midterm and a take home final which were both short), but unless you're fascinated by the material, could be a bit tedious\/boring.",
    "yes if you really want to, but you might be better off reading a general survey of archaeology of china....yes, the field is changing dramatically and new information is updated daily, but the class is just so boring...",
    "I really liked this course! At times I found the lectures a little dry but in general the material was very interesting and most of this stuff you probably couldn't learn anywhere else. Also, the course readings were very well-selected.",
    "ANTH 215 is a class that focuses more on examination of pottery and bronze vessels of the Neolithic and the Bronze Ages. It would have been nice to extend the class into discussing other technology such as procelain wares. The scarcity of information on the Neolithic makes it difficult to read and fully understand the culture. Take it if you're interested in pots.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student if she or he had knowledge of China at any levels."
