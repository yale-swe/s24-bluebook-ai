    "learn to write class",
    "Yes, it is a good introductory english class. You will learn to write stronger papers while also gaining skills in reading and breaking down more difficult texts.",
    "I personally would not recommend this course; I had hoped that I would be given tips and help to improve my writing skills but I do not feel that this was accomplished. There was more emphasis on reading and literature than on style and writing.",
    "English 114 is a great introductory course in order to learn more about college writing. The classes are small so you'll get great individualized attention and this is also a great time to get to know your professors. I would 100% recommend this course to any student who is interested in majoring in science\/math and wants to take a writing course related to this. I feel that this topic is related to current events today like global warming.",
    "Recommended. An important introduction to college-level writing regardless of your previous experience. Not as diverse or \"fun\" as, say, 120, but useful to write good academic essays before moving on to other writing styles. I present the usual caveat, however: be sure that your 114 section has subject matter that is interesting to you. \"Extinction\" sounded interesting but was often dry and abstract--not what I wanted out of the seminar. Shop around if possible! Regardless of the subject matter, however, Professor Groves is friendly, approachable, and extremely helpful, especially via email and during office hours. Four essays total, with almost no work other than readings. The standard for A grades is that an essay must be so good that it can be submitted for departmental awards, so do expect an upward progression in how you do as the semester progresses.",
    "You write papers and read stuff.",
    "Absolutely. Take the class and make sure you try to find the section most intersting to you and not what your friends might possibly be doing.",
    "An intense study of one particular topic within a small group of people. Yes I would recommend it to anyone who feels their writing isn't at the college level.",
    "Solid intro writing class.",
    "I would recommend English 114 to anyone who is not confident in their writing. Writing is an important skill to have and this class will help you bring it to the college level."
