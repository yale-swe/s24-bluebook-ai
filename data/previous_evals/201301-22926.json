   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you are interested in darkrooms and film photography! I really enjoyed this class, and definitely would take it again. The only thing I wished that I had known before signing up for this class is how much it would cost. Between the camera, photography paper, and the film, I spend $300-$400 over the course of the semester, which was very frustrating. That being said, if you have the money and the time to commit to the darkroom (roughly 8 hours\/week), then you should definitely take this class with Vicky because it is really fun and a nice break from academic work.",
    "This course is an excellent introduction to the technique of black and white film photography. It covers history and crucial figures, but mainly goes over camera and darkroom technique. For a first-timer in the darkroom or someone who has a summer or two of experience as I did, this is a very enjoyable course from which there is always more to learn. There are some time-consuming aspects to the course, and these are UNAVOIDABLE (no matter how skilled or experienced you are, you will need to spend several hours a week in order to keep up and upwards of eight hours for each critique). I enjoyed the course greatly and would recommend it enthusiastically to any student of any background who has the time to take it.One final note: there are some unavoidable costs (film and paper) that come along with this course. It will cost money to have supplies, and without the supplies it is impossible to complete any work for a grade. The costs are not insurmountable, but it is important to understand that taking the course will commit you to pay for your materials.",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who does not have a very busy schedule, and is confident eough in themselves to whatever it takes to get the shot within reasonable bounds of course.",
    "This is a great course for anyone considering an art of non-art major. Easy humanities credit. It's very fun and the two hours of class time fly by very quickly. Class time is usually spent looking at work of famous photographers or in the dark room. DON'T LET THIS ART CLASS FOOL YOU THOUGH: this course is a ton of work. I took two QRs this semester and this class was easily more of a time commitment than either one of them. Between shooting, developing, and printing, you can easily spend several hours a day every day of the week working for this class. It's all fun though, and the professor Vicky is great, so it is all worth it and relaxing. Plus making your own photographs to have, hang, or distribute can be fun. The class also pushes you to get out and experience New Haven and your surroundings in different ways. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone.",
    "A lot of work but if you want to dive into photography this is a great course. I loved it and intend on going further down the film path (p.s. film is greater than all things digital).",
    "Absolutely recommend it. Such a worthwhile class.",
    "a hands on introductory course to photographt. iit is what you make it to bemthe amount of effort you put in determines how much you can get out of it. extremely time consuming.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it to students who would be able to commit a great deal of time to this class."
