    "As the Global Capstone is a requisite to the Global Affairs major, there's little flexibility in whether or not you'll be able to take this course. The experience is largely dependent upon both the Capstone advisor and on the other members of the group - I was very fortunate to enjoy my experience with both, but I don't know that all other groups had the same experience.",
    "You have to take it as a requirement so no real choice here. Try to have your best attitude and really invest in your project. A bunch of GA majors did seem burnt out by the end of their projects; that's sad to see.",
    "I'd recommend it strongly as a culmination of the Global Affairs major - my only caveat would be for prospective students to deeply evaluate if the Capstone subject they are applying for truly interests them and would hold their fascination over the semester.",
    "Professor Malvesti is the most demanding capstone professor, but also the absolute best. This will make your capstone the best one you have ever had.",
    "Highly recommend, but I think the quality of your project really depends on who your capstone advisor is and the quality of your team. I lucked out and was part of MM's capstone group, which, besides having an amazing advisor, somehow fortuitously also had an amazing group. The work was really interesting, our client (SOCOM) was really interesting, and our team was fantastic. 10\/10 experience, couldn't have asked for anything better."
