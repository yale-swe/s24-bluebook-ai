    "This is an intensive survey of the modern half the the western literary canon. I would fully recommend this class to any student because it provides a perfect background for any field in the humanities.",
    "Some great books on the syllabus. Class is ok. Would take it again because I'd take DS again, but I wouldn't take this on its own. To be fair, I wouldn't really take a Lit class on its own for any reason. So I'd guess this class is better than most Lit classes. Take DS tho."
