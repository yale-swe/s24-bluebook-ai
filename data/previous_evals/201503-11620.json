   "comments": [
    "There's not much you can do if you wanna be a ChemE major. Try and make the best out of it!",
    "I would definitely recommend that you don't take it unless you absolutely have to. The dry material along with the poor administration of the class made it just a bad experience.",
    "If you want to get a chemical engineering degree, take this class. Otherwise, there are better classes at Yale for learning science or math.",
    "If this is for your major then take it. It is not super hard or time consuming expect to be frustrated though.",
    "CENG 210 is an introduction to chemical mass balance course. I would recommend it, as it is easy to grasp and overall fun.",
    "Good class with Taylor. I would recommend it if you are interested in the major. Do not take otherwise.",
    "This class is an awful introduction to chemical engineering. I am considering dropping the major after this class, as it was just so frustrating. I would not recommend this course unless you are completely set on chemical engineering. Be prepared to teach yourself the material and be left guessing what material will be included on tests.",
    "This class is horribly run and explained. I leaned essentially nothing in class. Gods speed.",
    "Overall, CENG 210 is a good class to determine whether or not pursuing a degree in Chemical Engineering is what you truly want. Although many doors open (not necessarily within this Chem E field) with this degree, the core principle of it is problem solving and thinking through situations. This class, which focuses mainly on material and energy balances, is all about that idea, and this is the skill many employers look for in engineers. It can be a tough class if you don't put the time in, but I would recommend it to students interested in engineering.",
    "I would take it if you need to take it, and most likely, if you are a cheme or an environmental major, you do. I feel like learning the information on sapling will be enough for you to do well in the clas."
