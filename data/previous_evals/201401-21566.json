    "Very good class, you'll be better at reading scientific papers by the end of the semester, and you'll be able to grasp the basics of earth science. Pretty dope on the whole",
    "a light class. minimum work. your papers make you learn a lot though.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. I'm a non-science major, and I felt like this course taught me a lot but had a manageable workload. Most of your grade hinges on a couple of large papers on the subject of your choice.",
    "EVST 200 is an overview of Earth's major processes and how they relate to each other to make our planet what it is. The homework for each class is to read a chapter in the textbook and answer some discussion questions - basically just reading comprehension. Every couple of weeks you also have to present a research paper with a partner, which allows you to get to know other people in the class. There are no tests - just a short mid-term paper, and then a long final research paper. If you're interested in glaciers, volcanoes, and earthquakes, this class is amazing!",
    "This was a great intro geology class in a seminar format. For each meeting, you read a chapter of the textbook, then Professor Park asks a list of discussion questions that he emails beforehand. You get the most out of the class by reading the whole chapter, but some people just skim or prepare for a few specific questions. Also, two pairs of students give presentations on academic articles related to the chapter's topic. Some of the articles are pretty confusing, and preparing for presentations can be difficult, but as a geology major, I found this aspect to be the most rewarding part of the class. Learning how to analyze academic papers is a really good skill for any field. Your grade depends on your presentations and two essays, a 5-7 page paper in the middle of the class and a 15-20 page final paper. Really long, but the professor helps you with your topic. Overall, this was a great class, largely due to Professor Park's engaging and hilarious teaching style. He's crazy and awesome.",
    "Not a gut, but not the worst workload, either. Good teachers. Start the papers early.",
    "Overall I'm glad that I took this class. It gave me a good general understanding of how the earth works. The format of the seminars is pretty straightforward (discussion questions from reading + student presentations), which can get a little repetitive. Being a survey course, it is hard to get to the depth of certain materials and I found myself cutting corners because of that. I suppose how much you learn depends on how much you are willing to put into the class. I actually enjoyed giving the presentations and doing research for the papers, when active learning is required, but I do wish that I had paid more attention in the reading and in class.",
    "This class is for geology majors or for students seriously interested in geology. Don't be mislead by the nickname \"rocks for jocks\"",
    "Again, not precisely a gut, but a good class!",
    "This was a great science credit. It requires neither problem sets nor exams, only class discussion of the textbook readings, presentations on scientific papers, a midterm paper, and a final paper. Thus, it is perfect for those students who are more inclined to the humanities. The seminar format is perfect; I really wish more science courses were in this format. You actually get to discuss science as a group with an expert in the field! I came away knowing a lot more about how the earth works. The textbook readings were interesting and easily understood. Although questions about the reading are discussed in each class, you can get away with some good skimming and still participate. The major pain of the course is presenting on scientific papers in pairs. We each presented on 7, which meant an average of about 1 presentation every other week. Sometimes they are interesting, but mostly they are just annoying and a good amount of work. Many of the papers are very difficult to understand. Still, by the end you get pretty good at identifying what\u2019s important in these papers, which makes preparing for the presentations much easier. Also, the final paper was 15-20 pages, excluding figures, making it the longest paper I have ever written. So that was very time consuming and stressful for me. But I thought the teaching staff handled it well and were there to help the whole time. And, at the end of the day, I learned a lot about my topic. What\u2019s more, Prof. Park is a very chill dude, who, on many occasions, would lighten the mood with bar jokes, his love for Italian cuisine, and random accents. He and Joe Panzik, the TA, were both very accommodating and helpful outside of class. Even though I put in a lot of work for this course, it is way, way less work than any science course I\u2019ve come across here (which is why I gave it a \"same\"); and far more pleasant (which is why I gave it a \"very good\").",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone at Yale, even if you\u2019re not a geology or even a science major. If you are a geology major, this course gives a great overview of geology topics and will help give you a better idea of what specific field of geology you\u2019re most interested in. If you\u2019re not a geology major, you should still think about taking this class, everyone should know a bit about what makes the world operate and what makes the land look the way it does. Also, for non-science majors, this class doesn\u2019t get too technical, so it isn\u2019t too hard to keep up with the material."
