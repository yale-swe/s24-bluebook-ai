    "I definitely increased my mastery of Classical Chinese, both in terms of reading it in Sao verse style but also understanding commentaries. As per usual in a Mick Hunter course, I honed my skepticism and inclinations to think outside the box, which not only enabled me to pitch some crazier ideas than usual but also run wild with them.",
    "I practiced reading (and following along with reading) literary Chinese by auditing this course. I was also able to think critically about the unity and identifiability of the Chuci anthology (and anthologies in general) while the conversation bounced across the table. I was able to witness some of Professor Hunter's thought processes and working habits (all the tools he uses, the way he was developing the paper he shared with us, and so on) which was a cool insight into the scholarship-producing process that I aim to grow familiar with and begin participating in."

   "comments": [
    "I really appreciated the flexibility of this course to allow us to explore the tradition and texts in ways that appealed to our own natural curiosity and thought processes. I felt that the course did pretty well in balancing the sheer immensity (and at times, impenetrability) of the tradition while chipping away at what we could talk about and discuss. I particularly liked how, in later classes, we began discussions with large-scale questions and issues, and then moved on to picking apart particular moments in the text in close analysis.",
    "I thought it went very well. Developing the syllabus as we went along seemed to work for the students. Classes with small numbers of students always have the best conversations (high-level intellectually, open, and enjoyable)."

    "I would recommend this course to the bold, the brave, and perhaps the little bit foolhardy - but also those who are ready to take their next step into higher level study of ancient Chinese literature. Its quite a lot to bite off and jurys still out on whether I chewed it, but its definitely a very challenging course that will push you to improve your critical understanding of the subject (in this case, the Chuci tradition and genre).",
    "It was great. We were actually trying to think through problems together that did not already have definitive answers. Students should seek out classes like this... workload was very high for an audited course, but even when I had not read everything I was supposed to, I was able to quietly listen to the conversation and still learn. Sometimes I used the course as my opportunity to listen and then read to figure out \"what are they talking about?!\" I suppose that's what happens when you overfill your plate. I am very happy I stuck with the class, however. I am becoming a believer in learning by exposure. But I have noticed that if I don't write or speak about what I learn, it all gets confused and my thinking doesn't really go anywhere. That is why some participation is important."
