    "While the lessons in grammar were very helpful, I would have appreciated more structured work on vocabulary. Also, while I enjoyed the reading comprehension essays in the textbook, work on something longer e.g. a short book might have been a good way to develop skills. The email exchange was a bit disorganized though this was no one's fault, I wonder if there might be a better way to practice communication skills.",

   "comments": [
    "5 days a week is always painful, but the workload isn't too intense. Lots of little things to keep up with (project components, email exchange, etc.), and it's easy to fall behind, but there are also lots of opportunities to improve your grade throughout the semester. My writing improved most of all (two short essays, an email exchange, and a final project with written components). Would highly recommend Marion Gehlker as an instructor -- she's responsive, provides clear feedback, and is always immensely kind and understanding.",
    "Yes,you learn a lot of different aspects about the german culture",
    "I would recommend this course to a graduate student who needed to learn to read, speak, and write German. At my level of engagement, it was mostly helpful for developing my oral and reading skills but that was because I didn't participate in some of the writing components."
