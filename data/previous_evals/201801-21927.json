    "I would highly recommend continuing the Russian sequence to anyone who completed L1! This is a really well organized course, with small groups and committed instructors, which makes it a great environment for language studies. Even though the class meets every day, I always looked forward to it because my group and the instructors were really fun to work with. Julia and Dasha, this year's TF, are both extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the class. Their love for teaching and quality of classes really gave me a strong basis to continue advancing my Russian and strengthened my interest in Russian language and culture.",
    "Russian is definitely not an easy language, and trying to learn all of the case endings and the overly complex grammar definitely made me want to hit my head against a wall sometimes, but it is still worthwhile. Julia is a little scary sometimes, but if her sassy remarks aren't directed at you it's actually really funny, and she definitely acknowledges hard work and effort where she sees it, even if you struggle a bit. Overall, I would recommend Russian to another student, but only if they're willing to put in the effort.",
    "Absolutely, Russian at Yale is incredible!",
    "Yes! Take it; it's amazing and not actually that hard"
