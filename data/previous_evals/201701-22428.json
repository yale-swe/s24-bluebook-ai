    "I learned about the relevant and prominent debates in Development Economics over the past few decades.. I also improved my ability to read, understand and interpret economic research papers.",
    "Interesting discussions of dev papers",
    "ADE was a great course in terms of understanding a broad range of development issues and being exposed to the literature in these fields. The research paper requirement was a brilliant learning experience.",

    "In depth application of micro techniques to development economics.",

   "comments": [
    "A lot of room to decide the way the project will be conducted.",
    "This class really didn't have a structure which made it really hard to follow.",
    "Three hours on a Friday are very long.",
    "Please see comments for ECON 559 evaluation.",
    "I think the course has a lot to offer and can be improved with more classroom discussion. One way to do this would be to split the class into teams and ask teams to participate in group discussions to discuss the findings of various Development Economics papers.",
    "I think the content is absolutely fascinating and the debates discussed are definitely relevant. The major weakness would be that I wish we could have had more interaction within the course to discuss the papers.",
    "Strengths: thematically relevant to development Weakness: no ongoing student evaluation (response papers \/ exams), so when push comes to shove, I didn't always prioritize preparing properly, and doing so would have helped me take more from the course",
    "More interaction in class and discussions on the literature could be a potential area of improvement.",
    "Was able to weave in and out with what we learn in 559",
    "Instead of going through various papers that suggest various techniques, having a stronger thematic flow across would have been useful in being able to tie these papers and techniques to specific areas of how to apply these techniques.",
    "I really enjoyed the content of this course, again I think we would have benefited with a commitment device to make us keep on top of the material a little bit better.",
    "Very helpful in understanding how to formulate research questions and the difficulties one faces in writing research papers."

    "Good if students are interested in research.",

    "Please see comments for ECON 559 evaluation.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to work in the field of development economics in the future.",
    "This course is a technical and holistic approach to understanding economic development analysis.",
    "yes",
    "Should ideally have taken 558 first. But rewarding project done at the end of semester.",
    "Yes",
    "This course provides a very detailed and technical appreciation of different methods used in RCTs etc. I would strongly recommend anyone who is serious about developmental economics to consider taking this to build up foundational knowledge about this topic.",
    "Highly recommend the course to students who especially want to go for PhD."
