    "Though this exact class will never be offered again, if you have the chance to take any class with Deb, TAKE IT!!! She is one of the kindest and most creative and talented people I have ever met, and it was such a privilege to work with her.",
    "Yes! Unfortunately, this class will never again exist, but it was an experience I wouldn't trade for anything.",
    "This is a great class in which the students create a personal piece of theater. I would recommend it if they offer it again.",
    "The Company & the Text: Portrait of a Lady was an incredible experience. It was an amazing opportunity to experience devised theater as a member of a company and produce a work that honored Henry James's Portrait of a Lady while giving voice to our experiences after reading and responding to it. The personal depth and collaborative nature of the show means that our class completely bonded throughout the experience and the work was uniquely ours."
