   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it because it was taught clearly. There is enough practice problems for you to do well one exams.",
    "Take it if you need to learn about organic chemistry.",
    "CHEM 220 is the first semester of the organic chemistry track. You learn lots of chemistry related to carbon-containing compounds. The material can be difficult at times, but overall the workload is manageable. If you really like chemistry, this class will be very enjoyable.",
    "Based on my experience, I would recommend it without hesitation because Rablen made the material so accessible. However, I don't know who will be teaching it in the fall, so the quality of the course may vary. If you're premed or some kind of bio major though, you have to take it. Approach the class with a positive mindset and it should be okay.",
    "Unless you really need to take it, why would you ever..? Also without Rablen...I wouldn't",
    "Everything bad you heard about organic chemistry is true. It will eat your soul and feed you the poop.",
    "Only if you have to obviously. Its more work than2 classes combined.",
    "Hard class - necessary evil for premed. If you have to take it, take it with Rablen. He has high expectations, and is very thorough (15 problem sets...hard af), but you have a good grasp of things by the end (even if you don't have the grade to show for it...)",
    "Take it if you have to. Very very time consuming. The teacher definitely makes or breaks the class.",
    "CHEM 220 is absolutely tough and a huge time commitment. Difficulty alone makes me hesitant to recommend it to anyone who does not have to take it for a requirement. However, the course with Rablen is good overall for an organic chemistry course.",
    "This is your first semester organic chemistry class. But don't freak out, because it's super manageable! Just like in a math class, if you do lots of practice problems and understand important underlying concepts, you'll be a rockstar in this class! A lot of the stuff you do in this semester class is a bit more conceptual than some of the stuff you might do in Orgo II (which seems to be a bit more memorization of pathways rather than applications of mechanisms). But this class was basically amazing and very highly recommended because of Professor Rablen. I think the teacher will really make or break this class. Sure, you can learn it on your own too if you diligently take note of the book and do lots and lots of practice problems. But, because P-Rabs explained things really clearly in lecture, you saved a ton of time by just understanding the concept the first time and then practicing right afterwards!",
    "CHEM 220 is an interesting and engaging course, and will help you build a good foundation of organic chemistry principles. It is a challenging yet rewarding course, and I would recommend it to any student who is interested in chemistry, science, or even just exploring a new subject.",
    "CHEM 220 is your basic introduction to organic chemistry, covering the major areas of reaction mechanisms and synthesis problems. If you are interested in pursuing chemistry and can take it with a good professor, I definitely recommend it.",
    "Chem 220 is a standard organic chemistry class. There is lots of memorization and the material moves quickly, but it is very interesting and very different from general chemistry. If you put in the work it is very worthwhile.",
    "Take this class, its great and not as bad as they say. It is DAMN early though!",
    "Definitely not a class to be taken lightly, so if it's not required, then maybe don't take it. However, even if it's not required, I think it is valuable to take. I feel like it forced me to think in a new way, and it was rewarding to realize how much I learned at the end of the semester. I've changed my major to something that doesn't require orgo, but I don't regret taking this class at all.",
    "Organic chemistry is a very challenging, labor-intensive course. Do not underestimate it! I studied more for this class than any other I have taken, in college or otherwise. I HIGHLY recommend getting a copy of Organic Chemistry as a Second Language, the suggested review book. Once I read through the book and did all of the numerous practice problems, things made more sense (learning organic chemistry really is like learning a new language). That being said, Professor Rablen is truly fantastic, and it's a shame that he'll be leaving Yale next year.",
    "Section either reviewed or gave associated information. New concepts presented in section were very clearly delineated.",
    "If Professor Rablen is your professor, you've completely lucked out. He is the best of the best. The course was wonderful and so organized it was unbelievable. You actually learn in lecture each day, and the tests are fair. Pray that they keep Rablen around and you'll be fine.",
    "A tough, yet gratifying course.",
    "Organic Chemistry is one of the most challenging academic topics. It is very easy to fall behind or get lost within all the mechanisms. However, Professor Rablen has really made this course more accessible to students. From holding tri-weekly workshop sessions to daily office hours, Professor Rablen has provided every student the opportunity to succeed in this course. Although it is uncertain whether he will be teaching this course in the fall, I would strongly encourage Orgo in order to challenge yourself with a different way of thinking. Take advantage of every opportunity for help--there seems to be a difference between understanding and applying concepts from Organic Chemistry. Do lots of practice problems, and be sure that you can fully invest yourself in this course.",
    "I'd recommend this class if you're interested in learning organic chemistry. You will definitively know a lot by the end.",
    "Taking this class with Rablen was a magical experience. I hope Yale hires him, because he is such a good professor. Also, get to know Sapling. Sapling is your friend.",
    "If Rablen is still there, take this course.",
    "A challenging but interesting overview of basic reaction mechanisms and concepts of organic chemistry that can get quite in depth.",
    "Only take this class if you are sure you want to pursue a career in the sciences or are premed. This class is quite difficult but rewarding if you put in the effort.",
    "Paul Rablen's Chem 220 is a gem of the Yale Chemistry department. If you have the opportunity to take the course with him, you are in luck. He's extremely approachable and will go out of his way to help you. Chem 220 is not easy, and will require a fair amount of time to master. Those who put in the extra effort generally seem to do well and feel that the exams are not very difficult.",
    "Take it because you have to. If Rablen is teaching it then absolutely take it. He's as good of an OChem 1 professor as you could ask for.His lectures were informative and straight to the point. In out-of-class workshops and Piazza questions he demonstrated a pure and natural desire to help his students understand OChem and succeed in the course. Exams were challenging but also fair; from prior exams you know exactly what to expect. Take advantage of resources (workshops, peer tutors, Piazza, actually read the textbook) and prepare to commit a lot of time to the class. If you do this, you'll do well.",
    "It's tough, and you will need to put time and work in (it was my hardest class this semester). That being said, you will survive! Go to office hours and peer tutor hours (all the peer tutors are wonderful). Just be prepared to work your butt off.",
    "Chem 220 is first semester ideas, theory and concepts of organic molecules and their reactions.",
    "If you're taking it cause you have to, you'll get through it somehow. If not, its a lot to learn and do if you're not very very interested in the material.",
    "It is a challenging but rewarding course, and not just for pre-meds! This class has a great workload, but you learn a lot. I would definitely recommend it!",
    "Organic Chemistry is a very difficult course. Some classes require memorization. Some require an understanding of overarching concepts. Some require a kind of quantitative reasoning\/problem solving. Organic Chemistry requires ALL of these, and is therefore, a VERY demanding course. You must devote a lot of time not only to understanding all of the concepts, but also to being able to solve problems. You can't do one without the other so it's very important to just do everything you can to do well in this class, especially lots of practice problems in addition to the reading. I would only recommend this if you HAVE to take it. Otherwise, I would not at all recommend it. It's been my most difficult class of the year--the one I've devoted the most time to and shed the most tears over. Best of Luck if you have to take it, and if you don't, don't take it!",
    "Take it if you have to. Actually really well taught by Rablen. I learned a lot.",
    "You're taking orgo because you have to",
    "I had expected to hate orgo, and this was my favorite class of the semester. That was probably because Professor Rablen is an organic chemistry demigod, but he'll be back at Swarthmore by the time you're actually reading this response. So, a couple tips that might be helpful regardless of who teaches it next semester: Start problem sets early- they're long. Then, once you've done the problems you know how to do and taken a stab at the ones that confuse you, GO ASK SOMEONE. Go to office hours, to a residential college tutor, a peer tutor, that kid who took freshman orgo last semester. Also, bring friends with you when you go ask, because bonding as you do psets is what improves the class most.",
    "Orgo is orgo. It's hard, but not as bad as people say it is, but don't take that as saying that you won't have to work. You will have to work, a lot, but honestly, it is one of those courses where you get out, for the most part, what you put in.",
    "Hard but necessary.",
    "Be ready to work hard, but if you're going into science or medicine it's a must.",
    "If you throw yourself into this class (not like you have an option--it's a lot of material), it will probably suck up your life but also be rewarding.",
    "I would recommend taking this class with Professor Rablen Cr\/D if organic chemistry interests you. If you're a chem major or a pre-med student I would recommend taking this class because you have to. Do NOT take this class as a fifth class, even if you're doing it Cr\/D, because I'm pretty sure a 99-question pset is not what you want to be doing if you've got four other classes to worry about.",
    "CHEM 220 shows that Organic Chemistry is not all that scary. It is manageable as long as you have a good professor and stay on top of understanding the topics."
