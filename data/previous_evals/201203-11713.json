   "comments": [
    "Take this class if you can! A unique way to study science at Yale. You learn so much from the professor and from your peers. It is a class you will really look forward to. Make sure you read the papers well and are willing to participate in class. If class participation isn't your thing, this class is not for you.",
    "This is the best biology course I have ever taken. Professor Rosenbaum has so much knowledge to share, both on the procedural and social elements of science. This was the first biology class where I really feel like I got to know all my classmates. While it was time-consuming to prepare for class each week, the workload was more than manageable. Grade based on in-class paper presentation and participation. It won't be offered much longer, so this might be your last chance. TAKE IT!",
    "Best class ever! You read a paper a week and really hash out the details and reasoning behind all of the experiments in class. It's a great way to bring together all the bio classes you've already taken. I definitely am much better at critically thinking about science after taking this class. Rosenbaum is great! He knows lots of stories about the history behind the papers we talked about.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It's one of the few upper level biology seminars available, and a very cool, different experience for a lot of science majors. The class has very little work, although you have to prepare well to discuss the papers intelligently.",
    "I highly recommend this class. It's the most unique science class I've taken at Yale - definitely the first one that encouraged discussion and debate. We had arguments in class over what techniques the experiments could\/should have used, which was a completely different method of learning from what I've experienced in other science classes (ie information being shoved down our throats). Rosenbaum was extremely warm and encouraging.",
    "Landmark Papers is a good way for senior bio majors to get a look into the experimental process behind some major breakthroughs in cell biology. But it is also a great way to get to know some of the senior members of Yale's Bio faculty as well as other MCDB\/MBB seniors you may not know very well. The course is structured such that each week a couple of students present on a paper assignedby the professor, and then the rest of the students are encouraged to participate in discussion about the methods and results of the paper. I definitely recommend this class to MCDB seniors.",
    "You cannot find a smarter or kinder professor at Yale than Professor Rosenbaum. It was an absolute pleasure to be a student in the class. A gem at Yale - this course exemplifies what one would expect from a science seminar.",
    "A wonderful senior biology seminar! I'm not sure if it's being taught anymore, but I loved this class. It's all based on discussion and presentations, which is a nice break from all the written work of other classes. It taught me a ton about reading papers and analyzing experiments.",
    "This class is fantastic. I think this class offers what most science classes cannot - applied learning. Sure, there are problem sets and midterms, but those don't really teach you to think with all of your scientific background, only the most recent couple weeks of material. It's a shame that this class may not be offered again, as I think it really made me appreciate biological research.",
    "Landmark Papers is the perfect upper-level seminar for MCDB majors. Each week, everyone reads the same \"landmark\" paper (most are from the 1970s or 1980s and by people Rosenbaum knew, and a lot won Nobel prizes), and then for 2 hours each Tuesday night, you discuss the paper. Two people are responsible for introducing the paper and then leading the discussion and asking questions about the paper, and everyone else is responsiblefor demonstrating that you read it and understood it. The class is especially helpful if you're doing intensive research and\/or planning to go to grad school, since even though the papers are old, you'll learn a huge amount about cell biology research methods, how to critically read and evaluate a paper, how to judge the methods and results in a paper, and how to ask the right scientific questions. If you've never worked in a lab before and done your own research, you'll probably be at a bit of a disadvantage, and you also won't get as much out of the course. It's a fun group, as you really get to know each other after spending two hours together in a cramped room in KBT every week. In order to thoroughly prepare each paper, however, you really have to read them carefully and look up anything you don't know, which can take several hours each week, but that's the only work required for the class."
