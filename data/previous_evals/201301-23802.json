   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course as it is structured and run at the moment. The syllabus looked great and the class could have been very interesting given the themes and readings, but the professors did not put enough effort into preparing for class. They could have used any of a number of approaches to better engage all of the students in discussion, instead of relying on the contributions of a couple of the more vocal students. For example, they could have asked students to come to each session with a list of questions for the group or assigned each student to lead one discussion throughout the semester. Instead, they talked for about twenty minutes (in a completely unstructured way) at the beginning of each session and then asked the class if anyone had any comments. That facilitation strategy was totally ineffective and I was surprised that the professors didn't refine it throughout the semester. They didn't seem to mind that discussions were awkward and unproductive. I often left class feeling extremely frustrated by the lack of effective facilitation and disappointed such low quality of teaching at Yale. It seemed like because theclass was co-taught, neither professor took responsibility for planning each session. In the future, I would recommend just having one professor."
