    "I recommended it to everyone I knew because the professor was such an amazing teacher.",
    "If you want to be challenged, read interesting articles in a rapidly expanding field, and have your ideas heard in class, this is class for you. I would highly recommend this course to students who are interested in cognitive science or morality because the combination of the interesting material and the professor make it easy to enjoy the classroom experience.",
    "I think the class is awesome. I would definitely recommend for others to take the class. I would advise philosophers to take the class, if they are interested in enhancing their work with a solid survey of the empirical work on the cognitive science of morality, but they should not expect terrifically nuanced discussion on the philosophical implications thereof. Or, terrifically nuanced discussions on the way in which philosophy can inform the empirical work. The class seemed to function better as an entry way for researchers in cognitive science to get a solid grounding in philosophy. So, maybe the issue is more just that because there are persons who are not philosophers and persons who are not cognitive scientists, so no one gets the really nuanced discussion that they are looking for, perhaps. But, I still think the course is really valuable. And, I'm very happy that I took it. This material is going to be super important to my dissertation work.",
    "I would recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "It changed the course of my research by opening me up to a whole field of study that is related.",
    "This course's focus on the decision making process and morality significantly added to the dissertation I have planned, providing a ton of information that can be uses for a descriptive account of how humans form their own moral framework.",
    "As noted above, the material is very important to my dissertation work. I would have preferred a far more nuanced philosophical discussion pertaining to the empirical work than was possible, because so many of the students lacked a philosophical background. But, I'm still very happy that I took this course. As mentioned above, I had actually intended to use this course to work on a very particular piece of my dissertation, and that didn't end up happening, which was a disappointment, but I also am very happy with the paper that I ended up working on. I think that I was able to carve out what may be a very promising contribution to the literature on the cognitive science of morality. So, perhaps it is better that I didn't end up using the class to work on my dissertation after all. I will definitely be pursuing the paper topic that I did end up writing on."
