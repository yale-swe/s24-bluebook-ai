   "comments": [
    "i would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in alternative energy, or who has some chem\/bio background and is looking into interesting applications (although by no means do you need the background; i came into the course with nothing but HS science). the workload is very manageable, there are no tests or finals, and the final paper is actually fun to write.",
    "Fun topic, but class was dry. Not much work at all during the semester but the final paper was terrible to write (unless you have experience writing scientific papers). Gut for science majors, but difficult for non-science majors.",
    "Useful and applicable, and not too intensive.",
    "Yes but I think it's best to have more a class with a uniform science background, whether that's more basic or more advanced.",
    "This is a great science course to take if you are interested in bioenergy. Prof. Brentner was a joy to have in class and made the course accessible to students from a wide variety of backgrounds. If she is ever back at Yale, and the course material interests you, consider taking Bioenergy. I enjoyed it very much. I might add that it was rigorous and informative yet not overly stressful - a great mix!"
