   "comments": [
    "Take it take it take it. Great readings which should be mandatory for all Yale students. Totally manageable workload. Helpful and knowledgeable professor. If you want to read very fundamental thinkers of religion, with really humble and nice prof and yalies, take it!!",
    "I would recommend only if the student wants to dedicate a tremendous amount of time to this class. This is not a simple 5th class to have. The grading is extremely harsh. I recommend taking it credit\/d but even then you can't slack off! She gives F's as well!",
    "This class is amazing! The instructor is absolutely phenomenal, and brings her vast knowledge to bear on every single discussion--discussions in which students are encouraged to take the lead so that the instructor becomes an active player in a struggle of interpretation that she is just as invested in as the students. Instead of doling out information, the instructor participates in it, and draws students out to ask questions you didn't even know it was possible to ask.The class uses the questions inherent in the course's title to find a path through each of the authors we read. 'Atheism and Theism' becomes a jumping-off point for extremely varied discussions that touch on extremely important questions. Students become articulate in critiquing each others' interpretations of a text and trying to arrive at some kind of consensus. This class is absolutely wonderful--because of the instructor, who has impacted me more than any teacher I've ever known.",
    "Not too much work.",
    "Theism and Atheism is a great class. It's more a philosophy class than a religion class. You learn about the thinkers by diving headfirst into the texts, which I really enjoyed. I went in with almost no knowledge of philosophy, but Prof. Levene was great about helping me understand the material and work on my papers. Class is entirely discussion-based, and you have to do the reading thoroughly if you want to do well. Don't expect an easy A. Prof. Levene is a tough grader, but a fair one, and she always gives excellent feedback. I'd definitely recommend going to her office hours. She's very approachable, and was always willing to have out-of-class discussions. She takes a personal interest in all of her students.",
    "If you want to read little snippets of Spinoza, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche and feel like your brain has been twisted into knots, take this class! Not a ton of reading, but it's super dense...but you really should be able to read every page which is a nice change (at least eventually in order to write the papers). Hopefully your group of classmates will be more talkative\/insightful than the group that took the class this semester...we had like five people who talked and a few who were really not helpful in carrying the class discussion. Class was run as a seminar this term because there were only 10 people; it would be very different with more students."
