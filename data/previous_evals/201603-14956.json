    "The organization is good. Due to the integrative nature of the medical curriculum, sometimes it's hard to determine whether material is \"strictly cell biology\" or not -- this doesn't matter so much in the day-to-day, but will factor in the calculation of the final grade for the class, so it may help to have a better idea of where these questions may come from. Not necessarily because this information is more important than the rest (or less), but because if MD-PhD students are graded on the cell bio portion differently from they are graded on the other portions of the class, it would help to be aware of which material will be emphasized for the cell bio portion so that we can prepare to study for that differently, if we must!"
