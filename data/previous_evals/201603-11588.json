    "This class gave me a much deeper knowledge of historical cause and effect as well as a rigorous framework through which to analyze abstract ideas. I learned an incredible amount about Islam, and I am very pleased with my knowledge of the topic following this class.",
    "I learned a great deal about all of the aspects of Islam in one semester--something all Yale students should do to build understanding in today's world.",

    "A real understanding of the history and theology that forms the foundation of Islam, as well as how different groups have practiced and interpreted it differently over the years."

   "comments": [
    "This course provides an excellent, in-depth study of the religion of Islam. I know much more about the religion, and I enjoyed exploring the core religious tenets as well as splinter sects and the modern results of historic trends. My only critique of this course is the structure of the lectures -- we learn a ton per lecture, but it would be helpful at the beginning of each class to get an overview of the structure of what we will learn during that lecture. I enjoyed writing the term paper - Prof. Bowering gave me excellent critiques, and it made me a better writer and thinker.",
    "Professor Bowering is incredibly knowledgeable but would do well to include more visuals in his lectures, especially of names that are difficult when you don't know Arabic.",
    "Maybe with more frequent discussion the course could be improved instead of only lecture.",
    "Strengths are that the class is quite small and the Professor is very friendly and engaging. Weaknesses are that the classes are quite long and it is easy to sometimes lose concentration."

   "comments": [
    "Yes - I would recommend this course to anyone who wants an excellent, interesting knowledge of Islam and the history of the Islamic world.",
    "If you have just one semester to learn something about all the aspects of Islam, this should be the course you take. Though you aren't as focused in on the theology as you might expect, that is because Islam is not as focused on its theology as you might expect. You need to study all the aspects of the religion to understand it in our world. You also might be surprised by the incredible diversity of the Islamic tradition. I recommend this course, in hopes that Dr. Bowering will make his lectures a little bit more clear, hopefully with more visuals. I definitely learned a great deal.",
    "I found the past descriptions of this course pretty accurate. Prof. Bowering is very old school -- he presents the material in a straightforward way, in a series of lectures (never asks students questions). The lectures are often extremely dry, and sometimes unclear, but overall the level is solid. I'm glad I took it, but it's only for you if you're really committed to learning about the subject. I found the grading more difficult than expected on the midterm, and easier than expected on the term paper. So overall I'd say he's a fair grader.",
    "Yes! If you want a broad understanding about Islam, this is a great survey course. The topics are not so much in depth but A LOT of material is covered.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in Islam and its basic history, tenets, and beliefs. You will learn a tremendous amount over the course of the semester.",
    "Yes, definitely. I learnt a lot about Islam and found the Professor to be a great teacher. He was encouraging and really takes time to get to know his students."
