   "comments": [
    "I gained a deeper understanding of advanced education theory, I substantially improved in my peer group working and I learned a great deal about research methods, particularly interview skills.",
    "This course really helped me in thinking about issues in education and we learned about some classic educational theories. This class also helped prepare for my final capstone project in the spring. I learned methodological skills in interviewing and coding interviews, which will be really helpful for the interviews I will conduct in the spring. The small (5 person) size of the class was the key for its success. The small size allowed all of us to help each other with our projects and receive personalized feedback from the professor.",
    "Early in the course I learned a lot about the way that privilege and social capital is transferred intergenerational and the role that education plays in that transmission. Later on I learned Qualitative Research Skills (writing interview questions, interviewing, coding\/interpreting data)."

   "comments": [
    "The small class size made this class amazing! The amount of peer editing was another key to success. The teacher and student feedback really helped me shape my capstone.",
    "The strengths are its class size of 5 people. If this course were to be made mandatory for incoming education classes, it should be divided so that people are in small groups and get the same intimate experience we did. Its strengths are also that a lot of the course was practical and directly related to our capstone projects, including completing the IRB application. One of its weaknesses was that we spent too much time on theory in the beginning and did not have enough time at the end to go over the methodology of interviewing and coding well and repeatedly.",
    "Strength: Small class size, individual attention by professor, close rapport with other students. Ample and useful peer feedback. Strength: Great preparation to get the most out of spring capstone for ed studies. Weakness: Ambiguity about theory\/readings relationship to the more practical IRB application and project creation. Relationship could be clearer and deeperor the class could just to be more fully about preparation for capstone\/qualitative methods etc."

    "I would recommend any course with Mira to another student!",
    "This is a great opportunity to dive into some important texts and research methods in-depth, and get started on your capstone project. I'd recommend it to any education studies scholar.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if you are in Education Studies! Mira is a wonderful and kind professor and she will really help you with your project. It will give you a huge head start with your project!",
    "I agree with Ed. Studies instinct to require it for ed studies scholar seniors completely. I think especially if it is required the structure of the class might have to be adapted some to ensure that the larger group is getting what they want from their prep for capstone."
