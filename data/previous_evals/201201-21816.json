    "I don't like most classes, and I don't review most classes, but there's something worth saying about this one: I loved it. Given that I'm a hater, you should probably give it a chance. The teaching is amazing, the format makes sense, and the material is one of those things a person of the world should know about. Like Plato, the French Revolution, and Chick-Fil-A.",
    "Human Evolution was one of my favorite classes. It's usually a medium-sized lecture, but for whatever reason only had 5 people this semester, which worked out great! Professor Hill is great, our TF Tim was fantastic, the material was really interesting. In section you play with bones, and it feels so cool to be able to identify them by the end! Yes, the exams take a fair bit of studying, but there's no work otherwise. I absolutely recommend this course.",
    "I really loved this class--it is a history of the discoveries in human evolution, so be prepared to learn not just theories of evolution, but stories about the men and women who discovered fossils. The lab is also really nice--a fun way to get an intro to osteology.",
    "This course was an amazing overview of Human Evolution (so it was aptly named, eh?). First of all, Professor Hill is totally awesome; he is a really engaging lecture who teaches you things in a way that makes them easier to remember. There is a lot of material presented, but he gives excellent background info to put it in context. Also, he is chock-full of hilarious, informative, and all-in-all entertaining anecdotes which he pulls out of his pocket each class. He is a leading researcher in the field who personally knows everyone we work with, so he has many relevant and hilarious stories featuring flying elephant dung, ancient footprints, children discovering fossils, etc. The course topics were totally fascinating and completely captivated all of us- it definitely redefined how I look at evolution (and humans.) The grading system is fair and distributed well so you have a lot of chances to do well. You do have to study for the tests, though. ALSO, there is an EPIC AND AMAZING section which meets in the anthropology collections lab, so you have hands-on access to specimens. This adds a LOT. The TA, Tim, is a complete boss and hopefully will continue to TA in the future.This class was an unexpected complete gem-- I highly recommend that you take it!!!!"
