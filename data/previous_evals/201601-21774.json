    "Frenh 140 builds upon what you learned in French 130 and is another step up in terms of difficulty with the stories read and grammar learned. I would recommend 140 to another student because it helps strengthen and build on everything learned up through 130.",
    "Yes, take it!",
    "i found the course material quite informative, especially the section regarding the Occupation. the workload felt much, much, much fairer than the past three semesters as far as time required to do all of the assigned material. the evaluations all seemed quite fair and didn't throw too many curveballs. all in all i thought this semester was a lot more fun and balanced than F130. if you wish to continue studying French but you felt F130 a bit lacking, i would recommend that you stick it out for one more semester before choosing to do something else."
