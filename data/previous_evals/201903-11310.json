    "Learned about Euler's equation, solving for the laplacian, potential flows etc as well as aerodynamic forces on an airfoil, lifting line theory, boundary layer flow and compressible flow. Can be thought of as a subset of fluid mechanics with a more in depth emphasis on compressible flow and immersed bodies.",
    "I learned about incompressible, compressible, subsonic, and supersonic flow. I learned about airfoil theory and about design considerations for aircraft. I used Mathematica and Javafoil software to solve flow problems numerically."

   "comments": [
    "Starts from the ground up; could do with a better formulation of some of the problem sets, and stopping to check understanding throughout; since it's easy to get lost.",
    "The theoretical nature of the course might be a strength for some students and a weakness for others. Perhaps a few more practical examples could have been introduced in addition to the introduction to Xfoil.",
    "The class was very small (just 5 of us), so this made it really helpful since we could ask plenty of questions and be engaged much more readily. There were notes for each section of material which was helpful. Lectures go very well, but it can be hard to follow sometimes - it could help if Professor de la Mora didn't erase things so quickly and had some notes on some equations because there are often some errors on the board that later have to be corrected."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, if you're interested in aerodynamics, this is a great course that teaches you all the fundamentals. Most of the things are done on computers nowadays but it's good to know the theory if you're interested.",
    "The material is definitely interesting. If you have any interest whatsoever in aerospace engineering, this is one of the few courses you can find at Yale that is in that field. However, do not go into the course expecting a very practical approach. If you are not comfortable with a lot of math, the first few weeks of the class will be less enjoyable for you. Not the hardest elective to take for the mechanical engineering major. Understanding of thermodynamics is a plus in appreciating some of the concepts especially in compressible flow.",
    "I would recommend it to any engineering student interested in aerospace. The lessons on airfoils and wing design are very interesting, and I got a lot out of it, such as the design considerations. It was a great elective for me."
