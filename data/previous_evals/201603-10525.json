    "If you are the kind of student that can learn well by themselves and not need to go to lecture if the textbook is good, then by all means take this class. I found the material to be engaging and interesting, and the exams and assignments were mostly pretty fun to do. The lectures are awful but they really didn't add anything to my understanding of the course anyways so I can't really take too many points off for that. As a pseudo-self-study this class is not nearly as bad as the ratings suggest, and if you like natural language processing then this class is fine.",
    "No, class is a waste of time. Subject matter is AI but all was discussed is NLP, and that very poorly and chaotically."
