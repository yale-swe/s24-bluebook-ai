    "Strengths: it provides you a great opportunity to make a film and the professors offer all the help you need to do so. Weaknesses: I guess it would be helpful to have more structured tutorials on working with software, although the class does provide ample time to teach yourself shortcuts in editing programs, so this is not a major weakness at all.",

    "Yes! If another student is looking to produce a film and is passionate about putting in the work necessary to do this, documentary filmmaking would be a great course for them."
