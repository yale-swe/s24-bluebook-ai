    "The material is pretty straightforward and problem sets aren't so bad. Plus, lectures line up with the book really nicely and it's easy to follow along. Pretty interesting stuff - take it if you're interested in the material.",
    "A pretty basic course. Could be improved with a better text that integrated differential forms into an updated presentation of this material. Doubt this course has changed in the last decade. Not very challenging, though. Perhaps take it if you need an additional course to satisfy the geometry portion of the intensive major requirement or if you want to take Professor Moncrief's GR course.",
