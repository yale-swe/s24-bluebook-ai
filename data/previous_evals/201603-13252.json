    "Great course.",
    "Contents were fine. Wouldn't mind if Hamiltonian Marte Carlo could have been promoted to formal course content and spent more time on, in lieu of or on top of Metropolis-Hasting. Homework got increasingly annoying by sucking out way too much time -- time that should have been spent on doing thesis research! Midterm was hard! Especially hated the second question with the terms multiplying each other. The hint \"taking the log\" didn't make much sense either -- knew what taking the log was but didn't know you could do it that way in that context! Happy with the percentage of the grade it carries though.",
    "It's an advanced statistics course. I sometimes couldn't understand the class contents well, but with the homework assignments, I could catch up.",
    "I think it's an excellent course. I learned a lot from the lectures and hands-on practices. The only problem is that the workload is relatively heavy, but I do not consider it as weakness.",
    "Good.",
    "strength: get familiar with computational methods in optimization, especially newton methods, EM algorithm. weakness: the workload is not distributed uniformly, there is one week I have to work 15 hours on the homework, but eventually I gained knowledge and technique, so no complain at all.",
    "Computational algorithms are intriguing especially when implementing them by ourselves. Also the math or deduction involved is moderate and acceptable.",
    "Great course and nice teacher. Recommend it !",
    "Great!",
    "Great course combining the theoretical derivation with the computational implementation.",
    "I thought the class was excellent. It was very demanding and I'd recommend that future students put a lot of thought into how much time the other classes in their schedule allowed them to allocate to this class.",
    "Great course! Prof. Crawford uses simple but clear example to illustrate methods, and follows up by more advanced homework, which, together, greatly advances my insights into computational stat.",
    "Strengths: Topics are excellent and useful. Weakness: Sometimes explanation is not clear enough.",
    "90\/100",
    "Strength: great material , great office hour support Weakness: too much work"

    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Very good lecturer -- a rare find at Yale really. Well-paced. Always gives meaningful motivation and context for the next topic coming up. Likes to draw pictures. Not too concerned with unnecessary mathematical proofs, unlike pretentious pure mathematicians. Very clear. A bit of a tendency to keep changing office hours though.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0He gave us the lecture very well. Some analytical concepts were difficult to imagine; he used several examples and make us understand them.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0He's an excellent instructor, who explains everything in very understandable fashion even for student like me who do not have a mathematical background.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Good.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Professor Crawford is great. He is kind and nice, totally available to students. His course materials are also interesting.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0I like his way of teaching, very clear, covers topics that I really interested in.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Lectures are organized in a great pace. Topics covered are relevant and moving forward step by step.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0He is really responsible and good at teaching. Very patient to answer any questions and prepare the course with heart.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Clear. Useful",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0The instructor was great.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Prof. Crawford is patient, helpful, and can be reached almost all the time. His lecture was clear and insightful, his office hour is also helpful and popular.",
    "Instructor: Forrest Crawford \u00a0Awesome, very willing to help student in class or after class.",

    "Useful content. Good lecturer. Homework means lots of work and can be challenging. Take-home final.",

    "I would definitely recommend it to another student who wants to develop or modify existing statistical methods in his\/her own study. But I would not recommend it to students who do not have experiences of using the statistical tools prior to the course.",
    "Good.",
    "I think the course has too much workload compared with the lecture hours. Usually it takes too long time to figure out the homework questions, extremely time-consuming. I think a longer lecture and less homework workload would be better.",

    "This course is very useful. All strategies of algorithms instructed by Forrest are very clear. We can also learn how to use them by homework.",
