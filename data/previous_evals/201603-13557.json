   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the instructor. And the powerpoint presentations are done is a VERY effective way - they are sort of like a textbook where they don't just relay information like most powerpoint presentations do, but they actually teach with examples and tips. I found this to be the difference between failing the tests and doing well on them. Weaknesses: The review parts of the Friday morning sections didn't add value to my course experience. Going over the homework was helpful, but the review was just a regurgitation of what we learned in class. It would have helped if the review consisted of different ways of thinking about the content than we saw in class - that would help because different students think in different ways, but a repeat of the information we already have on the slides isn't helpful.",
    "Too much workload",
    "As a CDE student, this class is obviously very relevant to my degree, but I truly enjoyed it. I had taken a public health class during undergrad that just brushed over epi concepts, but I enjoyed going more in depth about them and learning so many more things. I also liked the structure of the discussion sections!",
    "I thought the course did a fairly good job of introducing epidemiology and trying to hit the various topic within it which are the most important for all public health practitioners to know and given the variety of interests and goals of students in the course, I can't think of anything that would be feasible to modify.",
    "Linda made this course fantastic",
    "Great class. Even though pretty much everyone has to take it if your in the masters of public health programs, but it was actually really enjoyable. The lectures are basically what's on the slides she posts, not a lot of extra information, so if you have to miss class it's okay, but I wouldn't recommend it. Even though the info is on the slides, Dr. Niccolai explains it really well and makes it make a lot more sense.",
    "Strengths: material was well-put, but since it is an introductory course, it covers many new topics very quickly; becomes difficult to piece together in the end and understand how it impacts future research- but then again, it's an intro course, and EPI courses at YSPH can go further into detail. Good review of concepts, lectures were easy to comprehend, the HW assignments were reasonable in length and difficulty (though some topics were not as well covered as others). TA's are great tool, excellent timeliness and willingness to help on assignments. Weaknesses: Tests can be tricky for many students. Most students don't attend M\/Tues sessions, and TA sessions on Thursdays (HW due on Friday) can be crowded- students often waited 45 min+ to get answers to questions, TA's on thursdays are overly stressed, and difficult to get 1on1 help. Though good planning can help a student, may be beneficial to have more TA spots open on Thursday ( I believe there's 2, but might be good to add one more).",
    "This was a great introduction to epi course. It was well organized, well taught and very interesting. I feel like I learned a lot! It really felt like it had been taught before and so some of the kinks had been ironed out and it ran very smoothly. That said - I do not think the sections are really necessary. Our TA was superb but I honestly felt that I could have done the homeworks and learned from the feedback and gone to office hours as needed. Seemed like unnecessary time.",
    "I enjoyed the structure of the course and I felt lecture was the best way to convey all of the information. I also thought the discussion was very helpful in reviewing practice problems and questions.",
    "Strengths: Pretty straightforward. Slides are well organized and contain all the relevant information needed, with no unnecessary, irrelevant info. Weaknesses: No space in the lecture room, sometimes. Listening to students who didn't try on the HW try to explain their answers in precept was painful and boring\/waste of time.",
    "Great course. Professor Niccolai is highly engaged and very well versed in the topic. Classes were interesting and relevant. The homework was incredibly useful for learning the information.",
    "I think the structure of the course is fine. I was not a major fan of the weekly homework assignments, but I can see how they require students to stay up on the material.",
    "This class has weekly homework, 3 midterms, and a cumulative final. I think that the homework is useful in reinforcing and applying concepts, but it feels like we're constantly taking tests. I also think it was very odd to schedule the final on the same day as the health policy one given that a ton of students had to do both. That being said, this is a good introductory course that everyone has to take.",
    "I wish I had taken this my first year because it was a really useful class to learn about different study designs that you encounter in the literature. It was great, my only suggestion would be to maybe add some stops during lecture where students try to work out a problem on their own for extra practice. One weakness is that section can go kind of slowly. I think it would be a better section to do new problems together rather than just going over homework.",
    "The course is okay and the instructor is nice. However, the topic doesn't seem to be so interesting.",
    "Lecture was very help and I found that the material was presented in a very clear and understandable way on the slides. This made studying for the exams much easier.",
    "The course is a great fundamental course that was interesting, engaging, helpful, and beneficial to our future work in public health.",
    "I think this course was a good overview of epidemiological methods. I appreciated having homework in between exams because it facilitated learning of the material. Discussion sections were informative, especially towards the end when the TF went over the material on the board.",
    "Linda is wonderful and the perfect professor for this course. Go to lectures, and you should not have major problems understanding the material and learning practical skills.",
    "I learned a lot in this class, mostly thanks to the structure. At first I was surprised that we had so many exams, but that really helped me study at an appropriate rate. I LOVE the homework system--it allowed me to master the material in a low-stress setting.",
    "Great!",
    "I thought a big weakness is making 80% of the class grade based on Exams. I have always had difficulty taking exams, so I do not believe that relying on exams to calculate 80% of a person's overall grade would match my true knowledge and competency learned in class. I would recommend actually grading the homework and making the homework a bigger portion of the class grade. Homework (30%), Exam1-3 (15%each), Final(25%) may help this a bit more.",
    "The course material was not what I was expecting and I found the professor to be condescending at times, which made me feel uncomfortable to ask questions in class. The class size was also too big to understand course material without being distracted.",
    "As someone who never been exposed to Epidemiology, it was difficult to learn all of the terms, wording, and formulas so quickly. I wish that we could have gone more slowly and really perfected each section before going to the next topic. It felt like a race to understand with taking 4 other challenging classes concurrently. If I didn't get something, I fell behind because there was no time to review or go to office hours, and we were already onto the next topic. I wish that the class made it easier to learn- for example, it would have been helpful to break down new materials into steps and slowly go over the 1, 2, 3 steps a few times to makes sure that we understand the process. I felt that it was often left to students to break down the steps of the solution process and we would explain how to do it that way to each other. It would have been immensely helpful if students were provided a list of the formulas with descriptions on what they are used to find, when to use them, and how to interpret answers in one place. Instead, it was on the students to piece this together amongst ourselves from lecture slides and the internet.",
    "Professor very good at teaching material, especially at the introductory level but also so we have a thorough understanding.",
    "Good course. Definitely should be required. Taught well and provides everyone a good basis in epi. Tests felt fair and grading was good; class was set up in a way that really facilitates learning, I really liked having 3 tests throughout the semester, that way nothing felt too overwhelming and I was already prepared for the final when it came along. Overall, definitely glad I took this course, it inspired me to take epi 2 in the spring!",
    "Overall, really enjoyed this course. I liked the structure in terms of sections and exams after each. Really ensured that I was actively staying on top of the material so there was less studying for the final. Weekly HWs were also helpful in terms of understanding the material and as preparation for the exams.",
    "This is a really good course. It really allows you to develop facility with epidemiological methods, measurements, and study designs. It will make you a better reader of the literature, whatever your field, and will set you off in the right direction for doing your own research. The lectures are engaging and full of information. The readings are good the textbook is clear and the assigned articles help underscore the concepts you are learning. A particular strength of the course was the final unit on random error and generalizability, which gave a much-needed breath of fresh air to the exhaustingly narrow conversations occurring in biostatistics classes reifying P values. In fact, I think this course could be made even stronger by further highlighting the dissonance between the two disciplines in their approach to assessing significance (and I don't mean statistical significance here), maybe by assigning a reading from the likes of Deirdre McCloskey, Stephen Ziliak, or John Ionnidis. Biostatistics courses at YSPH seem to be totally irresponsible in their treatment of this material, and I would love to see epidemiology lead the way in responsible methods. I think the primary weakness of the course is the structure of the discussion sections. they simply go over the homework question by question. This did not feel like a good use of my time, and I would have much preferred to have a facilitated discussion of issues raised in class, some of which are moral\/ethical issues, perhaps framed by a reading or two that had been assigned during the week. I think the discussion sections could and should function more as seminar spaces for thinking through the issues, rather than as spaces where rote recitation of homework occurs.",
    "Great organization of information and great professor instruction. Did not particularly interest me nearly at all, but that is not the course's fault.",
    "Good",
    "execllent, very useful, epi is everywhere, all of my courses taken this semester contain epi knowledge.",
    "lecture notes are very organized",
    "good, some extraneous information and every class (reviews) should be available online",
    "Wonderful introductory class for epidemiology. Actually really appreciated the fact that we had three exams so we could keep track of all the concepts we were learning. The structure of the class was perfect. Discussion sections were helpful, it was really nice that we went over the homework so we would actually learn from it and go over our mistakes. This was basically a perfect execution of how lecture\/ discussion\/ homework\/ exams can be in perfect harmony. 10\/10 rating",
    "Professor Niccolai can sometimes just read off the slides when she's lecturing which made it difficult to show up to class. Also, asking for clarifications on some of the slides sometimes made the conversation more confusing and always ended up with the final conclusion being that we should just follow what she had presented. The subject itself was rather dry and the lecture style did not help much. However, she does seem to care about the students and can be reached out to if there are any questions.",
    "Love the weekly homeworks and reminders to do the class readings. So important for learning!",
    "One strength of the class is that it covers so much material and presents it in manageable weekly assignments. The weekly homework assignments are a great way to keep up with the material and not lag behind. They also give a good sense of what the tests are like, so I never felt unprepared. One weakness might be that the grading does not always seem 100% fair. Although I'm sure the TA's all use the same instructions to grade, there are many test questions that require us to write down our answers out. I think the general feeling was that it was up to the TA to assign a grade based on their interpretation of the rubric. Overall, however, this was a minimal weakness and almost insignificant in the end.",
    "A lot of emphasis Was on pure memorization, although it was a good introduction to those who have never an epidemiology course.",
    "Strengths : discussion is very helpful, Deanna is a great TF Weakness: 3 midterms it's killing me...",
    "Good",
    "Grading can be unfair",
    "This course might have been my favorite course for the semester, which surprised me because it's a required and fairly large course. The material was presented extremely clearly and was always organized. The homework assignments were useful in assessing my knowledge of the concepts and gave me a good understanding of what I would need to know for the exams. The exams were fair and straightforward. The discussion sections were useful, and I always learned something from attending them.",
    "This class was a good introduction to the course material, and the material was presented in a way that was easy to understand. I thought that the format of three exams and a final did a good job of testing you on the material in manageable quantities.",
    "I really liked the homework component. With the homework we are able to practice what we learned without having to stress about our grade. It was very refreshing, and I believe that it led to a greater understanding of the concepts.",
    "I really like how we can go over the course material every week by having the review session.",
    "Strengths- Rigorous Epidemiology teaching",
    "informative. The course combined materials with real study as examples.",
    "It was informative and provided us skills that we will use in the field, helpful. Strengths - weekly assignments and the Friday sections were extremely helpful in understanding content.",
    "Strength: Clear lecture notes Weakness: Too much workload, too many exams",
    "I really liked the structure of the course. I think up to homework 5\/6 (for confounding & effect modification), we can do going around the class for the answer, but for that homework and after, I appreciated just going over the answer together with you as a class.",
    "You learn a good overview of epidemiological concepts; however, the class is very test heavy",
    "Epi I provided a very solid introduction to epidemiology. Dr. Niccolai is very good at explaining difficult concepts. The lecture slides are very clear and concise - very helpful when it comes to reviewing for the exams. Reading the recommended readings from the textbook prior to each lecture definitely helped me do well in this class. The workload is not too heavy, but one can get a lot out of it. Amazing course.",
    "overall strong foundational course. First half is redundant for anyone with any intro epi background.",
    "The course covers a lot of information in one semester, which makes the material extremely hard to digest. The course may need to be spread over two semesters.",
    "Worst epidemiology course I have taken. The topics are not cohesive. The assessments are highly subjective.",
    "I think that the class is well organized. Although I took an epidemiology class before, it was taught at a much higher level (aka it was way simpler) and I didn't realize how complicated epi really is until now. I think that sometimes the instructors\/TFs struggle with the fact that epidemiology is often subjective - in the sense that there are multiple different ways to get an \"answer\" (analyze something) and even still there is not \"right answer\", there are always considerations to be made in analysis. Students don't always understand this and argue with TFs about a right answer - there should be a way to get this point across. In addition, as a former biology student it is difficult to hear that sometimes those explaining concepts can't explain the basic biology behind it. Although I understand that biology is not their subject I think credibility would increase if the basic biology used in examples was understood.",
    "Gave a useful grounding of necessary epi topics. It would have been useful to do more problems in class (similar to the homework) in class instead of just reviewing theory.",
    "It is very good class, however I believe for an intro class is a bit too advanced considering there is an Epidemiology II class on the spring semester. The class has a very demanding work load and schedule; for the time students must put in weekly the mid-terms tests and the homework assignments could be worth more towards final grade. Alternatively, homework assignments could be MUCH shorter. The tests and the assignments do contribute to the learning process, but their revision in section is very shallow -which undermines that learning process and is not commensurate to the time the assignments and tests demand.",
    "Epidemiology is a good intro class. I learned a lot and I thought the problem sets were helpful.",
    "This course was a solid introduction to epidemiology. Professor Niccolai is an amazing professor who is truly passionate and knowledgeable about the field. Her slides are always clear and concise, and the assignments\/exams were always fair.",
    "good",
    "Great course that taught the foundations of epi very well",
    "Overall the course was good. I really liked the structure and I feel like I learned a lot. I had moments of frustration in that I wish we could have discussed certain ethical concerns more critically and in more depth.",
    "Course overall was very well organized and taught. Instructor provided a good combination of didactic lecture to deliver core content and real-world examples that made the material more applicable to the students.",
    "Linda is great lecturer, very skilled at engaging large class size but room was too small not enough seats!",
    "The courses teaches the basic principles of epidemiology and does it successfully. There is either a homework due or an exam every Friday. This is the only class that does this, and I think it is a little tedious. I think it is hard to come up with that many questions to ask about this subject, ones that have correct answers. Better to let the material breath a little bit.",
    "This was a solid introduction to epidemiology, and although it felt a bit slow, it definitely allowed me to gain a fundamental and long-term understanding of the basic concepts of epi. Strengths: -problem sets each week and exams every three weeks kept students very on top of the material we were learning Weaknesses: -the course felt pretty slow-moving to me, and I wish more subject material could have been included in it -discussion sections were primarily about going over the homework, but this felt like a pretty significant waste of time. I think the course could be improved by providing answers more quickly to the students (rather than, say, going around and having students answer each question) and then spending more time delving into potentially complex or confusing topics.",
    "Linda is excellent, can see her passion in the course.",
    "Strengths: You will gain a good command over the basics of epidemiology. I appreciated the concepts and skills that I learned in class they helped me become a more critical thinker when it came to reading public health research papers. It is a lot of work (weekly homework assignments, exam every 3 weeks); however, that work provides much needed practice opportunities that in my experience cemented main concepts.",
    "Strengths- The structure of this course was very well done. With challenging and applicable homework assignments every week, and exams once a month, the materials I learned throughout the semester were consistently tested and by the end of the term I felt I had learned epidemiology thoroughly. Weaknesses- I did not think it was necessary to memorize formulas for this course. This did not help solidify the material of the course.",
    "I liked that we had homework every week, so that we could get practice with the concepts and problems. The lectures were generally informative. I particularly liked when the instructor worked through problems on the board with us. Some of the later material seemed rushed; I think we all needed more practice with the material that was on the third test.",
    "A great introduction to epidemiologic concepts and techniques. I learned a great deal in this class that I know will be useful later in my career. I frequently found discussion section a bit redundant after the week's lectures and am glad that sections were made optional this year. The classroom was not big enough for the number of students enrolled in the course."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: Dr. Niccolai is an amazing epidemiologist. This is a complex subject and her teaching style blows it out of the water. It's not often that I find powerpoint presentation class structures to be the most effective method, but in this case the way Dr. Niccolai approached the presentations really is the best possible way in my opinion. It's also evident that she cares about her students understanding the content, which is critical seeing as this is the first time some of us are seeing these words, let alone topics. To be honest, I didn't know what epidemiology was when I entered school (had to google the definition), and Professor Niccolai has done an incredible job introducing it. Weaknesses: the friday morning sections (see overall assessment and TA feedback). Other than that, the class was perfect and exactly what it should be.",

She is very understanding of students needs and always tries to go above and beyond so they understand the material.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: repeats material in her slides, wants you to know the material- really appreciate it. Enjoy the real-world case investigations\/ analyses, and her criticisms of certain papers. Provides a well-rounded approach to epi. Appreciate that attendance is not mandatory, as lectures are a good review tool on their own. This is good for many professional students; those who want to seek clarification will attend class, but others can review lectures the weekend before and focus on examination prep. I really appreciate that Linda puts all the material out there; there's no ambiguity as to what she will test and the demands of the course itself. Weaknesses: Teacher is difficult to hear, rather unapproachable and a bit condescending. Would be nice to have a use of Clickers, offer more engagement- lectures are very one-sided (teacher reads the slides, students silently listen on).",

Dr. Niccolai came prepared to every lecture and would incorporate outside information such as her research into the class. I like that she asks for students' answers\/interpretations before she discusses the correct answer.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths: straightforward lecturer. Weaknesses: Needs to relax. Her set rules about late hw\/time limits are a little draconian, even in legitimate circumstances (e.g. TA started exam a few minutes late, still stop \"on time\"...).",

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was great. She is extremely entertaining and intelligent. I enjoyed her class very much.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Thoroughly below average instructor. Did not seem to be engaged at all with her lectures, and it was evident she could care less whether or not we understood the material for a given lecture. She would often go very quickly through densely worded slides. Another concern is that she appeared dismissive of students' questions when they were asked in class.

    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda is awesome! Info was presented very clearly and in an engaging way, tests were fair, and class was always interesting.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think the professor did a good job teaching this course. Professor Niccolai was readily available to answer questions. There were sometimes when she seemed confused by a question or two, but overall she facilitated learning.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I really enjoyed Dr. Niccolai's class, but sometimes the wording that she used in lecture or on slides was slightly confusing to me. Several times I was confused by the lecture\/slides - but consulting the textbook immediately clarified. Great book! Otherwise, I found Dr. Niccolai very approachable. Her teaching style uses lots of repetition, which works very well for me.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She gives a really great and clear lecture. Every time her class is full of students.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Linda was a great professor! I really enjoyed her teaching style. I do wish that we had a little more f a medical background. Sometimes she would address a disease in class and say I don't know that this is, but it would be nice if we could learn more about the diseases we were discussing.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I found Dr. Niccolai to be knowledgeable but very condescending when addressing her students especially in class. It has made me feel uncomfortable to address her. She is also very hard to reach after sending emails I found that she never responds and I would have to follow through with my TF in order to get a response. Many of the course regulations I also did not agree with, and they detracted from the fundamentals of the class, shifting the focus on grades rather than fully understanding course material.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a kind, down-to-earth professor.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very good teacher, makes it easy to pay attention in such a long class",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is great and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She's good! Not amazing, but really does know her stuff and teaches this course in an accessible way that facilitated my learning. Does the best she could with an intro epi course and I enjoyed class a lot.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great, explained concepts in easy to understand terms. Was clear about her expectations. Very helpful during office hours and also very friendly and easy going.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof. Niccolai is a very engaging lecturer. She explains concepts clearly and with enthusiasm. I always learned and clarified concepts in lecture, and looked forward to the class.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was clear, provided great examples, and was wonderful at lecturing.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is clearly brilliant and a pleasure to have been taught by. She does not need improvement that I can think of besides perhaps a few more practice problems along the way would have been great. I also would have enjoyed hearing more about her own experiences more throughout lectures. I know they were included, but could have been slightly more dominant to add \"professional\" lessons in addition to the academic ones.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is so nice, her lectures are clear, easy to understand and very interesting. I love epi!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0her lecture is very clear and she gives frequent exams to test if you know the knowledge",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0good, but not an expert.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Best lecturer ever. I wish I had Linda for every single class. I love how passionate she is, how clear she is, and how many different ways she can explain a topic. I like that she posts notes beforehand, has definitions up on her slides, examples, and real life examples from studies. Everything with Linda is structured, organized, and straightforward. Love that she knows her stuff and answers questions efficiently. Nothing to improve upon because Linda is at the pinnacle of teaching success!!!!!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Her lecture style is somewhat dry which made it difficult to pay attention to the class. Additionally, her exam questions, and at times even her homework questions, could sometimes be misleading and required a good amount of clarification. She seems to care about the students, but looks to be rather busy and it can show in her preparation for lecture.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very knowledgeable and fair in presenting the material. Prof Niccolai was very easy to reach with questions and concerns.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The instructor was great. The course was taught well and with lots of interesting examples.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof Niccolai is good! But she doesn't answer questions actively after classes.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Nice person.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was fantastic. I especially appreciated her candor and her sense of humor during lectures. She kept me and my classmates engaged in every lecture, and I liked that she was very straightforward in her presentation of the material and in the way she wrote her tests. I also liked that she brought in real-world examples of epidemiology in action to illustrate concepts from the class--I feel like this is an overlooked but crucial part of public health education, and I'm glad we were constantly reminded of how we could use the concepts from class in real life.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She did a good job of presenting the information in a way that was straightforward and easy to understand, and was happy to answer questions. She also did a good job of making the material relevant to actual applications.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai is a great professor. I really enjoyed her lectures, and I really liked the readings she provided.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I really like the way she teach, it's very Intuitive. She may work on explaining the concepts by using some examples.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Knowledgeable, excellent and organized teacher",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Great. If the microphone worked, it would be better :). Since it was a huge class, people sat in the back sometimes had a hard time to hear clearly. I really love the examples of real world studies and wish there could be more in the study design session. I have never conducted a study before, so, sometimes I had difficulties when I was trying to choose comparable control group since there are all not that perfect, so I would love to know more examples about them to get a sense of which level of comparability is enough to conduct one.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She is a really good professor and explains everything clearly",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Helpful, and structured class well.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is a nice instructor, but the workload for this course is too much. There are too many exams within a semester. In addition, I think it is not necessary to have a close note exam. There are too many stuffs to memorize.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I really appreciate your open-mindedness and your humor & kindness. I can tell that you're experienced! I learned very useful information step by step thank you!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0I think it would be helpful to incorporate a component of the course that allows people to demonstrate their understanding of the concepts besides tests and ungraded homeworks",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai has a strong grasp on the information, but she relies heavily on the teaching assistants for the dissemination of it. With some teaching assistants being better than others, some sections of the class are more prepared than others.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was good overall and responded well to feedback.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Dr. Niccolai was really great at teaching the class and encouraged questions and participation in lecture.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0The professor is very passionate and easy to relate to. She is good at clarifying concepts and providing relevant examples. I appreciate her being humble and open too. She is realistic in her expectations in terms of what students should know, but she is ambitious in the amount of content she expects to cover in depth throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai is a very good professor. Her lectures were clear and she was receptive to students' requests.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Nicolas is an amazing professor who is truly passionate and knowledgable about epidemiology. Her slides are always clear and concise, and the assignments\/exams were always fair. She is very approachable and constantly available to answer students' questions\/concerns. Thank you Professor Niccolai for making this course enjoyable!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0good",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Very helpful with great understanding of the material; very helpful slides and examples",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Lectures were great for the most part. There were moments when people asked questions about racial health disparities and social determinants of health that I wish could have been discussed in more depth and unpacked more thoroughly and directly. When learning epidemiology, I think it is important to lay a foundation of critical thinking that addresses the limitations of quantitative research and data analysis in ways that address issues from a less binary, restrictive and traditional viewpoint. I think we went into this more at the end of the class when we talked about different models for understanding the complex determinants of disease, but it might be useful to try to do that starting at the beginning and incorporating that mentality into the material throughout the course.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Obviously a highly insightful instructor into the manner in which students learn. Used multi-modal approaches and maintained attention of the class while delivering content. No opportunities for improvement identified.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Really good lecturer, alot of lecture but good job at trying to create discusison",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Nice instructor for the course, obviously cares a great deal.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Prof Niccolai was so much fun to learn with. She was very entertaining (which helped keep students awake during morning classes) and always supplemented lectures with real-world examples, which I really appreciated. She was considerate to students and went above and beyond to ensure that students really understood the material.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Excellent!",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Lectures had a good flow and were clear. If I was confused about anything in the lecture, that was easily clarified by readings or by teaching fellows.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Strengths- Dr. Niccolai was very responsive to student questions and made herself available outside of the classroom to assist students as well. She also chose the best teaching fellows to teach discussion sections, which were extremely helpful in understanding the material of the course. Weaknesses- The course covered a lot of material that would have been better to understand if it was spaced out better over time. As the material became more difficult, it felt as though there was not enough time to thoroughly understand them. Therefore, the only weakness I noticed was there was not enough time allocated to concepts that were more difficult.",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0She was fine. Her lectures were well-organized and generally included all relevant information. Sometimes, her answers to student questions were not particularly clear (although, sometimes those student questions weren't particularly clear!).",
    "Instructor: Linda Niccolai \u00a0Professor Niccolai was a fantastic lecturer. She was incredibly responsive to student questions and comments and was also accommodating when extenuating circumstances required rescheduling some previously scheduled exams."

   "comments": [
    "This course is a critical part of our public health education. I would certainly recommend it to other students. I would suggest that they don't skip any lectures, and to identify a TA right from the get-go who they relate to and whose teaching style matches with their learning style because TAs play a surprisingly large role in this course seeing as you spend a full class-worth amount of time with them every single week. Yes, we get assigned a TA and can't necessarily choose to attend their sections instead of our own, but we can attend their office hours. Finding one you can relate to will enhance the experience greatly and cut down on a lot of inefficiencies in your learning.",
    "It was fine, felt a little slow at times.",
    "Useful but big workload",
    "Even if you're not epi or math inclined, take this class! It will help in all aspects of public health.",
    "The course is required for all public health students and gives a beneficial introduction to and foundation in epidemiology.",
    "Great. Loved it! People should definitely take it!",
    "It's an intro course; it will be crowded and instructor is the hardest person to reach. TA's will be your primary contacts. But all the material is there (lectures, HW, practise exams posted 2 months prior), you just have to use it to your advantage. If I honestly had my way, Yale would distinguish itself by making 2 sections of its EPI class. I think this is a course that could benefit from smaller classes; these are fundamental research skills and epi theory leads into all future courses. A lot of students aren't paying attention in such a big lecture hall, too much distance between prof and students leads to apathy on important topics such as reseach ethics and design.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Between the lectures and discussion, you have the opportunity to grasp the fundaments of Epidemiology in a supportive environment. The assessments are fair and it is a fun class (if you like math!).",
    "Take it if it's required. If not, just get an Intro to Epi textbook and self-teach yourself. You will just need to learn the basics to match what you learn in this class.",
    "Definitely recommend. Great intro to the topic, with a highly engaging professor.",
    "The course was good and I would recommend it to another student who wants to learn about various epidemiological topics.",
    "YSPH needs to reconsider the strength of instructor they devote to a required course.",
    "This is a required course, so there's not much latitude in whether you should take it. It's not too challenging conceptually, but it lays important groundwork for the rest of YSPH.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to other students as it provides a very thorough examination of epidemiological principles.",
    "You will learn a lot about different kinds of epidemiological study designs and calculations, which will be super useful moving forward. I would definitely recommend it, as you learn a lot but it's not an overwhelmingly difficult course.",
    "Good course if you're interested in the topic.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to any student!",
    "This course was very helpful and well structured. Even though it's a giant lecture class, I learned a lot and felt very engaged with my professor and TA.",
    "Great class, recommend",
    "An introduction to epidemiology with a pace that may be challenging in combination with four other classes, especially for those who have never taken an epidemiology class before. The homework takes a few hours each week, so make time for it.",
    "Very helpful for understanding the material",
    "Well it's required. But, it's a good course that teaches you so much important information for public health. Not all that hard. Learned tons about how to read studies and evaluate them that really enhances my ability to think critically about public health.",
    "Great Epi foundations course, you will learn a lot about study design and analysis.",
    "This is a good course that will teach you to read critically, produce your own research with a careful and critical approach, and in general be a more thoughtful public health practitioner. I would highly recommend it to other students.",
    "This is a core requirement, necessary to get through, Linda is a pleasure who you should learn from but mostly just do the work and get through the semester.",
    "Good",
    "Yes! Definitely!",
    "Yes,I would recommend this course",
    "great for better understanding studies.",
    "10\/10 recommend",
    "It is not a heavy workload course or a heavy subject, but it can be if you are not familiar with some basic epidemiology. If you have never seen epidemiology before, you may have to do a lot of independent teaching with limited help from professors. However, it can be done with some extra effort and being proactive to contact several different people for clarifications.",
    "So empowering! Probably one of the classes in your first term that will help you gain a feeling of being a public health professional. I definitely felt like I gained the most from this class of any other so far. It takes care, time, and effort to learn the concepts and they are very worthwhile and important.",
    "A must for those who haven't had epidemiology before; it's a great class and can be a lot of fun.",
    "This is a great course. The professor is outstanding, and it can best be described as FAIR, in the workload, in the questions on exams etc.",
    "Be ready for a rewarding course if you are willing to put in the hours to learn the material.",
    "Well, you have to go through this. Go to every class since it's 10:30 am not likely to be missed. Listen to Prof Niccolai carefully u will find this course rather ez",
    "Good",
    "I loved this class, and I would certainly recommend it to another student. This class has inspired me to focus on epidemiology in my future studies and future career, which is very different from what I was thinking when I started at YSPH. This class was exceptional, and I feel like I've learned so much from it.",
    "This is a good introduction to epidemiology, and the teaching staff is really helpful.",
    "I learned so much through this course. This is an important course for those that want a strong epidemiology foundation.",
    "This is an excellent course in introducing us to epidemiology, and I would definitely recommend.",
    "Rigorous but a great course to understand Epidemiology",
    "Great. Necessary for MPH student.",
    "I would recommend, as it provides useful public health research skills sets and new methods of thinking.",
    "The workload for this course is too much. There are too many exams and homework assignments.",
    "You have to take it. It'll be fine. :)",
    "I greatly recommend this course to any students pursuing the field of public health",
    "Although this class is fairly large and a survey course, Dr. Niccolai does her best to make it interesting.",
    "Intro epi - very approachable introduction to foundations of epidemiology.",
    "I would recommend that all public health students take Epidemiology, but I would recommend that they take it in two semesters in order to truly grasp the information.",
    "YSPH should consider a different professor.",
    "Yes, it's an essential class for all MPH students.",
    "Overall I would recommend this course to another student, but I would emphasise the need to take this course with other less time-demanding courses due to the workload",
    "This course is a solid introduction to epidemiology and I really enjoyed it! The teaching is concise, the assignments help reinforce the concepts, and the exams are fair. Epidemiology is such an important topic in public health and Professor Niccolai makes the class as enjoyable and painless as possible. Although this class is probably required and you have to take it anyway, it's definitely not bad at all!",
    "good",
    "This course offers a high level introduction to the study of epidemiology. Although many intricacies exist, the foundation for the study of epidemiology will be garnered by students.",
    "foundations course in understanding epidemiology.",
    "Good introductory course, Linda is a great teacher and the homeworks reinforce class material\/ help prepare for exams",
    "Introduction to fundamental concepts in epidemiology. The course is structured in such a way that it is easy to stay engaged and maintain a good grasp of the material throughout the course. Although it felt somewhat slow, I am confident most- if not all- students came away with a really solid, basic understanding of epi.",
    "Yes students should take it.",
    "I recommend this course. I am grateful to have learned many of the concepts that I have.",
    "I enjoyed this course. There was a lot of material covered in this course, but the structure was helpful in understanding the material. I am glad this is a mandatory course for all students because it is very applicable in the world of healthcare.",
    "It's a required course that contains many important basics of public health, so everyone should take it.",
    "N\/a",
    "A good introduction to epidemiologic concepts and techniques. I found that the course progressed a bit slowly at first, but lectures were always interesting on the whole. I was very impressed with the amount of material I realized I had learned by the end of the semester. I would recommend the course to any MPH student, though it is already a core requirement."
