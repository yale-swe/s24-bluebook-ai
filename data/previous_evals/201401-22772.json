   "comments": [
    "This is the best chance you are going to get to have current computation genomic approaches presented to you for a whole semester. It's a rather unique opportunity-take it.",
    "I would recommend gene 760 to other students. It's a challenging course, but you get a lot out of it. After taking this course, a biologist won't have to blindly depend on a bioinformatician to do analysis--he or she will at least know how the analysis is done and be able to question it.",
    "I would recommend the course if she\/he has enough time for that",
    "I would recommend it for any students that are doing computational biology.",
    "I would not recommend this class unless you are going to use one of these techniques for your own research. I would recommend that they not take any other classes or teach while taking this class (2nd years only). Learn Perl basics before taking the class.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. YOU NEED IT.Assuming no prior programming experience: Do NOT take this with other courses if you value sleep, friends, or your health. It will be incredibly confusing and difficult for a while, but I promise it gets better. I apologize in advance on behalf of perl. Resist the temptation to throw your computer across the room. Your computer is your friend, and it speaks many other languages, all of which are more same than perl. Afterwards, try python. It will restore your faith in programming. Hey, at least you're not coding in C.Assuming programming experience: this course will probably be simple, so please help those around you drowning in perl.",
    "With a little bit of programming experience, the class is sort of manageable. Without any programming experience, you will sink if you don't find a buddy with a little bit of programming experience. Therefore I do not recommend this course to somebody without programming experience unless their schedule is otherwise very light and they are a particularly patient person.",
    "I would recommend this class but warn the student that the homework assignments are very time-consuming if he\/she doesn't have any programming background",
    "If you think you'll need to use Louise\/a cluster or analyze genomic data, then this course will be helpful. But if you're trying to learn about how to properly use a variety of methods, I don't think this is an appropriate course (it just gives you a very broad overview of a variety of techniques). Be prepared, though, it's a lot of work and stress!!",
    "Yes.",
    "It is a very difficult class, and I like the topic so that was motivation to keep going, but in some ways it was unnecessarily difficult. It was a lot of work for the TA's and I felt pretty much uninformed the entire time. The group project at the end was outright painful. I enjoyed parts of this class, but I would not recommend this class to someone unless they were very interested in continuing on with computational work and genomics.",
    "Yes. It teaches a lot of bioinformatics. Especially important for students with no informatics background."

   "comments": [
    "This course absolutely gave me the skills I will need to take the research trajectory I want to and as no one in my lab or even my department had knowledge in this area, so this course was critical for me.",
    "It's actually the TA session is soooo useful rather than the lectures.",
    "It is helpful for my thesis in terms of RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis.",
    "Unfortunately I still don't have a great understanding of most of the techniques. I can physically run the pipelines really well, but I don't have a terrific understanding of what some of the data means. Potentially I will use some of these techniques for my thesis, but in reality seeing the lack of structure in the field has discouraged me from using some of these techniques.",
    "The main thing I gained from this course was programming experience. It was very helpful to get started, and I am already leveraging what I learned to perform molecular dynamics simulations using matlab and C. I don't know how I could have started learning other languages without banging my head against the wall with this course.",
    "It greatly deepened my knowledge of the discipline and was immediately and immensely useful to my research projects. I would strongly recommend it to somebody with some degree of programming experience and an interest in bioinformatics.",
    "I now feel comfortable with working on Louise and with various types of data sets and file formats.",
    "Helps me to get familiar with next generation sequencing techniques and the methods used to process and analyze the data.",
    "I am doing some computational work for my thesis, so the most invaluable aspect of this course was having the TA's to ask questions to. That was incredibly invaluable. We even used some of the specific programs I will be using. For the programs where I already had experience prior to this class, the class was very helpful. However, for the parts of the class that I had planned to use for future work, I found this class to be not very helpful.",
    "Answered above."
