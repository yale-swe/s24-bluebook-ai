    "This is a necessary course for anyone that will be going into synthetic organic chemistry. Be prepared to put in twice as much work&time studying into this class as any other, although it is worth it in the end.",
    "Good class. Material is very heavy, but all in all a good experience.",
    "The class is hard and you have to have the right mindset when you work on it. But its good for anyone doing synthesis, no matter what that synthesis entails. However, I would warn someone to make sure that they know this class will take up a lot of time and mental effort, so if they are not up for working several days in a row on one problem, don't take the class.",
    "I learned a lot from this class and if some one is interested in total synthesis, then they should definitely take the class.",
    "Several different approaches to total synthesis covering numerous reactions that you can add to you synthesis toolboxI would definitely recommend this course to students pursuing synthetic paths",
    "I would definitely recommend it if you are interested in synthetic organic chemistry",
    "Definitely I would recommend it to students in organic synthesis.",
    "I would describe the class as a great way to increase your knowledge of synthetic reaction, and to practice the art of designing complex molecules. I might mention that the class focuses almost exclusively on C, O chemistry. I would recommend the class."
