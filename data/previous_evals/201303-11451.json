    "chill class",
    "Fun and interesting class, if you're into medieval Celtic lit, and also a great way to kill a pre-1800s requirement if you're an English major not into Chaucer. Prof Gabriel is engaging and really excited to be teaching the class. Reading is light, and workload is super manageable--one short midterm paper and one 10ish page final paper."
