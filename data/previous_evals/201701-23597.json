   "comments": [
    "I learned so much in this course: - how to read, write and interpret historiographical texts - how to present historical information in a concise and organized manner - knowledge about African history from Great Zimbabwe to present-day - Topics in African urbanism and urbanism in general - Social and economic issues in past and present-day Sub-Saharan Africa",
    "Learnt how to extract important details and themes from long monographs. Learnt critical and close reading skills. Learnt the importance of being confident when putting across ideas and interpretations of the readings.",
    "I gained a wealth of information about a number of African cities through the diverse reading set and was able to engage with the materials through the discussions with the class. It was also an important class for me learning to really engage with the readings rather than other classes in which we skim the readings to find the main points. I also learned how to write a historiographical brief and approaches to learning in History.",
    "Where to begin. I learned so much this in this class. I learned how to compare varying sources and get through a large amount of material in a short time. While it seems like an obvious point about a class entitled \"Urbanism in African History,\" this class completely changed my perspective on cities, what they are, how they function, and maybe how we should aim to make them function. The selection of regions and period in time that we covered cohered really well. It is exceptionally difficult to cover cities on an entire continent in one class. We didn't do that, but what we did do was address the 'idea' of a city.",
    "I found studying history through the prism of urbanism incredibly useful as it placed our more specific discussion within broader concepts and global themes. I especially enjoyed our examination of earlier forms of African urbanism as I have rarely studied any pre-colonial African history.",
    "So much! Histories of cities, urban planning, urban development and more"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "I think it was pretty much perfect. It demanded a lot of participation which is what really made the class so good! I learned a lot from the professor, but equally as much from my class mates who had very different backgrounds than myself.",
    "This was an excellent class. The readings were really varied and challenging and gave us a nuanced view of African cities that I think is really lacking from other courses at Yale. We studied extremely varied eras, from medieval mud architecture of West Africa to the bustling networks and interactions of a main street in Accra. This class was one of the few classes I have taken here that really encouraged engagement and learning for enjoyment.",
    "The syllabus was great. I really enjoyed all of the reading and found that every week had something different to offer. I did not feel like we were just looking at different case studies on a weekly basis. Discussions in class were also wonderful. I thought that we had a really engaged group of people in class, which lead to in depths debates. I always came away from class really thinking. One thing I would have liked is more time to work on the final paper. I recognize that this might be my fault, and not the fault of the class, I think it would have been helpful to have had to submit a draft of the final paper earlier in the semester.",
    "I loved this class and felt the discussion was in-depth and illuminating. The reading was broad and touched on many different historical areas while still retaining common threads. One thing I would say is to perhaps have some smaller assignments to help get into writing for the class in advance of our two (very big) writing assignments.",
    "Strengths: The amount of content covered; the members of the class became quite close; the freedom on the final paper; the access to students from a variety of academic backgrounds; chance to get feedback from the entire class Weaknesses: Not so much a weakness but there is so much reading; also, the seminar meant that sometimes students spent a lot of time on topics not relating to the class."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely! It is very demanding - you need to read a lot, but it's worth it, because the classroom discussions are so valuable.",
    "Taking a class with Magaziner is always a transformative and very challenging experience. Take the class if you want to learn both about yourself and about African history.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in urbanism, urban studies, or African studies. The readings are really varied and interesting. The class is extremely discussion-based, so do the readings and don't be too intimidated to talk. Overall this approach really gets you to engage with the themes.",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you're interested in cities, African or not, or even just interested in people and how they live, you would be crazy not to take this class. It's a big challenge, but well worth the hours and work.",
    "Yes, the class felt important, relevant and useful. The reading was interesting and discussion exciting.",
    "If you are interested in learning a lot about academic thought on historical African cities in a very short period of time, this is your class. However, be prepared to dedicate hours everyday on this class! It is a READING INTENSIVE course!"
