   "comments": [
    "All labs track course material and are pretty fun to boot.",
    "Pretty good lab.",
    "Has to be done to take a class that is totally worth it. It can be a bit tedious sometimes and, unless your group is very energetic, you may be pretty bored for a lot of it. Plus, since labs are stretched out over two weeks, sometimes it feels like you're just wasting your time. However, it also means that you often have a chance to start the reports (which, for me at least, tended to take forever) in class and your TA often goes over most of what you need to do for the report anyway. Plus, it's only 5 assignments over the entire semester, one of which is a cool climate change debate. So it's definitely worth taking so you can take the lecture that goes with it!",
    "You have to take it with the class, so yes.",
    "If you take the Atmosphere's course that goes with this you have to take the lab. I recommend both anyway since they nicely supplement each other.",
    "This lab is not as intense as other science labs, but is nonetheless an effective way of exploring further the themes introduced in class.",
    "You have to take the lab in order to take the class. Apparently it's not so bad compared to other lab sciences.",
    "Only take it if you need to",
    "If you're taking the class, you probably have to take the lab. It won't change your life, and can actually be pretty interesting if you get a good TA.",
    "This lab was unique in that it actually connected with the lecture course quite a bit. Being able to relate hands-on experiences with class material was really cool, and the experiments were all interesting enough to make the lab reports easy to put together.",
    "If you have to take this lab with the course, than you're in luck: it's only 2 hours long once a week. Just keep in mind that while lab reports are only due every two weeks, they are challenging: don't procrastinate!",
    "My only caution is that while the lab is extremely interesting, the reports are quite time consuming.",
    "Yes! Totally worthwhile, a great part of the whole Atmospheres\/oceans\/environ. change class.",
    "I would recommend this course. While it is slow paced sometimes, you do learn a lot, gain new skills, and have fun.",
    "You have to take it with EVST 201. The lab is often fun, you get to go on field trips and release balloons, but also often a waste of time. You turn in lab reports every other week, so it is very low workload. You won't learn much, but you won't hate it and won't take much of your time. The content that is introduced is often worthwhile, we just didn't get any meaningful depth in it.",
    "You do a lot of cool experiments. I loved the weather balloon one, and you get to see a glimpse of how environmental science is done.",
    "Ehh. Not my thing. A bit tedius and boring.The weather balloon was fun, and I wish that the lab had been more like that throughout the entire semester.I found the debate on climate change at the end of the semester a bit unfair. It was structured in a way that resulted in some topics being quite easy to research, while others were incredibly hard to both research and understand--especially considering that some of the things we were expected to debate were hardly talked about in class or otherwise.",
    "The experiments are definitely enjoyable (being outside, using sophisticated measuring instruments) but a lot of what you get out of the lab depends on your TA and how much you are willing to put into it. The lab reports can be lengthy but as opposed to simply plug-and-chugging numbers, we were required to think about our results and because of that I think I got something out of this lab.",
    "I would summarize this lab as an unfortunate externality of the environmental studies 201 class. You must take it to take the class; which is definitely a worthwhile sacrifice to make in order to take the class. The lab is very tedious and pretty boring."
