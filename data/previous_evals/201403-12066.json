   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend L1 Russian to a fellow student. It's intense and it's fun, and you get to know so much by the end of the semester that there is a physical manifestation of your hard work. Due to the small classroom sizes, you are always involved in dialogue and the professor can pay attention to you individually, and it's a great experience. Of course the language itself is hard, and you have to learn a new alphabet, but it's a great intellectual challenge.",
    "Although I feel that Russian's difficulty is overrated, it does take decent work, at least at the beginning of the semester (which can be hard if you're a first-semester freshman, but it is well worth it). Once you get over the hump of learning a new letter system, new sounds, and new grammar, and you open yourself to changes in the way you think about language, the language begins to flow. This clearly takes longer for some than others, especially if Russian isn't particularly high on the priority list of classes, but if you put in the work, it's worth it. The homework might feel long at first, but it's just a matter of getting used to the format of the book. More time will likely be spent studying grammar sections in the book than on actual written homework.",
    "Try to get into Professor Hashbat's section. She definitely makes this class significantly better than it is otherwise. Russian is a great language. Definitely difficult but the amount of progress you'll make in one semester is so rewarding! The work load isn't too bad, and studying the grammar is significantly more important than studying the vocab for tests, which makes studying more manageable. Overall I loved this course and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a language to take.",
    "I'd absolutely recommend Russian. It's not a gut by any means- the grammar can be challenging primarily because nouns decline in 6 cases and 3 genders and there are several irregular verb declensions. This class will be easier for students who have already taken another language, especially Latin since the grammar is quite similar. If you're going to take the class, take it with Julia Titus.",
    "I really enjoyed this class. Julia runs a great section and her exams were very fair. It's a lot of fun and the language is fascinating.",
    "I fulfilled my language requirement with French and am just taking this class for fun. It is a great class. The workload isn't much if you do it consistently. There are daily worksheets and bi-weekly unit tests.",
    "I'm taking Russian for fun and am so glad I did with Professor Titus. Russian is admittedly a difficult language but Julia makes it digestible in a fun and engaging way. If you have any interest in Russian or languages in general, I would highly recommend this class!",
    "Yes. It is challenging but very rewarding.",
    "I wish I would have known just how difficult this class would have been coming in as a freshmen; by far the hardest and probably the hardest I'll ever take at Yale. Yulia is great, but takes a lot of time to get used to her teaching style, and Russian is no joke, no matter how easy they try to tell you it is in the beginning. Grading is also tough; effort doesn't get you very far and it is often an 'all or nothing' approach. That being said, I do not regret taking it. It will whoop my butt again next semester and will remain my lowest grade on my transcript by far, but I feel it's one of the language classes, by design, that you get a lot out of because it is very much a 'sink or swim' style class. Take it if you really want to learn the language as a life goal and will stick with it all offered years, if not, keep on looking.",
    "Absolutely! Russian is an important language for many disciplines, and Prof Titus helps make this class worthwhile.",
    "Great class, great language. Don't let it intimidate you because it's a lot of fun to learn!"
