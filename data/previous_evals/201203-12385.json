    "This course is one of the overlooked gems of the university system. It was supposed to be a lecture, but the class ended up only having 14 students in it, and the amount of personal attention we received from Professor Biggs was huge. The man is a genius, and this is probably the best opportunity an undergraduate will get to work closely with someone like him.",
    "If you have an interest in theater or the arts in general, take it! The class is very manageable: two exams (noncumulative) and two papers, all four components 25% each.",
    "If you want to read and think in depth about the plays on the syllabus take this class. If not, it will be a strain. The course is very text-driven, as are the exams. So, if you're not interested in reading the plays, it will not be fun.",
    "Very solid course. Fascinating reading and interesting lectures which illuminate new parts of each play. The workload is manageable, and I would definitely recommend doing all of the reading--material just doesn't get any better than this. At least one of the plays Professor Biggs picks for each playwright is a work which challenges general assumptions about his style.Professor Biggs is extremely knowledgeable and committed. He is always willing to engage with students further on topics that come up in class or are of particular interest to them.There are two plays per week, two medium-length papers, and two exams. Standard, manageable workload.",
    "This is a great course to take - if you're a Theater or English major you may have already read some of the plays or some of the playwrights before, but I doubt you would have covered them in as much depth. The class is organized as follows: classes take lecture form, but there are always snippets of a film adaptation of the play studied shown, or even a live performance of a scene by some of your fellow classmates (side note: doing the scenes is so much fun!). There's also a weekly section, which students are expected to lead, and that allows us to ask questions or bring up something that we found interesting, frustrating, funny, disturbing....I would definitely suggest taking this class - it was a great addition to my schedule, and is definitely a worthwhile Cr\/D if you don't think you have time to totally commit to another class.",
    "If you're remotely interested in modern drama, you should take this class. The reading is good and varied-- never too tedious that you'll resent taking the class-- and the lectures are even better. Plus, Prof. Biggs is a delight-- he puts on occasional staged readings of the plays, surprisingly fun!",
    "It's a good way to explore fascinating authors.",
    "Absolutely."
