    "I would recommend this to the student who enjoys doing political science readings and enjoys talking about them. It's not an incredibly daunting topic, as long as you have something to say about being American or living in America, you can offer your own personal opinion on the texts.",
    "It's a discussion of the abstractions that frame modern American life. I'd recommend it, but with reservations. Class discussions can sometimes get a little too unstructured.",
    "If you are interested in reading some Tocqueville and thinking about the American Dream it's a perfect course. Tocqueville is the entire first half of the semester. I found it really interesting but if it doesn't appeal to you it is a big part of the course.",
    "A great-in-theory class run by a very smart professor with a knack for explaining ideas and exploding students' complacencies; this semester it was pretty bad because the students were generally disengaged and not receptive to the material (of which a sizable and by far the most interesting part consists of criticisms of American classical liberalism and both the modern liberalism and conservatism that come out of it). Professor Bilakovics did about 90% of the talking. The reading is really great, but if you're smart and want to get a lot out of this class you should take it with equally smart friends with whom you can talk about the reading and have serious discussions, instead of being locked in a room for 2 hours every week with idiotic PoliSci majors who think \"All men are created equal\" is from the Constitution, as I was. Still, it was well worth it to get a good understanding of Tocqueville: he's AMAZING. Whether you take this class or not, read Democracy in America, and the way you see politics will be forever changed.",
    "In this class we read about and discussed different concepts of the idea of the American Dream. The first half of the semester was devoted to reading Tocqueville's Democracy in America, and even though I had read a lot of it before, I never truly understood what he was saying until I read it in this class. There was a lot of reading and writing, but it was worth it because it truly changed my life and the way I think about society and my place in it. The second semester examines various authors' views of the American Dream--either idealizations of America or critiques about what's wrong with America today, and Tocqueville remains a relevant theme throughout the course. It was a fantastic class, and Professor Bilakovics is a great mentor if you want to improve your writing.",
    "Yes if your interestted in tocqueville",
    "I think this class is incorrectly named. While it is a fairly thorough overview of the philosophy behind the notion of being American, etc., it wasn't necessarily a study of the American Dream. If students are looking more at a contemporary study of the American Dream, this is not the right class for them, but if instead they are looking to read many of the fundamental texts that have shaped American thought over time, this would be an adequate class. The reading isn't too difficult and it is sometimes interesting. One thing to keep in mind: this class met once weekly, for two hours, which is a little difficult to handle during really busy weeks. It might have been better if the seminar met twice for half the time...",
    "Yes -- makes you think about why American politics are the way they are, and on what ideas they were founded."
