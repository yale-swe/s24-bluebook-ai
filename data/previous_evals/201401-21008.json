   "comments": [
    "Yes.",
    "I would recommend it if you need to take it or really want to learn Spanish but it is not very fun.",
    "If you decide to take Spanish, Oscar is the man!",
    "With Oscar, the course is lively and fun. There are daily homework assignments, but this is true of all Spanish L3 classes; it takes no more than a half hour to complete. The course as a whole was also very well structured; it had interesting stories and cultural material with grammar lessons lightly sprinkled throughout. I highly recommend this course, and even more so with this professor.",
    "Good but boring. Obviously a lot with class every day",
    "It's a pretty standard Spanish 3 class. You go over all of the verb tenses, learn some more advanced grammar, read stories in spanish, and give some oral presentations.",
    "For those who have taken 110 and 120 at Yale (as I did), 130 is a great way to get more comfortable with grammar that was quickly learned in the past . My writing and speaking skills greatly improved."
