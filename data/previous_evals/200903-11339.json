   "comments": [
    "If you're looking for an easy L5 class, this is the way to go. If you're looking for something a little more challenging, you'll be disappointed.",
    "This is a relatively easy class that can help improve your confidence speaking the language. You get to speak a lot in this class, which is good.There is very little focus on grammar, but you still can lose a lot of points for incorrect grammar.The work can get a little tedious, especially some of the debates, such as the ones on immigration, which tend to be one-sided.",
    "I would recommend this class to somebody trying to fulfill their foreign language requirement having gotten a 5 on the AP Spanish Language test. It was a great follow up to AP Spanish, not to difficult, but just difficult enough. The readings were generally interesting and easy to understand. I don't feel that my speaking improved all that much, but your ability to read in Spanish will significantly improve!",
    "Take this course if you like to read articles\/stories and discuss them in Spanish during class. That's pretty much what the class is.",
    "This class is good if you want to practice your Spanish, but I felt like I talked more in other Spanish classes. If you want to practice Spanish, but you are shaky on grammar, you may want to take Grammar first.",
    "It is a great way to enhance your vocabulary and fluency. I recommend it.",
    "This class is fairly good for people who want to practice their verbal Spanish skills. It can be interesting, and some of the activities are actually fun. Other parts can be quite frustrating. More like a high school class, with little homework assignments all the time. Terry Seymour is a really nice professor."
