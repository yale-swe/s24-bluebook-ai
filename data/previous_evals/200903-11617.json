    "If you love Portuguese and want to sharpen your speaking and writing skills, take this class. Not too much work and pretty fun.",

    "Port 130 is interesting and relatively easy. It gets repetitive quickly, it's not very interactive, and Prof. Almeida is nice but not too enthusiastic, but you'll solidify a lot of the things you learn in L1 and L2 Portuguese.",
    "If at all possible, I'd say you might want to take the class with Tania, the other Portuguese professor. I haven't taken a class with her personally so she's something of a mythical creature to me because everyone who has taken her class absolutely loves her.It's a good language class, you learn but there's very little work involved and deadlines are not set in stone at all so it adapts well to a busy schedules. All in all, I don't regret taking it."
