   "comments": [
    "An engaging look at multiple approaches to three significant themes in musicology (the written tradition, the issue of performance, and the ever-momentous Wagner). Trying to keep the previous few week's readings fresh in your mind will help enormously in making the connections (a) that the course structure fosters and (b) that Professor Tomlinson will encourage you to find for yourself. To get the most out of this course you would be best advised to set aside some additional processing\/ pondering time on top of direct reading\/ work time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend the course; although it differed slightly from my initial expectations, I still enjoyed it and felt that it often intersected with many other topics covered in other courses; the final paper in particular was a great opportunity to apply the theoretical and philosophical issues and methods we discussed to a topic that particularly interested me.",
    "This course asks broad questions about why we choose the historiographical methods that we do and what kind of ramifications these choices have. I would definitely recommend this class to another student.",
    "The Historiography course covers a variety of topics intended to challenge some of the assumptions on which twentieth-century musicology was based and to suggest different possibilities for studying music history. I would strongly recommend the course for any student interested in re-examining current research methods, because the course sketches important branches of critical thought in the humanities from the past 50 years or so."

   "comments": [
    "This course is likely to have a stronger impact after a little time and space has given the readings, ideas and discussions a chance to percolate! It was very useful to disentangle some of the implicit ideas that have shaped musicology as a field (eg Taruskin and the lasting and widespread impact that assuming a literate musical tradition as a starting point can have) although some of the readings were not immediately related to it, with the connections becoming apparent only over time. While the topics discussed in class are unlikely to shape my immediate future research (whether in dissertation or elsewhere) the course nonetheless provided much food for thought about what musicology is, has been, can be, should be etc which will be useful to bear in mind now and in the future.",
    "It was great to come across sources I may not otherwise have read but that clearly influence the discipline as a whole and common ways of thinking within the field. I'm certain that I will return to the issues discussed during the course of my future work.",
    "Yes I definitely feel that this course deepened my understanding of a number of important things. This class provided lots of the kind of meta-thinking that I am interested in.",
    "The course helped to better to understand and contextualize my own intellectual position as a musicologist and as a North American humanities scholar. Although most of the particular topics and authors in this course might not end up playing an important role in my dissertation, the material is very important to my goal of becoming a critical and innovative researcher."
