    "This is an excellent course if you are interested in learning to write through implication. The readings are very interesting and relatively short, so make sure you do them. Professor Shirkhani is also very helpful.",
    "This class changed the way I write and think. Cultural criticism is the subtlest kind of argument -- almost every essay that you read is a cultural critique, and the most successful (and persuasive) ones do all of their convincing underhandedly. This section may not seem as applicable to real life as some of the other 121 sections, but learning how to dissect cultural criticism (just look at the syllabus -- it's amazing) will teach you so much more than just cultural criticism: it can reshape the fundamental way you approach argument and language. Prof. Shirkhani is brilliant and wonderfully generous with her time and energy and will push you to stretch your abilities to think about a topic, no matter how random or convoluted or seemingly esoteric it is, far beyond what you would have believed you were capable of prior to this class. If you enjoyed 120, take this class. If you enjoy reading and talking about incredible essays, take this class. If you want to learn the real art of persuading someone with nothing more than your words, take this class. It's so much fun and worth every minute of your time.",
    "Absolutely! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale! Take this if you want to be a smart consumer of culture, be really cool around your friends, and write like a pro",
    "If you are interested in seeing the society and cultural artifact from a more critically and in depth, take it! The essays we read are all so awesome. Professor Shirkhani is very kind, patient, and insightful.",
    "Engl. 123 is not for someone trying to get an easy writing credit. It takes commitment but ultimately you will be the better for it, my writing (and thinking) skills were enhanced dramatically by the course and I am so glad I took it.",
    "Take this course. Shirkhani is incredible, and you get to read essays by people like Joan Didion and David Foster Wallace for class and then try to write some essays like theirs for yourself. Take this if you've taken English 120 and want more, or if you like cultural criticism and want to try writing it, or if you just need a writing credit. You won't regret it."
