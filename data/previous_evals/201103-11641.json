   "comments": [
    "German 110 01 was a rigorous introductory course that packed a lot of material into one semester. It was very rewarding and provides students with many resources and opportunities to learn the language. I would definitely recommend the course to another student who is interested in either learning a new language or simply gaining a better understanding of German culture.",
    "highly recommend",
    "For a language credit, GMAN 110 is perfect. THERE ISN'T A FINAL EXAM, folks. Tests are only 25% of the grade, as well. The language is not that difficult (in my opinion), since many words are similar to their English equivalent. Just a very chill, probably typical, intro language course.",
    "It wasn't a hard class but very demanding and a large time commitment. I would recommend the class, but one should be prepared to work very hard especially if you have no experience with German. Many people in my class already had years of German in high school or knew some German, so I felt like I was at a disadvantage the whole semester.",
    "Work hard, look at the material everyday even if only for a minute if you can. It is quite condensed. I would definitely recommend it. German is great!"
