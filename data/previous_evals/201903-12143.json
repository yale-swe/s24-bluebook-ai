    "Acquired a wide range of knowledge in terms of British cinema, especially the legacy of Griersonian documentary",
    "Not just knowledge of British Cinema history, about which I learned a great deal, but how to participate in seminar in an enthusiastic, excited, vulnerable wayhow to work through intellectual problems and disagreements in class respectfully. This was the class where I felt the most free to take intellectual risks and go out on a limb. It was an absolute delight.",
    "Though Id taken many cinema and cinema history courses, Id never taken one focused particularly on the cinema of Britain. The material really allowed me to fit this new material & historical knowledge into my pre-existing understanding of film history."

   "comments": [
    "We could watch more films and have a couple of sessions in the British Art Center",
    "The biggest strength of the course was the openness of the seminarthis was where I felt the most confident that other students would tell me if they thought I was getting something wrong. That's not always something you can count on in graduate school, and I attribute it directly to Katie's encouraging and curious way of running a discussion. I have no complaints about the course.",
    "I found the course material to be well-curated, but often difficult. I dont, however, see an easy way around that difficulty, as British film has often been cutting edge, controversial, or even, at times dull, and all of that seems relevant to the classs survey of its history and progression."

    "I have had a wonderful experience in this class and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in cinema and\/or British culture. The class attracted a highly engaged and diverse group of students, and I have had the impression that Prof. Trumpener's excellent classroom management skills ensured that participation remained both unstrained and inclusive for the group throughout the term. I really liked the format in which the films were the focus of our conversation every time, with little to no reading assignments. Prof. Trumpener provides concise and helpful remarks on the historical and artistic context of the works and allows the majority of class time to be a free-flowing discussion, which was both enjoyable and intellectually enriching. My favorite film of the semester was Patrick Keiller's \"London,\" which probably is not the most obvious pick - I think there was something for everyone in this syllabus that contained films from a variety of styles, genres, and time periods.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "Absolutely.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone interested in exploring the oft-passed over history of Britains cinema, probably having already taken a course or two on cinema history in broader non-national terms."
