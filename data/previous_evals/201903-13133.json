   "comments": [
    "This course gives both a great overview and good in depth perspectives on many aspects of cancer. Molecular mechanisms, cellular level, organism level.",
    "Basic knowledge in cancer biology and therapeutics.",
    "This biology course, unlike many I have taken before, is NOT about memorizing everything on a slide and regurgitating it (perhaps in a slightly modified manner). Rather, this course integrates many facets of cancer biology and builds a unique view of cancer that isn't solely from a molecular vantage (in this way, the course title may be a bit misleading). Each lecture seems to tell a complete story, so now I feel that I have a solid overview of various cancer mechanisms on a molecular, cellular, and organismal level, as well as current treatment therapies. This is a very interesting course that I really enjoyed.",
    "This course gives you an in-depth but graspable understanding of the molecular events that surround tumor development and also provides a complimentary background on how these molecular events have been and continue to be targetted but cancer therapies.",
    "Learned about the multiple aspects of biology that give rise to cancer. Overall, the disease is much more complicated and multi-faceted than one may think at first.",
    "I got a solid overview of the genetic and cellular processes underlying cancer development, as well as a deeper understanding of what different kinds of treatments are used for and where the field is going in terms of personalized therapy. Generally, this class served as an excellent way of understanding the \"what, why, and how\" of cancer.",
    "A good overview and understanding of the many mechanisms that can lead to the development and progression of cancer.",
    "I learned about the mechanisms of cancer development, the role of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and the mutual interactions of cancer with the tumor microenvironment. I gained insight into the modes of action and side effects of cancer therapy, including chemotherapy and immunotherapy.",
    "A great overview of the basics of cancer biology"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Lectures are very engaging and well organized. The class clearly has a structure and a flow.",
    "This course was well organized and i thought the lectures and material was clear. Only thing that may help in the future is consistant access to practice questions\/exams for midterms.",
    "The lectures were a reasonable length that allowed me to fully understand every slide and every concept the professor wanted me to see. I never felt like I was cramming for exams, but rather synthesizing the information and making unique connections that allowed me to more fully appreciate the complexities of cancer biology. I found the textbook to be very helpful (the sides contain nearly no text, so if you miss something during the lecture, the slides are NOT sufficient to explain the content). That said, those students who don't have a book may be at a disadvantage and this inequality should be addressed (the book is very expensive).",
    "Dr. Dimitrova is an incredible professor. She presents information clearly, giving enough details\/examples that the concepts make sense but not requiring the memorization of unnecessary information. The class was open, and questions were welcome. This is one of the best classes I have taken in my 3 years at Yale, and I recommend anyone with an intro bio background who is interested in cancer to take this class!",
    "The course was very interesting, but it seemed that the content was more of an overview of many topics in cancer biology than really diving into one. The student drug-presentations at the end were not very helpful and became rather repetitive.",
    "One of the greatest strengths of this course was the focus on important concepts rather than rote memorization. I feel that I will remember most of what I learned, unlike in other courses, where I feel I will forget soon after the exam.",
    "The \"hallmarks\" framework was a great way of organizing our learning - giving just enough nuance and depth to our understanding of cancer, while remaining sufficiently broad so that we touched on a lot of different areas. There was definitely something of interest to everyone regardless of one's individual background or interests in biology, whether it was genetic, cellular, or developmental. Personally, I really appreciated that the course had real-world, clinical applications, and that tests often evaluated our ability to apply our knowledge to more clinical scenarios. That helped everyone succeed regardless of the different ways that people think best. The only two improvements I would suggest would be that discussion section be slightly more structured, perhaps with varied activities to reinforce our understanding of the papers, and that the final paper assignment should either be shorter or much broader in scope (it was a struggle to reach 6 pages while focusing on only one drug.)",
    "Strengths - Nadya, the range of topics discussed, the reasonable workload, the integration of the different topics discussed in lecture Weaknesses - trying to schedule a section after the course has started for a class of 20 students based on everyone's availability is not really realistic, some of the topics could have been a little more in-depth",
    "The strengths of this course are Prof. Dimitrova's thoughtful and comprehensive style of teaching, her excellent organization of the course material, and the selected readings for the course. I was not very impressed by the discussion sections, as they often reviewed basic ideas about the weekly reading and did not strengthen my understanding of the material.",
    "Good lectures and organization. Grading feedback is a bit odd, and can feel unfair at times"

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this to any non-MCDB or MCDB major interested in cancer. Everything is approachable without too much basic biology and professor dimitrova is incredibly helpful.",
    "Yes! If you are at all interested in cancer biology, I would highly recommend.",
    "Yes. This course is not too much work, and cancer biology is such a relevant field\/disease to understand because so many people are affected by it. Nadya is fantastic too, so even if you don't want to be a doctor or a cancer researcher, still consider this course.",
    "Yes! This is the best structured, best taught class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Yes! Prof. Dimitrova does a great job of balancing princples and fundamental concepts with specifics and her exams are very much reasonable and based on what was covered in class. A good intro into one of the biggest fields of biological research today, and Prof. Dimitrova does a good job keeping the course grounded in the human impact of the biological phenomena discussed.",
    "Yes, the course was very interesting and I am curious to see where it goes in the next few years, as this semester was its pilot.",
    "This was an amazing course and I would definitely recommend it. The material was super interesting and I came away from the class with a good understanding of modern progress in cancer research. The workload is not too high and the emphasis is on big picture concepts rather than memorizing tiny biological details. Nadya is an amazing professor, she explains things really well and clearly cares about her students.",
    "Yes! I liked that the topic was more specific than some other MCDB courses of a similar level, yet the class offers a sample of many different areas of biology so I felt I was building new knowledge even outside the cancer-specific realm. For people who have an extensive biology background or who conduct cancer research, I can see how the class might not be sufficiently challenging. I came into this class without having taken many advanced bio classes (pre-med, but not a science major), and this class was perfect for me - not overwhelmingly technical, and constantly applied the material to a clinical context. It felt like the material was truly relevant to future patients, and I loved that! It's also never a stressful amount of work (3 exams, mandatory section, a presentation, and a paper on the presentation topic.)",
    "Definitely - revitalized my interest in doing cancer research in the future",
    "Yes, I would highly recommend this course to any student interested in gaining a better understanding of cancer and its mechanisms of development."
