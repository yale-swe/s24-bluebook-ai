    "I thought the pace of the class was off: lots of problem sets and dense lectures frontloaded, then the midterm pretty early too. The second half of the course seemed to tail off when lectures weren't as obviously critical to attend unless they related to one's final project. I think it would have been interesting to spread the topical lectures throughout the term rather than just have them all at the end (at least the ones that lend themselves to that change), and to delay the midterm or spread the problem sets out as well.",
    "I had trouble grasping the concepts in the first half of the class. I think that overall more lab time and less class time would have been really beneficial. Im not sure how you can better communicate the theortically concepts, but I think discussing them while working on the computer would help me make the connection. The labs are where I learned the most and Larry was a great help during labs and while developing my final project."

I felt like it was easy to disengage from what I was doing if it didn't feel like I was in search of the answer to a particular question.",
    "I liked the organization and approach of this course. I am not sure I have an substantive feedback. The timing between the second problem set and the exam were a bit tight. I also wish we received feedback on labs a bit sooner (it would have been helpful for final project to make sure we weren't completely off in our thinking). That said, there was so much support in the lab from Larry that he made sure you were on track.",
    "Lectures later in the semester were interesting to attend but felt optional.If you want to continue with RS work after the class, you basically have to either integrate it into an independent research project or have the timing right to catch Seto's advanced class, taught every other year--not in the cards for me.",

Actually, the class is more like 2 courses in one--the first part is closer to an undergraduate class, with physics problem sets and memorization of terms. The second half is more conceptual and focus turns to work on your final project. Beyond the first 2 weeks I didn't find readings necessary to grasp the material--generally most learning at this point was done in labs.",
