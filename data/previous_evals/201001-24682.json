   "comments": [
    "Focuses narrowly on early monasticism, so if that doesn't sound interesting, don't take it. It will improve your handling of primary sources, but the reading is usually long and dry.",
    "I would recommend this class, although with some reservations. The time-period covered is a little restrictive- I would probably have preferred a more general survey of Monastic traditions up to the early Medieval period. Sometimes there seemed to be little movement from week-to-week, and the assignments were maybe a little pedantic.However, it was also a genuinely interesting class, and I learned a lot about something new. Professor Layton is engaging and clearly knows his stuff.",
    "This course was excellent. It was exactly what a history or religious studies course should be. We read primary sources and really engaged them: what did they say? what were their influences? how did they compare to each other? The weekly reading responses honed in on different historical methods and helped me become a better historian. The material is also extremely interesting, and we do a thorough job of reading the relevant material about monasticism. The papers, also, are a great way to engage the text since Professor Layton just wants us to use primary sources without outside articles or opinions. The class atmosphere is also really nice because we always go around sharing our working paper topics, which enables everyone to support and help each other.Professor Layton is just fantastic. Although he clearly is EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the material, he is utterly humble and gives room for us students to interact with the texts. He is extremely deliberate in his words and teaching style, yet he is also approachable and regularly meets with his students.I totally recommend this class!",
    "An interesting Junior Seminar with a remarkably small workload. Layton is a great guy and the content is interesting, but spread over 13 weeks it became a little repetitive.",
    "This is one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Layton has a very novel approach to historical investigation that is helpful for developing skills in 'mining' ancient sources for information. I also found the material to be very thought-provoking and to have changed my perspective - I am definitely going to persue the topic further during my summer because of interest I found in the class.",
    "Yes, take this class. You can definitely learn a lot--not just about monasticism itself, but about the way you think about and write history.",
    "if you're interested in the subject, definitely take it.",
    "I would for the professor, but not necessarily for the material. Be warned that it is extremely in depth and not interesting outside of specifics."
