   "comments": [
    "Brad's lectures were awesome, as were guest lectures. Julie's were pretty good as well. I really struggled with Pete's lectures. Lots of fuzzy, unexplained graphs. He barely seemed interested in what he was saying, and didn't do a good job answering student questions, Brad had to step in often. But I like the ethic of the class.",
    "1: The readings were useful. However, the lectures would have been enhanced if the professors made more direct references to the assigned readings or facilitated a discussion on the readings for 10 minutes or so during the class. Though the readings and the lectures were related, more could have been done to complement the two.",
    "The lectures for this course were useless. The professors could use a tremendous amount of training when it comes to presenting and thinking about what information to disseminate. There is a difference between knowledge and information. I learned nothing from this class about hydrology, engineering solutions evaluation, legal precedents or environmental economics frameworks - which are some of the things that were promised in the syllabus. Brad Gentry tended to air on the side of simplicity and barely ever gave any nuance to his larger takeaways. I was often left thinking \"so what\". Pete Raymond often assumed that his unlabelled tiny charts were intelligible to the audience and didn't actually explain what one should see in them. Again, there were NO scientific principles conveyed through his lectures. The guest lecturers were substantially better than the core teachers and made me question why I had attended FES over other programs given how poor the teaching is in comparison.",
    "Clarity in explanation and responsiveness to questions varies among the three professors. Prof. Gentry did a great job of acknowledging the perspectives of class members and then stepping them along the path to new or deeper understandings.",
    "There are three instructors for this course, and the quality of their instruction varied.Pete - thehardest to follow and usually deflected rather than answered student questions. Did make scientific processes accessible for non-science folks,Julie - the best lecturer of the three, clear and concise, specific and practicalBradford - the most informal lecturer, raised interesting questions and happy to engage with students. Sometimes wasn't as information rich as I would have liked.",
    "This questionnaire should be set up differently to acknowledge the team teaching aspect of the course.",
    "This course is better for first year students",
    "Out of the three instructors, Julie was the best. Her lectures were very informative although she would present the material a bit too fast.The structure of the class was a bit disjointed. The lectures between the three professors did not link up very well and the information was not presented as holistic concepts.",
    "Perhaps being very broad is the intent of the course, but I still found it too broad. It could have beenfocused on just one of the three cases, with the opportunity to go more in depth into the theory of how water systems are managed and what sorts of actors intervene. Also, the team assignments were too open and one could write about literally anything in them, so it was extremely hard to take away concrete lessons from doing them.",
    "It was great to have inputs from 3 different faculty, but their lessons were not as interconnected as they could have been.",
    "The topics were very interesting, and the Bay Game was a great experience. I was a bit frustrated withthe paper-writing process, which was the heart of the class for me - this may have been specific to our group, or to my experience in it, but I felt like I didn't learn as much from my teammate's expertise or delve into the topics as much as I would have liked, because we felt we needed to focus more on coming up with and \"selling\" a solution than on analyzing the problem. This may be part of the point of the class, and I may feel differently once more time has passed, but by the third paper I felt like we understood the difficulty of making decisions with incomplete information, and that we were just re-hashing the process we'd already established in the first two papers. It felt like a bit of a missed opportunity.",
    "Overall, this class is excellent in concept and in practice.",
    "Questions 8-10 are hard to answer because it's a team-taught class. I really enjoyed Brad and Julie's teaching styles, and felt that they worked hard to make connections and work with students, but Pete was harder to follow and his slides were often out of context. So, depending on the professor, I would give different scores. However, on the whole, I thought that the subject matter was REALLY compelling and gave us the opportunity to do some good thinking.",
    "I very much appreciated that the course was team-taught. I found Julie and Brad's lectures to be highlyrewarding and thought-provoking; Pete's left much to be desired.Many of the skills we covered in lab sections were particularly useful in other arenas; I thought the cases were all tremendously interesting and thought-provoking."

    "Expose us to interesting cases.",
    "Guest lectures - esp the b-school guy, the Tufts woman, and the final lecture on the Gulf (although it really made me question why the hypoxic zone was included as a subject of this class)",
    "The breadth of topics and opportunity for students to solve real world problems.",
    "Interaction among professors; complexity of the cases and depth of the analysis for the case studies; the Bay Game; guest lectures;",
    "Team work was the best part of this class. I learned a lot by working with my classmates from different perspectives and background. We were assigned to work on three papers with different topics, and finding solutions for the problems was challenging but helpful to understand how things work in the real world.",
    "The cases were all really interesting. The Gulf case was the hardest to approach and figure out what todo, but a good and challenging exercise.",
    "The case studies are interesting and promote consideration of a variety of factors in choosing a 'best' solution.",
    "Readings for the case studies were well structured, and guest lecturers provided great additional insights to the topics discussed in class.",
    "I really enjoyed the section focusing on the Bangladesh arsenic issue. It was valuable in that it made us consider socio-economic, development, and public health issues outside the U.S. It was an issue that had very tangible impacts on a population with real stakes for finding solutions.",
    "Interesting subject matter",
    "Fun teamwork and good concept.",
    "The team teaching approach I found useful.",
    "The lectures were very interesting, and the diversity of the professors' backgrounds really shone through to provide a more whole picture of the issues we were tackling.",
    "I liked how the course was divided into 3 case studies.",
    "I thought all of the cases chosen were extremely interesting.",
    "Team assignments.",
    "None. The course should not be offered again.",
    "Group work is a crucial skill and the different experience levels among teams is important for fostering development of that skill. Ambiguity also becomes more familiar to students in the course. High-level management and analytic skills for decision making are reinforced in readings.",
    "This course was helpful in learning how to do its very title -- develop management solutions to science-based problems. The instructors presented a valuable framework for assessing problems and creating viable\/effective solutions.",
    "julie's lectures and guest lectures",
    "Working in a team to write all three papers. Definitely continue this practice, please. I especially liked that we were grouped after taking the background survey. The case studies were well chosen and interesting.Also, learning how to use the causal loop software was super useful. Definitely recommend keeping that.",
    "Great selection of readings and diversity of approaches with each case study.Three case studies is an optimal number to be able to balance breadth and depth. I liked each case study.Team taught perspectives enhanced learning, and the guest lectures were especially excellent.",
    "The integration between science, policy and implementation.",
    "That is was directly concerned with current, real-world issues. That we heard from multiple guest speakers from different disciplines.",
    "The best aspect of this class was the team teaching. I really enjoyed learning from different professors and knowing that there was an expert in the room for any question I could think to ask.",
    "Learning to effectively work in groups and learn to satisfy multiple \"bosses\" requirements and expectations, learning the complexity of problems, guest lecturers.",
    "I appreciated the opportunity to get an in-depth knowledge of several different sides of a specific issue. It seems like the readings were well-selected, the professors did a good job of presenting different points of view, and I found the guest speakers very interesting.",

    "A lot of fascinating information.",
    "The reliance on team-based case studies.",
    "The interdisciplinary perspective",
    "Working in a team of students that come from different backgrounds and experiences.",
    "It makes you work in teams. Personally, I feel I gained some good teamwork skills. Even when it's hard, you learn to discuss, write and critique your team's work.Great idea to put teams together based on different backgrounds.It also provides you with great skills to analyze complex problems and a framework to deal with team and find a solution.",
    "The project work was the most valuable part of the class. That is where I felt we were doing the most learning.",
    "Allows students to see the complexity of environmental issues, wicked problems and the fact that solutions can be difficult to arise at. Group work and readings are helpful in understanding the complexity of problems and reaching potential solutions.",
    "I liked the format of the course. I think that three case studies is a good amount. More case studies would have seemed rushed and less would have made it seem like we were going too slowly. I also found the group work to be a valuable part of this course.",
    "The three cases were interesting and diverse. The systems-thinking approach taught in the course is extremely useful, as are the tools and methods, including the causal loop diagram and the multi-criteria decision matrix. It was really helpful to be placed in the role of a decision-maker and to have access to various forms of information--from social science to natural science--and to be forced to make decisions. I think this is great preparation for decisions that we will all need to make in a real work setting. Particularly helpful were assignments in which we had to logically defend our decisions through writing professional memos.",
    "The cases we looked at were fascinating. I really enjoyed delving into them, especially since it was my first time really looking at water issues.",
    "The topics were very interesting and relevant. The guest speakers were excellent and made the cases come to life. This class was a great introduction to using science to frame management strategies. It was also a great orientation to working in teams. The instructors are committed to continuously improving the class and are very open to feedback.",
    "Although working on group papers was challenging, it was also an extremely valuable experience and one the best aspects of the course. I also greatly appreciated the multi-disciplinarity brought by Pete, Julie, and Brad.",
    "Interesting cases",
    "This course discussed the concept of stakeholder involvement, which is relevant in any field."

   "comments": [
    "I would prefer to see the return of the individual paper either for one case or for all cases. Though I understand that the real world usually exists in group project form, having nearly all of the work for the class in the same group was very frustrating. Assignments that are broad and less structured like those in this class lend themselves to being thought about, changed, considered some more, changed again, and so on. That is a very, very difficult thing to do in a group in a very compressed time frame. The themes that end up in the paper develop a sort of inertia that is nearly impossible to slow in a group but is an easy thing to deal with individually.If there must be groups, I'd advocate for self selecting groups. Grouping with people you can work well with serves everyone better than does being placed in a dysfunctional group.",
    "I personally don't really agree with the idea of causal-loop diagram. I don't want to be forced to use this tool all through the semester.I think the instructors should really improve their presentation skills and slide making skills.",
    "Pete's lectures. The GOM section was also just less interesting than the first two, and the lecture made me feel like it wasn't even that important. I'm surprised there wasn't any section on water scarcity\/drought -- that would be really interesting.",
    "Some of the lab assignments felt disconnected from lecture, though lab sessions sometimes cleared that up; would have preferred having written \"prompts\" for the first two paper assignments; Mississippi case came off as less nuanced than first two cases; it was sometimes difficult to find assigned readings on Classes v2 (unexpected folders or file names);",
    "We had three professors with different background, and it was really great to hear from them how they would approach those topics. However, it was not clear what they expected us to do. Sometimes, we got different answers to the same question from different professors.",
    "The labs could use some work. I've played around with other tools in Vensim that we didn't cover in the lab (because it was 2 minutes long) that it would have been good to learn about, since causal loops were such an integral part of the course.",
    "Groups are assigned, and probably for good reason, but can also lead to incompatibilities.",
    "I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t feel that there was clear direction on the specific requirements for each of the case study papers, and found it difficult to target the scope of recommendations that my group made in the assignments.",
    "The lectures were interesting in and of themselves, but their flow from lecturer to lecturer and class to class was sometimes disjointed. The \"arch\" of the lesson\/case study was missing somewhat. Perhaps having the first class of every section be a lecture taught by all the lecturers that is an overview of the issue at hand would clarify the progression of class material beyond the syllabus.It would also be helpful to have very explicit expectations for our assignments - not necessarily outlining how to write papers, but clarifying how much of the grade will be dependent on clarity of arguments, structure, writing style, etc.There were also many classes where we were left out early or were dedicated to asking questions about papers and assignments that were wrapped up fairly quickly. I often felt disappointed when this happened because it felt like a lost opportunity to delve deeper into the case study or facilitate class discussions. These periods could have been used to break up into smaller groups for discussion, or for learning new skills.Replacing the NYC case study with one involving acity with substantial water procurement\/treatment issues might make for more compelling material and problem-solving papers.",
    "I thought the professors were well meaning, but could have worked together more closely to coordinate and make their expectations of the students clear. Finishing the assignments was often a very frustrating moving target--as different professors would add details or clarify things at the last minute, telling us something different than what the last prof had said.",
    "Lectures are not coherent",
    "All case studies presented varying perspectives of what needed to be considered in developing a solution: policy, soil aspect, science, economics, etc. The class did a good job of presenting these different perspectives but in some cases felt like important aspects of fully understanding limitations to solutions were missing. The Gulf of Mexico Hypoxia Case, for example, presented students with a wide variety of policy tools that could be used to address hypoxia (externalizing costs, externalizing benefits, barriers to entry). However, very little time was spent on sharing what policy tools have been tried in this case or similar cases, and what policies (such as the Farm Bill) are contributing to the problem. We are expected to be innovative with solutions and I understand the professors need to walk a fine line with not explicitly lecturing on what has and has not worked however, not understanding the specific policies that one would need to consider in situation like these in real life would be limiting.",
    "The group work needs lots of improvement. The idea of writing a group paper is flawed and difficult to manage. It'd be better if 2 people per group actually wrote the paper, and maybe those two people could rotate for each assignment. It was very difficult to coordinate 5 people to write a 10-15 page paper.",
    "Need to add one individual paper, to grade students outside group aspect.",
    "The guidelines for the papers. It seems one of the instructors wanted to give very loose guidelines because he didn't want us to be pigeonholed, but then the grader's expectations were very different from that. Also, when you have four to five people coming together and there is too little structure, it just becomes confusing.",
    "More guidance on the team projects. Provision or discussion of a good example of a team project would be very helpful to better understand the requirements for the course.",
    "The teaching, what is intended to be taken away from the course (just saying that issues are complex is NOT a sufficient premise for a graduate class). The learning should be rooted in the core principles of the various disciplines, not a survey of the topics without getting into any depth of the subject matter. Also, having 3 different professors grade each paper gave groups no chance to improve on their memos because each professor had a different take on how it should be written and what should be emphasized. This was probably the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Science slides... if sharing an exhibit directly from a paper, use follow-up slides (or animations) to demonstrate how to interpret the figure.",
    "connecting the labs to the lectures and papers; standardizing messaging about logistics and expectations amongst the professors",
    "The teaching, unfortunately. I think this class has serious potential in terms of material and its focus on interdisciplinary learning but the teaching and curriculum choices are just not up to par. Clearly all three professors are knowledgeable on their research areas but I didn't think they made enough effort to make their material engaging or accessible and often seemed to not be that interested in the case study. From lecture to lecture, they didn't flow in a logical manner a lot of the time and the professors didn't seem as dedicated to making this a truly team taught class as one would hope. In particular, Pete's lectures were either boring or incomprehensible. I have a solid background in geology and biology and I often felt that the material was not being presented in the most effective or engaging way. Many people taking this class are not science majors so it is critical that this material is presented effectively. Shimi Anisfeld presented eutrophication in my class the same week as Pete presented it in S2S and his lectures were far superior to Pete's. Finally, I found it a little disturbing that none of the profs had actually been to the Miss. River region or Louisiana to see first hand what they were teaching. Clearly more lecturers would have been good for this section.This class should have a much larger public health component. Why not bring in a prof from the PH school to team teach sections of this course? The public health aspect of the Gulf case study was completely ignoredwhich boggles the mind.More field trips and lecturers! We only went on two water treatment field trips and played the Bay Game the one day. While these were good, why don't we go to upstate NY to visit a farm? Why don't we find someone from the midwest, not just the Gulf of Mexico, to skype\/lecture one day? Why not bring in another public health person to talk about Bangladesh?",
    "As a former teacher, it sometimes seemed like the instructors -due to repeat teaching the material after a few\/many years- assumed certain bases of knowledge, so the explanations often seemed hasty.Some approaches, ideas, and data were presented as fact with little attention to competing perspectives. Pete Raymond mentioned some in his discussion of the GOM case, which I appreciated. But I found the depth of discussion of other perspectives generally light.More guidance and\/or baseline criteria with group work. I understand the instructors want to leave space for interpretation and creativity, but providing even 4-5 baseline standards as criteria would have been immensely helpful. In the absence of that, I found that my group members were confused about how to write a policy versus academic piece and that they were inclined to take the path of least resistance.Regarding the policy prioritization approach: while I appreciate the exercise of encouraging students to make executive decisions 'without all the information' and without doing additional research, I found (in my group) that this message encouraged an intellectual laziness and the approach to the paper as just an academic exercise. I would have appreciated more rigor from the instructors.",
    "There should be more structure for the papers. There was not much help before during or after the assignments.",
    "The course would benefit from being more additive. Causal loops and problem definitions were good through lines for the course, but we also learned about stakeholders and other social aspects that weren't as well drawn through. Some more specifics about the legal aspects of things would be good. The legal overview was pretty broad, but the specifics of those systems really influence what sorts of policies and projects can be implemented. Conversely, some of the technical specifics from each case could have been better linked to broader, overarching technical and biophysical themes, such that the problem-solving of this course could be more directly connected to other types of issues.",
    "I think the lab sections need the most improvement. The \"size\" of these was unclear and ultimately they seemed to be very short, cursory assignments. I understand that these labs were meant for exposure to material, but I was hoping to take away expertise.",
    "All professors getting on the same page with their expectations of the class. With that many professors and TA's I thought there was too many different opinions on what was expected from us.",
    "Discussion. It seemed like we wasted a lot of time in class waiting for students to answer questions or share opinions. I think there should either be less attempt at discussion or you should just start calling on people after two seconds.",
    "The lectures were mostly boring. The labs were almost completely useless.",
    "The expectations of the three professors are inconsistent. Often Professors Gentry and Zimmerman (particularly Professor Zimmerman) came across as condescending when students tried to clarify the inconsistent expectations.",
    "Too much information. Specifically, too many assigned readings which the student does not understand how to use.Also, I was seriously angered when the discussion of water management in the Mississippi river basin suddenly and inexplicably turned into a lifecycle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from corn ethanol production. The instructors should stick to the topic at hand, but with this they started wandering all over the place.",
    "The content of the course is best suited for a discussion-based course but yet it is too large for discussion to flow freely.",
    "a clearer and more detailed expectation for group work would help",
    "The information presented on the power points was sometimes outdated, and the presentations lacked enthusiasm and class involvement. This is probably related to the class being too large.",
    "Sometimes I felt like the lectures were dragged out and ran too closely to the readings. If we are already reading 3 papers on something, then the lecture should supplement them not summarize them.",
    "Classroom layout inhibited discussions to some degree. Field trips& optional activities were great and should've been required.",
    "Sometimes it seemed that the three instructors had different expectations, so it was hard to know what was expected from the papers. It also might have been helpful to have a discussion section where the class breaks up into groups to discuss each case study. A lot of people are hesitant to talk in a large class, and it might have stimulated more discussion among students.",
    "A short write-up on each assignment, given at the time that we begin each case, would have been helpful, especially if the write-up had included a rubric. It was a challenge to keep track of all of the various instructions about each assignment, which were given sporadically throughout the classes. This style also made it challenging to get started on assignments early, without the worry that we would need to back-track and re-do sections later when the instructions were given. A memo about each assignment would help greatly to clarify your expectations. Another possible way to do this would be to announce the assignment at the end of the first class in the case and allow time for Q&A.A second area for improvement is in providing better support for students to hone their memo-writing skills. We had a range of skills and writing experience in our group, and adding one assignment or lab dedicated to learning memo-writing would be extremely helpful.",
    "The expectations of group papers were frustrating. It felt like each paper was a moving target. It would have been great to have a better rubric for each paper. Since the premise of the class was that it was setting us up for the kind of work we may do, it would be nice to see examples of successful papers to get us started. Also, a common thing I heard - making the initial paper\/problem statement an individual project would have been very helpful and would have helped pave the way for better group work.Pete's slides could be a lot better, too, and the labs seemed somewhat unnecessary.",
    "The class has a very high workload and it would be great to see if it could be further reduced. As one suggestion, there were a lot of labs (4), and the first and the last one could easily be eliminated.",
    "I think the lectures could be integrated\/linked more thoughtfully so that each week flows into the next.",
    "At times, lectures could have expanded to fill the entire time allotted. It was somewhat frustrating to attend lab sections during evenings when daytime lectures ended 20-30 minutes early.",

    "The labs provided useful background information for each of the case studies.",
    "I did not find the labs very helpful. I would have loved if the labs were used to teach new skills, rather than having to complete the work on our own and then just \"review\" during the allotted time. Could have been a great opportunity to hold discussions on the material we were going over in class, or for teaching new programs\/skills.",
    "Labs 1-3 were very simple and did not add much to the course.",
    "I enjoyed the labs more than the group work, perhaps because it was our only chance to do individual work in the course.",
    "Labs seemed completely disconnected from lecture and just a random add on. I would prefer to focus on writing an extra paper.",
    "The first three labs were interesting, the last one was really confusing, it would have been more helpful if we did an actual decision matrix.",
    "Closely related, well-guided discussion.",
    "NANI lab could be improved with follow-up or feedback of content and concepts. I'm still not sure what drives the trends in NANI over time.",
    "Overall, I found very little value in the lab sessions.",
    "could be improved by tying in NANI and optimization matrix to papers the way causal loops were",
    "The labs need re-working. Some felt like the profs thought they should insert a lab or were just completely confusing for people unfamiliar with excel or social science analysis. In particular, the last one with the matrix: I thought we would actually walk through the process of filling out a matrix but instead we had a group discussion and I left not knowing exactly how to use the matrix. I did think the Vensim software was useful but the actual lab designed to teach that topic could use some tweaking.",
    "Yes, though the lab portion could be integrated more clearly.",
    "They could be improved by breaking down the assignments into smaller sections that related to the lab instead of just turning in big completed assignments.",
    "I Don't think there was a strong connections between the excel labs and the papers. Most of our individual grades where based on how well we understood excel.",
    "Though I think it is a good idea to have the labs, I didn't feel like they were particularly well integrated to the rest of the class.",
    "I don't know if we needed the labs at all, maybe smaller discussion groups to talk about the readings\/topics would be better. We didn't really ever go over the readings...",
    "The labs felt like a waste of time for the most part.",
    "The labs seemed to be completely separated and unrelated from the course. I never once looked back on them.",
    "I thought the lab sections were run very well.",
    "the water lab was the most helpful.",
    "Too many readings and most of them were not necessary for good performance in the class.",
    "The labs were interesting on their own, but connecting them back to the course or the project more consistently and more overtly would be helpful.",
    "The group work was where we got to apply what we were learning, and even learn more deeply about it since we had to think critically and solve problems together.",
    "Decent connection between these elements.",
    "The causal-loop diagram lab and the last lab that dealt with multi-criteria decision-making were the most well-integrated with the lectures and the other assignments. The NANI lab was helpful, but it could have been improve by discussing it in class after we had completed the lab, since the results were somewhat surprising.",
    "Labs seemed a bit out of context - I understand that you want them to give a better understanding of the kinds of tools you might use to look at these problems, but I didn't feel like they added a lot to my learning. It was also unclear that the labs would involve grades from the syllabus.",
    "The labs were related to the course lectures, however, they were not always relevant for the group papers. The causal loop lap was the most interesting, useful, and relevant. The first lab (watershed analysis) seemed disconnected with the main papers and did not seem like a very useful tool for the majority of the students. The last one (optimization matrix) could be incorporated into the third group paper.",
    "Labs tended to feel like a bit of an afterthought, although labs like the first one (on nitrate load, flow, ect.) were useful for understanding the basic theory behind a concept.",
    "The relationship was slightly disjointed at times, but in general, the exercises themselves were useful.",
    "The connection between the lectures and the labs were not made entirely clear."

It was a good introduction to\/overview of the complexity of the issues we face and will hopefully be dealing with after we graduate. I think the most helpful thing I learned was how our definitions of problems often pre-suppose a solution, and better ways of getting to better problem definitions. I think I will take that with me, as well as some of the systems thinking this class had us engage in.",

In terms of my knowledge of these areas, I definitely know much more, and the policy issues around the NYC issues and filtration technologies in the Bangladesh case were especially interesting and helpful to my interests. However, the best and worst part about working in groups is that people focused on their areas of strength. So, while I learned more about group work, I also feel like I relied on skills I already had, rather than on developing new ones, in terms of the role I played on the team. The feedback on papers was also a bit cursory and inconsistent - at times, it was hard to intuit what we did wrong or right, and what to do differently from the example papers on V2, or from papers graded by a different professor.",

Being international student, it really helped improve my research, writing, and teamwork skills.When you are working in a team you get really good feedback on how to improve your writing; you have valuable discussions; and you learn from everything your team members have to offer.It also provided me with the skills to better support my arguments.",

    "see question 15.",
    "I like the idea to assign us to a group based on a preliminary survey.",
    "Advantages -- great opportunity to practice teamwork. Learning or re-learning what makes a good teammate, and being reminded that your view is not necessarily the best one. That was important.",
    "Learned a lot from my fellow students.",
    "Lots of interesting perspectives, generally worked well as a group (with some unevenness in terms of effort).",
    "There was not disadvantages. My teammates were really good at being on top of their schedule. I learned a lot by working with them!",
    "I had a great group, which makes a huge difference. I know that other groups struggled a lot. Perhaps 5 is a few members too many - dividing into 4 or even 3 might make things a little more manageable for students? That being said, I didn't have any problems personally. I thought it was great that groups were assigned.",
    "It was helpful to gain insights into the complex problems discussed in class through discussions with students who had different areas of knowledge and experience. However, the members of my group had a difficult time working together and not all members contributed equally to the assignments. It was frustrating to have the majority of my grade based on group work that was not the quality that I would have wanted.",
    "I really enjoyed the people I was paired with, and appreciate the thought put into how groups were created (based on experience).I find writing papers as a group extremely difficult. Mixing writing styles is challenging given the different backgrounds we are coming from, and delegating responsibility in inevitably unequal. Our group also had an extremely difficult time finding times to meet because our schedules were so different. This resulted in a fair number of meetings with only some of our members, which created complications for completing tasks on time and information sharing.",
    "Mostly disadvantages. My group didn't work well together and it was just a frustrating experience. Since we were assigned groups and they stayed constant throughout the semester it made the class a very frustrating experience. I am upset by the fact that the vast majority of our grades were determined by group work--so if we were in a group that didn't work well together, we were stuck with a poor grade in the class. There are some groups that no matter how hard one or two people try, they will never put together a good work product. This was my situation.",
    "Very polite and inefficient group discussions around a not very well defined problem.A great group of people and quite some fun to work together.",
    "I addressed some of the disadvantages in the earlier question. The advantages were that I got to get to know my classmates better, and gained from their varied backgrounds and specialties.",
    "I liked collaborating with my team members who were committed and prepared to contribute to the project, it added greatly to the paper and allowed us to develop a more holistic perspective.However, some in the group did not take the projects or the entirety of the class seriously. If this were a 'real' life situation, that person would be fired. Maybe this could be an option for future classes?",
    "Advantage is parceling up the work,Disadvantage: because we were all unsure in which direction we wanted to take the papers, we always just tried to incorporate all of the ideas into one paper and it usually made for a weak paper. It's good to know that,I guess, but academically not helpful.",
    "Combination of skills and knowledge of the group members led to high-quality output.",
    "I enjoyed meeting a diverse group of my peers",
    "Group work is a crucialskill and the different experience levels among teams is important for fostering development of that skill. Ambiguity also becomes more familiar to students in the course.",
    "groups were too large, group work allows you to work on things you were already good at before school, doesn't push you out of your comfort zone to learn new knowledge\/skills",
    "Great experience! Loved the group papers. Of course, my group was great and we didn't have drama like some other groups did. All in all, it's a reflection of what working will be like so I think it's an excellent choice to make us work in groups.",
    "Exercise in efficiency, negotiating work and perspectives, learning from group members' knowledge and skills. I would have liked to write at least one paper on my own.",
    "It was difficult to work together toward a common solution. Everyone had different thoughts and beliefs so there was a lot of compromises made.",
    "Oh man, group work. Always tricky. Group work is a good opportunity to flex those communication muscles, but its seldom anyone's favorite.Advantage: Don't have to write as muchDisadvantage: People will never do the same amount of the work, really. Have to schedule meetings, which can be tricky when we're all so busy.",
    "The best aspect of the group work was learning from different people. We all added to the group in different ways and were able to take away something from someone else.",
    "I understand that effectively working in groups is a great skill to have but I would have liked to get more individual grades. I liked having predetermined groups.",
    "Advantage is sharing work. Disadvantages are that we don't get specific feedback on our individual ability to complete the work, and it takes a lot longer to complete assignments because of the necessary group discussion.",
    "The first paper on NYC city case would have helped better if it was done individually.",
    "It was good to work in teams because that's often how things work in the professional world. Having 5 people write a 10 page paper is a little ridiculous at times, and it meant none of us really knew all that much about the topic, but just about our assigned portion of the paper.",
    "The group work was frustrating and very time consuming.",
    "I had a good team and we got along well, but none of us was particularly excited about the assignments we had to do. Perhaps having one assignment be individual and another in groups (for contrast) might help.",
    "While group work is challenging - I viewed the group work as the primary advantages of the course.",
    "It was a great pleasure to work with my group. We were efficient and collaborative. I learned a great deal about how to create shared expectations and work with others throughout this course.",
    "Learning about how other people think is a very important skill, but in this context, it allows some to work harder than others.",
    "See the response to question 19.",
    "It was sometimes frustrating but overall met my expectations. It was definitely the best part of the course.",
    "Gives a good sense of real-world dynamics. Our group worked well together.",
    "The group work was an important component of this course. Group work can always be stressful, but I learned as much from the group work as I did from the lectures. It also illustrated the power of group brainstorming. My group was able to come up with interventions to the problems presented in the case studies that I would not have been able to come up with alone. I thought that the group work was a great component of the course.",
    "Main advantages of the group work were the opportunity to learn from each other's experiences and knowledge, as well as to practice defending one's own ideas and opinions by using available information and experiences.Challenges in the group stemmed from the wide range of writing abilities and work ethic. I found myself taking on a larger burden of the work at times because I felt that the quality of other group members' writing was not passable for a graduate level. At times it waschallenging to produce high-quality work with so many different authors and \"owners\" of a single document.",
    "I understand that the group aspect is an important teaching tool - it's supposed to mimic how work gets done in the real world. However, I do think that it's a pretty artificial construct. In the real world, you're all working on specific aspects where you have expertise, there are usually report templates for the way information is normally presented in the organization, and you have a solid understanding of the topic at hand. I think it's totally worthwhile to have group work in this class, but I also think that it's not as accurate of a depiction of how things work as you might hope.",
    "The group work was one of the key learning opportunities for this class. It was a terrific opportunity to practice working in a team, brainstorming ideas, agreeing on solutions, and figuring out the best approach to splitting up and completing deliverables. This was excellent practice for the type of work we will be doing in our careers.",
    "It was great to go through the brainstorm process in a group, to generate and hone in on innovative ideas together. The actual group writing process was slightly less valuable as it ended up meaning that each person grasped a piece of the whole picture but did not get to work through the full integration of our plan.",
    "Getting an interdisciplinary perspective was very helpful.",
    "Advantages: great practice working in teams, a valid challenge.Disadvantages: imbalances of work efforts and too often, individuals' innovative ideas were nixed due to the conformity of the group, resulting in (sometimes) boring solutions."

    "Meet with your groups as early as you can to discuss the case studies.",
    "Be sure to get clarification on the assignments early on, and to get started on the assignments early. Set up a weekly meeting with your group throughout the course, and\/or set all meetings in advance of beginning an assignment because it is difficult to find times that work for everyone.Also, hash out the details of your solution with all members of your group and create a detailed outline for each assignment before beginning the writing. This will help to make sure everyone is on the same page and that you do not repeat one another in the writing.Keep up with the readings. You can split up the readings among your group members and have everyone submit summaries. However, be aware that you may need to do most\/all of the readings anyway in order to get the information that you need to complete the assignments.",
    "I don't have too much except that it's important to set firm deadlines for group work. We had deadlines, but people often missed them, and we didn't have a good way of holding firm.",
    "I was unsure about this class initially, but it exceeded my expectations. The topics were very interesting and relevant. The class was well organized and the lecturers were all terrific. The guest speakers were excellent and made the cases come to life. This class was a great introduction to using science to frame management strategies. It was also a great orientation to working in teams. The instructors are committed to continuously improving the class and are very open to feedback. The course is a lot of work, as there are a lot of readings and writing three papers in a group is very time-consuming. Figuring out how to work effectively in a team is challenging, but is one of the most rewarding aspects of the course. One piece of advice: split up the readings for each case among your teammates, have each person prepare summary notes, then make them available for your teammates to read so that everyone is familiar with all of the concepts but each of youknows some of the topics in more detail. This helps reduce the course workload.",
    "Definitely recommend this course. Interesting cases, but be prepared for a lot of group work.",
