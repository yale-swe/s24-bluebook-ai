    "Capstone projects are totally dependent on your adviser and your team. It is exciting to work with a real agency, even with all the mis-communications and complications that brings. Working on a group project is good for you and it is a fun way to complete your senior requirement.",
    "Working on the FAO capstone was a fulfilling process. The course was effectively structured so that we each had individual tasks we were graded on and which could then be collated and compiled into the final product.The aim of this capstone was to address the best-practices that made agricultural investments gender equitable. This involved (1) a study of the current frameworks on agricultural investment (2) interviews with agricultural companies to understand notable practices with regard to gender equity and (3) making policy recommendations on findings. While the topic of research was fairly specific and we did not necessarily get the best sample of gender-equitable agricultural investments for case studies, we were able to produce a decent final report.The FAO had changing expectations, which were unclear to begin with. We did not receive adequate feedback from them but were able to produce a final report that they were pleased with.",
    "the capstone is a very unique opportunity to take earning beyond the classroom and a great feature of the Global Affairsmajor, so take advantage of it",
    "Not as exciting as I had hoped but sometimes interesting and worthwhile.",
    "This class was a very rewarding experience, particularly because of how well our particular class worked together and also because of how kind and supportive Professor Doss was. One of the more challenging and confusing aspects of the course was the fact that our clients (the FAO) were not always clear in expressing what they wanted from us, and so we often found ourselves needing to change our thinking or revise our project dramatically after something was quite randomly made clear to us by them. However, this may be resolved in the future by the sheer fact that the FAO and Professor Doss will both have some experience with what exactly this capstone project entails. Also, Professor Doss was extremely helpful at these moments because she always made an effort to sort things out with the FAO and also to stand by us and ensure that the project remained as manageable and as realistic as possible, while at the same time still being rewarding and educational."
