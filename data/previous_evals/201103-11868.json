   "comments": [
    "YES this is probably one of the best courses I took at yale. it is a sensational class. AMAZING.",
    "I would recommend Quantum Physics and Beyond to someone who is a.) interested in learning more about the universe, the Big Bang, string theory, and other cutting edge concepts in theoretical physics and b.) who isn't looking for a total gut science credit. This course deals with very difficult material, albeit presented in as straightforward a manner as possible. It's very interesting, but there are definitely easier science credits out there.",
    "AWESOME!!! I loved this class--really cool topic, and I'm so thankful that I could take a class on this without super advanced math. Professor Caines did a great job of explaining the topics--she was always very interested in our questions, and answered them honestly.",
    "I had never taken Physics before, and I was able to understand almost everything. It fairly interesting and gives you a very cool new perspective on our lives. It's not that muchwork, either. My one piece of advice is to talk to the TF about what sorts of material is going to be on the quizzes and midterms. I understood most of the material on the quizzes and midterm, but the grading was hard because I didn't understand what TYPE of answers they were looking for, and I didn't do so great.",
    "If you are looking for a science-credit that will teach you interesting stuff, this is definitely the course to go for! I think every should at least understand the basics of quantum mechanics and Einstein's discoveries. This course will teach you all the essentials in a painful and easy way. Only weakness: the reading assignments can be quite boring at times.Prof. Caines is great! Relly helpful, knowledgable and well connected to a lot of the current, exciting research that is going on, e.g. at CERN.",
    "A highly recommended opportunity to read about important concepts in science. No math involved means that you can simply learn the concepts, which for someone who loves physics but not math is invaluable. Take this class- the material covered by it is essential to everyone's education.",
    "Yes, the course covers very interesting topics that might otherwise be difficult to approach very well.",
    "This course was great! Not too much reading to do, and the reading we were assigned was super interesting. The course is directed at humanities majors, not science majors, so it was definitely up my alley and taught in ways that I'm used to. Professor Caines is great, and as a class, we all got really close. I would recommend taking it!!",
    "This course was amazing. Professor Caines is an expert in her field but knows how to teach this often mind-bending material to non-science majors. She created a very open class environment where people felt comfortable asking questions. Moreover she seemed genuinely excited about getting to know undergrads and working with non-science majors.In terms of workload, weekly short-answer problem sets took 4-5 hours (including the reading), the two quizzes and mid-term were straightforward to study for, 2-3 hours of studying for each is probably enough (use the slides from class! any question can be asked about them), and the final 2000 word paper was relatively painless since you get to pick any topic you want and write the essay as a popular science article (i.e. for a lay audience).",
    "Topics are interesting, readings are short and to the point, and Professor Caines is a good explainer. As much as the \"point\" of this class is to be discussion-based, I didn't really appreciate that aspect of it. It's too much of smartass humanities people trying to ask \"gotcha\" questions about how quantum mechanics can possibly explain their newest thought experiment, and the professor shrugging to say, \"The math works...\"",
    "Physics 120 is a comprehensive look at some of the most important and timely topics in physics and quantum physics. It covers so many of the significant areas. I would definitely recommend this class to another student--it's a good way to get a science and to learn a lot. I definitely walk away feeling that I know much more than when I came in.",
    "Quantum physics is a great class for non-science majors who want to learn some \"real\" science. The work is not challenging--just critical reading skills required. But the topics we learned in class were so interesting, and somehow always turned up in my dinner conversations.",
    "This is a good introduction. Interesting, reasonable workload, etc."
