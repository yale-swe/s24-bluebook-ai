    "If a fellow student had enough time to dedicate to the class, I would definitely recommend it to them. I think that I would say that it is a class that teaches you the technical side of photography but that also allows you to say something about yourself through the medium of photography. It was probably one of my favorite classes I've taken since being in grad school. I think that this is mainly because it taught me to look for beauty in a different way than I usually do--it taught me to say something without being able to use words and I absolutely love that!",
    "An excellent class and a must-take if you have the time. You learn about photography, take pictures with a black-and-white film camera, and develop your own film into negatives and then enlarge negatives onto prints. The class really imbues you with an aesthetic sense of the everyday world, and lets you see the beauty around. I'm not quite convinced on the merits of film, but it's refreshingly low-tech. You'll also take better pictures in general. Be prepared to spend the time, though; you take ~30 rolls of film (700 pictures), and probably have to spend 6-12 hours before each critique printing. Vicky is also wonderful, and try to get to know her!",
    "What you read about the workload is definitely accurate -- you're going to be spending probably 6-10 hours each week in the darkroom. But it's totally worth it to learn how to work with film, and the time in the darkroom was one of my favorite experiences at Yale; it's a wonderful change of pace from the normal Yale routine.",

    "Black and White Photography is an extremely rewarding class. Definitely take it! Vicky was a great professor, and Casey was just as insightful and involved. I feel like I really bonded with my classmates, since we all worked together in the darkroom, and grew familiar with their work. Even as an art major who had taken many art courses before, this one stood out to me because of the familiarity of the students and instructors. It was a great feeling to walk away from the final critique with a box (or a couple boxes) filled with work that I'm proud of when in the beginning of the course I didn't even know the difference between aperture and shutter speed. Be prepared though, because it's both a lot of work and a lot of money. The only times I felt bad about the class was when I had to shell out hundreds of dollars for the film and paper. That said, I still think the experience was worth the money, and definitely worth the time!",
    "OK, photo is a TON of time - and you shouldn't underestimate this, because you won't physically be able to finish your assignments. Expect to spend a couple afternoons each week shooting ~3 rolls of film; developing requires 2-3 hours in the darkroom, plus time to dry; then you must make contact sheets, which is another 3 hours in the darkroom, with drying time - all before you make your prints for the critiques, which will require 6+ prints for each. This being said, I'm very happy I took this class. I learned a lot about perspective in art and acquired a set of skills I'm going to use to keep taking pictures for the rest of my life. Plus, it was awesome to see the work of the class; I was consistently surprised by how different each of our eyes were. Take if you can, especially if you can invest the time and money needed!",
    "I think this course is super intense, which viki told us in the first class. But I will tell my friends how much time this course takes as well as how much stress and fun I had."
