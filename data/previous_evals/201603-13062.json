   "comments": [
    "I appreciated working through much of the material to see what directions have been taken around questions of land and animal in religious studies and theology. I would have loved to read more extensively from Katherine McKittrick's Demonic Grounds, Rashad Shabazz's Spatializing Blackness, and Vandana Shiva's works. Given the way that indigenous thinking and theologizng about land was a central motivation of many of the courses questions, I also think including some indigenous thinkers or theologians would be productive."
