    "Dr. Forman definitely put in a great deal of appreciated effort putting speakers together. It is beyond his control that some were not especially exciting or engaging.",
    "The speakers were interesting, 1 hour was perfect. Weaknesses was paper at the end. Students were not aware they had to do it.",
    "Limited time commitment. Exposure to the large variety of professional routes that one take with the degree that one is getting. No specific exposure\/direct interaction with the instructor about this course per se. Perhaps some time (perhaps one session every 4-5 ) with the instructor, evaluating some of the statements made by the speaker would be useful. A number of claims were made from time to time by individual speakers that were somewhat large, but it would have been rude to push the speaker. It would have been helpful to have Professor Forman give his insight on the \"truth\" to these statements.",
    "Bad that it's on Thursday The surprise paper was not cool. We should have known about it since the beginning so we could take notes.",
    "Great course. You get to meet many amazing individuals.",
    "It was great to discover the different parts of the healthcare industry and listen to members speak to the challenges of being in them.",
    "Good",
    "The colloquium provided extremely valuable exposure to experts in the field.",
    "This is an excellent course and should be encouraged for students interested in healthcare across Yale. The speakers were outstanding, had made significant impacts in their field and had great insights to share about their path to success. I learned so much from their honest recounting of their experiences.",
    "I enjoyed meeting the healthcare leaders, but the Thursday evening schedule was very difficult for most students. It would be much better if this course were offered on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday evenings.",
    "Every speaker was incredible!!"

    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Dr. Forman is incredible, his dedication is much appreciated",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Dr. Forman did a great job of keeping every speaker strictly to 1 hour.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Extremely limited exposure in this course.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is good.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0One of the best instructors I have ever had.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Good",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is always very enthusiastic and willing to connect students to the speakers.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Dr. Forman was deeply engaged in the conversations, and the course demonstrated his sincere commitment to the success of his students. In other situations, I've had professors introduce a guest speaker and then leave or do work in the back of the room, but Dr. Forman sat next to the speaker or in the front row, facilitating a real discussion. He clearly wants students to be curious and ask questions of the speakers, and he asked his own thoughtful questions as a natural part of the conversation.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Dr.Forman knows everyone.",
    "Instructor: Howard P Forman \u00a0Howie is the absolute best!"

    "Mandatory class - don't necessarily recommend but it's mandatory",
    "Very interesting, I would recommend it. Real life speakers giving their perspectives was great.",
    "Limited time commitment. Class time and wakefulness in class the only requirement. Exposure to the large variety of professional routes that one take with the degree that one is getting. Great for interacting with a variety of professionals in senior positions. If you already have a good sense of where you are going, then you can skip the course. Insufficient in-depth exposure to any one facet. Limited interaction with either the instructor or the speaker.",
    "Interesting",
    "Good",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in healthcare. It brings an important perspective the vast industry of healthcare, outside the clinical perspective.",
    "This is an excellent opportunity to learn from graduates of the program and hear real world experiences from the alumni."
