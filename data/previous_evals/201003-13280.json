    "Interesting material and not too hard. Definitely worth taking.",

    "This class is an indigenous groups-focused look at some of the issues and history of Latin America. You don't need to be familiar with Anthropology to take it, but if you're a fan of Anthro-speak, this is a good class for you. Very little is required of students in this course, but if you do pay attention, you'll get a lot out of it.",
    "good class. very reasonable workload.",
    "No, this class is stupid. It consists of the random ramblings of Professor Mayer. While Mayer is nice, he leads a horrible class. But, it is (probably) an easy grade that involves very little work and very little paying attention.That said, you have to go to lecture because attendance is taken. But you do not need to pay ANY attention in lecture because you are never held accountable for any of the material that you learn. You have 4- 500 word reading responses, a take-home midterm, and a final 15-20 page paper. Grading was EXTREMELY lenient.While grading was nice, attending this class was so painful. I would recommend that you steer clear of this class."
