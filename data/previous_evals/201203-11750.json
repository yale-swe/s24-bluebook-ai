   "comments": [
    "yes, great way to do some interesting research for you senior requirement.",
    "As a senior, you have to take this class.10 hours a week for one credit is unfair, and I'm sorry. Good luck! Make sure to put in the effort to find a nice PI and research that interests you. If research isn't your thing, then definitely look for a more \"translational\" lab, so that the real life effects and potential are more obvious.",
    "You have to take this class if you want a BS... research is fine, write-ups are vaguely defined but fine, and presentations would be better if the department provided food.",
    "Basically what you have to do to get a B.S. in MCDB. I took it bc I heard you basically spend 30 hours a week in lab if you do 495, and I didn't want that. It's been a pretty okay experience. Mandatory, so you can't say much about it.",
    "sure, if you had to",
    "It's your senior research. Do it if you don't want to write a senior essay.",
    "Find a lab that you want to work in and DO IT. GREAT experience if you like research!",
    "If you have agood project, you might as well just take this and do the full year.",
    "Yearlong research for credit for seniors, pretty straightforward. 10-12 hours per week, short proposal in September, short 5 page paper at the end, and oral presentations, with more work in the spring.",
    "It's research for credit",
    "It's a great learning experience into research! I learned how to formulate a plan for research in the form of a proposal and research grant. In addition, in the lab setting, I am learning how to collaborate with others and perform certain lab techniques\/follow certain lab protocol. It's been a neat experience so far.",
    "You do it because you're doing your senior project, but I will say that it can be fun to go to end of semester presentations and see the diversity of research among MCDB majors.",
    "You do research for 10-12 hours a week. Make sure you line up a lab the summer beforehand because your proposal is due at the end of shopping period. Then you write a brief grant proposal at the end of the semester, which is not that difficult since it's double-spaced and you can include figures. The intensive is 20 hrs of work a week in contrast.",
    "Your experience will be shaped almost entirely by the lab you join. There aren't too many expectations besides a proposal in the beginning and a brief write-up and presentation at the end.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course especially if you are doing research anyway. The oral presentations certainly were useful for me! I enjoyed it",
    "Great way to get research credit",
    "This class is a requirement for the MCDB major, but don't look at it as just that. If you put in the time you will learn a lot about lab techniques and the field that you are doing your research on. Be prepared to spend around 15 hours in lab to actually get something out of it.",
    "It's....senior research! The experience is solely dependent on which lab you do your work in. In my lab, I usually spend over the 10-12 hour suggested time (I would say it was more like 15 hours per week). The actual requirements for this class though are a joke. There's a five page grant at the end of the semester that should NOT take you long to write. There are a few presentations you need to go to. Take this if you are doing research and don't have the time or credits to do the intensive track.",
    "Do it! Biology is so much more interesting and complete when you get to do your own project in a lab. Find a mentor you like and a project you're excited about and go for it!"
