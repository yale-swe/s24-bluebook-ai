    "This class was a wonderful class to explore the ever-present struggle between democracy and a major tool of limiting democracy, constitutionalism. From answering questions to \"what is democracy and why do we care about it\" to discovering whether or not judicial review should exist and why I definitely learned a lot in this class and now understand issues that are very important to me. The readings were generally very short, which was wonderful as the class discussed was then able to discuss very specific arguments very thoroughly. Also, for most every class, a subject of discussion was proposed and we were able to read two contradicting opinions side-by side. I really enjoyed this interplay and and the immediate evaluation of the texts that resulted.I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Weekly assignments are easy (though Kirshner definitely didn't hand out easy grades on the reading responses) and the final essay, while somewhat daunting, is definitely manageable, especially because you can choose almost any topic you want. Just start writing the essay early in the semester in the extra time you have when you're only reading 40 or 50 pages a week.",
    "Absolutely",
    "Democracy and Constitutionalism is about the tension between the two ideas in the courses title. At first we worked to define what democracy and constitutionalism are, and then spent the rest of the course looking at the conflict between the two from theoretical and historical perspectives,usually in the context of the judiciary. The materials were usually about the United States, but we looked at other political systems and constitutions as well. I would highly recommend the class for anyone interested in political theory, politics, or constitutional law. There isn't too much reading, so it was easy to be prepared every week, which really showed in the discussions I think. The class was small and the discussions were really insightful and usually pretty intense. Alex is a really good discussion leader. He knows when to intercede and when to step back. There are biweekly reading responses, usually a paragraph or two, and a final paper of 15-20 pages. The paper is on a topic of the student's choosing, and I found was really interesting to write. Definitely take this class.",
    "This course really borders on legal theory - which I absolutely love. If you want to be challenged in seminar, as you should in a Yale seminar, Alexander Kirshner will do just that. The course is fantastically well structured, and the professor will get the very best out of you. If you like the look of the syllabus (which does become rather judiciary focussed), then i highly recommend you take this class.",
    "I would recommend it if you are a poly sci major",
    "This class is excellent, although it helps if you are interested in the topic. The class focuses on the theoretical roots of what Constitutions do, why we have them, the purpose and function of judicial review, etc etc. The final project, which is like 70 percent of your grade since part of it is due at midterms, may be applied rather than theoretical (e.g. study a particular case) so do not fear that the entire course is theory though. A very rewarding class.",
    "Absolutely. If you are interested in American politics, but have never studied democratic theory, you should absolutely take this course.This was the best course I have taken at Yale. Professor Kirshner was absolutely terrific. He did a great job of pushing students to develop strong, coherent answers to complex philosophical issues in democratic theory. He had a strong command of the socratic method and was much more interested in listening and guiding us speak and debate rather than lecturing us during seminar. The reading was both interesting and manageable. Kirshner does not assign an incredible amount of reading, but he expects you to read every page and to come to class ready to have an in depth conversation about the work."
