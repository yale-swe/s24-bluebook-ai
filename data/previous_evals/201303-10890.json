    "I would highly recommend if you want to practice Italian, improve your language skills, and read interesting books and watch films in Italian.",
    "Italian 150 focuses on discussion of Italian pop culture both high and low. It's quite similar to other L5 courses in that you do essays and readings, but with lessof an emphasis on grammar than usual. Professor Chiodo was super energetic and enthusiastic, and I would recommend her section. Our class met in the early morning and she managed to make it fun and relaxed. As for the course material, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a mixed bag. You get some children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s literature, some feminism, some film, some coming-of-age lit. Some of it you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll like, some it you might not. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re looking to keep your spoken Italian from getting rusty, or hoping to improve your written and reading Italian, this course does a solid job on both fronts. Note: the workload for this course is irregular\u00e2\u0080\u0094some weeks you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to do long and rather advanced readings, others you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be watching films in class and not doing much homework. I would advise anyone taking this course to budget time accordingly, and to get ahead when needed. Also, make sure to ask exactly what assignments are\u00e2\u0080\u0094sometimes the parameters of an essay, for instance, aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t always the clearest.",
    "ITAL 150 was great, especially with prof. chiodo. for once, we were expected to approach the class just as any other lit course. she pushed us to stretch our italian, and learn to use it in new ways to talk about different literatures and media. great if you want to work on your italian skills and read some great books.",
    "It was a fun class and very helpful. Professor Chiodo is a lively instructor and class was fun. It is writing-heavy, but the assignments are fun.",
    "It was a great discussion and writing class, quite demanding but really good. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves italian."
