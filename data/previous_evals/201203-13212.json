    "The lab is definitely a good, fun complement to the lectures, and provides a lot of visual training for the characters you learn about in the lecture sessions. Going to the greenhouses gets you some exercise and some experience with one of Yale's less utilized resources. Plus, you eat a ton of food from all the plant families you study (my favorite: dragonfruit, from Cactaceae). There really isn't that much outside work, besides the eight plant identifications we had to do on campus. Those IDs could be a little tedious - it could be difficult to find non-cultivated plants to identify, and to find plants that hadn't already been identified and added to the database - so I would hope that the course will lessen the homework's focus on identifications for the database and place more emphasis on just practicing identifying plants in general.",
    "Great way to experience plant diversity, interact with all types of plants in the Marsh Gardens, learn and love plants!",
    "I would definitely recommend. Take it for the plants, take it for the food.",
    "YES. Exotic food to try every lab. Super cool plants to draw and dissect every lab. A 3-hour fiesta. Every week. My only critique is that I felt a bit too free--sometimes I wasn't sure what best to spend my time drawing and looking at under a microscope.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. We all acquired an impressive amount of material over the course of the semester in what felt like an almost effortless way. Professor Donoghue did a great job of teaching us a ton of fascinating information about the plant families we studied while all the while making it a really enjoyable experience. The class was divided between time spent on a brief, explanatory tour of specimens at the beginning of lab and time spent independently dissecting and discussing plants. It was a really relaxing, casual environment and very conducive to collaborative learning. We also almost always had edible specimens to eat and dissect, which I felt was both really fun and a truly valuable, engaging part of the learning process."
