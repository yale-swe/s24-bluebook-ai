    "Critical thinking and analysis of economic models surrounding a variety of relevant topics including business cycles, the labor market, monetary and fiscal policy, etc.",
    "A thorough development of the skills learned in an introductory economics course. The best part of this course is its usage of mathematics to add structure to the theory of intro macro. Moscarini is heavy on the usage of math in his course relative to other ECON 122 professors, so be prepared to manipulate some complex algebra and take a few unpleasant derivatives. After taking this course, I feel very comfortable discussing economics with not only my peers, but also adults. Plenty of real world applications regarding monetary policy, inflation, the 2007-2008 housing bubble, business cycles, and more. Quantitative skills are stressed (thankfully).",
    "I am incredibly disappointed that we did not learn about an open economy at all.",
    "Gained a better understanding of main economic principals, as well as enhanced my math skills. Overall feel like I have a better understanding of Macroeconomics.",
    "You learn a good bit about how the macroeconomy works and how different markets (labor, goods, output, money, etc.) blend together with indicators like wage and interest rate. Pretty relevant and interesting material, although the models are admittedly a bit dry.",
    "I definitely learned to reconceive of Macroeconomics in term of its foundational microeconomics, which was a cool thing, and I definitely thought more about how I might apply these intuitions.",
    "You learn to think about the economy and all its fundamentals. You learn about interest rates, monetary policy, fiscal policy. Really really cool material, I really really enjoyed this class.",
    "Application of theory into the real world; past and current debates in the field of macroeconomics",
    "I learned a lot about Macroeconomic models and the overall economy both with hypothetical and real world information.",
    "Critical thinking about macroeconomic problems, not necessarily dependent on math. Understanding models. Quantitative thinking.",
    "Basic intermediate macro - graphing trends, working with macroeconomic data. Had to use Excel for psets but it was basic - correlations, graphing, etc.",
    "I learned how to work with various macroeconomic models and what trends were pro cyclical with GDP.",
    "I learned the basic building blocks of Macroeconomics, and how different models explain how different factors of the economy react with one another. I also learned the strengths and weaknesses of each model. I also learned how to solve basic maximization problems. I learned a little bit of economic history in regard with how history fits with the models.",
    "An in-depth understanding of Macroeconomics, including the foundation for economic models and updated notions of core concepts.",
    "I learned how to apply economic concepts to the real world aggregate economy. It was very interesting.",
    "I gained a deeper understanding of Macroeconomics from the perspective of a number of new models.",
    "An understanding of the macroeconomy and the microfoundations that build that model",
    "This econ class was awful. The teacher had no clue how to teach and shouldn't be a teacher.",
    "Really interesting course content that I thought was applicable to a lot of real world scenarios or concepts. Modeling made sense and was taught in a really strong way.",
    "learned to apply economic theories to practical and \"real world\" examples. This was a particularly appealing aspect of the class.",
    "Honestly not sure if any. I think the econ major would be well served if this course were altered to better understand the way things work in the economy, not just doing math problems.",
    "Applying theory to the mathematical portion of the topic.",
    "I learned a lot about the math behind macroeconomics that I wasn't previously familiar with, famous models, some of the patterns that emerge in the world (lots of stuff with the FED).",
    "We built up a dynamic model of the macroeconomy. I didn't really gain too many skills or insights from this class.",
    "ECON 122 was more theoretical and mathematical than I expected, to say the least."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: the TAs were especially helpful Weaknesses: At times, lecture made concepts explained simply in the book more confusing",
    "Moscarini does a great job supplementing the lectures with real world examples and several jokes regarding our aptness to make \"Super Big Bucks\" on Wall Street. I'm honestly a big fan of his teaching style - building each model through microeconomic foundations and manipulating graphs to reflect the mathematics. Problem sets are pretty difficult, but doable with collaboration.",
    "The course should cover the open economy (exports and imports).",
    "The lecture can get confusing and it is hard to understand where we are on the slides or in the current unit. When you get lost it is hard to catch up or understand how to formulate a question, which sometimes made it seem like lectures were not the best use of time. Could have improved understanding by doing more examples similar to the problem sets in class. The slides do a good job covering the book and giving clarification.",
    "Hard to spice up material like this. Pretty interesting problem sets when taking into account the application bits.",
    "I thought that the content of the course and its relatively interesting and straightforward PSets were definitely a strength, and the TF's were outstanding. It wasn't as rigorous or as theoretical as 126, but it was a solid course.",
    "The exam questions were unnecessarily mathematically. A lot of them required almost no knowledge of economics, just a good math background. This should not be the case.",
    "Incredibly amazing professor, really engaging. By far the best econ lecture I've taken at Yale. He cares so much about teaching, and you can tell he is excited to be explaining this material. A lot of people did not show up to lecture, but I think that's a real loss as the material and lecture can be incredibly exciting. Really loved this class.",
    "The strengths of this class where Prof. Moscarini, who was very helpful and explained concepts well, and the TAs. The problem sets were on the difficult side but they really aided in learning. One weakness is that it can be easy to fall behind on the material.",
    "I think section could be revamped-- reviewing the past Pset w\/o our own answers in front of us is not particularly engaging. In addition, the psets are pretty hard and some of the Excel stuff assumed a level of familiarity w\/ Excel that some people (i.e. me) did not have. Strength: midterm and final were pretty fair, nice mix of textbook powerpoint\/ professor's powerpoint\/ and professor's blackboard notes.",
    "I thought the lectures were hard to follow but I felt that the tests were written in a way that truly tested our understanding of the economy and its models instead of our ability to memorize random information.",
    "More focus on the logical thinking behind working through a model, visualizing it, I felt the math was pretty self-explanatory and we could have figured out how to apply it on our own.",
    "We didn't cover unemployment at all, which was odd, and never once discussed models of the open economy- something that was also lacking in intro macro. Some of the New Keynesian models were not explained that clearly in lecture. Lecture powerpoints came straight from book, and honestly weren't that helpful or interesting.",
    "The course provides very little support to quantitatively challenged students given the material and fails to make impenetrable topics accessible to students.",
    "The problem sets are based on information that the professor had not yet gone over in class, and sometimes never did go over in class. The TAs were the saving grace as they were the only ones who actually ended up teaching us anything.",
    "Strengths: - the course builds on itself, so if you master things in the beginning, you're continually learning throughout the course. -The course lines up very well with the textbook, so it's very easy to get more material if you need it to practice. Weaknesses -Weekly problem sets on new material may force you to cram it rather than fully understanding the material before being tested on it.",
    "Pros: Well organized, regimented, moved at a consistent pace Cons: Material was sometimes very dry, lectures were not always engaging",
    "I think this was a great course. The material was interesting and Prof. Moscarini made it applicable to the real world. It was a very well taught course. The only change I would suggest would be to make grading more consistent by having a different TF grade each week instead of one TF grading the assignments of half the class and the other TF grading the other half of the class. This is a minor point, though.",
    "It is a very interesting class but often hard to hold interest during lecture. Moscarini's lecturing is fine, but is easy to zone out.",
    "Lectures were clear, homework was challenging but helpful, professor was strong inside and out of class, TAs were kinda meh in section and going to section wasn't that useful because it was just homework walk through (which is already available in online solutions)...",
    "The lecture slides could be more clear. Sometimes when I review for exams and look towards my notes and slides it can be a bit confusing.",
    "I think the material is pretty interesting toward the end and pretty not interesting toward the beginning, but I think this isn't really avoidable given that you need the foundations. I think the lectures could have been made a bit more engaging.",
    "The course content is very interesting. However, there are interesting macroeconomic concepts that we did not cover that I expected a macro course to cover, such as international trade and currency. The course was clear and straightforward, but unfortunately, the professor did not present the material clearly. The problem sets and lectures were very wordy and hard to decipher without the help of a TA."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it was required for my major, but I felt like I got a lot out of the class. The TAs engagement was critical in my experience.",
    "A pretty nice intermediate macroeconomics course. If you're reading this, you have to take it, so suck it up. Very doable problem sets (2-3 hours a week), tolerable midterm and final, and a friendly professor make for a good combination. Many will complain about the mathematics of the course, but if you want to be an economics major, you probably should know the derivative of ln(x). Lectures were dry, but not terrible, given their 11:30 start time. Curve is decent, but be sure to study for exams, since there's a lot of tryhards in the course.",
    "Only if it is required for your major. Otherwise it is terribly boring and a waste of time.",
    "Unless they are in a major that requires this course, I would not recommend this class. It can get very confusing and overwhelming in nature sometimes.",
    "Worth taking, perhaps, even if you aren't taking it for your major. Mathematics in the class are definitely not strenuous and the material is fairly relevant. Prof. Moscarini is a great dude and tries to keep it relevant. Would recommend.",
    "I would definitely recommend to students who liked microeconomics and math, and don't have the time in their schedule to take 126.",
    "I would recommend this course if you're math-oriented.",
    "Absolutely! And please take it with Moscarini. You will really enjoy this class. It takes a few lectures to get used to his teaching style and his pace of talking. But he is truly one of the most engaging, skilled, and enthusiastic professors I've had at Yale. By far my favorite class this semester, would strongly recommend for econ and non-econ majors alike.",
    "It is a requirement for the econ major. I don't know how the class is with other professors, but this class is very micro founded.",
    "Pretty interesting economics course. I took it after econ 121 without taking intro macro, which worked out pretty well. It uses some of the same techniques as 121 but less intensely, i.e. more real-life application based. The psets are quite challenging but the exams are based off the psets. I think I understand a lot more about the macroeconomy and the field of macroeconomics itself now.",
    "I would only really take this course if you have to for the major. The course was considerably less engaging than intro macro. There were few real world examples of how the information we were learning might actually be applied. I was surprised that the course didn't even cover any international trade. Everything that we did was based on a closed economy assumption. It's hard to see why learning any of this information would be at all useful or informative on its own. I know that what I learned here will be expanded upon in future courses, but it was hard to feel motivated to engage with this class.",
    "For the Econ major, yes, otherwise, no.",
    "Requirement for econ majors",
    "Only if one needs to take the class for major completion. The score won't count towards distinction in the major, so chin up!",
    "I would recommend the course as long as it is not taught by Giuseppe Moscarini. If anyone else teaches it, it is a good base for macroeconomic knowledge. If he teaches it you are better off buying a textbook and trying to teach it to yourself, because that's what you'll end up doing anyways.",
    "Only take it if you need to.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in how the economy works on a large scale, and if you want to rigorously understand the building blocks of the economy. I think people who are not Econ majors can definitely take this course -- I took it while a prospective Econ major, and switched to History in the middle of the semester (not because this course was bad, though -- for other reasons!) and I'm really happy I took it so I can say I have a basic understanding of the macroeconomy. That being said, if you aren't an Econ person, this course does demand a lot of work out of you. But the TF's and Professor Moscarini are very accessible, and the textbook is very helpful. I would also not be scared away if you aren't amazing at math -- basic derivatives and algebra will get you far in this class. It's really possible to brush up on your derivatives.",
    "As an econ major in the course, the only other students were econ majors. You take this course if you have to and it's not the worst, but there is little reason to take this course outside of major requirements.",
    "Really good class - microfoundations is definitely the way to learn macroeconomics.",
    "I don't see why another student would take it unless they were an econ major, and a student who is an econ major has to take this. That being said, it is a solid course and Prof. Moscarini was very engaging and clear.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is required.",
    "This course is key to understanding how the macroeconomy works. A foundational course. Yes.",
    "absolutely not. the teacher doesn't care at all about the students well being and sucks at teaching.",
    "It requires effort to really understand I think but I enjoyed it. A mix of math and conceptual stuff and Prof Moscarini is great.",
    "A pset every week without being able to drop one is pretty brutal. Also don't put this off until second semester senior year",
    "No, I think it is more microeconomic theory than intermediate macro. This course felt very disconnected from everything I had learned in introductory macro.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you don't need to take it.",
    "Yes, the course was alright.",
    "Take it if you have to. Giuseppe really is not the best lecturer. In fact, I found myself more confused after he explained a concept than before. Generally, he is a pretty nice guy. He is accessible in office hours, and provides lots of hints on his problem sets and even sometimes on exams to help us out. He's also a little condescending, but welcome to Yale. If you need to learn the content for this course, just read the textbook. It explains things much more clearly than Giuseppe.",
    "I would not recommend this course with Professor Moscarini. Unless he changes the wordiness of his lecture style and problem sets, you will be lost and will have to teach yourself the material. Also, the problem sets were very difficult and on top of that very harshly graded. I appreciate the challenging concepts and found them especially interesting, but there's a harsh grade punishment for not getting them right on the first try."
