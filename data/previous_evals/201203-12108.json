    "This course moves really fast, but you learn a whole lot. We managed to get through the entire textbook with about a week to spare, and yea it was time consuming, but I thought that all of that work was worth it. I mean, there was homework everyday, but if you've know another romance language, the homework shouldn't take more than like half an hour to an hour to complete. And the class will be really easy for you.There were tests every week, and little quizzes that didn't really count for a grade (mainly participation, I think) that were sometimes twice a week. We mainly just talked a lot and did exercises from the book. At the end, you also have to read a short book, and we had to make a movie out of it, which was a bit crazy, given that we only had 2 days to film it, but it was fun. There aren't really any midterms, and the final this year was simply an essay using different grammatical aspects. We did have essays due every week, but those were never very long or difficult either. We also watched a lot of movies in the class, which was fun.Overall, I loved this class. I feel like I've learned a lot of Italian, which is great since I can't take anymore Italian classes after this (it's my senior year). Definitely take this class if you don't have a hectic semester and really want to start learning the language!",
    "I would strongly recommend other students to take this course if they truly want to learn Italian and are willing to put in the effort. It's a great experience, and you develop a great relationship with your fellow students and your professor.",
    "I highly recommend this course for students that are motivated to learn Italian. It is a lot of work but completely worth it! The quizzes and exam are helpful and force you to keep up with the material. It's amazing how much Italian you learn in such a short time!"
