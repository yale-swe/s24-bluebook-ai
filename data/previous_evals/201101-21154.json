    "\"In the Chun Lab meetings, we usually present our current projects or give practice talks. The group can be critical, but very much with the intent on improving research or presentation. I always enjoy hearing about the other research and find the comments very helpful to my own research and presentation. It's an interesting, fun lab meeting and I'd really recommend it.\""

    "Having all attention of my research and my presentation style during these lab meetings has been extremely valuable in terms of improving my presentations and focusing my thinking. Many of the comments received during this lab meeting have turned into much more in-depth discussions with my lab members and I feel like I really benefit from a research-oriented lab meeting. I look forward to the meetings."
