    "Take this class. Its interesting, engaging, and very relevant to today. You'll learn something new, and have fun doing it.",
    "This course discusses the history of gay and lesbian communities and individuals in primarily the 20th century, including the history of gender and sexuality and how they intertwine over time, etc. Legal, political, social lives are all discussed.I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Not too difficult and a good introduction to history and WGSS. Though there is a lot of reading, it is the most interesting reading you will have so you will always want to do it. Sections are fun and interesting and Chauncey is amazing! Make the time to take this class! It will open your eyesto entirely new ways of viewing things.",
    "Dull. I don't know. I would not recommend it except as the easiest fifth class ever. I was taking it at the same time as the Intro LGBT Studies seminar, which was by far the better course.",
    "I would recommend this class, but the end of the class becomes about pushing a certain agenda with certain biases.",
    "You will never regret taking this course but you will always regret not taking it.",
    "This is a fantastic class! If you're queer, you must take it, because even if you think you know your queer history, you probably don't know as much as you think you do. There are plenty of non-queer kids in the class, too, and I think everyone can enjoy Chauncey's fascinating ideas and fun lectures. Also, whether or not you end up taking the course, you should attend the lecture on AIDS... it's very moving.",
    "A wonderful course. If you care at all about LGBT issues (and how they developed), you must take it. The course spanned all emotions for everyone in the class--laughter and contentment abounded at the Pansy Craze lecture, tears fell at the AIDS lecture, and you could almost feel the empowerment at the last lecture detailing the struggle for marriage rights. Professor Chauncey knows how to lecture, though the topic alone should be enough to interest any Yalie.",
    "It is a history of both gay and straight people (so, sexuality) in America from around the settling of New Haven as a city until present day. I think everyone should take this course, because it is the history few are aware even exists, of a people who are consistently under- and misrepresented. It is very enlightening and will challenge the way you think about the topic, and sexuality in general",
    "survey of gay culture, life, struggles and struggles over time. definitely recommend it as it's an important part of our history and current culture to understand.",
    "This is a must-take class.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History was an eye-opening course that I enjoyed immensely. It takes you from the sodomy laws of Plymouth through to the gay marriage debate, stopping in the 1860s (romantic friendship between women) 1940s (the LGBTQ underbelly of WWII) and the 1970s (gay liberation front!) along the way. It's a comprehensive look at nearly 400 years of American history you've never heard of before, and Professor Chauncey is amazing. I absolutely recommend this class to everyone at Yale.",
    "Amazing class and extremely empowering.",
    "I can't recommend Professor Chauncey enough. The class itself is more work than you think it will be, but it's manageable and fun in the end.",
    "Absolutely; George Chauncey is one of the professors that I would seek out regardless of what he is teaching. Here the subject matter alone is so powerful that together the experience is not to be missed.",
    "I would describe American Studies 135 as an overview of gay and lesbian history that focuses mainly on the 20th century. Nothing too in depth.I would recommend this class as a fun elective.",
    "The topic is fascinating and something that everyone should know about, Professor Chauncey is a great and compelling lecturer, and the class is not too much work and always very very fun. I loved this class so much, lecture was always the highlight of my week.",
    "A history of sexuality, dating back to before sexuality was even a word or concept. Will blow your mind and put the homosexual experience into a historical context.",
    "This is a simple class on a very interesting topic. You will learn a lot, and its not hard. Take it!",
    "Take this class. If you are interested at all in learning more about queer history, take this class. Even if you aren't, you may find yourself liking it if you shop it.",
    "This course is amazing, the lectures are awesome and it's just a really interesting topic. There are only two papers, both of which are 5-6 pages, and you get to pick out of three paper options. There is a lot of reading each week, but it's manageable as long as you budget your time. The required films are really good, so watching them was fun.",
    "Everyone should take this no matter what!! It really exposes you to a history that almost no one has ever learned before!",
    "GREAT COURSE--TAKE ITIt will surprise you and give you a an appreciation for history as a discipline.It's not that much work either, as long as you keep up with the reading and IDs.Chauncey is an incredible lecturer and you will learn a ton.",
    "I dare you to shop the first lecture and not take the class. You will think that it was a misleadingly fun and interesting first meeting, but you would be wrong. Every lecture is like that. When Chauncey gives his AIDS lecture, you might cry.",
    "This is an incredible class. You might think our generation is greatly exposed to the LGBT community and LGBT issues, especially here at Yale, but there is so much you probably don't know about LGBT history and the problems they have faced and are dealing with today. Professor Chauncey is a fantastic lecturer and makes his lectures vivid and interesting. He plays music at the beginning and end of every class and shows plenty of video clips and pictures during his lectures. Much of the history is very tangible - we read diary accounts of gay students about their time at Yale andProf. Chauncey tells you about the development of the LGBT community at Yale and about students who battled and have died from AIDS. There is also one fantastic paper option, which involves interviewing your parents and grandparents about their attitudes toward homosexuality, and this allows you to have a discussion with your family that you may otherwise never have the chance to have. This class is a MUST take. It is powerful and moving and will make you rethink notions of gender identity and sexuality and open your eyes to many issues you may not have thought about. The workload is also quite reasonable, if only a tad above average.",
    "This an amazing class. You should not leave Yale without taking it. The third paper is a brilliant idea, and the topics covered will completely change how you view American history. This is an entire culture and history that you've never seen before. It's absolutely amazing. George Chauncey is a genius, and the lectures are outstanding. Very highly recommended.",
    "This class will prove to you why learning history is important. Taking this class is a moral imperative. do it!",
    "Yes. Take It. Best lecture course at Yale.",
    "Take it if you're into it. Don't study too hard. It's not that hard. Just get a TA who seems chill. It's a good interesting class. Not the best thing ever blah blah that everyone tells you, but it's solid and pretty easy and fun to study with people for.",
    "Probably the best class I've ever taken at Yale (and I'm an MB&B major). The topic is fascinating, the work-load is super manageable, and the professor is phenomenal. Seriously, Chauncey is the man. You MUST take this class.",
    "If you have any interest in the subject, take this class before leaving Yale. Professor Chauncey is a clear, enjoyable lecturer and an expert in the field. The material is most likely all new to students, and it's great to learn something completely different that you probably won't anywhere else. The readings were all pretty interesting and not too heavy, and the tests and papers were fair. It's pretty much accessible to any class year or major. You'll have a good foundation of LGBT history by the end, and you can surprise your friends with conversation starters such as, \"Did youknow that the original lyrics to Tutti Frutti were...\"",
    "Super fun. Not a crazy amount of work. Worth it.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. NOW. Or later, just as long as you do it before you graduate. George Chauncey is basically the reigning world authority on all of this stuff, and he's also a phenomenal teacher. Lectures are engaging, readings are fascinating, sections are small, papers and tests are relatively easy. It was an indispensable part of my education--especially as a straight guy--as both a revealing gay American history and as a new way to think about American history in general.",
    "If you're queer, you HAVE to take this class. If you're not queer, you should really take it anyway. It's fun and you learn a lot about American history in general through the lens of an oft-ignored minority. There is a lot of reading, but you don't have to do it all. Lecture is worth going to, especially because Chauncey doesn't share his slides. Pick a good TA (I strongly recommend Talya) because they grade all your work and will heavily influence how much you enjoy the class.",
    "YES, take it! Professor Chauncey is one of the main scholars in the field (we read a book by him, which is always exciting). It's one of those classic Yale lectures that you have to take.",
    "Yes, in a heartbeat. I don't care what major you have, this is one of the few classes I've taken thus far at Yale that I believe every student should take.",
    "Wonderful overview of gay and lesbian history throughout US history, mainly focusing on the early 20th c. A little repetitive at times, but Chauncey is a great lecturer.",
    "Yes, take it if you are at all interested. Worth the time and energy.",
    "Take this class, it's relevant to everybody. More than being a fascinating history that upends assumptions that we might have made about the evolution of the perception of homosexuality in America, it's a class that really concentrates on conceptions of gender in popular culture. If you're craving a \"whoa, I never thought of it this way..\" moments, you won't be disappointed.",
    "Definitely recommend. In offering a history of gay culture and life in the US, the course really illuminates a history of the mainstream culture's formation. Excellent at denaturalizing the present, and pretty fun material.",
    "U.S. Lesbian and Gay History is one of the best courses one could take at Yale. The course, in and of itself, is unique to Yale, in that the professor is a leading expert and has pioneered the course specifically for students at Yale to take it. Professor Chauncey relates lesbian and gay history back to Yale in some cases, providing more tangible examples of lesbian and gay history that has occurred on Yale campus. His lectures are fascinating, and the course will provide a new way of framing your perspective, both on history and on lesbian and gay matters.",
    "Please take this class. I grew up in a public school system in the south and never knew any US gay history. And George Chauncey is the BEST lecturer.",
    "This course is fantastic. Take it if you're anywhere in the queer spectrum, take it if you like history, take it if you're interested in anything LGBTQ, and even take it if you're secretly kind of homophobic but don't want to be. This class is incredibly fascinating.",
    "YES ABSOLUTELY! The material is engaging and Chauncey is a great lecturer.",
    "I think that to enjoy this class, you need as much of an interest in American history as in gay history, because so much of this class focuses on how broader themes in American history impacted and were influenced by gay history. Although I think that the material we learned in this class is something that everybody should be familiar with, it felt very much like an introductory class in that we only covered the surface of most topics. This might be due largely to how new the field is, but sometimesI felt like the class wasn't as academically rigorous as I would've liked it to be.",
    "Definitely take this course, it is interesting and informative!",
    "TAKE IT. One of the most important classes for you to take, not just because we're at the Gay Ivy. These issues are and will continue to be of central importance to our country for years.",
    "I would recommend history 127 to any student who thinks that he or she might have an interest in lesbian and gay history. This course provides a history of homosexuality from the days of the Greeks to modern day America. Chauncey is a great lecturer and the course is always fascinating. Make sure to stay on top of the reading because it piles up quickly and it will be impossible to catch up by the time you hit the final. Both the final and the midterm at very straightforward, as are the two essays you write during the course. Hist. 127 is an interesting history course that provides a great background to the issues of the lesbian and gay communities of today.",
    "Absolutely. I think it was my favorite class I've taken at Yale.",
    "One of the best classes at Yale. George Chauncey is an amazing professor. Take it.",
    "I took this class as my \"this is first semester of my freshman year, time to take a course that I would never have imagined taking in high school.\" I never considered it when blue booking. It certainly won't contribute to my major. But I still loved it. It's a great course, taught one of the best professors at Yale.",
    "Take it, it's awesome. I went into it suspicious of how great everyone said it was, and the fact that I've already taken many WGSS classes and had already read some of the stuff on the reading list, but I actually learned SO much new stuff. Chauncey is a great lecturer, as everyone will tell you, and I love that he starts and ends every class by playing a pop song that is relevant to that day's lecture! I will say, the reading load is heavy, but otherwise the work is manageable. Two five page papers is no big deal, and the ethnography at the beginning is just fun. The midterm and final don't take too long to study for.",
    "This class is amazing and pretty life changing. I'm a senior and it's the best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Chauncey is wonderful and really sweet. The lectures are awesome, and the readings are really interestingly.",
    "A great introduction to gay history. Professor Chauncey is engaging and very dedicated to the subject, and that shows in the lectures. The assignments are relevant and the readings are interesting.",
    "I shopped Gay& Lesbian History solely because of the phenomenal evaluations. I was in no way disappointed - after the first lecture, I was hooked. There are very few classes that I really believe every single Yale student should take, but this is absolutely one of them. Chauncey introduced me to a whole part of history I didn't even know existed, and one that, with this existence of this course, there is no excuse for not knowing. Chauncey is a simple and straightforward lecturer, and he doesn't need the gimmicks and jokes that other professors rely on - the subject matter is so fascinating and each lecture is so informative that each class is 50 minutes of plain learning. Exams are easy, papers are pretty fun to write, and the readings are largely interesting. TAKE THIS CLASS.",
    "Yes! Take it!",
    "This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. It's amazing. I recommend it HIGHLY.",
    "absolutely recommend this class to everyone at yale. it is a must take",
    "This class is a great course to get to know the queer history in the U.S.A. and pick up the basic ideas of sex, gender, and sexuality identity. I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it's just an interesting class and it touches upon ideas that are still in contention in terms of gay marriage and AIDs.",
    "Everyone should take this course!",
    "I would recommend it as a great, entertaining lecture. The reading can be a bit heavy at first but is generally interesting - overall, the workload is not bad. Chauncey is a great speaker, and though the class is about gay and lesbian history, it is more broadly a history of sexuality. A generally chill class.",
    "This class is really great. This was my first history class since sophomore year of high school, and I definitely do not consider myself a history person. But this class was so interesting, I might even look into more history classes. You will love George Chauncey. There's a lot of reading some weeks but really interesting reading that I loved doing. I would definitely recommend this class. It isn't extremely challenging, but you will have to do some work.",
    "This semester, I took this course with Professor Chauncey and a course about the Holocaust. Professor Chauncey moved me to tears three times throughout the semester; the Holocaust class, never. Chauncey is a great lecturer with a really interesting curriculum. Definitely take the course!",
    "I would definitely recommend taking the class. Lectures are fascinating, the sections are small and our group got quite close, and the oral history paper at the end helped me understand my parents and grandparents better, which was a nice bonus. That said, I would suggest taking it Cr\/D unless you've had experience with history\/cultural history courses--there's very little guidance on the tests and papers, I wasn't sure what to do, and the grading was tough.",
    "Yes! One of my best classes at Yale. Chauncey is really all he is hyped up to be. He was the only professor who could have gotten me to wake up before 1pm during my senior year.",
    "Wonderful course, not particularly difficult for a history major, I am sure very entertaining for a non-history major, and given Yale's well-deserved status as the \"Gay Ivy\" and prof. Chauncey's status as one of the nation's premier historians in the field, really should be a requirement for students of all backgrounds, gay or straight.",
    "Absolutely take this course. The readings (though there are so many there's no way you'll get to them all) are all interesting and the lectures are beyond amazing. I guantee the topic is something you're not going to know everything about already, even if you're a WGSS\/Anthro\/Sociology major and Chauncey is literally the BEST LECTURER EVER. Awesome. Take it CR\/D so you'll have no pressure with readings\/section\/papers, but if you take it for a grade the exams are straightforward and the papers engaging. JUST DO IT.",
    "YES you must take it! You will learn so much that will enrage, engage, and inspire you.",
    "I would recommend this as a fifth class. It's enjoyable, but didn't quite live up to all of the hype - the material isn't solid enough to fill an entire semester.",
    "Great class. Absolutely take it. Drop what you were going to take, it isn't important. This is.",
    "I absolutely loved this course. The lectures were fascinating, the papers were interesting and fun to write, and the exams were manageable. George Chauncey is an incredible professor, and everyone should know the material that you learn in this class. I would recommend it to every single student at Yale!",
    "Yes! Take it no matter what. The professor and TFs are great. It is not too difficult and the readings are more often than not fascinating. I learned so much that has been hidden from me before.",
    "YES! This is probably my favorite class I've taken at Yale thus far. The lectures are great, the readings are generally interesting, and the workload is not bad at all--midterm, final,2 6 pg. papers. Chauncey is an expert in the field and makes an effort to get to know students in this huge class. I learned some really shocking things that have changed my view of US history. You will get a good understanding of the history of homosexuals in the US since the 1600s, but the class focuses heavily on the last century. You also learn about US history in general particularly the civil rights and women's movements.",
    "TakeitTakeit!",
    "Take it! Great class!",
    "An overview of gay and lesbian history in the US from the 1800s until today (as the name of the course suggests). TAKE IT. Chauncey is very cool.",
    "Take this course. there's no other like it at Yale.",
    "Take it! It's great.",
    "I highly recommend this class- it was my favorite this term. It definitely changed the way I think about gay history. Chauncey is a great lecturer, and he starts every class with music. There is A LOT of reading, but most of it is enjoyable. Take it!",
    "Take this course. You will not regret it. The workload is normal for a lecture course, and the papers are actually pretty fun. Discussion section is also a lot of fun, and the readings aren't difficult to get through and understand. You will absolutely love lecture, George Chauncey is a brilliant scholar and a hilarious and engaging lecturer. He is always well prepared, so the class is very cohesive, and the lectures are very interesting with obvious chronological themes. If you are at all interested in the topic, or if you are a history major, you must take this class. An excellent first history course, so maybe not as challenging in terms of the discipline for experienced history majors, but still worth taking. Don't be scared off by the ethnography at the beginning of the term, it's really easy and fun to write and isn't even graded, but is a good exercise to get you thinking about the course in terms of your own life, which is also the goal of the final paper.",
    "This course was awesome! Definitely take it, even (especially if) you don't identify as queer. You'll learn a lot about a history that - if you are like most of us - you probably thought little about before, a history that nonetheless is highly important and fascinating. Chauncey is amazing and the TAs are all pretty cool too as far as I hear!",
    "This was a really interesting class. The lectures are good and Chauncey keeps it fun by playing music in the beginning of each class, and he has tons of fascinating film clips. I learned a lot about a part of US history that I really didn't know anything about before. I was never bored. It does tend to focus on white, male, middle\/upper class gay life, especially at first, but Chauncey devotes a lot of attention to minorities as well. Some weeks there is a ton of reading, but it is for the most part manageable. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone at Yale.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS. Whether you are a history major or just a senior looking for a random lecture that will entertain you for a semester, you should definitely take this class before you graduate. It's great to take a class taught by a professor who is a leader in the field, who really knows his stuff, who is extremely enthusiastic about the subject, and who is just a really great and entertaining lecturer.",
    "AMAZING. Must take class at some point. Especially if you're not gay and never had the impetus to learn it on your own. Chauncey is a brilliantly articulate lecturer; you just want to write down everything he says.",
    "definitely take! it's an overview of LGBTQ history from the 1800s to modern times. you discuss themes of shifts in mentality, activism, culture, and politics. you read a variety of accounts (historical books, novels, diaries, etc.) unlike any other course i've taken at Yale. relevant to everyone and just amazing!",
    "This is an excellent course -- one of those \"best Yale has to offer, take it no matter your major\" deals.",
    "Awesome, take it!",
    "This is one of the best classes at Yale. It puts the 20th century (and some broad strokes of the 18th and 19th century) into the context of social history. It will challenge students' preconceived notions of the time period and will introduce them to varied and interesting source material. This is a must for anyone interested in History, WGSS, or LGBT Studies - or for anyone with any interest in understanding the 20th century in the United States. A++!",
    "This was a decent lecture course, and one of the only one of its kind, for which there is something to be said. Plenty of other people will gush about it, so I'll take this opportunity to make my one sizable criticism.The course is hopelessly biased. I'm a Yale liberal at least as much as everyone else, but I was put off by how left-leaning the lectures and readings were. If I were from a conservative background and just wanted to learn about the issue, I would feel completely alienated and demonized. The material is rich, but very one-sided. It made the course seem less than academic; more like an advocacy class than a rigorous study. I was disappointed in this, and hope that the course is edited in the future.",
    "Take it. It's interesting, not too hard but not a gut, and the professor and TAs are nice. The three papers (you only have to choose two of them to do) are actually interesting and fun to write and Chauncey starts every day with fun music.",
    "Yes! its an amazing class",
    "If you're looking for a history lecture, this is a great choice. I would especially recommend it to people who haven't thought much about social history before, because it will show you why it's interesting and worthwhile. If you've done more of that stuff already (and\/or if you mostly know American history), it will be pretty easy, but that can be a good thing. Lectures and readings are interesting."
