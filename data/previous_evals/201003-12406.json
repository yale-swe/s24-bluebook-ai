   "comments": [
    "Yea. Definitely take. I have very little interest in classical Chinese, but this class made it fun and having snippets of ancient texts demystified was a treat.",
    "If you think it would be cool to read ancient Chinese texts, this class will give you the opportunity to learn how to do that. When taking it in English translation, the workload was very manageable. It starts off with almost no work and builds up towards the end of the semester, but compared to other L5 Chinese classes, it's still not that bad.",
    "This class is so enjoyable. you dont need to have a practical reason for it to be worthwhile. really it was awesome.",
    "If you're remotely interested in the material, you should take it. By far the most painless language class I've ever experienced, and I still managed to learn things.",
    "Great course if you want to gain reading ability of Classical Chinese text.",
    "Great (and painless) intro. to classical Chinese.",
    "CHNS 170 is a class in literary\/classical Chinese that introduces the grammar and syntax of literary Chinese in a number of short passages, both short philosophical discourses and fables. Later in the semester, we read passages from the Shiji. Altogether, the general flavor of the passages runs along that of sage ministers, kings, talking animals, retainers, eunuchs, and concubines. We had a daily vocabulary quiz, occasional homework and tests, a midterm, and a final. This class will not improve modern Chinese skills, but was sufficiently interesting that students of modern Chinese (even at a fairly low level) could enjoy and appreciate it. Additionally, I found the grammar discussions and passage content could facilitate a better understanding of modern Chinese language and culture.",
    "Take it. You will love it. You will learn a lot and believe it or not it is VERY impressive to be able to tell a native Chinese person that you know this stuff.",
    "This intro course in wen yan wen \/ More than fulfills your daily zen. \/ Learn grammatical features \/ From the coolest of teachers. \/ This class might be a perfect ten.Also, a story from his days back at Columbia: http:\/\/www.ivygateblog.com\/2006\/09\/faculty-studs-tenured-temptresses-of-the-ivy-league-last-call-for-nominations\/. But don't let this fool you, you'll learn A LOT from this class, without an overwhelming work load."
