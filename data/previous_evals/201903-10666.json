   "comments": [
    "Strengths is that if you don't have a lab you are working for you could possibly find one that you are interested in Weakness is that this class was WAY more work than my full credit classes, and this was a half credit course. The deadlines were at extremely odd times of the day and we received no feedback whatsoever on our responses. Some reason they graded things 2\/3 for full credit on the canvas site and it was terrifying to see 67%. Why don't you just make it out of 2 points? It didn't seem like the responses were even read. Also out of the entire semester every week we had a guest speaker and only ONE was a female speaker. Dr. Crdova Snchez said that it was only representative of the cognitive science department but that is very false just looking at the department's website.",
    "It's supposed to help you pick a topic for the senior thesis and apply to labs\/start the process, but is taught too late (most labs require more semesters working in the lab than students have after completing this course). Also doesn't actually teach you how to contact labs (email format, tips, etc). Would have been useful if not for the fact that it's taught far too late in the major track.",
    "1. there should have been more diversity in the people who came to speak about their research. why was their only one woman? incredibly demoralizing. also, more diversity in the kinds of research presented. 2. the class is supposed to help students plan their senior thesis, but listening to research done by people with PhD's and decades of experience isn't exactly representative of the kind of work a senior thesis would be. 3. way more work than a half credit. sometimes, the readings were 50+ pages and having two weekly reading responses (on incredibly strict\/odd schedules sometimes you only had 22 hours to do an assignment) was way too much. this should have been a full credit 4. professors shouldn't assign incredibly dense \/ technical readings. i often felt like i was reading things in a language i didn't understand, which was a total waste of time. 5. having a hard no-computer rule is bad. it makes students who require computers for typing because of disabilities feel uncomfortable and alienated. also, on the first day of course, the professor led a condescending discussion about letting us decide the computer policy, only to ignore what we said to go with what she had planned before (i.e. no computers). we were also told about a vote to decide the next year's \"fate,\" but this never happened, so I assume the vote she referenced that determined our fate was also a lie. we are all adults in the major and take this course seriously, so we should be allowed to make our own educational choices. 6. more leniency with missing assignments or lectures.",
    "If I didn't have much prior knowledge in one of the areas of study, the class meetings generally really helped me understand the paper.",
    "Great course!",
    "Honestly thought that the pre-work and post-work were kind of useless and tedious. If the course is supposed to be about just exposing us to different material, it should not treat us like we are middle schoolers.",
    "I enjoyed the guest lectures every week; the class was never dull nor repetitive. I also do appreciate being forced to think about senior thesis projects in Junior Fall - I feel ahead of the game compared to my non-cognitive science peers, and I think this gives me adequate time to start research if I want to do a BS. I wish that the course could meet at a different time besides 9:25AM; my level of engagement with the class could have been much higher if it had been slightly later in the day. I also especially wish that the deadlines for pre and post-work (and especially the senior thesis pre-work) were not set at 9:25AM but rather midnight the day before. The timing of deadlines is my biggest complaint from this class. Otherwise, I thought organization was pretty good, and the workload was quite manageable.",
    "Biggest weakness is how rigid the dates were for submissions. 9:25 AM on a Sunday is literally just an evil submission time. At least give us the afternoon. Another HUGE weakness is that this class was only 0.5 credits. It should be a full credit; it was a substantial amount of work (pre and post responses, long and technical readings). It was easily as much work as other courses at Yale.",
    "It's almost a bit too much work for 0.5 credits, I think the post-work is really unnecessary because the attendance is already marked and I understand that the pre-work is helpful for the professor and to ensure that we read the paper.",
    "Guest lecturers could be more prepared and vetted better, as some we had already seem before, and a couple of them spoke about very similar topics. Generally the class was good for what it was, although I really wish it had done more to foster a community among the people in the major.",
    "It is definitely a good class to orient you towards being more involved with research. One weakness is the lack of diversity of the speakers --white males from the SOM. Although I understand that it is a reflection of the reality (Yale professors are predominantly white males no matter the discipline), I wish there was an oversampling of underrepresented groups in the field. I think the class would be greatly improved if students had the chance to discuss the material amongst themselves, maybe even without the presence of the guest lecturer. The guest lecturers would also sometimes forget that they aren't speaking to people from within their highly specialized area. However, most of these weaknesses are due to the nature of the class and how it gives too much control to the guest speakers...",
    "I think the course assignments were not designed well. The due dates for the assignments were structured in an unnatural way and that made it so that it was easy to submit at the incorrect time. I spoke to many other students in the class who were having similar problems with it.",
    "The class has the potential to discuss all angles of the human mind with top class academics doing actual work in the field. But it fails to utilize this potential by bringing in professors in a random order, with no continuity, and often little enthusiasm. Felt like a large waste of time.",
    "Loved the guest lectures, though I wish the course was more dicussion based!",
    "I appreciated that the course aimed to show us a breadth of different research. However, I felt that certain areas were overlooked, while others were over-represented. 1. For example, Professor Knobe and Professor Newman lectured about essentially the same topic. I would recommend asking professors what they will speak about ahead of time, to prevent similar overlap. 2. A goal of the course was to help us find professors to work and do research with. However, the invited faculty didn't always talk about their current research, and most did not mention how to get in touch with their lab, and what the process for joining might be. In fact, when I approached Professor David Watts about working with him in the summer, he informed me that his lab almost never takes undergraduates with them to the field site. Several other students I spoke to had similar experiences with other professors. If a main goal of this course is to help prepare us to conduct senior thesis research and find potential advisors, it's extremely important that a majority of the people we invite to speak have room in their lab for undergraduates, are willing to work with students, and are clear about how to apply and what they are looking for. 3. Professor Scaz's lecture is a great lecture, but everyone in Junior Colloquium has already taken Introduction to Cognitive Science, and had heard his lecture before. Several other professor's lectures also spent significant time rehashing concepts we had learned in Introduction to Cognitive Science. 4. I felt that personality and social pyschology were under-represented, as well as research looking at addiction, mental illness, and criminal populations. We have several outstanding researchers on campus who do this work, such as Hedy Kober, Arielle Baskin Sommers, Jennifer Hirsch, Molly Crockett, and Margaret Clark, among others. I would have been really excited to hear them present. 5. The Cognitive Science major gives us incredible freedom to choose our courses, but this also means that most people in the major haven't taken classes with each other, and most of us do not know each other or know each other well. It feels like the cognitive science major is missing some of the sense of community that other majors with shared required classes share. I would appreciate if there were more optional social events for Colloquium students during the semester to meet and get to know each other, such as more lunches or maybe a coffee and brownies hour.",
    "I loved hearing from different lecturers each week.",
    "Lectures were interesting enough but class was too long that it was easy to be disengaged",
    "I really enjoyed the professors that came to speak to us. Although not all of their research aligned with my interest, it was really inspiring to hear what they were doing. I thought the pre and post works were very manageable, but I think the questions should have been more tailored towards the specific lectures and not as general as they ended up being.",
    "The timing of the class (9:25) was hard, the duration was difficult, and the homework readings were very long.",
    "Great speakers and good assignments, but I wish we had some time to discuss the topics as a group separately from listening to the speakers",
    "Very discussion-based and open to questions, which was nice",
    "It was so early in the morning. That was definitely a drawback. And the attendance\/lateness policies were very harsh. I liked the assortment of researchers who spoke to us, but I would have preferred to have seen a bit more non-white, non-male representation. I acknowledge that it is very difficult to do that when the cog sci research at Yale is so demographically skewed, but still, I'm sad researchers such as Prof. Ahn, Santos, or Crockett were not available. Also, this course was more work than some of my full-credit courses.",
    "Pretty harmless class and kind of interesting (most days), it's required so...",
    "The deadlines on this course were ridiculous - 9:25am every Sunday. This is not a fair time to ask for assignments to be submitted and made me like the class significantly less.",
    "This course provided a decent overview of the CogSci department at Yale. However, the speakers were mostly male and mostly white. It could be that the speakers chosen are representative of the department, but they surely are not representative of the students. It is difficult to imagine oneself contributing to a field that does not seem to have anyone but white men. More diverse speakers would improve the course, giving students of all backgrounds the ability to relate to the experts and their work. The deadlines for the pre-work and post-work assignments could also be improved. The strict deadlines do not give students ample time to write thoughtful responses. I was more stressed about getting the response in 24 hours after the class than actually processing the insight of the professors. It is ridiculous to have such a deadline after the lecture. I understand that the information is freshest immediately following the class. That being said, I had so many classes on Tuesdays that by the time I actually began writing my response, I had to consult my notes--notes that do not disappear 24 hours after the class. With more time to reflect on the experience, I would have gotten more out of the class.",
    "This course could be improved by being later in the day; I think the 9 am start time made it difficult for many students (like myself) to feel engaged. Additionally, changing the deadlines would be extremely helpful. Instead of having pre-work due Sundays at 9:25 even Sundays at noon would be great.",
    "This class could get very dry sometimes and it was hard to focus on the lectures for 2 hours because they sometimes got redundant, other times though they were FASCINATING. it was very hit or miss for me",
    "Strengths: It's interesting to hear from many different professors. Weaknesses: Too much work for a half credit course, especially since the work was not targeted towards our own thesis. I understand that some students who have no idea for their thesis yet may benefit from thinking critically about all these different topics, but for students who have an idea already, the class doesn't facilitate their exploration of that. Another weakness is the layout of the course whereby you MUST attend each class in order to do the post-work. The instructors implemented one make-up assignment to account for that, but considering how strict the deadlines are and the fact that late work (even by a few hours) gets Zero credit, it's very likely that you'll end up not getting credit for a few assignments. It's not just a policy that could be overridden with a dean's excuse either because if you are not in class there is no way to write the post work. The 24 hour deadline on the post work is also too strict (even though I'm told it is less strict than the deadline for the pre-work, it seems entirely subjective as far as how late it can be) and the fact that there's no system in place for partial credit is frustrating because you can work hard to get the work done and then get absolutely no acknowledgement for what you did just because it's a few hours late. I happened to have back to back classes until 4:30 on Tuesdays so I had very little time to get the work done that day. The instructors were not nearly as flexible or understanding as most other instructors I've had, which was endlessly frustrating for a 0.5 credit required course.",
    "Having the pre-work due at 9:25 AM on Sunday was very difficult. It's just plain hard to remember. I've never had another instructor pick a time like that, it's not normal practice for a Yale class. Having it due earlier would actually be easier, like Fridays at midnight. Saturday is \"weekend mode\" so it's hard to remember \"oh yeah I have something due in the morning\". And most people wake up after 9:25AM on Sundays. As someone that has serious social anxiety, I found it veryyyy difficult to participate comfortably because the class is so big and the subject matter was usually something I had no experience in. Lowering the percentage of the participation grade would be very meaningful. Or maybe having a way to send questions to the professor in real-time. Discussions were usually just a theatrical opportunity for (no offense, more egotistical) students to hear their own voices. But I guess that's on every individual professor to try and mediate more effectively.",
    "I would have liked more feedback on the work I submitted in this class -- many times the grades on reading responses seemed arbitrary and I would have preferred answering more specific questions on each lecture rather than answering the same vague question for every new class."

    "Yes, I think this is a good way to gain exposure to a bunch of different areas of cognitive science research, beyond what any individual course offering within the major could provide. I also think this class helped alleviate a lot of my anxieties about senior thesis work. I will warn students that it is 2 hours long, and especially at 9AM, can be a little tiring to sit through. However, the lecturers were all fairly engaging and the workload was predictable and light.",
    "I mean you have to do it, but I do think it is a valuable thing to be able to read the literature and synthesize it well. Go into it with a good mindset and you'll get more out of it than you think.",

    "yes",
    "Yes, and chances are youll have to take it anyways for the CogSci major",

    "yes - required for cog sci major, some of the lectures are very interesting",
    "Required!",
    "No, but you have to take it for the CogSci major.",
    "I mean, you have to take it if you are a CogSci major, so all I have to say is good luck and have fun!",
    "It is required for the major, but I think it was kind of a pain to have 2 mandatory homework and a long amount of reading each week.",
    "Frankly, this course really made my semester rough. The amount of reading was unpredictable from week to week, and it's very difficult to BS the pre-work without reading and understanding the assigned reading (which no doubt is intentional). I expected the work to relate directly to my thesis, like submitting ideas for a thesis, writing emails to PI's, taking me through typical stepping stones to get ready for a thesis. Instead, the work was mostly unrelated (except one or two lectures that may be somewhat in line with your topic of interest), it was busy work but also non trivial because you really had to understand the topic and think hard about it (to come up with novel research directions), and then it was graded with check plus, minus, and check like a high school assignment. There was also no explanation of how those translated into a grade...I would expect a course like this to be pass\/fail but it doesn't seem to be (I guess I'll find out when I submit this evaluation and can see my grade). I also think the amount of work just caused students to feel apathetic toward the course, which is not conducive to learning because then you start doing the work, not out of interest or excitement, but because you have to. It's not worth abandoning the major just to avoid this course, but I recommend you pick the instructors brains to figure out what the workload is when deciding on the rest of your schedule (for example having a full day of class, sports practice, and\/or a rehearsal on days when you only have 24 hours to do the post work would be a very bad idea)."
