    "Don't be scared off by Mme Pinzka's higher workload rating - it's 100% worth a little more work to have such an engaged, entertaining and kind professor. The class itself is an entertaining survey of some of the major authors and works of the French and Francophone literary traditions, and serves as an excellent introduction to the study of French-language literature. The papers are a reasonable length, and there is never an unmanageable amount of reading (although, if you read slower in French, be warned that the reading will be quite time-consuming). Class discussions are lively and the cultural and historical context provided by the incredibly knowledgeable Mme Pinzka is invaluable. Highly recommended!",
    "I would certainly recommend this class. Be prepared for the workload--it's certainly not easy or fast reading--but it's totally worth it. You'll emerge with better French writing, speaking, and analysis skills. Mme Pinkza is a great professor, who works to makes sure everyone follows the material and engages in discussion. Grading is very fair and overall rather forgiving.",
    "French 170 is your standard French lit course. Reading about a book a week give or take, the pieces are good and the class is enjoyable. It's a small class though, so you have to at least have some knowledge of the reading when you come in. If you're remotely interesting in French lit take it, because you won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend French 170 to anyone who would like to more about French literature, whether or not they've already studied it a bit (I had before taking the class). The diversity of the readings and the breadth of the course (nearly 1000 years of literature are covered) means that you never spend too much time on a particular genre: if, for instance, you don't like medieval French lais, you won't have to spend more than a week or two on them. This course helped me discover which types of French literature I *do* particularly enjoy; I look forward to studying them more in the future.",
    "This class introduces the students to the French literature; the readings are not that hard but they can be overwhelming for someone whose french is still rudimentary. However, probably the hardest part is the discussions conducted in class. The discussions are so demanding for everyone, especially if one is still stumbling with vocabulary and accents. If you are not yet confident with your communicative abilities, make sure you are willing to pay the cost because it might get really rough at a certain point! Just one more thing: if you want to take this level, Pinzka is definitely awesome! You will love her!",
    "I would highly recommend FREN 170-02 to any student who feels prepared and is interested in literature. The works covered in this course are all the more interesting because they are made accessible by the excellent instructors. This is definitely a great course to study French literature, whether you plan to continue with it or not."
