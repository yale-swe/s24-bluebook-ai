   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the course as one that holds a fairly light workload but provides intuitive explanations of fundamental chemical processes. Good for all organic and physical students.",
    "Chemistry 518 is appropriate for a student who wants to understand organic reactivity within the bounds of systematized, physical properties and phenomena. Provides insight into molecular conformations, orbital interactions and energy transitions among other topics.",
    "Yes I would recommend it for any student who is interested in physical organic chemistry.",
    "I would recommend this to an undergraduate as an advanced course. I would not recommend this for grad students as most of the material can be learned independently.",
    "Strongly recommend!",
    "Chemistry 518 is a slow-paced course, and would be recommended for another student, and for undergraduate students. This course does not go through material fast and is taught in a manner that is understandable. The textbook is also good for learning material.",
    "I will recommend this course to computational and physical chemistry students , but not synthetic or organic students.",
    "Definitely a class to take. At times it can be slow and boring but overall its worthwhile.",
    "See question 1. Yes, recommended.",
    "Starting with a review of Lewis structures, Chemistry 518 is a review of the most basic organic chemistry, with an emphasis on research conducted more than twenty years ago. It includes a tantalizing skirmish with pericyclic reactions."

    "focused on things I should know.",
    "This course helps me review the organic chemistry courses I took during college. It also extends my knowledge on physical organic chemistry and a variety of topics related to reaction mechanisms.",
    "This course was a good review of basic organic chemistry concepts, with some advanced topics mixed in. Overall, it did not extensively deepen my understanding of organic chemistry though.",
    "It helps me develop a physical view of the organic chemistry field which is new and interesting.",
    "It gave me more knowledge about physical organic chemistry. However, I learned most of the material in a graduate course taken as an undergraduate. It will be useful for my research.",
    "I obtained a deeper understanding of a couple key concepts in organic chemistry. Hard to say how much of it will be directly relevant to my research, but I'm certainly more knowledgeable.",
    "See question 1. Definitely good to know the fundamentals reasons why molecules behave as they do. It was also great to learn about computational chemistry, which will also be useful."
