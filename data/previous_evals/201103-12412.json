   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it, you definitely have to take it anyways so you may as well.",
    "Smooke is a great guy. He has a really calming deep voice that will soothe you into liking fluid mechanics. Then suddenly you will find yourself frantically trying to keep up while copying down irritating derivations in class. Don't worry too much about writing them down. Smooke goes too fast and they aren't necessary to know anyway. The book is good although it goes beyond the scope of the course (so don't read it at first), and the tests are just like the homework problems or even easier. The final is somewhat harder than the midterms but by no means impossible or tricky.",
    "This class is most likely a requirement for your major, but it'll be one of the more enjoyable major-required classes you'll take here. I liked it a lot.",
    "One of my favorite classes at Yale, though I know I'm in the minority. The class was very difficult the year before this, but was very reasonable this year, so I can't predict how hard Smooke will make it next year. Interesting material for chemical and environmental engineers as well. Very math-driven.",
    "Take it! Although it's a mechanical engineering class, the course material is applicable to many different sciences. A lot of content is covered, but the tests and homework are manageable. Lots of fun!",
    "Not really. You'll take it because you have to. Components of it are interesting, but it can be very frustrating given that class is unrelated to homework and the section was completely useless.",
    "Interesting material and some neat insight on the world. Definitely a must for MechEs.",
    "If you are looking at these reviews, then you most likely have to take this course. It is very interesting and challenging, but if you put in the work, then you will enjoy the course.",
    "I really enjoyed fluid mechanics. We went over a bunch of things that seem complicated at first but can then be reduced to pretty simple concepts, such as control volume analysis and differential fluid motion (Navier-Stokes equations). Professor Smooke and the book did a good job of explaining everything. I think in previous years people have complained that the class was not very well organized - that was not the case this year, at least in my opinion. While we still studied things scattered throughout the book, Professor Smooke did a good job of letting us know which sections we needed to know, and the midterms and final, which were very fair, did a good job of tying in to lectures and the homework. Furthermore, Smooke had some awesome and memorable examples during class. I loved calculating how fast a racecar would have to drive in order to drive upside down in a tunnel (lift coefficient). I will also never forget our final lecture, where we applied everything from hydrostatics to adiabatic compression to the analysis of the Titanic sinking. Overall, this class was very enjoyable, and I left feeling that I understood everything we had been taught.",
    "Unlike, I think, most people in the class, I didn't have to take this for my major. I'm really glad I did, though -- it was a really solid course. It's definitely challenging, but I got a lot out of it. At times it felt like an applied math class, which was sort of interesting and fun. If you're willing to put in some work, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course- favorite math class I've taken at Yale! Smooke is an incredible teacher and you learn a TON.",
    "This is a course in which you will learn most of the basics of fluid mechanics. Professor Smooke is a very good instructor, so take it with him, if you can. The homeworks don't take too long, and the test problems are quite straightforward. The grading curve may be a little harsh, though. The material is pretty straightforward, so if you want a good introduction to concepts in fluids, this is the course to take.",
    "If you like engineering, then you probably won't mind this class, but if your focus is more science than engineering, stay away. It's mildly interesting but incredibly tedious. The professor's good, but he tends to use a lot of examples in class with numbers, which isn't particularly helpful and actually tends to muddle the concepts he's trying to illustrate.",
    "Fluid mechanics is a decent course, although most people are taking it because its a pre-req. You do learn a lot of useful concepts that apply to more advanced engineering ideas and projects. Smooke does a good job with helping you learn the basic concepts and the class, although you do have to spend a decent amount of time learning some things on your own.",
    "I would only take this course if you are required to. The amount of material covered is pretty overwhelming, but the book is extremely helpful. The work and exams are doable, but you have to put in a lot of time.",
    "Good intro course to fluids and also extremely undemanding in terms of time commitment (even less if you have some background in physics and a cursory background in complex analysis). Problem sets start out taking around an hour or so a week and eventually end up taking about two hours a week, maybe a bit less. Midterms and final are extremely straightforward and easy. Definitely a course worth taking if you're interested in the subject or you need an easy QR course to round out an otherwise difficult schedule.",
    "I think it's a fairly easy course if you are good with mathematics and vector calculus. The first half of the course is a very useful way to gain a basic understanding of the principles of fluid mechanics.",
    "I recommend this course. A great thing about the course is that Professor Smooke reviews all of the mathematical techniques and thermodynamic concepts that you will need to solve problems and understand the material.",
    "Great class, required for MechE's and ChemE's so its largely unavoidable, but the class is enjoyable and gives a great overview of Fluid Mechanics",
    "It's fluid mechanics. There really aren't any surprises here. Besides the fact that it's hard to distinguish his 'p's from his rhos on the board, Smooke's a fine professor and a nice person. The standard curve is to a B-, but this year he raised it to a B+ because we apparently did very well.",
    "midterms were fairly doable. final a little harder. p-sets doable, look out for solution manuals to old editions of the textbook, makes life easier. textbook itself isn't all that great, so paying attention in class would be a good idea. pset\/exam solutions not uploaded on classes, so maybe you could ask that of the professor\/TA when you take it. what i expected to be an absolute nightmare of fall semester of junior year turned out to be a rather interesting and dare i say fun class - smooke was a great lecturer, and he always brought in fun examples to show to the class. overall, don't worry too much about this one - it's a pretty typical engineering class.",
    "MENG 361 is a great introduction to concepts applicable to every engineering discipline. For the mechEs, the applications are obvious: buoyancy, drag, etc. For BMEs: flow through frictional and frictionless tubing\/syringes. ChemEs: hydrostatics, combustion, etc. The list goes on, and I believe every engineering major will benefit from this class (I also think it's required, at least for ABET engineering majors...). Professor Smooke is the best engineering professor at Yale, in my opinion, so make sure you take this class when he's teaching it!!",
    "Take this course! Professor Smooke knows how to teach and always brings in real-world examples of fluid mechanics to class (e.g. clips from Titanic). Problem sets and exams are reasonable.",
    "A really good introduction to fluid mechanics. Smooke knows what he is doing and always uses interesting examples (and sometimes movie clips) to illustrate the ideas. He also uses examples from all areas of engineering. If you're biomedical engineering, this class overlaps a lot with beng351 and is good to take concurrently (although they're changing the curriculum for that course, so maybe double check). Problem sets and tests aren't too bad.",
    "you're obviously taking this course because you need to, not for fun, but if you do the work it's not that hard.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Make sure to get a foundation of the material in the beginning and you will be fine. The test is just like the homework. Also, professor Smooke really knows what he's doing.",
    "Lots of work, but the applications are fun (really!), so much more rewarding than DiffEq and Multivariable. \"Things go boom\" with a wicked curve (although degree of wickedness varies year to year)."
