    "Absolutely! This is a great way to get to know arguably the most important playwright in history, and come to a good understanding of who he was as an artist in his time, through history, and today. You come out a with a really solid understanding of his works and their significance. If you want to learn about Shakespeare, take this course!",
    "I really enjoyed the class. There is a sizable amount of reading with a new play each week, but very worth the time investment. Professor Walsh does a nice job of creating interesting lectures. No outside homework besides a few shorter papers. The prompts are difficult, but nothing too bad. I would recommend the course if you have an interest in Shakespeare. It's not writing intensive and you read a lot of classics.",
    "If you're into Shakespeare, do it! If you're scared of Shakespeare, do it, too! This course is a great entry point into the work of a master writer and Prof. Walsh is a very able guide.",
    "Amazing class!! Much better than Romances and Comedies (partially because of the material, partially because of the professor). Walsh's lectures were always interesting and engaging, and he has a great sense of humor which really lightens up the class",
    "Take this class if you 1) Love Shakespeare and have read a ton of him but need a course for the English major or 2) Have never read a lot of Shakespeare but have time to read a play a week. Walsh is awesome and his lectures are really insightful.",
    "If you're like me and you need a professor to make Shakespeare more engaging, I'd say take it.",
    "Great English class whether you're in the major or not. A play a week, Walsh is a pretty interesting lecturer and makes the material easy to understand\/not too far fetched. I would recommend it",
    "Take it! I think sometimes English lectures are underrated when they shouldn't be. This class with Professor Walsh is a gem--he's very approachable but has really interesting ideas about the texts. The reading list is standard for a Shakespeare class on histories and tragedies, the workload isn't too bad (one ungraded short paper, 2 medium-length papers, one performance review), and the lectures are great.",
    "This course strikes an excellent balance between illuminating to an English scholar, and accessible to someone reading Shakespeare for the first time (which is me). Professor Walsh really does take the time to expose the fascinating aspects of each text. Though his lecture style is not the most engaging, the content certainly is. Put in the time and the effort and you will leave this class with a rich understanding of the English language's most important and influential writer. Nearly everything else you will read refers to (directly or indirectly) his works in one way or another, making this an essential backbone of any liberal arts education. Do take the time to shop your TFs, though.",
    "Don't just take it as a WR, but it's a great class if you're able to keep up with the play-a-week pace. That's a lot of reading.",
    "Take this class if you want to read these works! It's a straightforward, pleasant course, fairly graded and well structured. The teaching is good and the plays are Shakespeare, for God's sake!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Professor Walsh is a fantastic lecturer, hilarious and brilliant and insightful. EVERYONE should know more about Shakespeare--my section was half English majors, half physics\/EP&E\/history majors, because everyone loves Shakespeare. The material was interesting even for people who aren't generally into theater. Only 2 full papers, very manageable, excellent class.",
    "TAKE IT! Shakespeare is the best. (Yes, nerd alert -- whatever, I'm over it.) This class provides the discipline for you to read all those awesome plays that you feel like you really ought to read, but will in all honesty probably never get around to. The plays themselves are fun to read as preparation for class each week (you read one play a week, with two lectures on it) and lecture itself is really interesting. Those 50 minutes fly by. The written work (one ungraded close reading, a review assignment, and two 5-8 page papers) was very reasonable and (dare I say!) enjoyable. The written final was very do-able. Super fun class.",
    "The syllabus is standard, but the lectures are not! Professor Walsh is great at illuminating angles of Shakespeare and (responsibly qualified) modern reads of the plays. Professor Walsh is a sensitive, humorous reader of and lecturer on Shakespeare. Fellow students and I spoke throughout the semester about how well he connected with the class despite the small lecture size. I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to anyone of any major. It's challenging enough for English majors while accessible to all. Shakespeare is made out to be such a part of the college experience for good reason. Take this chance to alternately empathize with and laugh at our humanity! Strengths: Strong syllabus, solid lectures that covered both well-traveled (for those less familiar with Shakespeare) and new ground. Weaknesses: Not enough time in the semester to do more!",
    "A good lecture course! Engaging and varied lectures, interesting prompts, and (obviously) wonderful reading material. Professor Walsh is knowledgable and entertaining.",
    "If you are at all interested in Shakespeare, take this class. It's really wonderful",
    "Every student should take this course as an essential component of a liberal arts education. Professor Walsh was wonderful. It was clear every lecture how much careful thought he had put into the themes we covered. He is a phenomenal teaches and lectures were both informative and thought provoking.",
    "A survey of some of Shakespeare's greatest works. The workload is constant but not super heavy (one play every week) and the papers are manageable.",
    "Interesting course. Walsh is a strong lecturer. Make sure you get an engaging section leader. (Stephen Krewson was great.)",
    "The course itself is decent to good, but the plays are some of the best things ever written, so if you haven't really gotten into them yet, take the opportunity. Brian Walsh does fine as a lecturer, although I did think that the essay prompts in this course were a bit broad and uninteresting.",
    "This is such an amazing course! Definitely one of my favorites...do shop it, even if you aren't an English major, and especially if you like Shakespeare. I absolutely adore the Bard, and so the reading list was a dream. And now I own the Norton Shakespeare. I feel so sophisticated carrying it around, but anyway...Professor Walsh is really great, his lectures are so well organized and fun to listen to. Professor Walsh has this great endearingly awkward sense of humor, and he really loves Shakespeare, and I just learned so much. I hated missing the one or two lectures I did. You'll be reading about a play a week, which is manageable, I suppose though I never did do well enough to read it in time for lecture (eventually got around to it though!) And I like going to section, which is crazy, I know, but there was always a lot of great discussion. The papers weren't too bad, and they were a lot of fun, and so was the final exam. I've never enjoyed taking a test before, and it was such a wonderful experience in general.",
    "A must-take at some point, especially if Walsh is still teaching. Shakespeare's histories and tragedies are an important foundation in English theater and literature, so why not read them a bunch of them in a semester? You'll learn a lot, and it's not too difficult if you read all the plays.",
    "Pros 1) You read great Shakespeare. 2) Brian Walsh is adorkable, a quick-witted engaging lecturer who has enjoyable self-deprecating humor. Cons 1) There is a stupid, non-graded paper in the beginning. 2) Grading feels arbitrary. It is unclear what they look for on the papers. They say they want close reading, but then assign very broad essay topics that require synthesis of multiple texts rather than analysis of a single paragraph. 3) A play or more a week; it's a lot of reading. 4) About 1\/3 of the final is close reading of literary devices, something we literally spent no time on during the class. There are more cons than pros in this list, but I'd still recommend the class. The texts and lectures are great. I just have my gripes."
