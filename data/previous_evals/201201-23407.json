    "The instructor was generally very responsive to questions, but there was very little, and often no time for them.",
    "While the professor was clearly very knowledgable on the topics, I felt like he didn't impart his expertise very efficiently. We were given a lot of reading but we didn't spend much time going over the reading in class so it was unclear what the benefit of the reading was.",

    "The Revesz textbook was a great resource.",
    "The subject matter is critical to any environmental manager.",

   "comments": [
    "Readings were a little confusing without going to a non-class source to read about the actual case.",
    "The reading material is very dense and difficult to get through for those not already familiar with typical law school readings and language. Most students did not complete the readings.",
    "The class lectures tented to digress and focus too closely on the Professor's own pontification about the topics. This kind of discussion would be appropriate only after actually presenting the nuts and bolts of the statutes the class was slated to go over during the class.",
    "The course focused on statutes rather than how the law can be used to solve environmental problems. This was disappointing. As a non-YLS student, the course content was not as relevant as it could have been. On the other hand, it's quite possible that the nature of the material reflects the legal system as it exists.",
    "getting into the case history in more depth by making class time more interesting, perhaps by asking a different student to present a specific case each class.",
    "Additional assignments would be helpful in this class to make students apply what they're learning. The course should also have more structured lectures with the use of power point or some sort of format to follow.",
    "It should have some exposure to the laws of the country to which a student belong."
