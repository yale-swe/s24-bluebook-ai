    "Great improvement in Chinese language skills, Yale's Chinese department is one of the best around, and the teachers are all top notch.",
    "I learned a lot about how to study Chinese more efficiently than ever! My grammar is greatly improved, and I've been able to model a system of learning Chinese after the system Xu Laoshi and Liang Laoshi taught us with. I also feel like my oral and aural skills have greatly improved from the tutorials and oral exams.",
    "By the end of the class I had an increased vocabulary and better tones.",
    "Chinese vocabulary, grammatical structures, cultural knowledge, some formal language (as opposed to earlier Chinese classes that exclusively covered conversational Chinese). Very similar to Chinese 130.",
    "This class taught me a wealth of information about Chinese grammar and higher-level vocabulary.",
    "This course was very effective at helping me remember a large amount of vocabulary by repeating it every day."

   "comments": [
    "Content could be more relevant to culture\/identity. A lot of it is my fault - I wasn't good enough to do the heritage track - but some of the lessons were pretty meaningless - one chapter about a guy who cheats on his wife after becomes successful was a particular low point .",
    "I think they've pretty much perfected the art of teaching Chinese. No real improvements to list. It was a tough course but got results and that's why I took it.",
    "Most aspects of this course are top notch. Some say the work load is a bit much, but I feel that the daily homework is a great help to learning Chinese. We get all the corrections we want when we make mistakes, so we make sure to learn thoroughly. The teachers are incredibly passionate and fun in class, so it's always fun to . The tutorials are a great addition to help with oral and aural skills.",
    "The strongest aspect of this course is the constant engagement by Xu and Liang Laoshi. They're both incredible teachers, and they work diligently to make sure the course runs smoothly for the entire semester. The pace is very fast, with a quiz every day, and about a full chapter covered every 10 days. However, every single assignment was turned back within 24 hours, making it possible for students to keep up with this highly demanding course. I can't think of any ways to improve this course. CHNS130 and CHNS140 are the two best Chinese classes I've ever taken, without a doubt.",
    "Strengths: passionate, dedicated professors who care about the class and their students. You are guaranteed to come away with much more Chinese knowledge than you had when you started. Since the class meets every day, youll have a tight community of Chinese classmates. Its a great class if youre willing to put in the work. Weaknesses: focus on rote memorization means retention is not that high; we have to memorize so many characters that I would memorize them for the quiz, forget and restudy them for midterms, and forget and restudy again for the final. If we spent more time on fewer characters, we would really be able to master those instead of moving so quickly we dont have time to remember anything.",
    "The strengths of this course are the wide variety opportunities to engage in Chinese dialogue, and learn about Chinese culture while doing so. The weaknesses of this course lie in the class size, which was a little too large this semester.",
    "Strengths: repetition, always knowing how to plan to study for Chinese. Weaknesses: there is not enough practice for grammar."

   "comments": [
    "Yes! Although if you can do the heritage track, I would 100% suggest you do the heritage track.",
    "Of course, the teachers are amazing and so sweet.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!!! Chinese is a fascinating language, and the way it's taught at Yale, everyone who takes this course will enjoy learning the wonders of .",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Although it is a lot of work and takes a lot of time to meet every day, the improvement was worthwhile and I grew close to my teachers and classmates.",
    "The Chinese track at Yale is absolutely incredible, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to continue studying Chinese at Yale. Xu Laoshi and Liang Laoshi are fantastic teachers, and will push you every day to make your Chinese better. Definitely try to avoid signing up for the 9:30 class, as you're not gonna want to be up that early every day. That being said, this class is a lot of work on the day-to-day, but any single assignment won't take you longer than an hour or so. There is a short quiz at the beginning of class EVERY SINGLE DAY, but you know exactly what material it will cover and honestly I can't remember the last time I dropped a point on one of those. Expect to devote about 30-60 minutes to Chinese homework every night. Also, you'll meet with a TA for a one-on-one tutorial once a week for half an hour, these are graded but as long as you prepare for like 5 minutes you'll be fine. Definitely be on your toes in class, Liang Laoshi is an absolute expert when it comes to cold-calling people who are zoning out, and Xu Laoshi is pretty solid at this too. Finally, the assessments in the class are not bad at all. The oral tests can be a little tricky, but as long as you know the questions covered during the weekly tutorials you'll be fine. Written tests are also not bad at all, and the final is essentially a slightly longer written test. All in all, you'll get out of this class what you put in, but if you are serous about improving your Chinese, then there's no better option than 140.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yes, if youre okay putting in the work. Chinese 140 is exactly the same as Chinese 130 except that there is a dictation homework (15 minutes per unit, not bad at all) and slightly different tutorial structure (not a big change either), so if you were okay in 130, youll be fine in 140. If you dont want to spend lots of time practicing characters, memorizing sentence patterns, etc., then this might not be the course for you. But if you do choose to take it, you will learn a tremendous amount of Chinese and have strong support from caring and dedicated professors.",
    "I would recommend this course to any student genuinely interested in Chinese language and culture.",
    "Yes -- it is effective if you want to learn Chinese very fast."
