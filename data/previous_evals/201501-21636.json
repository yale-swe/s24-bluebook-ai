   "comments": [
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT. I am not a science major, and this class has been the most rewarding QR\/SC class I've had so far. I feel like I have a much better conception of how daily gadgets work. Having a good physics background but little knowledge in applied physics, I found this class extremely accessible.",
    "I would not recommend it to another non-science\/math major.",
    "Good, fun class! If you have AP Physics you should be fine. Don't make the mistake of missing class or understudying the exams though!",
    "I would recommend the technological world to anyone who has taken a physics class in high school and who is committed to showing up to class. The tests aren't easy, but it is an interesting class with a relatively low workload outside the class.",
    "Very informative class which helps us understand the mystery behind many modern technologies.",
    "A cool \"how stuff works\" course based on Physics E\/M. Best if you've taken AP Physics C beforehand.",
    "The course covers a good and broad range of material, with a good balance struck between the theory and application. The pace was good and its level pitched at a sufficiently introductory level without at all being too easy.",
    "Good \"How-stuff-works\" class. Definitely not a gut course, you need to show up to lecture because slides are not posted online. Having a good physics background would help. Psets weekly, 2 midterms and a final. Not too bad for a QR\/SC credit.",
    "I feel like this class is a bad rap. You get to learn how stuff you see every day actually works. There's no textbook, which saves you money. Professor Henrich gives you links to very helpful websites and there's a general physics textbook on reserve at Bass. There were three help sessions a week; I would usually just do each week's pset there. All of the TFs are very helpful. They and Professor Henrich really want each student to succeed, and will help them to get there. If you show up to class and go to the help sessions, the material is within your grasp. I'm a theater major and I enjoyed this class.",
    "Great to learn about how some everyday things work!",
    "This is not the gut you are looking for, if you are in fact looking for a gut. If you have basic math skills, and are willing to put in some work, this could be the science\/QR you need to graduate.",
    "It was pretty much what I expected. It's not very easy, but it is doable if you go to lecture and take notes and study for tests. The material is mostly straightforward and some of it was pretty interesting.",
    "Not a gut. Interesting material but not very engaging.",
    "I recommend this class - I looked forward to going every day. It was well taught, and there were lots of resources to get help from. In terms of workload, there's a reasonable weekly pset, 2 in class midterms, and 1 final. For each, we were allowed to bring in 2 sheets of papers with notes on them, which was very helpful.",
    "By far the best class I took this past semester. This class is a survey of various everyday technologies and explains the science behind them (aka, how they work). In addition to providing me with a solid foundation in Physics (electricity and magnetism), this class showed me how these basic concepts are manifested through everyday technologies. From iPhones to the Internet, from GPS to CAT scans, this class was so interesting and applicable to everyday life, and I would highly recommend this class to anyone.",
    "Great!",
    "Not a gut.",
    "A great course for non-STEM majors, but realize that it is NOT a gut. you have to work hard to understand and disentangle the concepts, especially if you have little experience with STEM."
