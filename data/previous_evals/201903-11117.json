    "In-depth survey of 20th & 21st century scholarship concerning the 12th century. Discussion of cultural shifts in the academy (and in the outside world) which influenced historical scholarship about the Middle Ages. A very useful course for any graduate student of the Middle Ages",
    "I have learned quite a lot about how to approach writing history. The class allowed me considerable time to think about historiography and the manners in which the discipline of history has changed in the past hundred years.",
    "Learned a lot about major debates and trends in the scholarship on the 12th century etc."

   "comments": [
    "Can't claim any real weaknesses. I could have imagined different readings a few of the weeks but nothing was too repetitive",
    "I believe that, given that this is a historiography class and not one on the actual events of the twelfth century, the amount of reading is a bit too large for one to deeply engage with it. The class's strength is Prof. Freedman, whom you are able to get to know through taking the class.",
    "Course is valuable in terms of familiarizing students with important bibliography for the high middle ages. Suffers a little bit from a \"ground hog day\" effect, wherein we're basically reading about the same events over and over again, but I'm not really sure that can be avoided."
