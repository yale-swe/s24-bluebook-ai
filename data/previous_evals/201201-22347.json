   "comments": [
    "Tough if you are not a Bio major. LOTS of memorization, so be ready to put in the time for the three exams.",
    "Great class! The lectures are very interesting - I always looked forward to them! The only homework is reading, which you don't need to do. The textbook is more of a reference book - it's a good resource when you want to look something up, but it's not something you would sit down and read. The tests are straightforward. If you know the material, you'll do well. But, there is a lot of material to memorize. You have to know many plant families for the tests. It was sad that I had to learn so many different families and then only small portions of the tests asked about families. The EOL assignment is not too bad.",
    "a course that will teach you about plant morphology, defense& communication mechanisms, identifications of plant families, and the diversification of (mostly) angiosperms.yes, do take it if you have any inclination to, you'll have a blast, and you'll never look at any plant in the same way again.",
    "The class consists of two parts: phylogenies and concepts. The phylogenetic part (the majority of the class) explores the various clades (orders, families, etc.) of plants and their unique characters. In alternating weeks, Wendy explains some concept that applies to the plant world at large (carnivory, defense, pollination, etc.). Everything comes together to deliver the student one large picture of the evolution of plants from a single common ancestor to the speciose kingdom we have today.I would definitely recommend Plants to another student because I had so much fun in the class and looked forward to it every week.",
    "Ecology& Evolutionary Biology 246 is a great experience and provides students with a lot of really interesting information that is incredibly applicable to the world around us. That said, the class requires a lot of studying and a lot of memorization, which would make me inclined to say this is nota class for the botanically faint of heart. If you already have some form of an appreciation for Yale horticulture, take this course!",
    "Lots of memorization, but an interesting class. Take it if you have a lot of time to devote to studying plant families!",
    "Take it! This is a really fun class - a lot of memorization, but pretty straightforward in terms of material. It really changed my perspective on what's around me. I can no longer walk around campus without stopping to look at leaf margins and petal arrangement. Our class came together and turned into a little cult of people obsessed with plants. Wendy Clement was our fearless leader, fielding every question with grace and ease. I added this class to my schedule at the last minute because I didn't get into basic drawing and haven't regretted it for a second.",
    "Yes, it's a great class if you want to learn a ton about the diversity of plants. Wendy is a wonderful lecturer and I looked forward to this class more than any of my others. It does required a lot of studying to do well on the exams, though, and I'd really recommend studying all the botanical vocabulary you'll be exposed to because so much of it will be unfamiliar.",
    "really good introduction to plants and botany. lots of terminology to learn, and most of the time spent studying for this class was spent memorizing plant family characters. in-class time is really compelling because the professor does focus on fascinating individual plants and their \"powers\" (victorian water lily, durian, venus fly traps, figs), which is the most interesting, as well as plant mechanisms in general (defense, carnivory, etc.). the class has a project and 3 tests, (mostly)not cumulative, which is fortunate since the material is pretty hard to get under your belt. recommended, but not an easy class, and harder than other similar bio classes taken if only because botany is more pedantic and more alien to us",
    "Not a super easy course, but definitely very interesting and worthwhile. I would recommend it 100% to anyone at least somewhat interested in learning more in depth about some aspect of biology."
