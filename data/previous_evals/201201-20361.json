    "French 943 gave a broad overview of Creole Literature beginning with the establishment of the colony of Saint-Domingue by the French, and ending with contemporary authors. Readings included a mix of history and literature.I would recommend the course to others. I enjoyed the discussions and I thought Professor Miller gave useful feedback. I really learned a lot.",
    "Absolutely I would recommend it. It's a great introduction to (post)colonial studies and easily accessible to a student of any discipline.",
    "I would definitely recommend it.",
    "I would recommend French 943 Creole Identities and Fictions to fellow students because it is a superb blend of literature and history. Students walk into the course most often knowing very little about cr\u00e9olit\u00e9, and walk out of the course with a solid grasp of some of the principal works of literature in the tradition and a knowledge of the history of the former French colonies and slave trade in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean."

   "comments": [
    "We were introduced to a lot of sources, a lot of authors, historians, scholars, methodologies, etc. It was a broad overview that didn't sacrifice depth. In my opinion, it was a great model for how I would like to run an advanced seminar someday. I'm not sure that I will end up working on the subject for my dissertation, but it definitely encouraged me to pursue colonial and post-colonial studies more generally. And I will definitely apply the methodology I used in my final paper and the feedback I got to my dissertation."
