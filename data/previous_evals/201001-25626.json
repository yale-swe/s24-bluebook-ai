    "The biggest lesson I learnt from this class is that there is no perfect way of evaluating and studying Environment and Development issues since it is so complex and a lot of different criteria need to be looked at.I hope in the future, the class can offer more insights into how things can be done and, if there are the lack of accuracy and considerations in some of the projects and programs, how can we improve them? are there any more good and successful examples on dealing with those complex issues? Or we can just only remain skeptical forever?!",
    "Doug was extremely responsive to the students, and the class was a good balance of lecture and discussion (although it started too high on the discussion side). Doug did a great job of keeping the discussion flowing between students of fairly diverse academic backgrounds at a reasonably high level.The class projects were well thought out and helped me to better understand the material. Overall, this was one of the best classes I've taken at FES.",
    "This was basically an economics class. But the Professor was avoiding math and econometrics. I understand this because most of the students at FES are not comfortable with econometrics. The class turned out to be too theoretical. May be econometrics and microeconomics should be a prerequisite for this class.",
    "Great background on development economics - might be repetitive for someone who already has an extensive grounding in the material but I found it to be a really enjoyable survey course. Class discussion was probably the best part. Prof. Gollin and Ali were both great and very responsive to students' questions and requests for additional input.",
    "Professor Gollin is a great teacher. One distinctive advantage of his style is that he often asks a question and allows everyone who has something to say to make their comment, which reveals that as a whole we already know the answers. He is also extremely responsive to student questions. The issues discussed were very interesting. Ali was very nice and helpful when approached for help, but he wasn't too involved with interacting with the other students. While Professor Gollin's streamlined slides were effective, maybe some other media would be nice - eg. more guest lectures, field trips, video clips, etc.",
    "This is an excellent class. Very relevant and practical",
    "This was probably one of the most useful and enjoyable classes I've taken at FES. Prof. Gollin is an excellent professor and the subject matter is broad and applicable to much of mine and other students' work.",
    "I really liked the assignments. Final exam was very difficult."

    "Be exposed to different approaches and practice some things in the assignments.",

    "the problem sets and readings",
    "Professor Doug Gollin approaches economic development from an inquisitive point of view. I enjoyed his style of teaching and openness about literature and debates in the field. I also appreciated the time and support he offered to students.",
    "The breadth of material covered was impressive. The course was taught at a level beneficial to people with a heavy economic background and without a heavy economic background. The professor was excellent - perhaps the best I've had thus far at FES.",
    "The pace of the course and the readings. Professor Gollin did an excellent job facilitating class discussion, introducing topics, and having students be responsible for learning the material.",
    "The intervention project! Save the poor people, tell them what to do! bad, bad..."

   "comments": [
    "Offer more solution and positive examples.",
    "Early one, I thought Doug allowed too much discussion, although this balanced out over the course of the term.Having the reading list further in advance would also have been nice, but wasn't a problem for me.",
    "More structured and organized schedule and assignments.",
    "The problem sets weren't very related to the class work.Also, the final exam was really time consuming, and didn't do a great job of testing our knowledge. The first half of the exam, where we summarized two papers, could be done by anyone, whether they were in the class or not.",
    "The Professor should allow in class discussions but he should be on top of it. We spent a lot of time discussing among ourselves, leaving no enough time for the professor. And as I mentioned earlier, most of the class members have no background in economics. Being too democratic may not help in some situations.",
    "It would have been nice to have had better discussions in class, though I realize with the number of students, it would have been difficult.",
    "I did enjoy the assignments (as far as assignments go anyway :) ), but I think they will get a little smoother with time. There were some kinks in the formatting and procedure, especially on the first one. Likewise for syllabus and readings - it would be nice to have a schedule planned out - at least roughly - from the start. All of the changes got hard to keep track of.",
    "While the lectures are very interesting, it would be interesting if there was more discussion that was not so much about the papers that we read. Nevertheless its great.",
    "Being a broad overview of many of the the important concepts and debates in international development and environment, it is sometime difficult to explore issues in-depth. That being said, the course serves its purpose well by providing a broad range of ideas and a wide sampling of important literature on the topics.",
    "I don't see any significant areas of improvement for the class.",
    "It would be nice to have a little bit more help outside of the class to learn about the econometric techniques. Just a bit so we can understand it from the papers.",
    "Better preparation for the final exam. Make sure people know what to expect early on in the semester."

    "Despite the good work of the instructor, I don't really learn much from the class mainly because it is quite general and a lot of problems we touched upon I already know but I do not really come away from the class knowing the solutions since we have been mostly focusing on what have been done and what are wrong.",
    "As someone interested in natural resource management, development projects obviously play a large role in the field. The course helps you to better understand the strength and weaknesses of the various development paradigms that are commonly proposed. Understanding the assumptions behind each are important in knowing how to deal with proponents and critics.",
    "1. The prerequisite for the course should be econometrics and micro- and macro-economics.2. The TA should come from the econ department. Someone with enough economics training.3. The 8-hours open book final exam sucks. It's not a good idea at all.",
    "I am focusing my studies on natural resource economics and the implications in international development so this course fit perfectly into my program.",
    "I'm not an economist by any means but it's important to get some idea of econ for any environmental management course. I think this was a good survey course that introduced some helpful ideas and sparked some good dialogue on a lot of topics that we could have touched on in much more depth if we had more time - but seeing as we didn't it was a good intro to these ideas.",
    "This is a very pertinent class for those of us interested in policy analysis and design. I think it would be very helpful if there was a prerequisite that people had a statistics background.",
    "The course is an important addition to my degree program, providing a broad introduction to many of the ideas surrounding economic development and environmental issues in developing countries.",

Of course, get started early on the assignments as you will get a lot out of them if you put in the time.
