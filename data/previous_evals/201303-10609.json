   "comments": [
    "If you want to take French sure take it, otherwise its a good bit of work",
    "Reading of short stories and two longer novels. What I love about this course is that you don't focus on the minutiae of each text, but rather the central themes.",
    "I would recommend this class because it is a good way to practice french conversation, read french stories, as well as review grammar.",
    "French 140 is almost exactly the same as French 130. You are likely either taking this class for the language requirement or because you are interested in higher level French courses. Either way this class is satisfactory. If you managed in 130 you will be fine in 140.",
    "I would definitely recommend French 140 to another student, especially with Professor Koundi. I learned so much french this semester (especially grammar), and the workload isn't that bad. The tests and final were all pretty easy. Also, Professor Koundi is a wonderful teacher who really cares about her students."
