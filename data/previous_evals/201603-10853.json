    "learned how to read in french, reviewed grammar and sentence structure",
    "Although I had no experience reading French before this semester, I made considerable progress. I am impressed by how much I was able to learn in this course.",
    "Developed streamlined strategies for reading documents in my area of study, as well as learnt the basic foundations of verb constructions and prepositions. I felt far more comfortable reading academic texts in French at the end of the course, not least because of the translation works and the constant exercises every week.",
    "The course was instrumental at significanlty increasing my ability to read texts in French, in my field and outside of it. It also improved my understanding of how French works as a language."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "this course moves very quickly, so i could imagine those with no french background might struggle. however, the fast paced nature of the course allowed us to cover all language tenses and review most of the basics to be able to read so that the only thing left to do was remember them",
    "The homework and the textbook were great, but I wish we had spent class time slightly differently. I wish we had focused on verbs and grammar more.",
    "The course is structured for those with little reading knowledge of French. In that sense, it is strongest for students with zero prior knowledge of French or latin languages. It was most helpful in how it helped me familiarize myself with verb tenses for reading.",
    "I was very satisfied with the course, including the assignments and do not have any suggestions for improving it. It was a heavy workload, but the payoff was very much worth it from my perspective."

    "yes, in addition to helping those graduate students needing to pass language exams, this course is helpful for students with some french background who want to review.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in making considerable progress in their ability to read French.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to others seeking to quickly grasp a solid foundation for translation.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for any graduate student preparing to pass the French language requirement, or in need of imporving, in a relatively short time, their readings skills in French."
