    "It's an interesting class if you like words. But the problem set and the NEWJ assignment can be very repetitive.",
    "A good course. You learn a lot about the English language, including things you never noticed\/realized. You also learn to notice and listen to English better, and to connect the history of the words together.As a science major, I took this as a HU credit, and do not regret it at ALL. You get to learn the phonetic alphabet, the midterm was manageable, and there is a take home final and no paper, just a really fun journal of new words you keep from the start.If you are at all interested, shop it and see.",
    "I would recommend taking Linguistics 108 Credit\/D\/Fail. It's interesting at first, and then you can change it if you want to. The problem sets can be tedious, but Professor Horn is really nice and funny. He's also brilliant and knows so much about words. I think I learned a lot about the history of the English language, but I wish that the class had been more about recent changes to the language rather than changes from the Proto-Indo-European roots of words.",
    "It's interesting sometimes but overall it's very boring. It's also not easy because everything is graded out of very few points. You need to really love linguistics to like this class.",
    "This is a great course if you are looking for a basic introduction to linguistics that is less formal than the Intro to Linguistics course. The problem sets are fun because they are like puzzles that you need to figure out. I feel like I learned a lot in this class, albeit mostly great cocktail trivia. Also, like any other course, the amount you learn scales directly with the amount of time you put into it.",
    "Great introduction to the workings of English. Good balance of history, etymology, morphology, phonetics, and semantics. I would absolutely recommend it.",
    "Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. A must take!!!!!!Have a passion for spelling? Love word origins? Have all your Latin roots memorized? Know what Proto Indo-European refers to?ME NEITHER!This class was beyond amazing. You will learn how words change, where, how and why we get new words, why English spelling is so messed up, etc.In some ways this class was like taking a foreign language, but without the endless memorization, b\/c you already know the langaugeThe first half is a little stronger than the the second half. Lectures were a bit stronger in the beginning. Subject matter ran hot and cold for the second half. But these are very harsh criticisms. This was the best class that I have taken at Yale!",
    "This is a pretty chill linguistics class. I took this second semester of my senior year and I found the work for this class to be bearable and quite enjoyable. Work consisted greatly of researching the origins of words and then answering questions based on your findings. Pretty standard, I guess.This class goes over the different vocal sounds and you learn how to write in IPA (or your pronunciation alphabet of choice), but we didn't talk about any of the anatomical features of linguistics or some more traditional terms. We did cover topics such as consonant shifts and the Great English vowel shift which pertained specifically to English and its preceding languages.This class is very much about changes in the English language. I think most people who took this class emerged with a different perspective of what is \"right\" or \"wrong\" in language. The class was definitely worth it as a cultural experience as well.",
    "This is a very fun and interesting class, especially if you're interested in linguistics but don't want to deal with all those foreign phonemes. I learned a lot about words in general as well as specific words in English, and it gave me a new perspective on language and vocabulary. It also taught me a lot about how to do quick research on the internet and how to spot dubious etymologies. I would encourage you to take it; the workload is manageable, and going to class actually felt worthwhile.",
    "Linguistics 108 is great for anyone who wants to learn about etymology and loves finding those interesting tidbits about what a word actually stems from. However, be wary about the problem sets, as if you have no patience for researching etymological histories, then this is not the class for you.",
    "I would absolutely recommend it. The workload is very reasonable, and many of the exercises (espcially the English words journal) will change the way you think about the English language, and the way you listen to your friends speak. I learned a lot, and sincerely enjoyed the process. Take this class!",
    "Take this class. If you're at all interested in why English is as weird as it is, which you must be, this is the perfect class to answer all your burning questions (and more!). This is also not an overwhelming class in terms of workload, with weekly problem sets, a straightforward midterm and take-home final, and a brilliantly fun project. You will learn tons of new information and understanding about English and linguistics in general each week. You will never think about words the same way again.",
    "Material is somewhat interesting. Lectures are pretty dry. The problem sets are brutally tedious but not difficult.",
    "YES! Lot's of fun and learned a lot",
    "The Structure and History of English Words is amongst the worst class I have ever taken at Yale. The lectures were excruciatingly boring, the problems painfully tedious, and the other assignments insufferable (in addition to being extremely unclear as to what would be expected in order to receive full credit). During shopping period and even for a week or two after, the class gave the fa\u00e7ade of being interesting, but the interesting aspects of the class quickly disintegrated into boring discussions and nonsensical descriptions of the English language, sometimes either seemingly fictitious or based only loosely on fact. The title of the course is rather deceptive; the history of English words is covered only in one or two lectures and the structure of words in three or four lectures. The rest of the course dealt with odds and ends descriptions of the English language as a whole. My main motivations for taking this class were that I wanted to use it for a humanities credit and that it sounded interesting. This course should be stripped of its classification as fulfilling the humanities distributional requirement; there are many exciting and interesting classes at Yale that qualify for the humanities credit which actually deal with topics related to humanities, this class is not one of them. Overall, this class is an embarrassment to the state of education at Yale. It was obvious that Professor Horn was really enthusiastic about the material given his high level of knowledge and the effort demonstrated in creating elaborate handouts; however, the sloppy order in which the curriculum was presented is quite troublesome and partially mitigates this enthusiasm especially when one is trying to follow one of Professor Horn\u0092s lectures. In my opinion, the linguistics department has two possible solutions to improve this class. The first solution is to make it a seminar or advanced lecture for undergraduates majoring in linguistics since a large number of students in the class appear to have been linguistics majors. The second solution would be to run two classes which cover the same basic material, but at different levels of depth: one course for majors, one for nonmajors. I recommend this class if and only if one truly thinks s\/he is passionate about the material, not simply to fulfill the humanities credit, nor to use this course as an elective credit. Even though I likely did well in the course, I would only with great reservation recommend this course to my peers and I do truly regret taking this class and not taking advantage of Yale\u0092s other options, which in hindsight are likely a lot more appealing. Linguistics 108 needs to undergo a major transformation to make it a better class for students when offered again in the future.",
    "Linguistics 108 is a good course and is a great introduction to the structure and history of English Words, focusing mainly on the aspects of morphological and semantic change. Problem sets do take a fair amount of time, but they are fair and actually sort of fun and interesting. The NEWJ and take home final are also interesting ways to learn the material.",
    "Linguistics 108 is a course that basically covers the changes that have occurred in the English language since its origin. I would recommend the class if you are looking for a Humanities credit, but without all of the reading. Problem sets generally involved looking up and analyzing the etymologies of words. Problem sets generally took about 4-5 hours, and there is one each week. They became tedious, but were generally interesting. However, class got boring about halfway through the semester. Also, I would suggest going to section.",
    "Weekly problem sets, not overly difficult but can be tricky and more time consuming than they seem. Lecture isn't necessary but is entertaining and worthwile. I would recommend it",
    "If you like words, or the history of English, or discovering interesting etymologies -- or even if none of those things interest you -- I highly recommend this class. Professor Horn is engaged and engaging. Everything he says is interesting. The material is fascinating, and I've left this class having learned a great deal. This was the best class I took my freshman year, and after having taken this I am almost certainly going to be a linguistics major. Again: highly recommended.",
    "This class is FANTASTIC. The material is absolutely fascinating, and Prof. Horn makes it really accessible for those who have never taken a linguistics course. If you do the readings and attend lecture, you'll leave the course with a whole new appreciation and understanding of the English language. If you're interested in the English language, or even language in general, I'd really recommend this class. The problem sets are tediously repetitive, but at least they're not difficult, and you actually learn from doing them.",
    "If you like words, fun facts about words, or etymology this is the class for you. It's designed to be accessible by non-linguistics majors, so nothing here will be out of your reach. The class is extremely interesting and well taught. The workload is not bad at all, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "This class is so much fun! If you're looking to dabble in linguistics but aren't an expert, this is a great class to get a taste. You'll learn a ton about English and language change in general. The problem sets are really interesting and fun; I actually enjoyed doing the take-home final! Then again, I'm a huge word nerd.",
    "Really easy credit, especially if you have any background in linguistics. And the subject matter is pretty interesting.",
    "This is a class about etymology. It's a lot of working on the internet, and is certainly not hard. Great fifth class.",
    "Whether you're interested in Linguistics or not, whether English is your first language or not, you'll probably find Structure and History of English Words an interesting course. The course is a combined discussion of language, history, and culture, and you may find, as I did, that what you learn in LING 108 helps you understand what you're learning in one (or more) of your other courses. You'll have fun listening to Professor Horn in lecture -- he has a great sense of humor and not only a deep understanding of the subject, but also a deep appreciation for it, which motivated me to really get inside the concepts he introduced us to. Do keep up with the reading: it's meant to prepare you to do problem sets, but it's also just a fun set of pieces on language. I highly recommend LING 108.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The material is really interesting and fun, and the lectures present it well. I learned lots of neat new facts. The workload isn't too bad, but some of the work has fiddly details that can be annoying. Prepare to become very familiar with the online OED.",
    "I would recommend it. It's fun, not too much work, and enriched my understanding of the English language, allowing me to make phonetics jokes with my friends.",
    "Linguistics 108, a.k.a. SHEW, should be taken only if you are really interested in learning the history and structural analysis of words. For instance, I think knowing the Indo-European roots of different words and doing phonetic transcriptions are really interesting. But if that's not your cup of tea, you will find this class very boring. On top of that, it's actually not a gut class. The weekly problem sets are long and tedious, with some of them being quite difficult. The New English Word Journal project, in which you have to collect and write entries for 35 new words, is also a lot of work (especially if you do it all at once)."
