   "comments": [
    "A lot of insight into some of the historical factors behind partisanship, and the role of finance and other resources in politics. An survey course but one that's interesting and engaging.",
    "This course is essentially a more in-depth version of the electoral parts of AP Gov, but with a lot more focus on voters and voter behavior rather than on the institutional things that allow campaigns & elections to happen. Lots of discussion about graphs and data pertaining to voting patterns\/public opinion. Learned more about political science as a field & its history than I was really aware of before, which was pretty interesting.",
    "It was neat to see an experimental\/scientific approach to Campaigns. Prof. Gooch did a great job of tying in his research and research in the field to current happenings in elections. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the incumbency advantage.",
    "A lot of knowledge about the process of running and campaign and the strategizing necessary to be successful.",
    "Campaigns & Elections provided me with a very firm grasp of the election process, both at the congressional and presidential levels. Professor Gooch really tries to focus on recent developments as well which makes the class more interesting in my opinion. The campaign strategy assignment really helped me synthesize the material. Taking the course really allows you to follow current events and the news at a much deeper level.",
    "I learned a lot about data: how to use it, when it is good, and how it can be manipulated. Further, I think I gained some really key insights and a better understanding of the American Electorate. I loved going to this class every day (even if it was at 900 am)",
    "Great",
    "I learned valuable information about how campaigns work, how to analyze districts, and how to gather data for campaign studies.",
    "Main topics include: Presidential election campaign history, dynamics, strategies, and finance laws 2016 presidential election (primaries, campaign dynamics, general election; subject to change since this class was soon after the election) The general history of congressional elections Data in political science and campaigns",
    "I developed the ability to better interpret graphs and information about elections and demographics in a constituency.",
    "Professor Gooch taught us a wide-ranging set of materials with regards to elections including the key factors in Presidential elections, House and Senate races, the methodology behind polling, campaign finance, and the specific variables that applied to the 2016 election. We also covered various special elections and looked at how historical results, polling, candidacy valency, etc affected turnout.",
    "This course taught us about what goes into a campaign, from techniques to theories, historical examples. We covered various topic such as the nomination process, the general election (including the 2016 election in detail), campaign strategy, finance, and other issues. It turns out that economy and the popularity of the president or incumbent is the main determinant of electoral outcome. This class covered everything from local to congressional, to presidential campaigns.",
    "Ability to understand complex Aspects of elections",
    "I learned about the general statistical trends of recent presidential and congressional elections, as well as some of the techniques campaigns use to woo voters.",
    "In this class, I learned about the basic concepts of elections and campaign work in America. I also read informative books on the general information of elections as well as the 2016 presidential election. I also learned how to write a campaign strategy plan for an actual 2018 congressional midterm election candidate.",
    "I gained a lot of understanding on how presidential and congressional elections work, as well as the current political science scholarship on these areas. American Campaigns & Elections was much more than a basic introduction to American Politics; instead, Professor Gooch really broadened our understanding of elections and debunked a lot of myths people have about how American politics work. Professor Gooch was really up-to-date on all of the latest political science research, which was awesome to learn about. I also enjoyed learning about the type of research he does, and I think it will influence my thesis topic as a Political Science major."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The range of material and use of statistical sources made the course very interesting, but I felt that sometimes Professor Gooch rushed through the material in class and then finished class half an hour early?",
    "Strengths: Professor was really interested in & nerdy about the material which made the class a lot more enjoyable, lecture was fueled by student questions & engagement, we got out of class early quite often (which was nice because the class was at 9am and I usually didn't wake up early enough to eat breakfast beforehand), campaign strategy memo was a nifty little assignment, not a heavy workload, and Andrew Gooch is a funny guy. (I'm still not really sure whether or not he tries to be.) Weaknesses: Could have focused a LOT less on 2016 -- it felt like the lectures got pretty redundant toward the end of the class, especially since we were listening to info that many of us had already been exposed to during the actual campaign\/election season in 2016.",
    "Organization is a big weakness of the course. I was initially excited for weekly warmups with campaign mythbusters or recaps of famous campaigns. I would have enjoyed that and it unfortunately did not come to fruition. The campaign strategy assignment could have had some more guidance. A strength of the course was the depth of knowledge Prof. Gooch possess and his willingness to be assessable. I have full confidence that with time Prof. Gooch will give an amazing version of this course.",
    "Content was clear and concise.",
    "A definite strength of the course is its emphasis on recent elections and trends (particularly the 2016 election). Another strength was the campaign strategy assignment, which was one of the more fun assignments I have undertaken at Yale and really forced me to immerse myself in the current state of politics. Perhaps the material for the last few weeks of the course could be modified slightly to perhaps cover a few more topics.",
    "I think the strength's were definitely Prof Gooch's knowledge and experience. He has a wealth of information. Further, I think the way we kind of mixed a lecture and discussion was fantastic. The only weakness I'd say was occasionally the material repeated, and I would have preferred more projects like the campaign strategy instead of the mid term and final.",
    "Great",
    "The strengths of the course is the content and Professor, and honestly, the only weaknesses were the time and location.",
    "This course was honestly really enjoyable. Not a lot of people showed up to class, but the Professor was so chill and it was honestly really engaging material. Lectures could have been a little better organized (lecture pretty much always ran short), but it honestly wasn't a huge problem. All in all, we focused on really engaging material. I was a little disappointed with how much focus was given to the 2016 election, since I was expecting more general explication of campaign and election dynamics, but it was good to get a better understanding on how 2016 was similar and different to other elections.",
    "The readings and lectures are repetitive, so more varying the content between the two would be helpful. I also feel like we spent too much time covering the 2016 election. At least half the course was dedicated to that one election, when there are plenty of other equally relevant years we could have examined.",
    "The course was well organized, with a solid reading and writing component. I really enjoyed the ability to access both major texts written on the subject material and the shorter articles and newly released works that made the subject material especially timely. The Campaign Strategy memo was another really cool component of the course and allowed us to apply the readings and lectures to specific case studies. Course weaknesses: I do wish that it had not been at 9am on a Monday and Friday though!",
    "There are many strength of the course, including the quality of the instructor and the way he approaches teaching in a fun, chill, but educational and engaging way. Even though it was a lecture, he engaged with the students and led small discussions. The class itself covered readings, etc. that was both informing and interesting. One aspect that can be improved was the timing; a Monday and Friday class at 9 AM is kind of tough.",
    "One strength of the class was the engaging lectures from Professor Gooch. Each lecture provided interesting information about elections and campaigns that you would not find on the news. Although this was a lecture course, the class size was fairly small. Professor Gooch also made time to allow students to ask questions about the course material, either for clarification or for just genuine curiosity for the lecture topic. The only improvement I could think of for the class is the move the class time from the inconvenient times of Mondays and Fridays from 9 am to 10:15 am to encourage more students to take the class.",
    "Strengths: Professor Gooch's lectures were interesting and accessible. He would really take the time to answer our questions, and I felt like the class was a very welcoming environment in which to ask questions."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes - not too hard, but still rewarding and informative.",
    "Yes. The course overall gave a solid background on elections, and the data we learned about the 2016 election and the upcoming 2018 midterms was particularly insightful.",
    "I've already recommended this course to a bunch of people. The workload is much lighter than any other course I've taken here (two very short quizzes, a midterm, a 3-4 page campaign strategy assignment, and a final that's the same length as the midterm but you get an extra hour to do it), and the lectures were usually pretty interesting, although not a lot of people went (he posted his very detailed PowerPoint slides on Canvas) -- but I think the smaller class size made them more discussion-based than a regular leminar, which I think ended up being a strength of the class for those who found it in them to get out of bed and drag themselves to Luce by 9am. The reading, at least this semester (not sure if he's going to change it moving forward), is somewhat interesting if you do it, but also pretty much unnecessary if you go to lecture.",
    "It really depends what you want to get out of this course. If you are looking for a lot of knowledge on the 2016 election and a rigorous background in research methods, this is the course for you. As for a more general introduction to the mechanics of how campaigns are run and communicate with voters, this may not be the course.",
    "Yes, very informative and practical.",
    "If you're looking for a better understanding of American elections or would like to better understand how Donald Trump was elected president, I would highly recommend this class. It is quite enjoyable and informative while not being taxing workload wise. It's an interesting class that isn't too stressful.",
    "Yes! Important material, cool professor. My one suggestion is to learn Professor Gooch's teaching style and expectations for his students as early in the semester as possible. For instance, I had to transition from focusing on studying concepts abstractly to memorizing very strict definitions. Professor Gooch was helpful with his feedback, but it was still a bit jarring to be expected to output information in that specific way. Also, when he says be brief and concise is your essays, he means it.",
    "Yes. Anyone interested in Politics will love this course. Further, Prof Gooch knows so much cool stuff, he will completely change the way you look at data and elections.",
    "Great",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because of the depth of knowledge on gains about general campaigns and how they have changed over the years.",
    "I would definitely recommend this as a fifth class, since it wasn't too much work but was definitely engaging. For me, this was the perfect class because I feel like I learned a lot (and the readings were fascinating) but it wasn't that much work.",
    "I would recommend this course as an introduction to political science and elections in general.",
    "Absolutely. Great class. Accessible material and engaged lecturer. Go to Office Hours!",
    "I would most definitely recommend this class! If you're interested in how Hillary lost to Trump, or why Bernie was so popular, this is the class for you! I honestly wish there were more classes that taught *actual* election theory and techniques like this one did. Prof. Gooch is super helpful and approachable and it is genuinely a good class. I'd recommend it to all, including non-poli sci students as well.",
    "I definitely would! Even though the class was very interesting, the workload is not very large so it would not overwhelm you. This was honestly the most straightforward class I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student! You don't have to be a Political Science major to take it and enjoy it. I think lots of people will appreciate learning about the nuances of American elections."
