   "comments": [
    "It's really more of a philosophy class so it's pretty crucial to have some Phil background. It's a pretty laid-back seminar and the work is very manageable, but it's not for people who are looking for actual applications of philosophy to clinical psychology.",
    "Philosophy for Psychologists is not a class for psychologists hoping to dabble in philosophy, but for the experienced CogSci-minded student who is interested in philosophy of mind and more generally the big questions that are found in cognitive science today. Aaron is an excellent discussion leader and attentive. I recommend this class particularly for those who are thinking of pursuing a senior project in cognitive science, philosophy, or psychology that has a component of philosophy of mind. There are weekly reading responses and the option of two papers or one longer final paper.",
    "It is what the title says it is. Almost entirely philosophy readings in philosophy of mind. I guess this might be what a phil of mind course would be like (I gather it hasn't been taught at Yale in a while), so if that's your thing, this is your thing. This course went a little off the deep-end early (Tyler Burge, 2010) and then recovered. I suspect that if it's taught again it won't be as much of a problem, but we seemed to suffer a large week-two attrition. As this was his first time running a course and it'll likely be very different to what it was this time, I imagine that if he teaches it again, you'll be better off shopping the first class than reading these reviews. Norby is somewhat hands-off in conducting discussions, but if you've taken a seminar before, you'll know that's not necessarily a bad thing and he won't hesitate to jump in where necessary (it can be better than those professors who run a seminar like a mini-lecture).",
    "There were somewhat high expectations for this class based on the facts that Aaron was the PhD student of Tamar Gendler, whose work and teaching is admirable and interesting, and that it was to cover topics in the intersection of philosophy and psychology, which is rare. Our study of cognitive science was fascinating and deep, but perhaps too dense. Aaron gave us very helpful reading guides starting mid-semester, which was a big improvement upon basically bringing our confusions to class and not discussing much. I think what this class needed was more proactive guidance from the professor, since it was pretty easy to be passive. Aaron has potential as a professor, and this class evinced his development, but it was hard for upperclassmen and grad students to feel like they were part of the growth process rather than benefitting from the fruits. Overall, interesting material (though sometimes too much or too dense) and room for more engagement on students' parts both with the material and with each other.",
