   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in taking a step back and really thinking about the novel as the form which has come to dominate the literary scene. It is a great excuse to read some very important works (Tristram Shandy, Jacques le Fataliste, Lazarillo) while thinking about how the genre comes into being and what its true antecedents are. You will always learn a lot from a Trumpener course because she gives you so much in class. The secondary readings were well-chosen and usefully summarised in class, and at the end of the course you really do feel that you do have a deeper understanding and finer appreciation of the novel as both form and genre.",
    "This course took several texts as case studies\/examples of developments in prose fiction from the early modern picaresque to the doorstep of nineteenth-century realism. Pan-European (indeed, global) in scope, the course nonetheless focused primarily on French and English texts of the 18th century. As an introduction to the pleasures and challenges of the study of the rise of the novel, this seminar was profoundly helpful. I would recommend it to any student of prose fiction.",
    "Would recommend very, very highly!",
    "Swift, sweeping analysis of the European literature from the 17th-19th centuries. I would absolutely urge students to take this course."

   "comments": [
    "As a student of literary modernism, this course was especially helpful both for giving a sense of the literary history that twentieth-century authors pushed back against, and for showing the strangeness of pre-nineteenth century fiction that very well may have served as the inspiration for modernist literary experimentations.",
    "As the subject matter of the course was way outside of my area of specialty, this course did a ton in terms of broadening my literary horizons. Very much appreciated."
