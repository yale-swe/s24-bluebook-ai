    "An excellent course.",
    "i thought it was pretty interesting, but it seemed a bit rushed. Workload isn't too bad, and it's great that it only meets once a week.",
    "This is an AMAZING class that provides you with a lot of good information about the history of Italy, and you'll get a lot of good practice with both your written and spoken Italian. Prof.ssa Sodi is GREAT, and she really makes the material come alive, even though it can be pretty challenging\/complex at times. The history itself is very interesting, and the workload is manageable, plus there's an online discussion forum, which makes it fun to see what your classmates find most interesting about each week's reading.",
    "It's a great course for anyone interested in Italian history post-World War II. Be prepared for a lot of reading, and weekly reading responses and comments.",
    "Definitely recommended if you're looking to practice your writing and speaking skills. Fairly interesting a material and a good tool for understanding Italian society today and in the context of european politics.",
    "In this class you learn about Italian politics from 1945 to today. It is a confusing time period to learn about, but it will definitely enrich your understanding of modern Italy and Italian culture. It is a long seminar, but Professor Sodi is very knowledgeable and tries very hard to keep the students engaged. It is also a nice way to practice speaking, reading and writing Italian without committing to a class that meets 3 times per week.",
    "This was a very interesting course. It is a different experience to read an Italian history textbook but it allows you to get a great understanding of the country and how it felt about its history. Prof. Sodi is wonderful, and she keeps things interesting and engaging. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Italy, history, or Italian."
