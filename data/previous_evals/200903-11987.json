   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. I loved this course. The professor, T.A., and lectures were great and the work was manageable. I couldn't ask for more.",
    "This was an absolutely astounding course! This course was an eye-opener to the past, present, and future worlds of architecture. It was informative and fun and inspiring. I cannot wait to go to Rome and visit the monuments I have learned about. I recommend it to every student.",
    "I would summarize History of Art 252 as a truly excellent course taught by a truly excellent professor, and would recommend it on the basis of its interesting material and careful organization. The workload is very reasonable: two mid-term exams and one paper or project.",
    "This is a very interesting course that mixes architecture with history. If you are interested in either subject you will definitely enjoy this course - however, attention to detail is essential.",
    "I would if they were at all interested in Architecture or Rome!",
    "I would recommend this course. It doesn't have a heavy workload, and you are given a great understanding and appreciation of Roman architecture and history. Be prepared to do a lot of memorization though.",
    "It is a manageable class, although the online discussion board is a pain.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone. It is fascinating and a great way to learn about the Roman society and culture as well as the modern city. You also learn a great deal about modern architecture in this class. It is a truly fabulous course.",
    "Yes. There is really not much work. I did the reading until the first midterm, and since it didn't really helped me, I stopped and it didn't seem to matter. The design your own city project is a great alternative to the typical research paper. Memorization for midterms is a little tough, especially if you are not good with visual memorization, but it's not bad. If you actually manage to start prepping a week in advance you'll be in great shape for the final.... I just wouldn't leave it to the night before... take at least a couple full nights to study for it. Virtual section is a bit annoying and not really that enriching until the end of the course (i.e. after the 2nd midterm), I think, when you really have a good understanding of Roman architecture and can apply specific examples across the gamut of the discipline. Kleiner is definitely among the more fun, interesting, engaging and exciting lecturers that I've had, but a 9 a.m. class is still a 9 a.m. class.",
    "Definitely! If you are mildly interested in Architecture or Art History, this class will serve as a foundation to all your later explorations. And even if you mostly hang out on the hill, if you ever marveled at any Yale buildings, it's important to acquire the vocabularies and train the eyes so that you are more conscious and appreciative of the surrounding building environment. Besides, this class is fun - an option of the final project is to design a roman city. Where else (well, except in the architecture school) do you get to do that?",
    "It has two tests and one final paper. Going to class everyday is studying for the exams. This being my first art history class, I found it was a good introduction to memorizing facts and identification. You learn as you go and enjoy learning. The subject is interesting and you feel accomplished after the entirety of the course. I feel if I were to go to Rome I would have an advantage over other around me!",
    "Strongly recommend this class to anyone.",
    "This class is perfect for anyone who wants to get an in depth view of basic concepts in architecture and an artistic history of the Roman empire. Professor Kleiner did an amazing job of connecting the buildings we studied to the history of Rome and really managed to create a story that gave the slides context and importance. But at the end of the day, it truly is an art history class, so be prepared to identify materials and styles in each of the structures presented in class. Consists of two midterms with slide identification, comparison, short essay, and one essay\/project which requires A LOT of outside research.",
    "This is a great course! If you have any interest at all in roman architecture take this course. Professor Kleiner is awesome and very organized so you won't ever be confused about what is going on in the course. The toughest part is preparing for the two tests which require a lot of memorizing. But other than that its very reasonable.",
    "The course was great and lectures were available online. The teacher is very helpful and the class is rather small, which is nice.",
    "If you are at all interested in the history of arts or history of architecture, it is the best course to take.It is taught by a wonderful professor, who will inspire you on the further exploration of architecture. This course is great for those who have visited Rome or other Italian cities, or for those who are planning to visit them, because it examines in full detail the most prominent Roman monuments that are usually visited by tourists.",
    "I definitely would recommend this course. Its an early lecture that you shouldn't miss so that's a downside, but it is worth it if you find the material interesting. Kleiner is great and very engaging. The class has very little weekly work, but the midterms are rough to study for if you aren't taking it credit\/D",
    "Great class to take, but I would recommend taking a more basic intro class to architecture if you haven't before. The reading is absolutely not necessary, but if you want a good grade you have to study a LOT for the midterms. Lots of memorization.",
    "Roman Architecture is one of the BEST COURSES at Yale. Professor Kleiner is OUTSTANDING, the material is FASCINATING, the workload is MINIMAL--this is a GREAT CLASS.",
    "I would definitely take this. It's a great Art History class to take for non-majors. The subject matter is something that has relevance for everyone, since Roman architecture has influenced architecture in the US and elsewhere in the world. The class is very straightforward - there are no tricks or hidden gimmicks. If you come to lecture, and learn what's in the lectures, you will do well on the exams. The paper wasn't too much trouble, but if you are not an Architecture major or don't have enough time to fully commit to the assignment, beware of the \"Design a Roman city\" option. The \"online section\" is a little bit annoying but you only have to post four times, and that sure beats having actual section. Professor Kleiner is really nice and helpful. Finally, there are a lot of resources on the classesv2 site (including a \"Name that Monument\" activity that is helpful for exam studying), and all of the lectures are online because of Open Yale Courses (I would definitely still come to the lecture, but if you miss some material or need to clarify something, it's nice to have this as a reference when you're studying)",
    "Take it if you love architecture or roman stuff, otherwise... shop it and see.",
    "If you want to spend a semester with Roman architecture, go for it.",
    "Yes! This is a class where you're often wondering why you took it during the semester because of all the memorization. It was really cool afterwards though, when you see a monument that your roommate has in her pictures of Italy and can identify it.",
    "If you are at all interested in the subject it is a great course. If you do not enjoy looking at pictures and memorizing everything about them then do not take it.",
    "Roman Architecture is the best course I have taken here and is very much set up for you to succeed. The lectures -- now available through Open Yale Courses -- as well as the online course materials \u0096- set up unlike any other class I have taken -- are great study tools and amazing resources. The greatest strength, however, is Professor Kleiner, who is extremely enthusiastic and dedicated to the class and Roman architecture. She will take you back to Ancient Rome every day of class and make you feel like you are at the fantastic monuments, which range from the famous Pantheon and Colosseum to lesser known, but fascinating tombs and villas. Her lectures were great and consisted of many of her own photographs. Another great aspect of the course is its midterm project, which truly caters to the student. You can write an essay or create your own city based on what you learned like I did. It was a lot of fun! I was initially hesitant to take a history of art class with the heavy emphasis on memorization, but I enjoyed every second of Roman Architecture, found it intellectually stimulating, and highly recommend it.",
    "I liked this class a lot. It is very early in the morning, which meant I missed more than a few lectures. The good thing is that the lectures are online, and that was a lifesaver for reviewing those that I had missed. The postings on the classesv2 kinda suck, but whatevs.",
    "The class covers very interesting subject matter but the lectures can get quite monotonous. Don't be sleepy when you go to class!You really need to be able to provide your own motivation and interest in learning about Roman Architecture to enjoy this class. Also, Prof. Kleiner is very funny but you have to be in the right mood. If you can do this, you'll really enjoy the lectures.",
    "Highly recommend this class."
