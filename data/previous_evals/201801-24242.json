    "I am a better student for taking Medicine, Race, and the Slave Trade. I am more skilled at reading primary source material, better at analyzing secondary literature, and my academic prose have greatly improved.",
    "the history of medicine in reference to the transatlantic slave trade. critical thinking, and displacing ourselves through time and through many lenses.",
    "In terms of hard knowledge, I learned about a whole world within the slave trade with which I'd never previously been acquainted. In terms of less-hard knowledge, I learned how to force myself to write good, thick history and to not let the words escape the page. Professor Roberts' feedback has helped me attune myself to what I need to be extra attentive to in my writing going forward.",
    "What an amazing class. I learned so much about the transatlantic slave trade and how it was foundational to so many modern structures such as pharmaceuticals, the doctor-patient relationship, and etc.",
    "Understanding that an ideology is a product of its time is not the same as thinking things should not be better.",
    "I learned so much from reading, researching, and discussing histories of the slave trade, race, and medicine in the Atlantic world in a way that did not treat them as parallel histories but rather all connected to one another.",
    "I have a much greater understanding of historical medicalization of race, including the construction of physical differences in the European mind, as well as the racial and political theories that had stakes in the slave trade.",
    "I learned about how modern medicine shaped, and was shaped by, the slave trade. I learned how to do historical analysis when working with primary sources that have large absences and often exclude marginalized voices. I also learned how to review a body of secondary literature and identify gaps in which I could make my own contributions.",
    "I truly learned so much about the transatlantic slave trade in a surprising amount of breadth and depth. I also developed my ability to engage with historical texts and research."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "a lot of information in such a short period of time. Dr. Roberts is phenomenal , and ignites her passion for the material through her seminars.",
    "This class as a course is incredibly strong, intellectually rigorous, and open enough for one to pursue their own subset of interests within the boundaries of the class. I would not change anything. Sometimes I felt that some individuals were not engaging as fully as they could have with the material given, which was a shame because Professor Roberts is truly outstanding and goes far beyond the role of other professors in her involvement.",
    "Definitely a lot of reading and writing with the reading responses, but really worth it because Professor Roberts is so kind and amazing and knows SO MUCH. Seriously. She knows everything there is to know about the slave trade.",
    "I think the course is definitely strong in that it is the one class I have taken that has managed to blend both STEM-focused areas and the work of the humanities. I think it's a very well-rounded course that allows for people to find a bridge between the two worlds that are often separated from each other. At the same time, I believe there are times where lack of knowledge of one or the other shows in some of the discussions. Some of the things I learned I actually learned because of the help of the STEM majors in the class - which is great in itself, but maybe needs a little more background in some other cases.",
    "This class was the best class I've ever taken at Yale. Absolutely *every* element is a strengththe professor, the readings, the peers, the structure, the interactivity. My one suggestion for improving the course would be to reduce the number of required reading responses during weeks where other assignments are also due for the class, as writing a thoughtful ~500 word reading response every week became a bit much. But, again, this only pushed me to work harder and grow as a student and I can visibly see improvements in my analysis and writing skills as a result of this class.",
    "The course was strong throughout. The teaching was excellent, and the progression of the course well-paced to build understanding over different subjects of study. It was great as a seminar, and very rich in what it was able to accomplish, but felt occasionally like a survey course in that so much more material was revealed for future exploration through the course. The weakness of this course is that of any seminar course - it relies on strong participation in class, and discussions can lull if the readings were not thoroughly done. The ideas of having students give class openings and lead discussions were great ones, but I wonder if more work could be done in the pre-class meeting in order to support the teaching styles of the students who lead discussion.",
    "The course has a great syllabus, and the written work helped me become comfortable with doing historical analysis using a body of primary sources that had large absences. Class discussions often had silences, partly because of the emotional intensity of the subject matter, and partly because people weren't always sure what to say. Toward the end, it seemed like Professor Roberts intervened a bit more to ask follow-up questions when the discussion faltered, which seemed like a good way to address people's shyness about speaking.",
    "This class has such rich material. The readings are so engaging and class discussion quite productive. The only way I think it could be improved would be the timing of the papers, which I think could be spread out a little more."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. Professor Roberts is absolutely fabulous, the material is fascinating, and you will leave with a greater understanding of race in the world as well as the history of the medicine of the slave trade.",
    "Yes, if you want to be taken on an adventure through time and learn key points in medicine.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. I think that, for it being the first time it was taught, the course felt incredibly well matured. Also, the content is so important, especially in this historical and cultural moment. To really come to understand aspects of the slave trade underneath dominant narratives of empire and industry reveals that there is so much nuance to the ways that people come to know each other and live together. In the end, this becomes profoundly inspirational.",
    "I would 100% recommend it to anyone who is interested in history or medicine. Or both.",
    "Absolutely! I got a lot of actual feedback on my writing and on my thought processes. I really appreciated having someone not just say \"this could be better but overall great!\", it was really helpful in building me as a writer.",
    "Yes!",
    "When I first came to Yale, upperclassmen would often advise me that, at Yale, every so now and then, you'll come across a class that is a gem. Gems are classes that come and go, they'll pop up in a blue book one semester and be everything that you're looking for in a class. At first, it may seem a little out of your interest area, or you're daunted by the readings you've never heard of. Still, something about the class catches your eye and you wonder what it would be like to learn about something totally new, from a brilliant professor, in this fleeting moment of now. THIS CLASS IS A GEM. Professor Carolyn Roberts is the kindest, most engaging professor I've ever met. Her eloquent language, fountain of knowledge, and ability to recount incredible facts and stories from any point in history impressed me every single class. The class itself is well organized and well structured, guiding you from one topic to the next in the history of medicine and the slave trade as you *literally* embark on a journey of scholarship that remains under-explored and under-researched. So take this class. Now. I was forever changed by this experience and so will you.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! Professor Roberts is an incredibly caring teacher, and puts a lot of effort into responding to individual work and feedback to help you learn. If you haven't taken much on racial theory yet, you'll learn a lot, and be pushed in your intellectual comprehension. I was. It's absolutely worth it, and medicine is a fascinating lens through which to analyze power, otherness, and hierarchy.",
    "Absolutely. Carolyn Roberts is extraordinary. This subject matter is so important for understand the enduring, complex relationship between medicine, race, and violence.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! Prof. Roberts is an absolute joy to work with, and the material is so rewarding. Probably the best classes I've taken at Yale."
