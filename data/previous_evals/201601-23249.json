   "comments": [
    "Do not take this course unless you have a basic understanding of econ, because you certainly won't learn it here. The TAs for the most part were horrible, to the extent to during the two review sessions for an exam, they gave us different answers to different review questions. Going into the second exam, none of us knew how to properly answer a number of questions. P-sets were poorly written and difficult to understand. Grading was not uniform, I would work on p-sets with my friends and with the same answers I'd get a 6\/10 and they'd get a 10\/10. This is not a credit to fulfill a distributional requirement.",
    "Economics of Natural Resources was a great class that challenged the way I think of environmental issues through an economic lens. The concepts we talked about were varied and interesting. We talked about public goods, forestry, fishing, as well as polution, among other topics. I would highly recommend this class.",
    "Yes, it is an interesting econ credit and actually teaches has a lot of interesting and relevant material. However, be aware that this class does not have much structure and at times is poorly organized. If you go to section, you should be fine doing problem sets and exams.",
    "This course is definitely a mixed bag. I learned about some very interesting applications of economics to environmental issues and resources, which I think is the biggest take away. Workload: 2 midterms and a final, weekly sections (required, for some reason, but if you have a helpful TA that's not bad), and weekly readings that mostly reiterate lecture so you probably don't need to read them. Though the course concepts are not difficult, the Professor can be quite unclear and his problem sets and exams can be confusing and typo-ridden. That said, he is also fairly engaging for an economics lecturer--though I would recommend recognizing that he puts forward a very particular opinion on how different issues should be approached. It was interesting to recognize that bias, though. Ultimately, if you're okay with the course being muddled and frustrating at times, I'd say go for it. I think it's most useful to someone interested in the environment, but probably easiest for someone who is good at econ.",
    "This is a great class. You learn some important concepts, and it's good either as an environmental policy type class or just as a nice into to econ in general. I had never taken any econ before and I did very well in the class. The problem sets are very manageable, and the midterms and final aren't bad either.",
    "Bar none the worst class I've taken at Yale. The lectures were 50 minutes of repeating the same point over and over, with half the class struggling to stay awake.",
    "Could be an easy class but no one ever knows what's going on.",
    "I would recommend this class as a good way to learn about what economists out there in the world are doing about environmental problems, but I highly advise that you take what Professor Mendelsohn prevents as fact about economic solutions to environmental problems with a grain of salt. There are a lot of environmental critiques that he does not incorporate into his lessons.",
    "Fairly interesting and very easy course on how micro and macro principles apply to environmental situations. Lectures are sometimes hurried and sloppy but other times are very engaging and funny.",
    "take it. It's a chill econ elective and you don't need too much prior econ experience.",
    "Would recommend if you have any interest in natural resources or Econ. It's a new way to think about both. Mendelsohn clearly has an agenda though, so just be prepared.",
    "It's not so much work or so hard to do well in and the information that you learn is important, even if it makes no one happy so sure, take it!",
    "Take it if you are environmentally conscious and is confident in your microecon preparation. You'll need to be good at both in order to succeed. Awesome lectures.",
    "A crappy, unorganized economics course that you should take, then drop, then take again for a second time so you know what to expect and don't get caught off guard then screwed over.",
    "Yes! I would recommend ECON 330 to students of all backgrounds who want to learn about natural resources and from all academic backgrounds. It is such an important and pertinent topic for our generation, and Professor Mendelsohn is incredible!",
    "Not as easy as I thought it would be, but definitely not bad! Material was a bit dry, but pretty easy to understand and the basic concepts are interesting.",
    "This class is good, but huge and sometimes poorly administrated. While the material was very interesting, the exams and problem sets often have errors. Moreover, the material is relatively simple so grade differentiation is based on small errors. Overall the class was great, but there are some logistical issues.",
    "The content is super interesting and Mendelssohn is incredible, just make sure you get into a good section.",
    "Good class",
    "Good introduction to Econ electives at Yale after intro micro",
    "Pretty gutty, very little work, not that interesting, and poorly organized. If you need an econ credit or a 5th class, go for it, but don't expect to get that much out of it. Be aware that all the lectures are done by hand and the lectures don't get posted online.",
    "I wouldn't recommend this class. It was ultimately so frustrating, with the constant typos, unclear instructions, unknowledgeable TFs, and Mendolsohn's sometimes tangent-y lectures. That being said, I did learn some (not a whole lot) about why environmental policy often is shaped how it is, and the psets were fairly easy.",
    "good class, but try to ask for more practice questions just so you can check your understanding of key topics.",
    "I would recommend the class to anybody interested in both environmental studies and microeconomics. For those thinking it's just an environmental studies course, however, there are aspects in the problem sets that require economics background.",
    "ECON 330 is a fabulous class to take. Not only is the subject matter important, but the class remains interesting. By the end, because it wasn't so laboriously hard, I felt like I had actually digested the material and learned something, which is hard to say for a lot of Econ classes here. This is a good class to take with a heavy schedule, and a great Econ course in general.",
    "A pretty good class! Take it if you have the course room.",
    "Not as bad as some make it out to be. Exam curves are generous",
    "ECON 330 is a great introduction to environmental economics for someone without a ton of econ background. I could definitely be frustrating for someone who has taken more economics and wants to dive more deeply into the material, however. Furthermore, the class was administed very poorly with many communication issues between the professor and the teaching fellows. Thus, while the material was some of the most interesting I have seen at Yale, the course was also very stressful and annoying at times, with mistakes on problem sets, TFs who could not explain what Mendelsohn lectured about, etc.",
    "I would tell them that it is a genuinely interesting and informative course, going just by the lectures. That being said, the TA's were so terrible (although I admit mine was particularly horrendous) that the course almost became a guessing game of whether you were being taught the material correctly or not. I think in the end, I would not recommend it.",
    "Interesting topics, although it doesn't attract the most invested group of fellow students.",
    "Would definitely recommend this class. Only 10 psets 2 midterms and a final and 2x50min of class a week. Interesting topics that are thought in a relatively extraordinary manner from a sometimes unexpected point of view.",
    "This is a standard class. It's not the most captivating, but it discusses some interesting ideas about forest\/land\/water\/resource management. It has a very manageable workload. Take it if you want a manageable econ class and are kind of interested in resource management. Don't take it if you're looking for a life changing experience. This review may sound a bit dull, but honestly this class was never stressful and was enjoyable at times. Advice: If you end up taking it, look at the problem sets early and go to office hours with any questions. The p-sets are pretty short, but there can be strangely worded questions or other issues that can be cleared up by a TA very quickly.",
    "Would recommend. Great course.",
    "Really great class! Straightforward and interesting. Good class to take no matter what your major.",
    "Good class - very dry lectures and gets super boring and repetitive and you feel like it's a waste to go to class but it's also pretty easy and chill so that's a big plus. Only weekly psets, two midterms, and a final. Psets shouldn't take longer than maybe 2-3 hours but the last few psets get a little trickier and you don't really know what they're looking for so they took a little longer. First midterm was harder than the second to me and the short answer questions kind of tricked me as an Econ major who likes the quantitative questions, but I'm sure the short answers were good for intuitive environmental studies majors. Very sweet and passionate professor and he was so excited each class to talk about the topics. Interesting perspective on looking at natural resources management and pollution, recycling, climate change, policies on common goods, etc.",
    "Great econ class.",
    "I would recommend this class! As an environmental studies major, I really appreciated the economics perspective on some of the material I work with in my other classes, and it wasn't too difficult to keep up (I took intro econ a while back but didn't remember much). Lectures were engaging.",
    "Good course but requires a lot of initiative to get ahead",
    "This is a great class to take if you are interested at all in either environmental issues or if you are looking for a class that will let you apply Economics to other things. It is eye-opening to see how all these issues can be viewed from an economic perspective. The class is also wonderful because the professor actually TEACHES and EXPLAINS THINGS and DRAWS GRAPHS ON THE BOARD!!! You don't have to chase stupid lecture slides that make no sense, and you can actually TAKE NOTES!",
    "Would recommend to another student that was able to handle the economics and math aspects. Have to be good with Present Value.",
    "Econ 330 is a pretty good survey of the current economic theory about natural resource management. As a science student who had never taken econ before I found the econ very manageable. However I found much of the science and logic that was the premise for the class to be flawed. For example, trees don't really reduce water supply for people other than in very specific situations, Forests rather play an integral part of the complex system that allows us to get clean water. Ultimately, the content (and economics) is very simplified and anthropocentric. Given that, Mendelsohn is a very good lecturer and you will learn a lot of econ.",
    "As a bio major, I thought this course was fascinating. A lot of my friends who are econ majors did not share that opinion, but maybe they were just trying to pretend that it was easy. Lectures were pretty hard to keep up with because there was no slide show and the notes on the board were entirely unintelligible, but what was actually coming out of Professor Mendelsohn's mouth was really cool. Unfortunately problem sets were entirely quantitative and so lecture did not translate to the homework very well. Section sort of helped finish the psets, though for me it did not exactly help understand them. People will say this course is a gut. It's true that the readings are completely unnecessary and the first few psets took 15 minutes to complete. However, exams are not a stroll through the park and you need to know a hell of a lot more than MB=MC. I would definitely recommend it but I'd suggest going in with an open mind and not with the idea that natural resources are a complete joke and an easy A.",
    "Econ is a basic course, not TOO hard but definitely there are moments where you really need to study and work. If you're interested in the material, it'll be good but i definitely saw people get bored at times. Exams pretty straightforward.",
    "Yes.",
    "It's an interesting course and not too difficult--did give me a few things to think about. Just don't think it's going to be a total gut, and also don't think you're going to learn a ton about economics.",
    "I would recommend Econ of Natural Resources to EVST or ECON majors looking for a laid-back QR credit. Analyzing environmental issues such as pollution, water quality, forestry, and climate change, EVST 340 provides an overview on how the environment and the economy interact to achieve ultimate sustainability."
