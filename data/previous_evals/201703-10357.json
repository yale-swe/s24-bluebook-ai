    "The course was not demanding at all. I didn't learn a lot.",
    "Errington is excellent.",
    "Prof Errington is underrated in my opinion. He knows a lot, is really nice, and can be very helpful if you go to his office hours for the final paper. It's also a SUPER chill class; he gives a ton of flexibility so that you could discuss things of personal interest to you, which is cool because most of class had specific languages they cared about. That said, I think I would have preferred a bit more structure--there were a lot of concepts that were unfamiliar to all. Think less time could've been spent on the student presentations (the last half of class), and more time to working through those concepts.",
    "This course is enriching for students who enjoy working pretty independently. No weekly assignments outside reading, and a few check-ins about the final research project.",
    "The strengths of the class were the readings and the in-class discussions. The professor gave really nice insight and valuable recommendations. My classmates shared a lot of valuable personal experience which I could not have appreciated as much if I read in a book. The weaknesses were that sometimes the discussion would drag on or not contribute to larger themes of the class."

    "Take it if you need a very chill anthro credit. The only gut I've ever taken, but I don't regret it. The prof is a really nice guy.",
    "Yes. Endangered Languages is awesome, not too much work, and super engaging. TAKE THIS CLASS!",
    "It's a chill class with a cool professor. I think it's worthwhile if you have a specific language you're interested in that's not super common.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in delving into a specific topic regarding language endangerment. I would describe it as a research seminar; readings act as tools for completing the final presentation and paper, which I think make up most of the grade for the class."
