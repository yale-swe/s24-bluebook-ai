   "comments": [
    "Learned about Christian missionaries who went to China from Yale, visited the Yale China Association, visited the Peabody Museum on a tour, had several trips to the Yale Archives. Learned about how WWII and WWI influenced life at Yale, as well as how the Cold War influenced life at Yale. Learned about Hiram Bingham and the Yale Peruvian Expedition and how Yale stole a bunch of artifacts from Peru and refused to give them back (until recently).",
    "This class gave me a great foundation in how to properly conduct archival research. Professor Engermann brought us to the archives several times throughout the semester. These sessions made me more confident in navigating the records so that I felt ready to start the final paper when that time came. If you are looking for an opportunity to ease into research, this is certainly the class for that!",
    "I learned about Yale's response to and interaction with various global phenomenons of the 20th century including missionary work of the early 1900s, the age of scientific discovery \/ exploration, WWI and WWII, and divestment movements of the 1980s regarding South Africa. I also continued to hone in on the skill of thinking critically about history -- and trying to uncover how power operates in different situations."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Very cool field trips throughout the course (to the archives, Yale-China Association, Peabody Museum) Also small class size (5 students) was a strength in that each class session was very discussion based and collaborative. I felt like I got to know my classmates very well. Most of the readings were interesting. The less-interesting ones I didn't read as closely. Weakness: Small class size - discussion can kind of die down since there's only 5 students.",
    "The strength of this course was undoubtedly Professor Engermann and his plan for the semester. Each class provided a new and exciting experience. This included everything from diving into the archives, to visiting the Peabody, to meeting with former Yale President Rick Levin, and much more. It was truly a class I looked forward to attending and flew by when I got there.",
    "Professor Engerman opened up this conversation in the last part of our final seminar and we had a really productive discussion. In my opinion, the course was great on the whole: the reading load was not too bad, the selected authors complimented our discussions well, the paper topics were engaging and offered students a fair amount of choice, and we covered a large breadth of topics. I also appreciated how professor Engerman emphasized archival work throughout our course and mixed up what our weekly seminar looked like. One thing that might be helpful would be to encourage students make more of an effort to better connect scholarly \/ generic readings with those specifically about Yale."

   "comments": [
    "Recommend to anybody who needs a Hu credit. A great way to earn a Hu credit - you learn interesting things about Yale's history, and also learn more about how Yale has impacted the world. Also English \/ History majors will get a lot out of the course as well.",
    "Absolutely! What made this class so special is that it could only have been taught at Yale. Yales rich history and amazing resources provided us a lens to look at larger US-global events. It truly is not just a history at Yale. Rather, Yale provided us a supplementary outlook to ideas, forces, and movements happening across the country and world. As stated above, Professor Engerman makes the class incredibly engaging. We look at and make use of many of Yales resources that I previously would not have known that it even existed! Furthermore, it gave me a better appreciation and understanding of this University, which I think is important for any student to gain.",
    "Absolutely!! This course uses Yale as a medium to discuss larger trends in higher education and touches on US politics as well. The readings are all thoughtfully selected and never overwhelming. For a history seminar, the workload is easily manageable, and Professor Engerman works so hard to make sure everyone is learning and growing.",
    "Yes - absolutely! I think its really important to learn about and think critically about our own institution -- part of that requires self-reflection, self-critique, and an awareness of our role in Yale's current moment \/ broader history. Every Yale student who's interested in doing this work should take this course."
