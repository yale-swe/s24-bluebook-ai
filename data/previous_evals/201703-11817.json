   "comments": [
    "I learned the arabic alphabet, and basic vocabulary regarding introductions, hometown, university, food, the weather, and other conversational topics. I also learned to differentiate between dialect and formal arabic.",
    "This class is a good introduction to MSA and also introduces some aspects of dialects. If you're looking to learn a dialect to travel abroad this may not be the best course but if you're interested in Arabic this is a great place to start and even though it is not the focus of the course you will get some practice in a dialect.",
    "Learned many useful tools with speaking writing and listening! Loved the course!",
    "I developed conversational skills in a foreign language, which helped me with my time management and made me more patient with myself and my learning process.",
    "During this course, I developed a great foundation for formal Arabic and the Levantine dialect that I can build upon in the future. I learned how to write and read the Arabic dialect as well as speak for several minutes with a native speaker in Arabic."

   "comments": [
    "Elham is an incredible teacher and will help and explain any topics that dont make sense and will slow down the class if need be. Moreover the course offers a very good foundation of how to speak and write in arabic. The weaknesses of this course, although few, mainly revolve around the opportunity to speak the language and perfect an accent. However, by the end of the semester we were able to hold 10 minute conversations with native arabic speakers.",
    "I think this course is very strong. The small class size is really helpful in getting personal help with things like pronunciation and writing and allows recurring mistakes to be corrected quickly. I think there isn't quite enough emphasis on speaking and conversation and I think a more consistent conversation session in either the dialect or MSA would be really helpful.",
    "Dont see any improvements off the top of my head. Great course",
    "Strengths: amazing instructor, great help outside of the classroom, supportive classroom environment, high level of skill in speaking, reading, and writing in Arabic in a short amount of time Weaknesses: very fast paced, high workload, no differentiation between heritage and non-heritage speakers in this course, which means there is a skew towards heritage speakers in terms of grading"

   "comments": [
    "Yes. If you are willing to learn a new script in a language, this class is perfect and widely applicable. Within just a semester you learn basic vocab structures and can communicate in the new language.",
    "Arabic is a hard language to become fluent in but this a great class and if you're at all interested in learning Arabic this a great class.",
    "If you want to learn the Arabic language in an engaging but challenging environment, then this is the class for you. I would not take this class if you are looking for a \"gut class\" or anything remotely easy. You will be pushed to do your best but you will also learn an incredible amount in a short time. This was my most rewarding class of the semester and hopefully, it will also be yours."
