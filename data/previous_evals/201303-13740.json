   "comments": [
    "The course is structured well, the homeworks are relevant, the reading are interesting!Often, it seemed like some of the homework and exam questions were attempts at reading Melinda's mind, and less about being able to justify an answer that we wrote down.I would like to have had a more public health-oriented textbook. This one, which I admittedly didn't always read, seemed more catered towards medical professionals and clinicians.",
    "One of my favorite classes I have taken at YSPH. Challenging information but well taught. Interactive, and the syllabus was designed very well - from the progression through diseases, the readings included, etc. The only constructive criticism I have would be to vary the lecture style a little more - the two days of group presentations were a start, but also some group exercises \/ informational clips \/ case challenges would also be fun and keep students engaged through the whole semester.",
    "Great course, loved all the different disease we went over. I come from a molecular and cellular biology background so this course made me feel at home. I thought the course was very relevant for EMD and provided some great info for a public health perspective.",
    "This was a great class! It was a perfect combination of scientific material and public health application. This was easily my favorite class of the semester and one of my favorite classes I have ever taken.My only recommendation was that the organization in the beginning was a little confusing (the first few weeks). One of the first classes were were assigned something like 12 papers, which was overwhelming. It took a few weeks to get into the swing of things, so I would recommend starting the semester with at least two introductory lectures from Melinda and then moving to sections with Jamie, just to get us used to the format of the class and what our expectations are.",
    "A great course. Lots of material, but interesting stuff. The structure of each class (disease introduction followed by research analyses) was great, and helped students apply their knowledge and understanding to real-world scenarios. It was very valuable to work through those research papers together, discovering connections and expanding our understanding of disease characteristics.Dr. Childs' peanut gallery helped to add color to the classroom.",
    "Sometimes the lectures were rushed. Overall we covered a lot of material and it was a interesting class. I think there needs to be a third test so that there is not so much material to test on at the end.",
    "Great course in infectious diseases. Really enjoyed the combination of biology and public health, and especially the efforts to try to tie relevant aspects of the biologic mechanisms of disease with public health. Homework assignments were, in my opinion, often very harshly graded with minimum feedback. Relevance of some of the reading assignments was questionable.",
    "This course is a very good overview of major infectious diseases, and provides students with knowledge of key concepts that are important for understanding of the spread and control of infectious diseases.",
    "This was probably my favorite course of the semester. I liked the way it was organized by disease but had overarching discussion\/theme questions to guide the recurrent points throughout the course. My only suggestion for improvement was to possibly discuss some of the concepts in the homework prior to assigning it. The first assignment (dealing with calculations sensitivity and specificity) was not heavily covered in class and was not discussed in Epidemiology until way later. Coordinating the assignments a little better with the class sequences could have reinforced important skills more.",
    "THIS IS THE BEST CLASS. A wide range of topics are covered in depth; unifying themes throughout make it easier to follow everything. Homework assignments are fun, and the exams are designed to really test your knowledge and show you what you have learned.",
    "Incredible class. I have never learned more from any class I have ever taken.",
    "Great informational course on ID. I feel like a learned a wide range of information.",
    "I greatly enjoyed taking this course. I'm not sure that I have any responses for improvement. I came into this course well-equipped to handle it, but I also thought that the teacher did an admirable job teaching this class, interacting with the students, encouraging student participation, covering interesting and relevant topics, giving breadth and depth in the coursework and clearly laying out expectation for the course. I felt I learned a lot and I had a great time taking this course.",
    "Great course. I'm CDE and very glad I took it.",
    "Good organization, I loved the slides!Weaknesses: the TA",
    "Strengths: LecturesWeakness: grading of the homework",
    "This class is perfect as is.",
    "Awesome course! Learned a lot and really felt engaged with the coursework. Easy to follow slides and the course really makes you think.",
    "I think this is a good introduction into the basics of infectious diseases. Melinda is a good lecturer with very logical lesson plans and a good sense of humor. Really enjoyed having her and Jamie Childs as instructors.",
    "The text and articles were excellent. Homework assignments were interesting and helpful. Both Melinda and Jamie were great lecturers.",
    "The course was incredibly strong. We learned the desired content, which was very extensive and informative. The course helped me leave with a good understanding of infectious diseases, and gave me new perspectives on epidemiology, outbreaks, and infectious disease.",
    "Interesting but not good for people who don't have a biology or science background. There should be a minimum prerequisite of this course of biology and\/or microbio in order for students to actually benefit from it.",
    "It's weird but I wish we had more homework assignments. For weeks we had no assignments, I forgot a lot of what we learned because it wasn't reinforced in any way. Also, these assignments could have contributed to our grade to give us more of a boost.",
    "This course was a good overall introduction to many important infectious diseases. The content wasn't very in-depth about individuals diseases, but it was a very good introductory course. I learned a lot from this course",
    "I think this course is too general. It's mostly basic information we could easily look up in a wikipedia article. There is some learning of concepts in public health that can apply to other courses and situations, but not as much as I would like. I think individual courses based on say STIs, GI, vector-borne diseases, whatever would be more useful than making everyone take a very broad overview.",
    "This course was fantastic! It was difficult but provided a great review of infectious disease and a wonderful approach to ID that I had never experienced in my prior years of education. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda is a great instructor. She knows the material very well (sometimes I'm amazed how one can have such a vast body of knowledge stored in the brain) and generally can explain things well. She cares a lot about students learning and she loves the material.I also think Melinda does an excellent job of bringing critical thinking into the public health classroom. Public health is sometimes far too descriptive, far too focused on the cold hard facts. I really appreciate her ability to bring a liberal-arts tone to things and wishit happened more in classes at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She made the class interactive and wrote very clear slides. She always made sure to re-emphasize complicated topics in the next class so that everyone followed along. I also liked the \"questions to ponder\" at the beginning of each class to get us oriented and thinking critically. I liked her dry humor, and I walked out of every class feeling like I learned a lot, and I could remember the information for weeks to come. Professor Pettigrew is one of the best professors I have had at YSPH.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Amazing teacher. She really knows her stuff about different pathogens and doesn't BS students. She provides great lectures and is really very interesting. Very funny!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda might be my new favorite professor of all time. She is approachable, smart, an interesting lecturer, organized, aware of her students -- everything you could want in a teacher. She should definitely keep teaching the first class for EMD students (unless she wants to teach more classes I'll be taking)!",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Professor Pettigrew is a wonderful instructor. She always brought a smile to class, and was engaging and entertaining. Her passion for the subject was apparent. She encouraged class participation, and encouraged students to reason through public health scenarios in class.",

    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Melinda is super cool and funny. I truly enjoyed her as a lecturing and she did a great job of answering my questions after class.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0I enjoyed learning from Miranda. She engaged the class well, and held us to high, but fair standards. Perhaps she could have been a bit clearer about her expectations for memorizing for the exams, but ultimately most of the people I spoke to thought the exams were hard but fair and she was an excellent and well-informed instructor.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0Great job.",
    "Instructor: Melinda Mary Pettigrew \u00a0She was great! good sense of humor, and she never made you feel stupid, she always took the time to explain something if you asked. She was also really approachable and made herself available for office hours and extra help. I learned lots from her.",

    "Instructor: Ryan Henry Boyko \u00a0I hate to be rude, but I did not like him at all. He is a fine person, but way way wayyyy too harsh of a grader and too self-important. He was a harder grader than the actual professor! I also didn't care for the fact that he would try to speak out a lot in class after the professors, to show off his knowledge or to have the last word I do not know. Other than that he is okay. But needs to calm down with taking away points carelessly.",
