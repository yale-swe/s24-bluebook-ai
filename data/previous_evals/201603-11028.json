    "Learned a ton about writing, researching, and conducting oral interviews for my final research paper. Really useful skills. Also learned a TON about Old Yalehow students were admitted, who was admitted, what the institution was like, what traditions dominate this place, and more. A must-take for students interested in their home, alma mater.",
    "I learned a ton about Yales history and its relationship to the overall US narrative. I learned the most from the stories and information Gitlin and Chauncey relayed. For students who have not had the chance to work with Manuscripts and Archives, this is a great chance to do so since the final paper basically requires you to.",
    "My takeaway from this class is how Yale and her graduates have shaped American history. Professor Gitlin is a veritable fountain of knowleddge and one cannot be in the same room with him for more than a couple minutes without learning something new. This course helped me take a step back and look at my experience here so far, which I think has enabled me to better enjoy the final semesters."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Professor Gitlin is an energetic and committed instructor, and a great person to be around. However, the class basically took history as a pub quiz; we dealt with topics very superficially. There was no emphasis on skills development. It is a shame that this can count for one of two history departmental seminars, because it means history majors are potentially missing out on an important opportunity for the exploration of historical methods and writing. Because Professor Gitlin just rambled at times, I felt left out of the conversation.",
    "Weaknesses: no real need or incentive to do work...ever. You can reasonably get by without doing a single reading the whole semester. Which is a shame given how good the readings are. Also, Professor Gitlin, God bless him, is one of the most disorganized humans on this earth. It makes class more fun, but certainly more unpredictable in and out of seminar. Strengths: Jay Gitlin. The man, the myth, the legend. A genius and a scholar. A real pleasure through and through. If Sam Chauncey shows up, all the better. The two of them are worth taking this course, period. There are no two better humans alive to teach this class. Being in their presence is a gift, each and every week.",
    "GItlin and Chauncey. Gitlin is the type of professor I imagined having at Yalehe is so so incredibly dedicated to his students and sees them as people rather than just as numbers. He took several of us to Whitlocks Bookstore and organized a class trip to the Grove Street Cemetery. Chauncey provided an amazing counterpoint to GItlin and offered key intuitional insight. The readings were not entirely related to the course material. This course pushed me beyond my typical boundariesI hate group work, but most of the work is group work, I sang a song in front of the class. While these seem kind of nuts, GIltins emphasis on creating a class community actually make these tasks much more feasible.",
    "Strengths: The energy and knowledge that Professor Gitlin brings to every class. The wisdom and perspective that Sam brings to the class. The huge breadth of the class, which is quite ambitious. The readings are interesting. The course can engage people who are interested in neither Yale nor American history. The class unity that Professor Gitlin promotes: people celebrated birthdays, we went to Mory's, on a field trip, etc. The chance to write about any aspect of Yale's history that interests you. Professor Gitlin's perspective and willingness to be open and speak his mind, which I value highly! Weaknesses: There is way too much course material. How can one cram over 300 years of rich history into a seminar that barely meets two hours a week with a professor that is prone to tangents but also terribly interested in hearing what students have to say? Each week's class could easily be divided into four and still not have time to talk about everything. I don't know how to remedy this, but the result is that not everything gets talked about and students who worked hard on presentations don't get to present them to the fullest extent that they may have wanted.",
    "My only advice is to manage the time better so we aren't waiting four weeks to give a presentation. Beyond that, keep it the same. This class is great."

   "comments": [
    "No. The class is overrated. Little by way of intellectual substance.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Gitlin makes the class. His engagement with his students and the material is legendary.",
    "A must-take for any Yalie serious about learning the traditions, rules, ethics, insights, legacies, and histories of this wonderful and inexplicable home we call Yale. Professor Gitlin is a genius, and together with Sam Chauncey you are learning from the two most knowledgable humans on Yale alive. Really, being in their presence each week is a treat, a real gift to be cherished that, doubtless, will be remembered by all for years to come. Though there's no grand narrative to the course no life-changing lesson that'll shape anything more than a nice afternoon the random facts, stories, and anecdotes from Gitlin, Chauncey, and the readings are unforgettable and really enjoyable. Together with the hilariously-low workload, this class is a gem.",
    "This is incredible course. However, I do believe senior history majors have the most to gain as there is a large amount of reading, little preparation assistance for the final paper, and it is the most meaningful having been in the university for three years. I would not recommend taking it if you are not a history major or have not taken another writing intensive history seminar in which you were taught how to write a rigorous research paper. That being said, it is an absolutely amazing course that is truly distinct from every other course at YaleGitlin is incredibly engaging, his love for the material and teaching is infectious, he is so dedicated, and Chauncey is fantastic.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you get in. Especially if you think this is self-indulgent Yale stupidity. Take the class and find out why that isn't the case. You will not be disappointed. If you are a freshman or sophomore, you won't (shouldn't) get in but go to the first class to get a feeling of what it would be like and fill out an index card. He gives preference to people who have shopped his class before. I think all Yale students should be able to take this course (which is impossible for a number of reasons). Professor Gitlin designed it for his son to take senior year, which he didn't, but you still should. It's a great way to get some perspective about what this place means. It's a class about Yale history but it's really a class about American history as influenced by Yale and her graduates. This course has it all. Interesting discussions, wacky class meeting locations (YDN Board Room, Yale Corporation Room, Grove Street), a fantastic and lovable professor, classic late-night emails (you'll see what I mean. The Gitlin Email is an artform!)... I could go on and on. It's not a lot of work, though there is a fair bit of reading and the final paper is long (15-20), but Professor Gitlin is very understanding with deadlines. One of the very best parts of this class is Sam Chauncey. He came to all our classes (except the one where we danced with the Professor and his wife). He is by far the wisest man I've ever had the privilege to meet and has been behind an overwhelming percentage of the good that Yale has done in the past half century. Take this class, if only to meet Sam. He's THAT GOOD. The most moral human being I've ever met. I cannot say enough good things about him. The only drawback of the course is that Professor Gitlin will keep you late about 90% of the time because there is simply too much course material. Too much. It cannot humanly be covered in the amount of class time that the course has, especially when Professor Gitlin can talk about any of these things for hours and hours without exhausting his knowledge. You'll learn things in this class that you had no idea about and will blow your mind. You also might come away from a class not really sure about what you learned (rare). This class is totally worth your time.",
    "I would highly recommend this class, especially to seniors. Professor Gitlin puts a fair amount of effort to create an environment that is both engaging yet intimate. He has endless things to talk about and can keep the conversation interesting for the whole two hours. At the same time, he appoints social chairs, runs events such as the Burial of Euclid, and even has an end of the semester event at Mory's for the sole purpose of socializing. We even had a class where we sang Cole Porter songs and learned to dance! Although it can sometimes feel unstructured, very few classes at Yale have the same sociable, engaging, low pressure atmosphere of \"Yale and America\". The other highlight of the class is Sam Chauncey. No other man on this campus can provide as much insight into the inner workings of Yale; to have him provide commentary in many classes is a treasure. The workload is a fair amount of reading, but it is not necessary to do all of it. Every week interlocutors are appointed to summarize the readings. Beyond that, there is a midterm paper and a final paper, making the actual workload very reasonable.",
    "Yale and America is a good class. Professor Gitlin is wonderful and he runs a great seminar. Beware that you might not get that much out of the class unless you do all the readings.",
    "THIS IS THE SINGLE GREATEST CLASS AT YALE. PREPARE FOR A SEMESTER OF SCHOLARLY JOY. Prof G is an ebullient scholar, and he emanates irresistible curiosity and enthusiasm. Through a myriad of class traditions, excursions, and storytelling, he creates a class culture that even my favorite classes have only approximated. Yet, even though he teaches with so much love for his students and for our readings, that never compromises his skill at giving incisive feedback or his capacity to model daring thesis-making."
