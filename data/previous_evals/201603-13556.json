   "comments": [
    "Great Course",
    "Overall, I felt a little unorganized. But am a huge advocate for the teaching style, it really helped me learn in the least stressful way possible.",
    "I liked that we had the opportunity to get firsthand experience with trying to implement and adhere to health goals; however, I do not think that I learned any helpful new information about the topic of social and behavioral health from doing the papers that we had to do each week on our goals.I felt like a lot of what I learned were things that I already knew.",
    "Interesting course, but sometimes too much workload.",
    "I absolutely loved this class. It was clear from the beginning that both the instructor and TAs were invested in us and our health. Class material was easy to understand, and the health behavior assignments not only taught us about public health interventions and social and behavioral aspects of health but helped us improve our own health!",
    "I thought the behavioral change goals were great, and I'm so glad we got to use this opportunity to make our lives healthier. I look forward to continuing the behaviors. I think one weakness is that I thought the information that was lectured in class was too basic and that we could have gone deeper in each section.",
    "Marney is super sweet. You can tell she really cares about her students and really wants to improve population health. I did pretty well on the writing assignments but I know there was some general frustration with the lack of transparency about how assignments were graded. We were just told that the average for the writing assignments was going to be an 80 or 85 and our work would be graded based on how well it stood up compared to the work our peers were handing in. But it was unclear how these distinctions in quality were even being distinguished. Also, there was some confusion about the behavior change projects. If we messed up one day would we not get extra credit? How ambitious were the behavior change projects supposed to be? There was a lot of uncertainty about course logistics all the way through the course of the semester.",
    "While the behavior changes were beneficial, the assignments were repetitive and became pointless. It would have been better to learn more information with respect to the field during class and discussion.",
    "Strengths: actually improved my lifestyle. Because of the class, I now am more physically active, mentally focused, socially open, and eat healthier than when I started. Weaknesses: None",
    "I think this course has amazing potential. However, I felt like lecture didn't go as in depth into the topics as I had hoped.",
    "I didn't think this course provided any novel insights; I don't think we learned much of anything. The lessons were pretty high level and obvious (eating vegetables is good for you, stress is bad for you, etc). I would've liked to see either a deeper dive into social psychology or more lessons about the biological mechanisms that these discoveries are based on.",
    "This may be the worst course I've taken. Topics were very fluffy. Very little time was spent on anything that lent technical heft to the concepts of behavior change or health disparities. Discussion sections were painful experiences that amounted to either group therapy sessions regarding water intake or 40 minutes of flailing to throw together a slide show on a topic for which teams were ill prepared. The best example was the final project in which students were to put together a \"public health awareness campaign\" for an assigned topic in 20-30 minutes. The exercise did not allow the time to dive into the assigned problem and understand anything about the root causes or data involved. It ended up being a lesson in what NOT to do in a public health campaign: blindly throwing around slogans and hashtags without any concept of what the real problem was or how to move the needle.",
    "Easy class, no midterm or final. Discussions were useless despite TA's best efforts.",
    "The increased average workload instead of a final was really helpful at decreasing stress levels, and it made the material more relevant to my daily life.",
    "Dr. White is an incredible professor who brings fresh breath of air to the classroom experience and truly cares about the well-being of her students. The course was very interesting in that it truly teaches students the difficulty with changing population-level behaviors by performing than on the individual level. I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in this field.",
    "I enjoyed this class and the interventions very much; however, I felt there was a slight disconnect between the material we learned in lecture and the many mini-papers we wrote for discussion section. I would have liked to do more with the lecture material, or at least have the slides available so I could go back and re-read them.",
    "The class covered useful and interesting topics, but the grading of the assignments needs to be improved. For assignments that take 10 hours to complete, like the summaries, they should be worth more than 10 points. Especially since 1 point can easily be lost for a small detail.",
    "I didn't like this class. I don't feel like I learned anything new, and I felt the way we were evaluated was not great. Marney is fantastic and she clearly cares about the subject material, but I don't like the way it was presented.",
    "I really like the structure of this course. With no exams, I had more time to really focus on the behavioral change goals, which helped me a lot over the semester!",
    "Great! The behavioral intervention have helped me to change my habit a lot in a good way. And I think it's a really useful and helpful class for changing bad habit into good ones.",
    "This class was required so I went in being unsure of it but ended up LOVING it! So glad this class is part of the YSPH core curriculum.",
    "I thought that Professor White's lectures were the strength of the course. However, I felt that the assignments were a weakness of the course. I felt that they were repetitive and after some time, did not necessarily contribute anything new to my learning. Especially with a topic like Social and Behavioral Foundations of Health, perhaps more hands-on learning would be beneficial (ie. group project).",
    "Strengths: Professor's lectures were great She was instrumental on helping me start healthy habits",
    "I love how behavior change models were integrated into the coursework and that we don't have a final!",
    "Honestly . . . I don't feel like I know much more about the social and behavioral foundations of health than I did before I took the course, because as it was structured the course required essentially no reading (except for articles we chose from the literature ourselves for our little mini-essays). I improved my own habits, but I wish there had been some enforcement to force us to learn the basics of what is known from the literature. (I realize that we should be motivated to do that ourselves, but given the vast number of required courses for the MPH, for graduate\/medical school applications a lot of people have to budget their time toward what is evaluated and drop the rest.)",
    "Great experience and fun course",
    "Strength: very rigorous settings, with weekly assignment and discussion group, very helpful for developing healthy habits. Weakness: sometimes the class can be pretty common-sense.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of the course, but it was also challenging to blur academic-personal life boundaries and incorporate the material into our everyday lives with the behavior change interventions. It was a unique learning experience, though, and balanced the lecture material well. The material was interesting and introduced concepts that are very relevant to all concentrations. Marney was so fun and engaging, would definitely recommend taking this course!",
    "The structure of the course encourages students to lie. I absolutely understand Dr. White's reasoning behind the new class curriculum with no tests. However, I do not think it is fair that our grade is based on self-reports on how many days\/weeks students completed their goals. When people are given up to 15 extra credit points for completing their goals most often, it gives a disadvantage to students who are actually telling the truth, and they should not be punished (have a lower grade) for doing so. I have no doubt there were people who actually completed their goals that many times and deserve those points but not all. Also, I felt that the weekly assignments were extremely repetitive.",
    "strengths - improved my writing and behavioral skills weaknesses - did take a lot of time in my schedule (time-consuming in that aspect)",
    "lectures are interesting, however, discussion session seems a little over-loaded",
    "I appreciated that this class did not have any quizzes or tests and really enjoyed the fact that we had to improve our mental and physical health for an assignment. It allowed us to make time for ourselves. The stretch sessions in class were awesome. Weakness - discussion was too long",
    "Lectures were very enjoyable and TAs were extremely friendly. Discussion sections would benefit from being shorter, and while I enjoyed doing goals and goal summaries in place of a final exam, it would be appreciated if feedback was provided for grade deductions on any assignments. The final intervention summary was a good culmination of everything learned in the course, whereas the \"media analysis\" as the \"final\" seemed like an unrelated add on. Increased communication between professor and TAs would be helpful, as there sometimes seemed to be a lack of continuity from directions given in lecture to activities completed in discussion sections. Lastly, the course was very focused on spending more time on nutrition\/physical activity\/social time etc.., but only quickly glossed over the risks of over-committing to these goals, a topic that seems relevant especially in this population of students.",
    "Marney is an amazing professor and truly cares about her students and their success in the course. However, the substitution of exams for weekly papers could be overwhelming depending on your teaching fellow. The course lecture itself was always engaging though and very interesting. Marney has a wonderful way of teaching that made the 2 hour class pass by quickly.",
    "The professor is amazing. I truly admire how much she cares about her students and that she wants to make a difference. However, I do not think that I learned from the assignments, and I think that the grading was very unfair and way too unpredictable.",
    "It was refreshing to have a course not focused on exams. I learned a lot with out the stress of exams. Marney does a great a job of keeping us engaged as we learn.",
    "Strengths- Highly interactive, stimulating and targets health behaviors",
    "Over the course of the semester students aimed to change their own health behaviors using a variety of behavior change techniques. Lessons learned were applied to public health models and interventions.",
    "Although I loved the idea and found it extremely conducive to graduate life, I failed to learn or acquire a single skill to be applied later in my public health career. With an extensive background in clinical psychology, I should have been permitted to exempt. Because I was not, I would at least request the coursework to be challenging and teach me valuable skills if I am forced to pay upwards of $4,000 for it. The material was the only issue. Professor and TA were beyond fantastic.",
    "I liked how the course focused on four interventions and had students complete them rather than just write clinical essays on the four topics of nutrition, physical activity, mental health and social support. It really forced us to confront the difficulties people have with adhering to interventions while showing us the downsides of 'paternalistic medicine'. While I appreciated the interventions, I believe it is better to focus on having students do one or two interventions rather than do all four. If the purpose of implementing the goals is to teach us what it will be like for future study\/intervention participants then it makes more sense to only do one or two interventions.",
    "I really enjoyed your new pioneering way of teaching this course. It was very creative and refreshing. I enjoyed writing reflections & gave me an opportunity to think about the takeaway points of the course rather than memorizing them. I felt like I was living the course rather than chasing for points. Thank you.",
    "This class is phenomenal and helped me to understand not only health problems that face the feild of public health but also helped me to take control of my own health",
    "Work load too heavy.",
    "This course was interesting. I really liked Professor White and think she is a dynamic lecturer with a lot of interesting ideas. However, I did not enjoy the assignments for this class. I felt like there were never any clear guidelines or any clear learning objectives so I walked away not knowing much more than I knew before taking the class. I essentially learned about the different topics just by searching online for articles to site in my assignments. So I think the topics discussed in the class were important and interesting, but I think the assignments and class need to be more structured and learning objective based.",
    "I enjoyed the class because it was relevant to my personal health behavior and lessons that I learned during class were things I could implement in my personal life. The activities and behavioral changes were fun but the assignments (the write ups) were tedious at times.",
    "Very unique course, one that really puts theory to practice.",
    "It seems odd to tie students' grades to their health behaviors and goal-setting. As a result of the current structure, students are punished for being overly ambitious and not meeting their goals. Also, the entire course is basically a process of self-evaluation. Overall, I felt like I would've learned more from traditional teaching and grading methods. I feel like I churned out a lot of personal reflections during the semester about my own health behavior, but that these reflections did not make me a more skilled public health practitioner. I'm not sure I learned how to meaningfully apply any concepts in social and behavioral health to intervention design. I felt like the takeaway from the course was \"social and behavioral determinants of health matter\" but this is something that all the MPH students probably had a good sense for at the beginning of the semester as well.",
    "Really, this class could be reduced to a seminar featured around the four main topics: physical, mental, nutritional, and social support\/discipline. The assignments were incredibly tedious, and the lab sections were altogether unnecessary. While I understand that it is required by the MPH curriculum, I didn't feel the course added any value to my education. I definitely did not look forward to class, and found the assignments a chore.",
    "good",
    "Interesting topics, but the material could be presented in a more academic, sophisticated manner, with more evidence-based examples of how behavioral changes are important to public health, etc. The goals were unique, but believe having us set them for one behavioral change instead of all of them would be more appropriate, as they got repetitive. Additionally, I found the discussion section activities to not be that helpful for learning the topic. Instead, maybe they can focus more on real-world examples of behavioral change strategies?",
    "This class is very different from the rest at YSPH. There are no tests, but there are a lot of smaller assignments. I thought that it was interesting, but the premise of grades and grading itself were really subjective.",
    "The course teaches good lessons but would benefit from more structure. The mixture of lecture and personal activities is still a work in progress. Needs some more scaffolding for subjects to sit on, rather than to float freely in air as they currently do.",
    "Strengths: - If you are planning to design public health interventions, this course is a really good way of understanding how to best implement them. I thought of the behavior changes as an exercise in empathy for the people who may be recipients of an intervention I gleaned insight into what makes for more sustainable interventions because you had to sort of take part in one yourself and of your own design). - Marney is an incredibly caring professor she really wants the best for her students, which was reflected in the design of this course. Behavior changes were a way for us as grad students to better care for ourselves in what can be a stressful environment, so I very much appreciated it. Weaknesses: - While encouraged to continue behavior changes for the entire semester, the compulsory period was 5 days. I found that 5 days may have been a little too short it was easy for me to discontinue behavior changes after that period of time. I would suggest increasing the 5 days to perhaps 10 days. - There were a lot of mini assignments for this course that proved a bit tedious and repetitive at some points during the semester. I would have liked to have perhaps combined some of those assignments into a larger one (e.g., for each behavior module, have the behavior change summary and diversity assignment together in one assignment rather than having two separate ones).",
    "Strengths- This course was extremely beneficial to take as a public health graduate student. I gained a better understanding of paternalistic medicine and the obstacles of applying individualized interventions on a community level. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this course. I enjoyed the weekly discussion sections that solidified our understanding of the concepts we learned throughout lecture.",
    "Initially, I was quite interested in this course. Professor White is an knowledgeable and humorous lecturer, and the subject is one which has interested me for some time. But in practice my experience was poor. A lot of the material seemed very basic and surface-level. Or just common sense. All students come to courses with different backgrounds and experiences, so perhaps the information was more useful for others. I also found that the assignments were repetitive and sometimes not clearly described. Grading seemed to vary between discussion groups. Getting full marks seemed next to impossible, which removed my motivation to even try for an honors grade. It was overall a disappointment."

Genuinely cared about improving student's physical\/mental\/social health, so used the class as a semester-long intervention to make us healthier, while having us learn about interventions through practice. No memorization about social theories, or intervention studies, or stressful exams\/quizzes. Just improve your life, and learn something along the way. Enjoyed the class. Enjoyed the pop culture references. Weaknesses: Lectures could get a little boring (maybe it was the material). Sometimes it felt like Marney was talking to herself..",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Good instructor. Understands the subject well and good advocate for the students.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0- Very knowledgeable Professor whose lectures on social and behavioral science theory were very informative. - Content of lectures drew from a lot of empirical data from various studies. I enjoyed learning about these studies. - Dr. White did a very good job with ensuring that we become critical thinkers when reading articles in any way related to public health media analyses throughout the semester, as well as final media analysis assignment ensured this.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strengths- Dr. White was an incredible instructor. She was engaging, funny, and made the concepts of the course come alive through our health interventions. I really liked that she did not have exams for this course- she emphasized the importance of understanding interventions in a very practical manner. Thank you for making the semester both eye opening and productive Marney!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I liked her. She has a lot of interesting personal experience in the field. She was perhaps hampered by the introductory nature of the course. I did feel that some of her lectures and assignments needed more focus. I would potentially take another class with her, especially something on public health marketing."

   "comments": [
    "Easy A: take this class!!!",
    "Strongly recommend",
    "So interesting, and very engaging.",
    "I think this course helps you to understand the challenges in devising a plan that will actually promote adherence to wellness goals. I would recommend it to another student, but I think more information about social and behavioral topics needs to be included.",
    "Good course",
    "If you want a different class experience compared to everything offered at YSPH- take this class!",
    "Great and easy course. You get to make goals for yourself: nutrition, mental health, physical activity, and social support. There is a low workload and the TA's and Marney really care about your success with the behavioral goals and your stress levels with the class. Getting to participate in a public health campaign is something you wont be able to get in any other class.",
    "Marney's great. It's nice to have some time and encouragement to focus on your own health. However, writing the reflection papers quickly becomes tedious. I felt a bit like I was being treated like a child in the discussion sections.",
    "Take it. It will improve your life if you take the interventions seriously. You will feel better, physically, mentally, and socially. It's required anyways, so why not?",
    "I would recommend this course to a student who had no background in this topic. As someone who studied the material in undergrad, I didn't feel as if I really learned anything new. I was hoping that because it was a graduate level course, I would get an in-depth understanding about the topics we spoke about in class but felt that extensive information was lacking.",
    "It's a really basic behavioral health course. Unless you have to take it, I would not recommend because you won't learn anything new.",
    "Avoid this class. The topics are fluffy, discussions sections are incredibly awkward and forced, and the likelihood of you learning anything new is close to zero. This is the worst course I've taken at Yale, and likely the worst I've taken anywhere.",
    "I would recommend this course for fellow students as a way to understand the effects of public health interventions and policy recommendations.",
    "This course is fun and different. I wish I had learned a bit more \"factual\" information, but overall the experience was very positive.",
    "Yes, a very good class",
    "You preform interventions on yourself and learn who you are in the process!",
    "Although the behavior change was not as effective as it could have been since many students lied about the success rate, I enjoyed the class. I would recommend it to students who I think will take it seriously, because many people thought the class was a joke and failed to see the reason behind the semester-long assignment.",
    "Yes, recommend. Great professor and TAs",
    "I love this course",
    "Pretty easy and improved my personal habits.",
    "I would definitely take this course with Marney. This course is very different and very chill.",
    "Besides the heavy workload and sometimes common-sensed classes, everything is good.",
    "I really enjoyed the structure of the course, but it was also challenging to blur academic-personal life boundaries and incorporate the material into our everyday lives with the behavior change interventions. It was a unique learning experience, though, and balanced the lecture material well. The material was interesting and introduced concepts that are very relevant to all concentrations. Marney was so fun and engaging, would definitely recommend taking this course!",
    "Sure! It would be a different experience for them!",
    "perhaps yes. it seems more fun to me than something useful, especially for those who are interested in dealing with data.",
    "This course is required and, unlike other courses, is extremely difficult to waive out of given Marney's requirements. Given this, I would definitely suggest taking it first year as it's actually helpful in striking a balanced schedule outside of coursework. Given my personal academic background, I maintain that there was not really any new educational content conveyed in this course which is why I sought out waiving the course at first, but nonetheless, lectures were an enjoyable time.",
    "It's an amazing course with a wonderful professor. I highly recommend taking this course just to learn new and amazing things about social behavior and how this affects health. However, the amount of time you invest will vary depending on who ends up being your TF.",
    "No, given the busy work and unfair grading.",
    "I highly recommend this course to everyone, and especially to all first year students. This course definitely helped me with my graduate school transition. It has helped me prioritize my health which is very important.",
    "Highly recommended as it brought physical and behavioral changes in my attitude towards my and community health.",
    "Yes. Doing behavior changes is a great way to learn. This class allowed me to relax and focus on what is really important in life.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to all MPH students.",
    "I recommend this course to any students pursuing the field of public health.",
    "This class is amazing an I would absolutely recommend it to anyone considering the course",
    "This class is required, so most students have to take it. It is useful, interesting topics are discussed. It needs more structure that helps students actually learn the material and walk away with tangible lessons and information.",
    "My favorite course.",
    "It's a great and fun course but if you have already taken a psychology course, then you may find the subjects redundant.",
    "Very much.",
    "You have to take it--but you probably won't find it very helpful.",
    "good",
    "I liked that this class didn't have tests, and most of the grading was predicated on whether you submitted weekly assignments. We got extra credit for (self-reported) completion of personal goals. I thought that this drove home the points about how difficult interventions are to design and implement, but I also don't think that I learned much from the class.",
    "I recommend taking this course. You will get a lot out of it if you are diligent about the behavior changes and think deeply about how concepts from the lectures inform your experience.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. The course was very enlightening in understanding how health interventions work on a population and individualized level. I really enjoyed this course and look forward to taking another course taught by Dr. White in the future.",
    "I would not recommend this course because I found it too vague and superficial. I would recommend another course taught by this instructor."
