   "comments": [
    "Learned how to view issues of migration through a lens of political philosophy and law.",
    "This source provides a fantastic overview of classical political theory and transitions throughout the semester to contemporary writing on theory and immigration law. It covered everything I expected to learn and more, and I feel like I can speak on the topics of the course well now.",
    "I was able to see how philosophy could be applied to the real work, in international law. I also improved my writing.",
    "I developed an understanding of the theoretical backing of modern immigration thought as well as its application to contemporary issues",
    "A deeper understanding of the importance of citizenship, nationality, and state borders for political theory and philosophy; the ways in which theoretical may be and have been applied to political decisions",
    "This course was interdisciplinary by virtue of the professor's interests. I benefitted greatly from both the theoretical and empirical readings of the course, and the lecture materials together was a thorough meditation on questions of theory and practice. The intellectual history component of the course was very important, although there could have been more of a bridge with contemporary philosophers. The legal elements were what interested me in particular, but many of those lectures ended up being given by guests.",
    "A comprehensive knowledge of a canon of thought about immigration law, citizenship and refugees. Modes of thinking about the issue and different possible analytical lens through which to interpret modern phenomena of statehood and citizenship.",
    "This is a great course for understanding some of the arguments on all sides of the immigration debates in the US and abroad. The readings are complex and fascinating, and the assignments are thoughtful.",
    "I gained a grounding in the Western canon of political philosophy, international law, and cosmopolitan rights.",
    "This class provided a historical, philosophical and political take on migration.",
    "This course provided an invaluable introduction to the political philosophy behind today's conceptions of citizenship and borders.",
    "Excellent insight into major theories, tensions, and questions related to immigration, the status of refugees, the justification of borders, the notion of citizenship, and the nation state. Also learned about some concrete recent legal\/historical\/sociological developments. I was challenged to think critically about theses issues and analyze the material from class towards forwarding my own arguments related to these topics.",
    "A really good, overall understanding of the philosophical underpinnings of the nation-state, theories of citizenship, and a less rigorous but still substantial knowledge of migration trends.",
    "Prior to this class, I had never taken a political philosophy class at Yale before. This class challenged me to approach issues that I care about in a different way that required I think more critically and theoretically about them and to challenge the assumptions we make about borders and migration without falling into the trap of being purely theory with no real world application. It taught me how to investigate questions of migration etc from a philosophical angle and to write logically rigorous papers defending such arguments."

   "comments": [
    "This was a good but not great course. Perhaps I was not thrilled because of a lack of personal interest, but I often wondered what this course was accomplishing. Professor Benhabib is an excellent and renowned lecturer. But, often times, it felt that the lectures were an exercise in pretentious and useless political theory. I love political theory even in its most abstract forms; but I believe rigorous reasoning in political theory must be ultimately well-connected to the real world for it to have value. I don't know if I learned much from the course.",
    "The lectures generally summarized the readings, which left something to be desired.",
    "I loved this course! No changes whatsoever.",
    "As someone who is not very well versed in political theory, the course seemed a little advanced at times. I would recommend that one section be spent on teaching the students how to write an effective political theory essay. A guide would have been useful. Other than this, Professor Benhabib was extremely comprehensive in her lectures and I enjoyed the input of the guest speakers.",
    "Readings were very interesting, lecture and section were both very boring. Prof. Benhabib merely summarized our readings but didn't really engage with them beyond that.",
    "This course provides a fascinating analysis of the intersection between ideal political theory and modern politics. Learning from Professor Benhabib is a real luxury. However, her lectures are sometimes rather slow (especially at the beginning of the course, when the lectures review the readings very closely) and at other times, way too fast-paced (especially toward the end of the course). It would have helped me if there was a better balance between the pace of the first part and the second part of the course. I also really liked the guest lectures.",
    "Great lectures and fantastic syllabus - even though I had read some of the texts before, encountering them in a different context with specific questions was worthwhile. More historical focus would have been good, although it is to be expected that a philosophy\/political science course might not be able to do this.",
    "Professor Benhabib's lectures were great- I wish she had given more of them. She has her own methodological readings of the philosophical texts, so I would've liked to hear her take more. Her guest lecturers were great as well, but those course days often felt a bit disjointed from the flow of the course.",
    "Strengths: Great readings, challenging, thorough, comprehensive. Seyla Benhabib was so knowledgeable and inspiring.",
    "Strengths: - Coherent\/interesting readings and syllabus - Sections worked well with the course Possible improvements: - Wish Prof. Benhabib spent more time on content beyond summary of readings. Her expertise could be better used on evaluation\/exploring implications etc. I think students can be expected to have done and understood (to some extent) the readings. - Essay topics got better as the term went on. Wish we were given the option of writing longer papers",
    "Strengths: good progression of themes in the course (from early to modern takes on philosophical debates on borders and citizenship); engaging lectures Weaknesses: to much of a focus on philosophy and not looking at actual policies until closer to the end of the semester; all of the assignments were rushed and pushed to the end of the semester and could have been spread out more evenly; course needs more of a stressed ewarning when it comes to having some background in philosophy",
    "The strengths of the course are in Professor Benhabib's lectures and the quality of the readings, as well as the TAs. The only weakness is that I felt Professor Benhabib could have been more charitable to some of the anti-cosmopolitan viewpoints, and more of a focus on those and how their arguments interact with the cosmopolitans would be great.",
    "Lectures weren't terribly interesting and the readings were often dense and long, but section was fantastic, the readings were interesting, and the essay prompts were varied and rigorous.",
    "The readings were incredibly interesting, the syllabus as a whole was very strong, and Professor Benhabib was a great lecturer. The section complimented the class very well.",
    "It offers a comprehensive survey of disciplines, authors and schools about migration issues. The course may benefit from a greater emphasis on policy and law at the expense of its philosophical aspect. The latter dominates the course and it may be better for them to be on the equal footing, receive similar amount of time and space etc.",
    "This course has a very strong reading list - you will enjoy the readings and get a lot out of them. Benhabib's lectures are not the most dynamic, but, because they are shorter then usual, you will not get bored. My TF for this course was fantastic.",
    "Overall excellent class. The organization is very good and Seyla Benhabib is a knowledgeable and purposeful lecturer. No major weaknesses.",
    "The reading was substantial but not especially so. It takes a few weeks for everything to start making sense together, but it really does. This particularly gave me a new way of thinking about the classical political thinkers from a more modern, critical but still supportive angle.",
    "This course was incredible to take because it is so relevant to the way we approach the world and to our political environment, not just now in particular but always. It investigated questions of belonging, citizenship, borders, nationalism, and migration in a way that delved into both classical and contemporary philosophy, which was a huge strength of the course because it provided the framework for discussing contemporary migration issues from a philosophical and rights-based perspective. While the initial setup of the course through classical philosophy was a drag, it set up the discussion in a way that contextualized the modern thinkers we read and ended up feeling hugely necessary. The main weakness of this course was that lectures were set up to only really summarize the readings we had. There was little analysis, discussion, or pushback. Given Prof. Benhabib's tremendous expertise in this field, I think thencourse would have benefited hugely from more dynamic lectures."

   "comments": [
    "I wouldn't urge another student to take this course. I didn't learn much and there are countless other classes at Yale from which students can get more out of.",
    "Yes! For any student wanting to understand the moral and utilitarian dilemmas of migration policy internationally.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to other students interested in political philosophy in general but especially those interested in global affairs and the politics of immigration. Professor Benhabib, the teaching fellows, and the guest lecturers were all greatly helpful and informative.",
    "This class exceeded my expectations for what classes could be at Yale. This class was special because of its intersection between international law, human rights, and philosophy. I hadn't been exposed to any of these fields before, and the class made me extremely excited about pursuing them in the future.",
    "An extraordinary and topical class. Prof. Benhabib is brilliant, and the course combines the philosophical canon, from Aristotle, Rousseau, and Locke through some modern critical theory, with legal theory and caselaw.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone with a political theory background and an interest in immigration issues.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course - especially for DS grads (and Prof. Benhabib is rarely on campus, so if it's offered it might be the only opportunity)",
    "I would definitely recommend this course if it will be taught again. It's a very expansive introduction to migration in a globalizing world. There are both theoretical and empirical readings, although it is more heavy on the philosophy side. Unlike previous years, I think, you absolutely do not have to have taken DS to thrive in this course. It will be more work since you may be reading some of these thinkers for the first time, but what's important is getting as much as you can out of the lectures, which are fantastic. Professor Benhabib developed her own intellectual history about the construction of 'citizen' out of classical and modern political philosophers, and it's worth hearing her connect it to real-world situations instead of solely reading her books.",
    "Yes! If you are remotely interested in what makes a citizen, what duties international organisations owe to the stateless, what rights we have as a human being to community and belonging, and the modern phenomena of statelessness",
    "Yes, most definitely! However, I would warn students that the class takes up a lot of time (especially if you do not have a thorough background in philosophy). The payoff is worth it in my opinion. Although I did not academically perform as well as I would have liked to in this course, it nevertheless helped me narrow down my academic interests. I am now looking into taking more human rights and immigration focused classes within my major in the future.",
    "This is a fascinating exploration of citizenship and border closure that spans from Aristotle to 2004 UN court briefings. Professor Benhabib is an excellent professor who has interacted deeply with all the material we cover. She is a brilliant lecturer. This was a timely course for Fall, 2016, and Professor Benhabib wove current events well into the course. I highly recommend it.",
    "Yes, as a foundational\/survey course.",
    "Absolutely. Professor Benhabib is extremely knowledgeable and the topic is timely and interesting. If you are at all interested in citizenship as a concept (or even more generally are interested in political philosophy) the class is worth taking.",
    "Definitely, especially if the area of migration studies is of interest.",
    "I absolutely recommend this course! Take it!",
    "YES! Excellent course with a deep chronological review of the theories, questions, conflicts, etc. relevant to immigration, refugee acceptance\/law, the idea of borders and closed borders, liberalism, the nation state, citizenship, etc. Towards the end we also learned about some concrete recent historical, legal, or sociological developments. I found the readings and lectures to both be substantive and feel I have come away with a solid grasp on the issues relevant to immigration and refugee studies. The papers really challenged me to think about the questions raised in class--be aware, they really expect not only analysis but for students to strongly forward and support their own argument. With that said, they are doable. Section was fabulous with Mie and was like having a seminar in addition to the lecture. I found the class overall to be interesting, engaging, and thought-provoking. However, prospective students should be aware that this is a theory heavy course and sometimes gets caught up in abstract political philosophy. But it is still quite accessible--I did not have that much prior exposure to this kind of thing but did not struggle.",
    "This course pushed me to re-evaluate my basic assumptions about migration and national identity, and allowed me to more critically consider my belief in open borders. For that, I think it was a hugely worthwhile course that I would definitely recommend. However, the structure of the course would not necessarily have been conducive to what I gained from it had I not had a TF who pushed us to critically engage with the texts and have dynamic discussions about them. The lectures by Prof. Benhabib were generally disappointing and contributed little to what I gained from the course, given that they were almost always summaries of the texts with little analysis or more open discussion of them; any analysis she did provide felt too strongly like her forcing her own view instead of facilitating students' analyses. I think this course would be vastly improved if it were a seminar where Prof. Benhabib's insight could be much better served than simply summarizing readings, or if the structure of the lectures were changed."
