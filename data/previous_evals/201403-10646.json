    "I definitely learned a few things about optics I hadn't thought of before. This course gave me new ways to think about some optical phenomena, which will be helpful in developing and presenting my research.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of optics and refreshed my undergraduate optics, which was also great. I wrote my final paper on transformation optics, which was very interesting. It is a subject that I hope to delve further into in my research, so it was great to get the opportunity to investigate it in a final paper."
