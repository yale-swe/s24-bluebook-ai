   "comments": [
    "Anyone with any interest whatsoever in disability or the role of language in society as a whole (so...a lot of people...) should really take this seminar. The reading list basically just consists of absolutely incredible material that is fun and interesting and the type of thing that you will be glad to have read even if you're not an English or Lit major, and the conversations become really thought-provoking even if you think you're not particularly interested in the subject matter. Definitely consider this class if you have any interest in linguistics and the whole study of language pre- and post-lapsarian.",
    "ONLY IF YOU REALLY CARE ABOUT DISABILITY IN FICTION. IF NOT, IT WON'T BE THAT COMPELLING. THE CLASS RARELY GETS INTO THE LARGER SCHEME OF THINGS.",
    "Take it if you like to read and write, especially about characters on the margins of discourse",
    "The novels you are assigned make for good reading, which makes having to read one novel a week a little more easier. As an engineering major whose other classes were all science courses, getting through the reading was not always possible, but it was never overwhelming. In all, you have to turn in one 3-4 pg paper, one 6-7 pg paper, and a final 12-15 pg paper. Berger never gives an assigned topic for any of the papers, which some people didn't like, but he is always willing to work with you as you come up with one. I definitely recommend this class to anyone whether you are an amst\/engl major or not.",
    "As far as reading contemporary fiction, the class has a great reading list. Prof. Berger can be dismissive, but if you don't mind it, it's a good class.",
    "It's a great class if you want to read a ton of great books and have enough time. Sometimes the reading level is fine, but other times there are 500 pages of reading and a paper due for one class. Really interesting topic which enjoyable reading, but it's a lot."
