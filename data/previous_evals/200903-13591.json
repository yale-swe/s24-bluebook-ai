    "I cannot deny that Professor Oliver is incredibly intelligent, well-traveled, and well-versed in a myriad of environmental issues. However, this course is completely nebulous and pointless. There is no clear connection between lectures, hand-outs\/readings, problem sets, and exam material. I've never taken a class where there is such a distinct disconnect between the aforementioned items. The problem sets serve as advanced, time-intensive Excel exercises and nothing more. I cannot begin to describe how utterly disappointed I am in the quality of this course. This exemplifies everything that is wrong with the structure of our curriculum and bin requirements.",
    "The instructor and the TA was excellent. The assignments helped a lot. Workload was sometimes on the higher side, but that helped in the end.",
    "This class embodies everything wrong with the bin system. I took it out of obligation to fill a bin\/because of scheduling---I rarely had any idea what the point of lectures were, there was virtually no syllabus and a very loose structure to the class. Professor Oliver is one of the most intelligent people I have encountered at FES--his breadth and depth of knowledge is truly impressive. Unfortunately, the class has no structure or clear thesis\/point that I could see, thus wasting his tremendous knowledge and boring students.",
    "This is a nice course but is very introductory and thus tries to cover a few too many topics.",
    "The questions I declined to answer were because I only audited the class and so I did not participate in the homework exercises.",
    "Response to Question 1:The course material was very inadequate. The professors weekly readings were not peer reviewed material, with notes stating everything may not be accurate and numerous statements without citations. I found many of the readings to be mostly the professors opinions and some were very insensitive of other cultures.Response to Question 7:I gave the instructor of this course a rating of poor because much of his lecture was similar to my comments above. There was little room for discussion and questions in the class, and I found the instructor to teach facts that promoted dominant western society ideals and scientific paradigms that neglected other perspectives and cultures.",
    "Q7: Professor Oliver is a very inspiring person and very passionate about the topics he teaches. He listens very well to our questions and gives very satisfying answers. He encourages critical thinking in class, more than most other professors."

    "The comprehensive thought process behind the syllabus",
    "The flexibility of the deadlines meant people could turn in homework when it best suited their schedules; but that meant they were not necessarily in support of anything being covered in class.",
    "an overview of global resources including human, financial, natural and technological resources. It was interesting for policy interest students to have a broader overview of where resources lies and where they are direly needed. or what trade-off can be made between countries.",
    "The course provided a broad overview of many different resource issues and concerns. Chad is an excellent professor and does a great job of integrating disparate pieces of information.",
    "Lectures were interesting and informative.",
    "The topics covered. I think some of the information provided in this class is essential for all FES students\/environmental decision-makers but not necessarily common knowledge. Classes on habitat-protection were especially interesting. The last topic, focusing on energy seemed too basic and not as interesting as the other ones though.",
    "The range of the different topics and issues the instructor covered.",

    "The lectures need to be integrated more with the homework exercises. It felt like I was in two different classes sometimes. We should discuss the exercises after they are due.",
    "More organized slides\/lecture notes.",
    "I can't even begin to answer this question.",
    "The problem sets were sometimes not related to what was covered in class and could be changed so that it's less of looking at graphs and more of an overview of class material.",
    "This class needs structure--a textbook, a theory of change--something. There was nothing to refer back to after class if you didn't understand something. I had more than one binder full of assorted handouts that I could not make sense of. Nothing is posted on Classes V2 (including no syllabus)--lectures consisted of assorted photographs on slides, photocopied in hard copy.The homework sets were a giant exercise of cut and paste in Excel, with very very little value added.",
    "The assignments were very repetitive and were not much help in understanding the subject at hand.",
    "I think the course goes well with its title of \" Global Resources and the Environment\". so narrowing it down will then leave many important global resource untold. I think its O.K so far the title remains Global resources.however, students find it very general course on global resources with not much focus on one resource which kind of makes it a little broader and not specialized course.",
    "The homeworks were sometimes a little tedious. They were useful, but I feel would have been more useful if we spent more time integrating the information.",
    "Course readings and instructor.",
    "The assignments need to be more clear. The TA was great at clarifying when we asked her for clarification, but we should not have to ask clarification each time.",
    "I can't think of something that needs improvement.",
    "Reading Materials could be improved."

Xuemei was reasonably responsive by email, thoughthe phrasing on the majority of the homework assignments was so confusing it was very very frustrating.

    "My undergrad is in Agri science and my current research in in tropical forest ecology. I wanted a course to give me a clear idea about resource availability, use and trends in the planet, to help enhance my understanding of the world with respect to my topics. This exactly was the course I was looking for.",
    "It doesn't in the slightest, and fills a bin requirement...leaving me extremely cynical about the entire bin system.",
    "I am pursuing my MEM degree in Environmental policy, Economics and law. I think it is important to have a global overview of resource distribution in the world and that's why I took this course. I enjoyed the course.",
    "It fulfilled one of the bin requirements for my degree, and informed me more of the dominant global perspective of resources and the environment. However, it lacked a policy focus.",
    "This course provides a great background for anyone interested in pursuing an environmental profession. Some of the information provided broke many of the students' misconceptions related to environmental protection, especially related to habitat protection. I think having a solid background on all environmental issues is necessary for FESers, and this course does a good job at providing it."

I can't imagine we finished the whole globe in a single semester!The very good part of the course i like was when Chad taught us how to do negotiations. The core of the practice was that trading involves the safety of the environment, the practice went further into exploring how can we protect the biodiversity hotspots. The course also had direct link with the environmental economics (Robert and Kotchen) and so i was able to apply materials i learnt from both classes.",

However, while I did learn a more global perspective, the class did not address the issues facing local indigenous and other communities.",
    "Recommendation from 2nd years and FES graduates especially about Professor Oliver.",
    "Because it seemed very interesting and the instructor is extremely knowledgeable.",
    "Because it provided me the essential knowledge about environmental sciences, since i am not in the environmental field."
