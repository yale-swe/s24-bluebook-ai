   "comments": [
    "This class isn't too much work, lectures can be a bit dry, and section is relaxed. Take it if you are interested in the subject or need a 5th class. You'll love how passionate Professor Underhill and the TFs are!",
    "Enjoyable course with just the right amount of breadth for a survey, and just enough depth to be interesting. Covers topics from prehistory up to European contact with Native Americans, with heavy emphasis on the development of 'civilization'. Assignments include weekly readings, weekly section, a midterm, a short (7 pg) research paper, and a take-home final. Sections for this class were actually very interesting because we were able to see and interact with items from the Peabody's basement.",
    "I would recommend it with reservations. It has the potential to be a really interesting class but I do think it needs some restructuring. However, there is only one paper, the midterm, and a take-home essay final so it was a pretty laid back class which was nice.",
    "ANTH 171 is exactly as its title suggests: an introduction to archaeology with emphasis on \"great civilizations\". If you are looking for the classical civilizations (Greek, Rome, Carthage, etc.), this is not the course to take. However, these, including Egypt, were briefly mentioned, and the other (often overlooked) civilizations covered are just as fascinating. Lectures are straightforward but very important! Take notes, as slides are not posted online. The midterms and paper are extremely fair, and Professor Underhill is incredibly friendly and wants you to do well! Sections are interesting, although repetitive and a little excessive, but in general, this class is a good one to take if you are serious about archaeology or just a science major dabbling around in some of the courses Yale has to offer.",
    "It's really easy, but honestly I was so frustrated with how little in the way of critical thinking was expected of me, that I didn't do as well as I probably could have. Professor Underhill is really sweet, but she pretty much turns and flees at any sign of controversy, so the class was predictably boring. There are way more interesting ways to get a gut; don't take this course. I had totake it for my major, otherwise I would have dropped it like it was on fire."
