    "I would have really preferred to take this class in a normal classroom setting. I found the online format really minimized my engagement with the material. I am in graduate school to engage with professors and other students and that was not really possible in this setting. It was a great, interesting course and Professor White was great but the course format really put me off.",
    "I do not like that this course was online. I was hesitant about it in the first place but think I would have got a lot more out of the material if it were an in person course where I could have heard my classmates questions and thoughts on the different items discussed. I also think the assignments were too repetitive. I like the idea of the 4 goals but the assignments for each goal should have varied a bit. Having to write the same paper 4 times became quite burdensome.",
    "The course was alright. I feel like a lot of the lecture material comprised of general knowledge... I don't think I really learned anything new. We got a pretty shallow overview of a lot of the material presented in class, especially in the mental health unit. I think we could have gone a bit deeper and explore the issues as being multi-faceted. I do wish the course wasn't delivered online. Because the course was online, I ended up putting it off till last minute and didn't prioritize it alongside my other courses. I did appreciate the goal-setting aspect of the course, though. It went great in conjunction with the lecture material and the real-life application was a nice challenge.",
    "This course was well-delivered in an online format. It was a good overview of wellness topics and how they might impact public health. I cannot comment on the teaching quality of the TFs, as they did not teach. My only interaction with them was looking at their comments and grades for my assignments.",
    "I really enjoyed this course because it helped me focus on self-care during graduate school. I think the course is great the way it is.",
    "The online component of this course made it convenient yet very difficult to engage with the material. The workload was higher for any other class I was taken which I found to be strange for an online course. The behavior changes were interested but pretty stressful. I felt the need to strictly follow my behavior changes for the course of the semester in order to receive extra credit at the end of the semester.",
    "I did not particularly enjoy this course, or feel that it integrated itself well with the other core classes I took this semester. It felt like an outlier course of some sorts, in that the material was largely isolated from the others. For example, I used biostats in epidemiology and vice versa, as well as integrating both of those in infectious diseases. This class felt more of a personal project, in which I set personal goals for myself just to evaluate myself as a person throughout the semester. I wish there was more study design incorporated into the course, so that an investigative line of thinking is established. More assignments dedicated to a broad public health application would serve the course well, rather than focusing on individual behaviors and feats.",
    "Very comprehensive and thorough. I like the interdisciplinary approach; I often found that material from SBS505 was applicable to my other classes! The behavior change assessments were kind of tedious but I understand why they are important.",
    "the online lectures are easy to follow at your own convenience, but the assignments take more thought and time than expected",
    "the online format was less than ideal",
    "If the point of these course of reviews is unrestrained candor for the purpose of improving the pedagogical experience at the Yale School of Public Health, then I would appreciate that my response not be censored. SBS 505 is an absolute and total waste of time. The professor simply assigns course work for the purpose of allocating each student a score. The grading process is entirely arbitrary, and the rationale provided to us was that only students who go above and beyond will receive the grade of Honors. Now, I completely agree with this premise. However, the nature of the coursework assigned in this particular class is absolutely menial. There is no learning taking place. Most of the assignments are given for the soul purpose of assigning grades. In order to achieve the highest possible grade, one must engage in activities that offer little to no actual learning, which to me is simply paradoxical to the purpose of our being here. This subjective and arbitrary grading process has done nothing but worsen my chances at getting into a competitive graduate program in the future.",
    "Not a huge fan of the online format, assignments weren't particularly difficult, I didn't feel like they expanded my knowledge of public health",
    "Thoroughly enjoyed this course an its instruction. Online is a tough environment but I found that i learned a lot and enjoyed our challenges throughout the semester",
    "Interesting course. Learn by practice.",
    "Very well organized course. However, because it is an online course, it sometimes prevented students from knowing about others' progress and hearing about each other's experience and opinions.",
    "Good!",
    "Course was well organized and content rich. More could've been done for office hours and face to face engagement.",
    "I did not like the fact that it was online, but the course itself was great.",
    "loved marney and think only she could pull off a great class like this in the online format",
    "Really enjoyed the weekly projects. The write-ups were redundant, however, and this course likely should have had IRB approval for the data that is gathered and used in research papers. The taped lectures were great.",
    "I thought the course was really interesting, but I would have gotten much more out of it if not for the online format. I wish it was an in-person course.",
    "Strength - adaptable to student schedules. Focuses on implementation work and understanding how feasible it is for vulnerable populations. Weaknesses - lack of interaction with students in class.",
    "This seemed like a relatively pointless course. The material was so basic I have a hard time imaging how anyone could have not been exposed to it before now. We all know that getting people to eat their vegetables is hard and that sleep deprivation causes stress and vice versa. It was all common sense, I didn't do any of the readings and skipped the majority of the lectures. I think a lot of the problem this term was the online set up. The lectures were delivered in this very weird quasi-talk show format, with Marney interviewing past students. That in itself doesn't make any sense, because these students have presumably taken the course before? So asking questions like \"what do you think this is\" or \"did you know this\" seemed like a weird charade. I don't feel like having the students on there served any purpose. The behavior goals is an interesting format, but of course were easy to fake. Just write up a thing with correct buzzwords and say you did it and you got full credit. Everyone I know did the work for this on Friday, usually a couple hours before it was due. Most people that I know didn't do at least some of their stated behavior goals, but wrote up an appropriate-sounding summary. The final bit, where Marney is going to publish a paper with this data, seems kind of laughable. There's absolutely no way to prove adherence or amount of time the goals were completed. The beginning \"baseline\" survey was administered the week we started, so of course none of us had social support or a work out regimen set up yet. Making statements indicating that this class improved our health is completely baseless. Overall, I feel I learned nothing from this class at all, the material was overly simplistic, and the online platform was a complete bust.",
    "Strengths: The professor, the TFs, goal setting is a good exercise for oneself especially during first year. Weaknesses: I wish there was less busy work.",
    "Wow this class got me to exercise frequently and for that I applaud it as a very enriching and valuable class.",
    "really loved the selection of topics discussed in the course and how the lectures tried to be engaging and relevant",
    "I think that this class could be better if it has been offered in \"actual\" classes, instead of online classes.",
    "Overall, I learned a lot from this course. However, I wish it hadn't been an online course. While Marney made an effort to provide students with the chance to meet her (ex: lunches), all those spots got taken quickly and meeting her in person was difficult. Additionally, I found myself often wanting to talk about the material we were learning. If the course must maintain an online component, YSPH should consider making it a hybrid course. Perhaps keep lecture videos online, but then have small weekly discussion sections for turning in homework and discussing the latest topics. I think that would be very conducive to learning.",
    "This is a great class that covered a wide range of important and interesting topics. The personal health improvement projects are a great way to learn and also an important experience to undertake as public health students who may be trying to encourage such changes in other people in the future. My primary criticism of this class was the online format. I feel it minimized my engagement with the course, instructor, and other students. I am in graduate school to have those kinds of classroom engagements and interactions that were not possible with this class. I feel strongly that YSPH should not utilize the online format for courses during the semester.",
    "Content is dull and not Master's-level material--should focus more on the science and public health aspects of the various issues. Seemed ridiculous that so little actual information was provided in the class given how much we pay to learn here. The structure wasn't great--while I understand what Marney was trying to do with having us do our own little interventions in our own lives, this really wasn't helpful with regard to learning material. Also a waste of time. All assignments were busy work with no point.",
    "I enjoyed this course. I was hesitant about the online platform but it ended up being okay. The TFs were great. However, I worry that with other instructors that aren't as great as Marney, the online platform will be a problem. I also wish we had talked more about social determinants of health, health disparities, and intersectionality. For a lot of YSPH students, this is their only exposure to the more social sciences side of public health (e.g. biostats students). I think it's important that we talk more about these issues.",
    "The online course format made it easy to complete the assignments when convenient throughout the week. There were several weeks with significantly more assignments\/work though, which could have been better if they were spread out more (for example, a blog quiz, a summary statement, and the intervention development assignment were all due the same week). It was helpful for the assignments to have the list of questions to answer, but perhaps a grading rubric would also have been helpful if provided.",
    "For me, this class helped me form some habits like eating more vegetable and fruits, keeping exercise regularly, which made my body healthier than before. However, I do not like the online format of this class since it reduced students participations.",
    "This course can help you lead a healthier life.",
    "This class was horrible. Lectures were too basic. Premise of doing personal behavior change modifications does not work with an online course b\/c so much of what is valuable about this idea is the social support you get through section + going to lecture all together. Too easy, but lots of busy work. Grading was arbitrary and varied greatly based on who your TA was for that section. Also, changing TAs all the time meant it was impossible to build a close relationship with any of them. Overall, this course was horrible. And, negatively affected my mental health b\/c I was stressed about the behavior change assignments. Really should not be required for people who have an understanding of the topic already.",
    "I honestly grew to hate this course over the course of the semester. The material we covered seemed to be somewhere around the 6th grade level. We all know vegetables are good for you, why do I have to find a citation for that? The TA's had VERY inconsistent grading so you had no idea what you needed to do from week to week. It was difficult figuring out what level of work needed to be submitted to please each TA. The course was not meant to be an online course. It was not something I enjoyed doing every week. The behavior change assignments SUCKED! And replacing exams with a weekly essay was terrible. I just really did not like this course.",
    "Strength is that the class help student have a better general understanding of how to live a healthy lifestyle using nutrition, physical activities, mental health and social support with an unique teaching modules. The interaction with the instructor and TA is very limited. The goal-setting and goal tracking process can be improved",
    "Strengths: Concentration on primary literature on social and behavioral implications in health. Interventions brought the issues discusses closer to home, and prompted students to make active changes in their lives. Weaknesses: Extra credit portion - While this is not a commentary on the validity of my own participation, I would be willing to bet that very few people answered these surveys honestly. This sort of assignment puts students in a bind because they feel guilty about lying about their completions of the behavior change, but they also don't want to fall behind everyone else by not getting these extra points. What about those who are already on top of many of the issues that the behavior changes aim to address? I don't think the default assumption should be that all graduate students are out of shape, overstressed, eat unhealthily, and have little social support. I acknowledge that these are all issues that widely afflict this demographic, but they are not the default. I feel that the behavior change intervention assignments were posed as if they were the default. Nevertheless, no matter how \"together\" someone seems to have their lives, there is always room for new projects and improvements.",
    "This course was honestly a joke. There was no rigor and I can honestly say that I did not learn anything new.",
    "strengths: good overall curriculum goals and experiences weaknesses: too many assignments",
    "I liked that we could watch the videos at our own pace. It would be better if assignments were due Saturdays instead of Fridays.",
    "Very interesting course, very organized and passionate instructor. The material was exciting and relevant, and the assignments were very organized and aligned well with the material each week. The online format was excellent- the best and most engaging online course I have ever taken.",
    "I do not think this course should be taught online. I think that there were miscommunications, a disconnect and I think I learned less because of the nature of the way the course was set up. If this course were taught in a classroom, I could have learned from my peers and the questions they ask during lectures. I also feel like Marney has so much to offer and I only was able to scratch the surface of what she could teach me because of the pre-recorded lectures. While I greatly enjoyed the 4 goal setting style of this course, I think the assignments were too repetitive. I think we should have to 4 goals setting assignments but maybe change up the other writing assignments a bit more so you don't end up writing essentially the same thing 4 times.",
    "I do not know why taking this class is required for MPH students at YSPH. If taking at least one class in SBS is required for MPH, students should be allowed to take other SBS classes that are more applicable to his\/her interest. Learning about behavior change interventions can be helpful if we were not being used as study subjects. I would rather learn about study design and different methods to conduct and analyze your data than having to force yourself to do something for extra credit (we're not in middle school)",
    "The course was highly engaging and the course material was very relevant to the MPH program.",
    "Loved the course:)",
    "I want to preface this evaluation with the fact that I thought the material at hand was interesting and engaging, and that Dr. White is extremely knowledgable in her field. However, having it been the first time this class was taught online I think there are a number of changes that need to be made. 1. I enjoyed that this class was taught online for the fact that each student was able to \"attend\" class and work it into their schedule where they saw fit. However, it often felt odd watching pre-recorded video lectures that were with students who were all aware had taken the class before. I think in the future it would be more engaging to either have the option of attending live lecture (either in an actual class or doing it virtually like the last lecture of the semester), or perhaps recording the lectures a week prior to their release with actual students currently enrolled. I think this would also make the course more engaging, as the material could be adapted with the cohort of students, and questions\/concerns that have been brought up (either on the discussion board or directly to Dr. White) could be incorporated into the lecture. 2. More along the lines of being able to adapt lecture to the cohort of students, I was a little disappointed that this class was not as broadly applied to public health as I had wished. I thought the material\/behavior change units were interesting, and Dr. White did bring in a lot of chronic epidemiology examples and data to support what she was saying. However, as this is a core course, I would have appreciated more examples from infectious disease and health policy. The behavior change units were applied very much on an individual level and only in our reflections did we truly broaden them to public health interventions. I think it would have been interesting to expand the concept to how do we change behavior, say, in a high prevalence area of HIV, to decrease the impact of the disease? How does policy aid in this behavior change or make it more difficult to implement these interventions? 3. Perhaps my most significant concern with the class was that the grading was inconsistent, and at times, unfair. Going from TF to TF, the approach to grading varied (some thought only those who go above-and-beyond, which was ill-defined, should get honors, some took off points on blog quizzes even when you showed that you had watched lecture and engaged in the readings, etc.). Furthermore, Dr. White mentioned in the last lecture that very few would be getting honors, and implied most with honors would be those who did the extra credit. My biggest concern with this is that many (if not the majority) of students who filled out the extra credit link lied. This was often talked about openly throughout YSPH. While I'm sure Dr. White is fully aware of the bias, in the publication we read from last year's class data, as well as the last lecture discussion, bias was largely not addressed\/discussed.Therefore, those of us who decided to be honest for the sake of the research Dr. White is publishing, as well as our own studies\/moral reasons, are being punished. Obviously we are unaware of our grades at this time and so do not truly know where we stand in the class. However, I would be quite frustrated if those of us who received over 90% in the class, but did not fill out the extra credit link, receive a grade lower than honors.",
    "I appreciated the concept of the course--teaching public health behavior change concepts through our doing them ourselves. I think that having the course in an online structure made these assignments a bit less effective because there wasn't as much accountability and discussion as there could have been in an in-class environment.",
    "This course was severely disappointing. I would have appreciated warning that I would be a research subject during this course much farther in advance, instead of at the end of the course. I also would have liked to know the grading scheme--no other course is so reluctant to assign Honors grades. I would submit an assignment that addresses every prompt and receive feedback that said, \"Great job!\" but I would have received a High Pass (8.4 or something) with no explanation of how to improve my work or why I had 1.6 points deducted. In fact, at the beginning of the course, TFs would grade assignments as they saw fit, but then the instructor would go through and arbitrarily deduct points because she didn't want everyone to get Honors. Instead, the only way to earn Honors was to participate in extra credit, which I declined at the very beginning of the course when I did not know that it was otherwise impossible to earn Honors. Those who did participate in the extra credit were encouraged to commit academic dishonesty, because your extra credit points depended upon how many self-reported days you completed health behavior changes. This dishonest feedback was then used for the instructor's research, of which the ethics were dubious at best. We were given a consent form at the END of the course (which was due for points in the class) and it only had a \"yes, I consent\" button. In order to decline, you had to send an email to the instructor or TF, which was obviously not going to happen because I was worried that my grade would reflect my refusal to consent. So not only did it feel coercive on the part of students, her research does not reflect the quality that should be expected of Yale because students' responses were not likely to be accurate.",
    "The course was well-designed, though the personal interventions and summaries felt somewhat monotonous after some time.",
    "This was the first online course I have ever taken, and I appreciated how interactive and engaging it turned out to be. I really appreciated the opportunity to improve my own health while learning about behavior modification techniques in public health. I would have appreciated more significant feedback on some of my work, as I occasionally was confused why I performed better or worse on certain assignments.",
    "The class helped me lead a healthier, more balanced lifestyle by giving me opportunities to create specific goals related to physical, mental, nutritional, and social health and carry them throughout the semester. Although I enjoyed these challenges, the sheer amount of work required for this course felt overbearing at times. It would have been better if students did not have to do so much work, this course would have been more enjoyable.",
    "The class was not very rewarding and will not be helpful in my career, particularly in its online format.",
    "too many assignments each week ...",
    "I had numerous issues with the structure and grading of this class. In Dr. White's final lecture, she stated, \"as you know, it is a core course, which means that very few honors are given out, and in all core courses, it's only reserved for the extremely exceptional work.\" From my experience, this is simply not true. Other core courses have numerical cutoffs in their syllabus, such as above a 90% grants honors. Other courses started off with last year's class statistics, showing that many students in other core courses received honors grades. Grades seemed extremely subjective. Students would often receive HP+ of H- grades with the only comment being \"great work!\" There was no indication of why points were lost or how students could improve. We received many \"4.45\" grades, which seems like a arbitrary reduction of points. I thought the reason YSPH did not use ABC letter grades to to avoid grades such as HP+, so this was frustrating. I even received a \"B+\" on an assignment, which was frustrating as this is not a grade at YSPH. This really showed that grades in this class were basically translated into ABC letter grades. My biggest issue was grading not being compatible with what we learn in the course. Self-efficacy was a major topic we covered. During the first few weeks of the course, I worked very hard on all assignments, watching and taking notes on the lectures, completing all the readings, and spending time on the assignments. Despite this, I would continue to score H- or HP+ grades with no feedback. When a peer asked a TF why many students consistently received HP+ or H- grades, this peer was told that HP was the starting grade baseline, and we would have to go above and beyond to move up from there The TF specifically stated that they were supposed to limit Honors grades. As time went on, my self-efficacy decreased. I felt as though no matter what I did on these assignments, I could not achieve an honors grade, so I stopped putting work into the class. It is very frustrating to get the same exact grades (HP+ and H-) when I put extra work in as when I put little time into the assignments. When I stopped putting time into the class, my grades did not change at all. Additionally, grading was inconsistent between different TFs. There were certain TFs that we knew would grade harder than others. I am glad that they rotated to make up for these issues. I also found issue with the extra credit. This should be an assignment, not extra credit, as one cannot realistically receive an Honors grade in the class without completing it. What is more unfair is the structure of the extra credit being based on how many days students completed their behavior change goals. With the desire for extra credit, students are dishonest. It is easy to check a box and say that you completed a goal with nobody to hold you accountable. It is unfortunate that this is the assignment that truly separated Honors from High Pass grades. In the future, I highly recommend that the extra credit is to fill out the survey each week honestly so that you can get real data, not how many days goals were met, as this is an intensive for students to be dishonest. The module structure of the online class was good.",
    "This course was taught online, and I appreciated the flexibility of online lectures but wish there had been some in-person interactions with Marney and classmates (maybe every other week or once a month even). The topics were important to learn and have as a base for future public health work, and the weekly\/semester health challenges were fun and helpful to complete. I would have appreciated (and probably been more successful) in the challenges if there had been an in-person check-in about challenge progress\/struggles and a more tangible support and motivation system. I think overall this course may have been more effective with online lectures and then in-person discussion sections. Perhaps weekly lectures could be streamed live to those who can watch during a set class time, and then made available to watch later to those who cannot watch during the set time.",
    "I felt to was interesting to cover a variety of topics, but I let that the actual workload of the course was much higher than what I originally expected. I also felt that the online format of the course was a detriment to learning and engaging in course assignments nad projects. Having to watch videos was treated more like a chore rather than an opportunity to learn. I feel the online format could work if there was a way to engage students with their projects for each week and encourage more self exploration rather than simply fulfilling requirements, and for every week.",
    "The online nature makes it easy to adopt the lecture times according to the timetable\/schedule and makes life better. The assignments are also designed very well.",
    "enjoyed the online component and being able to watch lectures on my own time. also liked the organization of the course into units that had consistent assignments. extra credit for maintaining goals was a plus. weakness: grading by TA's was not consistent. providing a rubric that students have access to in order to know how assignments are being grades",
    "Strengths: Empowered students to make positive health changes in their lives through goal setting, taught about relevant\/interesting topics such as nutrition, physical activity, mental health, and social support Weaknesses: Sometimes the homework felt like a lot of busy work, the online nature of the course did not allow us students to get to know each other and the professor Improvement: Just a few less assignments and maybe the first class could meet up in person",
    "Way too many repetitive papers",
    "wonderful class--I learned a lot!",
    "I strongly believe that we should not have online classes. Especially in a course like this where conversations are so important, we should not completely remove this from the course. I think the zoom office hours are silly considering everyone is already on campus and they do not make the office hours more convenient. I think the fact that this was an online course made me take it less seriously and I felt less accountable for my work. Also, in choosing YSPH, we were sold a community feel with small class sized and close relationships to our professors. This course defied EACH of those promises.",
    "Pro: -It's great to be able to improve certain parts of my health the first semester. Con: -This class would've been better in person, but I just prefer that. The online part was good for what it was though.",
    "strength: covered many perspectives of social and behavioral sciences. a good introduction for someone who has never learned this topic before. very flexible since we just need a laptop to watch the lectures at our own convenience. weakness: lack of interactions with the lectures and TFs. the grading criteria are varied across TFs. sometimes there are multiple assignments to be completed in one week. Sometimes, the slides cannot be seen clearly on the screen according to the shooting angle.",
    "This course is a waste of time. Taught basic common knowledge and I wouldve mich rather taken a course relevant to my career. I believe this class should be optional. I couldve easily googled this information. Especially for anyone who has a humanities or social science background, this core class was a disappointing waste of time.",
    "It engages us in a new topic each time, we get feedback from our TFs, Marney seems very passionate and engaged, we are challenged to improve.",
    "Great",
    "It is engaging and fun to learn the basics of social and behavioral sciences. The online format is a no go for me though. Puts it down on the priority list",
    "I think what the course teaches is very useful. But the main weakness is it's an online course.",
    "I am furious that this course was online. This is a discussion based course and no one was able to discuss anything with our peers. If you're going to diminish my education with an online course, you should decrease my tuition as well.",
    "This was a pretty basic class; don't know if I necessarily learned much that I couldn't have gotten from a pretty basic public health course",
    "The grading seemed unfair and very arbitrary at all times through the semester. It seemed that mainly the TFs were concerned with meeting a certain quota of HP, H and P rather than giving the grades people deserved. There was also a lot of busy work that was time consuming but not necessary to the mastery of the material and certainly more busy work than other courses. It was unclear as to what level of work would lead to honors and it seemed that the only way to get it would be in doing the extra credit but to be fair I believe it should be possible to get honors both through extra credit and without extra credit. Or it should be made clear that the extra credit is really the only way to get honors in the course.",
    "This course was okay. Much of the information was already known to me and at times did not relate to my focus on infectious disease. The online format often made it hard to engage with the class as it was harder to connect to the lecture and the instructor. I feel like I would have appreciate an in-person version of this class more.",
    "Treats us like we are in high school despite claims to the contrary. Should have us work on meaningful interventions rather than subject ourselves to interventions that are unnecessary (for example- I don't need to exercise more as i already meet the CDC and WHO standards)",
    "Lot more work than expected",
    "Fantastic course!!! The online format worked flawlessly and I would highly recommend that YSPH consider adding more online courses to the schedule. The course honestly did not even seem like it was online--Professor White did a fabulous job of bringing the material to life during the lectures and I appreciated the student visitors in the studio each week. Only suggestion for improvement (although I think this was taken into consideration during the last few weeks): I would have appreciated a timeline of all assignments and deadlines, especially as lectures dd not become available until the Saturday before and not knowing what was due a few days later could become a bit stressful.",
    "It lets you participate in the program, you not only accomplish the course, you have also improve your health condition after taking the course.",
    "The information was very interesting, things I can actually apply to my life. Feedback for this course not helpful, so areas of improvement were always unclear.",
    "Strengths: It was honestly nice having a lower-intensity course to balance out the heavier coursework of others; The online lectures were also appreciated, especially being able to watch them at my preferred speed at my preferred time. Weaknesses: I'm not sure I absorbed anything meaningful from this course; I never felt like was part of a community in taking this course.",
    "Online delivery was effective",
    "I think this course is incredibly valuable for anyone interested in public health. The course is well organized and well designed.",
    "I liked that the online format allowed me to keep up with the class at my own pace and my own schedule but I felt like I lost out on a lot of important interaction with my professor and my peers. I'm paying a lot of money to attend this school and an online class just doesn't seem worth it. Another frustration was with the grading. Switching TAs every unit meant that I could never actually improve my writing style to suit a specific TA and they all graded so differently. I also followed the instructions exactly for every assignment and it was often unclear to me why I was losing points. It also seemed like the assignments really piled up near the end of the semester. There were some weeks near the beginning or middle of the term when we had almost nothing then all of a sudden we would have two or three writing assignments due in a single week at the end of the semester, which I did not appreciate. The workload could have been distributed much more fairly throughout the entire semester.",
    "strength: interesting class and assignments weakness: content could be more advanced and was very simple",
    "Strengths: Online Weakness: You can have all positive feedback on your assignments but still have points deducted",
    "My overall assessment of this course was that it was not public health oriented. This felt more like an intro to psychology course than it did a public health social and behavioral foundations class. The course would have been much stronger if the weekly assignments were less individually oriented and more public health oriented. While I appreciate the idea of having future public health professionals attempt to make the health behavior changes themselves to see the obstacles first hand to making such a change, it felt largely like this course was only a data making source for future papers to be written about our successes and failures with the behavior change rather than attempting to teach us about public health behaviors. I take large issue with the fact that students only receive extra credit if they fully complete the behavior changes and that the recording system for this was an online survey. I understand that it serves as more motivation for students to complete the behavior change goals, but it is very easy for students to lie about their success with the behavior change goals. For the students who feel that lying is inappropriate, they serve to receive a lower grade than students who lied about their adherence to the behavior change goals. Dr. White should not publish the data from this years course because there were students who had false answers for the extra credit and she should be aware that it would be inaccurate and unscientific to publish incorrect data.",
    "This class was comprehensive in nature, but I wish it went into dept more on all topics.",
    "class material lacked depth and overall relevance; only applicable to certain fields such as clinical medicine and social work.",
    "Ive never taken an online class before, but I think this class lent itself nicely to the online format. The behavioral assignment activities were enjoyable, however I felt that grading from different TAs each round was very different. Often I would not get feedback on why certain points were taken off.",
    "This was the first year for the class to be presented online. The material was engaging and very well presented. Professor White was a fantastic instructor and really made the class. I do wish there were more formal opportunities to engage with my fellow classmates, as many of the health challenges we did were tough to sustain without classroom support. However, the online format made this class very flexible and helped to balance classroom work throughout the semester.",
    "It tries to apply interesting concepts to behavioral knowledge. The online system of video lectures is unnecessarily long and tedious.",
    "- enjoyed course, best online class I have ever taken - would absolutely recommend",
    "This class was bad. Why is it a requirement? First, the lectures were extremely basic. I just didn't learn anything. Although it was great to have an easy fifth class, it felt like a waste of my time and I wished I was getting something more out of my education this semester. Second, the assignments all focused on designing individual-level interventions. This strikes me as incompatible with the principles of public health. It was also really invasive to have to provide summaries of my dietary habits and mental health to be graded and evaluated. I found that this class exacerbated some of my anxieties about my body. Also, little guidance was provided on how assignments would be assessed, and grading varied wildly between TFs. I noticed that I was graded more kindly when I adhered to my goals and less kindly when I didn't adhere, even though our grades were supposedly not connected to our performance. This became known by everyone in the class because we rotated TFs weekly -- why? Not only did the online format make it harder to form relationships with any instructors or TFs, but we changed our graders weekly as well. It doesn't make sense. Finally, it came to my attention that students were used for data in studies that Marney intends to publish. In my opinion, this is inappropriate. This class is one of two required classes. Students are given the option to opt out, but Marney did not explain what would happen if we said we didn't want to participate. It felt coercive and misleading.",
    "The idea of the class is to convey that as health professionals, ourselves have to live a healthy lifestyle. It a great class for the first year students, to guide us on behavior change. I really enjoyed the class lectures, and practices I took myself. I wish the class was offered in class instead of online. In that way, it could offer more opportunities for discussion.",
    "I liked the flexibility of having an online class. However, I found the material itself to be uninteresting. It was nice to implement behavioral changes into my daily schedule. I just wonder how many people were really honest with their reports.",
    "The online course flexible our time.",
    "I really did not like that this was a purely online course. I think having the lectures online is fine, but the lack of any in-person component detracted from my overall experience. For a \"social-behavioral\" class it seems odd and incongruous with the material to use a purely online format. I also think that the class focused too much on personal change and did not adequately ground our knowledge in academic literature and other relevant texts.",
    "I think having the class taught in person would be more beneficial to the learning process. I also am unsure as to how beneficial this course is to me as a public health official in the future. I don't think I retained information from it and would rather have used this credit for an elective in the future.",
    "I would have loved in-person conversation and communication!",
    "The prof was pretty good. I just wished we focused a little more on the tenants of social behavior theory and how that can be better applied to public health interventions. We focused almost entirely on our individual behavior changes throughout the semester and although I found them to be somewhat fulfilling I wished we focused on ways to optimize interventions objectively.",
    "This course is alright, though I think it suffered from the online format. The write-ups were repetitive and I felt like it was mostly information that I already knew.",
    "Great course",
    "The content is clear and important. more coding skills practice could be involved.",
    "the overall assessment of the course is average to below average. strengths: the topics covered in class are relevant and real applications to improvements. weaknesses: the design of the course. the subject of the course would have been better taught in person to have that human to human interaction benefit. and most importantly where this course loses the most points in on the grading system. Grading nature of the course is ironic to what the course teaches and discourages you to do well in class. while this course teaches the value of positive thoughts and motivation, the grading system where students have a baseline of HR instead of perfect score made me feel very often incapable of being able to receive a perfect score in this class despite my work and effort. While the professor says that this is a similar grading system is used for all the core courses, i think the way this class is graded is WRONG. by only giving positive comments to students and not providing feedback why they didn't receive a perfect score it doesn't show us (Students) what we need to do to reach that exceptional and honors work. it frame it as students can inherently be good at something to receive the perfect score instead of showing the way that that perfect score can be reached. other than this the course is good!",
    "Very useful and informative; liked the convince of it being on line, but would have liked more discussion with other students",
    "Strengths - I REALLY enjoyed the learning by doing method of this course, and it actually helped me keep myself accountable to my personal health goals outside of this course. This was my favorite course I took this semester, and I am personally interested in learning how to help change health behaviors of people. Weaknesses - Potentially the online component of the course, as I do prefer learning in person.",
    "This course, especially in its online form is, em, I don't want to use the term \"waste of time\" because that seems too harsh, but yes, definitely not a good use of time. Most of the matter is (or should be, to anyone admitted to YSPH) entirely intuitive, it's completely unnecessary to do any of the readings or, in fact, behavioral change, to do well (read - get the grades). The online format is awkward and uninviting. The \"discussions\" with TAs are dull at best and reductionist at worst (three white women saying \"weeeelll like we know it's better for us to eat the apple, but like it's sooooo easyyyy to just reach for the chips, right\" - please. Can we talk about the fact that a decent portion of this country cannot afford to buy an apple in their neighborhood instead of listening to this for five minutes?) I often forgot the class existed until Friday, with the online lectures and uninteresting content. Bottom line, not great. I'm not happy to have spent my tuition money on this.",
    "I do not think this should be online.",
    "I enjoyed the online platform for the course this semester. It made the work\/lectures much more manageable. The instructor was also approachable and invited different students\/panelists each week, which is something I appreciated in the class.The biggest weakness I experienced with the course was the fluctuations in grading between TAs. As a student, it was difficult to track who my TA was, and even more difficult to understand the grading from TA to TA. One week, I would receive full credit without comments, while the next I would receive positive comments throughout my assignment but still get docked. In the future, it might be better that students are assigned to a specific TA (or set of TAs) so that grading is consistent.",
    "The online nature of this course was not conducive to learning the material. Watching the lecture videos and completing the weeks' assignments was more of an afterthought each week. Also, concerning the inclusion of the extra credit assignment, I believe a lot of responses were dishonest. I chose not to complete the extra credit assignment because the thought of maintaining four different goals every day of the semester daunting and stressful, but for those who did complete it, it would have been very easy for individuals to lie about their success each week. Therefore, I also do not think it is wise to base a study on these responses. Returning to the course, there was also a lot of opportunity for discussion that was lost by the course being online. Watching the discussions that happened in the videos was not enough to engage the viewers.",
    "It's not as easy as one would think. Especially if you get a strict TF. It's also a fight for self-motivation and remembering to do the assigned work in time due to the online nature of the course.",
    "Having an online course, while convenient, is not really my preferred style of being taught. I don't feel like I really learned much from this course.",
    "I liked the online format and how responsive the TFs were. I enjoyed having to choose different goals and going through a process of personal behavior change.",
    "Too much writing assignments",
    "Excellent",
    "I thought that the lectures were very interesting, but the rest of the class was quite tedious. Some of the information on nutrition was outdated. Also, some of the assignments felt unnecessary and did not reinforce the information. I also did not enjoy having assignments due every single week. The TA's did not seem to have any rhyme or reason in how they graded.",
    "The strength of this course was the introspective nature of the course assignments. As a behavioral class, it really gave it person the opportunity to reflect and better understand their own behavior. The weakness of this course was that there were so many assignments, possibly to make up for the online manner of the course, and that the sheer volume of assignments made it hard to truly grasp some."

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I think Marney seems like a great professor and very knowledgable about her field but I felt too disconnected with it being online. Her enthusiasm came across in the videos but I felt like I wasn't able to really get involved in this course because of its nature of being online and I really wanted to dig more deeply into the wealth of knowledge Marney can offer.

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White appears to be very well informed, a good communicator, fun, approachable, and passionate about her work. Unfortunately, we didn't get to really interact with her since this was a pre-recorded online class. The \"interview\" format was definitely uncomfortable, and the conclusions drawn for the study that she intends to publish are pretty shaky. It's hard to say what I would have thought about this class had it not been online. I do think that Marney is a good instructor who did the best with the platform she was given. One of her flaws as an instructor may be assuming that everyone in the class is as dedicated to and enthused about the subject as she is.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really appreciate how engaging and caring the professor is towards her students. the course is taught in a quite modern method though I wish we were in a classroom setting. nevertheless the instructor made the course enjoyable and engaging.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0While Marney herself seems really nice and like an interesting person with a lot of great experience, this class is poorly executed and needs a lot of work.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White is responsible and knowledgeable, the only thing I did not appreciate is the format of online courses. Since it reduced the participation of students.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Overall good",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Lectures too slow + basic. Spent too much time chatting w\/ guest students during lectures and not enough time going into depth on the concepts. It feels unethical for her to expect students to participate in her pre\/post research --- by requiring us to complete the survey for class points it does not feel like genuinely voluntary participation. Also, Prof White does not respond well to critical feedback and is quick to lash out instead of honestly contemplating what she has been told.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I think Dr. White was, for the most part, effective at presenting social and behavioral trends as they relate to health, and at highlighting current issues with striking data. I think that the \"talkshow\" format in which the lectures wasn't necessarily the most effective at getting the information across, though I do think it is important to try new things so I think it was worth a try. The information could have more concisely been delivered in much less time with a traditional format, though it may have been more boring in this type of setting. The readings were generally effective in reinforcing lecture concepts. A criticism of Dr. White's teaching style that I have is, as I mentioned earlier, that it tends to cater to those who don't physical and mental health and leaves those who do with less to gain and feeling like the material is obvious. This is not coming from an insensitive position. It is vitally important to inspire those who do not prioritize health or who have external barriers that have prevented them from prioritizing it. However, when the course is designed to target this audience, those who already do prioritize health are given the room to grow that the target audience is.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Excellent instructor. Very engaging and clear, and very responsive to students. It really showed that she wanted to help each student succeed. The course was very well taught and organized, and each week I looked forward to lecture.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I really loved Marney and while her enthusiasm showed through the online videos, I really would have appreciated getting to know her in a classroom setting. The disconnect that was created by the nature of this course really made me feel like I didn't get as much out of what Marney could teach me if it had been in person.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Great professor, very engaging style, I like how she was able to make an online course still feel like a more of a conversation than a lecture.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Dr. White is very passionate and knowledgable about her field. Additionally, she went out of her way to make sure her students knew that they could always come talk to her. It was obvious, especially through the implementation of the behavior change units, that she really cares about students and their health.",

Dr. White offered to have lunch with students to get to meet in person and was very responsive to questions on discussion boards.

This took away from our ability to forma relationship with our profession which is a major selling point for YSPH.",

    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Her lecturing was fine. It could go into more detail\/have more content in lectures. Was somewhat rude when I requested to exempt from the class. She tried to get the poor admin assistant who sent me the spreadsheet of class times in trouble. I wasn't trying to get out of this class because i'm not interested in the subject- I wanted to take a more advanced course. This should have been allowed. This was repetitive of what was in my health psychology class in undergrad and several of my medical anthropology classes (despite the professor's claims to the contrary)",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was good.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Incredible, fantastic professor! Professor White should be a model for all professors--her ability to bring material to life even through a recorded lecture was incredible. She understands the proper way for students to synthesize material and truly changed the way that I think about how lifestyle habits can affect how students learn. YSPH should strongly consider structuring classes in a way that aligns with the mission that Professor White has for students to actually practice and live out the material taught (while staying attentive to social and behavioral lifestyle habits).",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is really great to let you learn the related knowledge and make you think deeper.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Engaged, friendly",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0engaging and clear, made content easy to follow",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strengths: Very engaging, liked how she brought in other professors depending on the topic",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Due to the fact that this is an online course, interaction with instructor is limited (not necessarily a bad thing for an introductory course) and feedback on coursework and class material is strongly dependent on TF grading and comments. However, grading varies between TF and grading criteria lacks transparency.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0I enjoyed the online lectures. I thought they were very clear and informative.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White was helpful and super engaging. She made herself available whenever there were questions, and she was open for discussion. Her lectures were very well put together and easy to follow.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She explains concepts clearly and has good knowledge on a variety of topics. Did not do much in terms of feedback or grading anything relating to the course.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0- professor was engaging and more in touch than professors I saw every week - enjoyed format and intervention designs",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very enthusiastic, but her boundaries with students are inappropriate.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is a great instructor, she made the class organized and encouraging. Although the class was offered in class, she replied the questions in discussion board timely, and clarify the confusions. You can tell that she really put effort into this class, and willing to see us make positive behavior changes throughout the semester.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor Marney is really nice and patient",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White seemed genuinely interested in her subject matter and research, and that enthusiasm was nice to see. However she liked to focus on personal anecdotes instead of the academic material which I found distracting and unnecessary.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is very competent in the field and is qualified to teach this course.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney is amazing! I would have loved to be in a classroom with her.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0really clear",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White truly cares about her students, and she is by far the most empathetic professor I have ever met. Her lectures are informative but also engaging, as she uses interesting articles and personal anecdotes to support her point.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She always has feedback in time.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She is nice and patient.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very knowledgeable and did her best to be engaging\/approachable",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Strengths - Professor White is very engaging and I would look forward to watching her online lectures each week. She presents very important concepts and supports them with very interesting and relevant examples. And I like that she includes a lot of her own personal life and experiences as well. She also made herself very available to students even though this was an online course. Weaknesses - none!",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0She was great on the videos, but I would have liked more FaceTime weekly with her.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Because I didn't get face-time with the instructor, It is difficult to evaluate the instructor due to the unique structure of the course. However, from what I could see, it seemed like Professor White was very engaging and connected easily with students.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0The material of the course at times did not seem applicable to the MPH curriculum, and I think it would be helpful to discuss the content's connection to a variety of interests, rather than just to chronic diseases. Dr. White did a good job in explaining the material.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Love her. I only saw her through the videos but would love to be able to hear a lecture in person. She presents the information in a conversation-like lecture so it's very engaging.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Marney was very responsive via email and did a good job of making the class feel personal despite the online format.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Excellent",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Very reasonable professor. She was a great lecturer and I did enjoy that she used our data to perform a study. I just did not like having all of the assignments.",
    "Instructor: Marney A. White \u00a0Professor White is a good professor. You can tell that she is invested in her subject and interested in her students."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "I would not take this course if you are concerned about how an online course may be. It was distant and disconnected. If this course is ever offered in person I would definitely recommend taking it because I think its all very useful information for someone in the field of public health",
    "I'd recommend it to students who don't have a strong foundation in social and behavioral sciences; this course can definitely deliver that. If I were the student, I'd definitely take it if it were offered in person!",
    "Easy course that positively impacts your personal life. The online format is ideal. I recommend taking this class.",
    "I would recommend this course to pretty much all students\/graduate students who would like to focus more on their overall health and self-care",
    "Overall, I would not recommend this class in this format. Learning was very difficult and somewhat stressful. Most of the course felt like busy work as opposed to real opportunities to learn.",
    "I would not recommend this course, assuming the format remains the same. Even if you are a SBS student, I feel like it does not emphasize public health in a broad enough manner to warrant enrolling (I know it is mandatory). Additionally, the grading is highly variable depending on the TF. If two TFs make the same comments, one gives you a HP- and the other gives a HP+. To me, this indicates disorganization and a lack of a rubric or set of guidelines. This can be very frustrating for a student.",
    "The course is nothing new if you have a background in psychology\/health behavior.",
    "yes! wonderful way to engage with your own health through an educational course",
    "Great course, very interesting and rewarding. This is a course that you can actually participate in it.",
    "It's an online course, but the effect of teaching are not weakened at all. Very interesting topics and useful techniques.",
    "Would recommend.",
    "I would recommend.",
    "Yes. Take it. It's a great Public Health course.",
    "Great",
    "Interesting weekly projects but more work than one would assume. Recommend if you can put in the time.",
    "It's an easy one to get through. Good and interesting content. Would be better as an in-person course than an online format.",
    "Great course for people to understand the social and behavioral sciences, specifically the research. Accommodating of different schedules. Allows students to participate in the intervention activities they may implement one day.",
    "If this class is still online, do your best not to take it. There was a LOT of busy work, a lot of really tedious and awkward recorded lectures, and the material is crazy simplistic. If you've literally never worked in any capacity with humans than maybe you'll learn new information, but mostly it's common sense things like \"you have to reward people for working out\" or \"lack of social support isn't good for you.\" Everyone I knew half assed all the assignments the hour or two before they were due, many didn't watch the lectures, and I don't know anyone who did the readings. It was a constant source of bitching among the entire first year class. I really have no idea what it would be like as an in-person class. The instructor is nice and entertaining, but if it was the same amount of work plus actually having to attend class I also would not recommend.",
    "Not worth taking--opt for the other semester's SBS option for course content that is of actual substance. This class is just fluff and no substance.",
    "Enjoyed this course and the ability to set and achieve health-related goals throughout the semester. The online format worked well with the material, and I feel like I learned a lot!",
    "I would recommend",
    "Would NOT recommend at all. Did not learn anything, lots of busy work and arbitrary grading. Online experience felt impersonal and detached. Definitely not a good course at all.",
    "If you can avoid taking this class I would strongly encourage you to.",
    "Yes",
    "I would not necessarily recommend this course to others. The online interface was, to be honest, less than engaging and it was difficult to consider this a real course. I think the course provides important information and presents opportunities to make real lifestyle changes. However, I do not think these elements necessarily merit and entire semester course.",
    "Take it only if you have to. Wait until Thursday night and then bullshit an answer for the assignment.",
    "I would recommend to another student because it is a great way to learn about the basics of social and behavioral health and participating in the activities makes you realize how hard it can be to change certain behaviors and lifestyles.",
    "Great course, and hopefully there will be more like it!",
    "I would recommend this course if it was taught in person. I think you learn a lot of great basics in social behavioral sciences and the segments of goal setting are fun but if this is offered online again, I might reconsider my suggestion to take it",
    "I would highly suggest this course for anyone interested in gaining a high-level picture of what SBS is about.",
    "I do not remember all of my TFs, but for the most part they were responsive and helpful. Some of them did not put comments\/indicate why points were being taken off and that was extremely frustrating.",
    "This course should be a testament to the fact that YSPH should not ever host an online degree program and should not host any more online classes in its program. The quality of this course was far poorer than that of my other courses. I wish I had opted to take SBS in spring semester.",
    "It's a class designed to improve your personal health behaviors more than anything else. It is valuable if it helps you be healthy throughout the semester.",
    "Great course for anyone looking to learn about behavioral health through engaging in their own health promotion projects.",
    "If this class is still a core course, then everyone has to take it. With that said, there are some perks to this class. It helped me lead a healthier, more balanced lifestyle by giving me opportunities to create specific goals related to physical, mental, nutritional, and social health and carry them throughout the semester. Although I enjoyed these challenges, the sheer amount of work required for this course felt overbearing at times. It would have been better if students did not have to do so much work, this course would have been more enjoyable.",
    "This online course is very straight forward in the sense that there is a regular routeing of assignments posted on Fridays. The work itself is fair and manageable, but do not go into this class expecting to receive an Honors grade without completing extra credit or understanding why points are taken off of your assignments despite positive feedback from the TFs grading them. Since HP is the baseline, an HP+ or an H- is regarded as great work by the TF, which will be frustrating.",
    "This course content was interesting and important to learn, but the online lecture set up was not very engaging. The health goals were fun and useful, and probably teach you the most about social and behavioral health.",
    "I thought the course would involve more self exploration with the subject material and blending the main concepts in each weeks video(s). Instead, a lot of the assignments felt like busy work and something to be completed. Therefore, it was difficult to really engage in the material, and this could be du to the online format or having to finish assignments, watching videos, and fulfill goals every week (which over time were arduous to complete, along with other class assignments). I would recommend the class to a student seeking to learn about basic social and behavioral concepts and topics. However, I feel the online format and general structure of the course needs to be tweaked to be more effective.",
    "Would definitely recommend this course for an introduction to the social and behavioral issues in terms of public health.",
    "great course! definitely recommend. it is very practical and personal which makes the material more engaging",
    "SBS 505 was a great course! What I loved about it is it taught students that changing behaviors is hard. This is important so that we can empathize with those we will be working with in the future. Furthermore, Marney was a fabulous professor who really wanted to students to learn. There are no tests in this class I think because of Marney's learning philosophy. I would definitely recommend this class next year for other students!!",
    "excellent class--I thoroughly enjoyed it!",
    "Don't take it. Wit for second semester where you can actually attend an SBS course. If the course wants to keep the online lectures, thats one thing, but there should at least be an in person discussion period considering the course material",
    "this is a requirement for whoever has not taken any SBS module before. my suggestion for this module is do not wait until last minute to submit the assignments, otherwise, you will not be able to enjoy a good Friday night.",
    "You will skim the surface on SBS and be challenged to implement these things in your own life.",
    "Highly recommend this course to other students",
    "Online course to teach you SBS, but gets a bit tedious. I would recommend the content of the course but not the format of it.",
    "This course teaches you how to change your behavior and have a more healthy lifestyle.",
    "I feel this course would have been better in an in-person format.",
    "it was fine.",
    "Excellent!! 1000% take this course. I gained immense insight into looking more deeply at my own personal social and behavioral lifestyle habits and how to more effectively change these. Highly interactive course, lectures were engaging, courseload very manageable",
    "This course is great. It lets you participate in the program, you not only accomplish the course, you have also improve your health condition after taking the course.",
    "This online course is a good, non-intensive way to introduce yourself to the field of Social Behavioral Sciences. If you already have a background in a field related to this, however, I would suggest looking for something more intensive and, preferable, not online.",
    "This is an excellent course for anyone interested in public health. I highly recommend it.",
    "It's a core class focused on behavior change. The assignments are annoying but not particularly hard.",
    "I would tell them that the class provides you with a general understanding of some of the social determinants of health, and the importance of physical health, mental health. nutrition, and social support.",
    "There is a lot of assignments in this course, but the content is not difficult to master. The class is important for all first years to take, but I wish we could have learned more throughout the semester. The online format is not conducive for a challenging work environment.",
    "I would recommend it only for the purpose of completing core requirements and for someone whose interest does not lie in the field of behavioral sciences. It is a quick summary course that briefly introduces concepts of behavioral sciences but does not discuss these ideas in great detail or depth.",
    "This course was a good overview of behavioral change strategies and how to engage others in health practices.",
    "Would not recommend, there is a lot of money necessary writing and you get no feedback from the time you spend on it.",
    "Really bad, hopefully, they will get rid of this class with the curriculum revamp. If not, at least it's easy.",
    "Yes, this class is great for those who are willing to make a behavioral change and\/or those who have never thought about it. If you can continue your behavior goals throughout the semester, it really makes a difference of your life.",
    "Don't put too much effort into the assignments because you'll get points taken off for minor things anyway. Also, set realistic goals so that it'll be easier to keep them.",
    "yes. Goal setting is really helpful",
    "I would not recommend this course. It is easy and you won't have to do a lot of work, but as a result you won't learn as much as you could.",
    "Not a very useful course. I could've done without it and taken an elective. Didn't come out of it learning much.",
    "Extremely broad overview of SBS mayerial, focusing on behavior change. This is a very hands on course that gets you to change your own behavior with class incentives (extra credit). It was tedious and annoying at times, but honestly it was worth it to make healthier choices alongside your peers.",
    "This course is alright, though I think it suffered from the online format. The write-ups were repetitive and I felt like it was mostly information that I already knew.",
    "It is a core course students required to take, not too much work load, and maybe good for you.",
    "This is a useful and essential course for the public health field. I would definitely recommend the other students to take it. however the grading method for the course is very discouraging.",
    "Makes you think a lot about personal behavior change and how you can utilize your behavior change strategies to implement behavior change programs at a community level",
    "Although this course was taught online and I had never taken it before, it exceeded my expectations. I really enjoyed the learning my doing nature of this class, and Professor White is truly an amazing professor.",
    "Don't take it if you can satisfy the requirement with something else - unless you know nothing about public health.",
    "I would not recommend, I do not think online classes offer very much interaction.",
    "Overall, I enjoyed this course. I felt that it was very different from other courses and allowed me to focus on behavioral change that I have wanted to for a very long time.",
    "I would not recommend taking the online version of this course over an in-person class. It is not conducive to learning the material.",
    "sure",
    "It was nice being able to watch the videos and do the course work entirely on your own time. I would recommend",
    "Excellent",
    "Tedious, but fulfills the SBS requirement. I would recommend it to a student who would rather not attend a fifth class in person and is trying to get credit for an SBS class. I would not recommend it if you want to learn something new or if you do not want a lot of writing assignments.",
    "I enjoyed this course. However, it was overwhelming at times, as I believe was the intention. It is a requirement, but I do think I would recommend it to a friend."
