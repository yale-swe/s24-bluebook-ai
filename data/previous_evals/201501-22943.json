    "If you've done graphic design in the past and want a medium to improve your typography skills, I would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class if you are interested in typography. You'll learn a lot and the amount you get out of it depends on how much effort you put in.",
    "Type II is an extension of Type I; whereas Type I had entire projects dedicated to typesetting or typeface choice (etc.) Type II forces students to draw on those in depth studies on a macroscopic level (much like drawing on a well-developed toolbox). I would recommend this course to any student interested in graphic design or who had taken Type I and had enjoyed it; it improves upon the skills developed in Type I greatly.",
    "It is a great class to learn about different ways of communicating ideas through typography, I would recommend it."
