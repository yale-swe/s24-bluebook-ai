   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it for people who already have some background in the material and who plan to pursue further work and\/or research related to feminist postcolonial theory. The material is a bit difficult for somebody with no prior exposure.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. I would say this course provides a great overview of the history of postcolonial theory as it intersects with feminist theory, and of the various issues that have arisen within those two areas. The texts covered all related quite wonderfully with one another, and I really appreciated how, in every class, we were able to tie in things from previous weeks to the current week's themes. Everything built nicely off of each other.",
    "There is a lot of reading but you also at least get a broad idea of the field. There is room to explore your particular interests in the paper and reading responses, though not so much in the classroom, especially if you are interested in literature and the arts. The course seemed more focused on big ideas\/structures and draws students from a wide variety of disciplines, which can be both stimulating and frustrating. Professor Grewal is extremely knowledgable and wants the students to do well in her class, which is nice. I am not sure how she expects students to cover additional scholarship for their final papers when we work right up to the end on assigned readings, but that is generally the case with courses across the board at Yale.I would recommend the course to students who want a survey and don't know what in particular they'd like to work on yet. They will get lots of ideas from the wide array of readings and lots of opportunities to explore them in the weekly writings.",
    "Excellent",
    "It is an informative course which requires a lot of critical thinking as well as reading. I would recommend it if the student is able to keep up with the course load of the semester, but not if the other classes might hinder them from fully engaging with the class."

   "comments": [
    "This course gave me insight into the ways that both humanities AND social science methodologies can be applied to pursue feminist postcolonial critiques.",
    "My background is mostly in feminist rather than postcolonial theory, and the course was so wonderful in helping me think about issues such as colonialism, race, ethnicity, migration, etc. as they relate to issues of gender and sexuality. I definitely felt that it filled what could be considered a \"gap\" in my knowledge.",
    "This course gave me additional frameworks from which to engage my topics.",
    "First, the course provided a critical view in the way research methods are deployed for various studies. In my own research, it allowed me to gain a range of insights necessary for evaluating source materials and think beyond the available tools."
