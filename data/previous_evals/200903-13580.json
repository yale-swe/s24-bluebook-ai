    "The professor was and incredibly articulate and interesting lecturer. He did and excellent job of giving us condensed but still thorough information on every relevant part of energy markets. This course was great for breadth and depth. Also, the two strategy games were a really amazing way to learn and apply the concepts- this is the class experience that I will talk about when I leave here.",

At a minimum, move this time up to 10pm.The electricity game was too confusing and complicated. Simplify it and people will internalize the information more.",
    "better application to contemporary issues in the energy industry.",
    "no improvements",
    "I would have liked a small intro class on financial modeling in excel. I often had to rely on others' expertise to figure out bidding strategies.",
    "I would reduce the time spent on the gasoline market and spend more time on more interesting areas such as renewables.",
    "This course could have included discussions on the environmental impacts of the structure of energy markets. The incentives and disincentives in the market for environmental improvement could have been discussed. The renewables section was a bit rushed. Not enough environmental focus to be a FES cross-listed course.",
    "Provide some type of preparation of put material available to students not familiar on Economic topics"

The TA met with me independently to help me get up to speed on some concepts, and the Professor met with a group of students including myself to help us prepare for the test. Both were especially responsive to those of us that came into the class without as much modeling experience which was really helpful.",
