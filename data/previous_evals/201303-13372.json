    "This course provides students with the tools to design sociological research projects. Yes.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course.",
    "This is a class I would recommend to any social science grad student, even outside of sociology. Many history students would also benefit from the class.",
    "I would recommend this class to other students, especially to those who are in their 1st or 2nd year.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course, it helps to understand principles of social research in detail. The time and effort invested here into understanding a phenomenon such as an \"alternative explanation\" is worth it, I think it marks the difference between a certain \"language\" of social science and a serious understanding of the working process and criteria behind it. It develops up a range of criteria to comment on the quality of qualitative and quantitative work alike."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, it deepened my knowledge of the discipline. It definitely contributedto my research and will do so for a long time.",
    "It deepened my knowledge of sociological methodology and helped me begin thinking about how to design my second-year research paper.",
    "This provided me with a much-needed methodology to ask the right questions and go about answering them. A must.",
    "It would be very helpful to my future research.",
    "It is a very helpful course enabling a grad student to think more broadly and critically both his\/her own future research and the others'.",
    "This course helped me to prepare for my dissertation reserach in many ways: in identifying topics relevant to the social sciences, in gaining a sense of how professional discussions in American sociology work and most of all, in understanding and working with the criteria and professional standards to improve one's research."
