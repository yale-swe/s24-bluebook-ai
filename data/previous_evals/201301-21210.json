   "comments": [
    "Great course for those looking for applied policy experience in the field of early child development. Be prepared having done all the readings and ready to speak up in class. Work load is reasonable.",
    "Discussion seminar about ECD with some room for general conversation about policy. Engaging, fascinating, but disorganized professor.",
    "This course will introduce to you many current issues in child development. It will be a very useful course for anyone interested in development.",
    "I would highly recommend the course because the teacher is amazing. Also I think it is appropriate for individual interested in international development and Early Childhood Development (ECD). We have used ECD as a foundation to learn about the policy making process. The speakers are also very knowledgeable and accomplished.",
    "I would--it is a pretty niche subject matter at first glance , but is applicable to many fields and thus useful to students of many disciplines. It is also not a lot of written work, so students with busy schedules or lots of other commitments will find it manageable.",
    "If you want to get a taste of how people actually work in international policymaking, it would be a good choice."

   "comments": [
    "Increased understanding of policy development mechanisms, importance of ECD to development, and UN system.",
    "It contributed because there was space to pursue research\/policy memo on my specific professional interests and areas of study.",
    "This course has reconfirmed my interest in child development. The knowledge and skills I gained from this course will be helpful in my academic and professional career.",
    "This course presented ideas on how to create evidence based policies, but these ideas could be more strongly reinforced.",
    "This course focuses on Early Childhood Development initiatives and thus allows us to learn a lot of about the ECD policy making. The speakers were also really good and helpful. Moreover, we learned a lot about the UN and other development agencies and their relationships with developing countries.",
    "The course gave me a lot of insight into the UN system and how arduous it can be to get a policy to be implemented!",
    "It introduced real practices and practical problems to justify and sometimes negate the theories I've learnt before, informing us the difficulty and considerations in the real world."
