    "I would recommend Math 120 to another student. The course is well taught and well organized, and provides a good foundation for multi-variable calculus.",
    "I'd like to reiterate what most people say about this course: only take it if you have to. While necessary for most STEM majors, this course is unfair to students when it comes to grading. The over-reliance on exams and the steep curve makes the margin for error very small; one mistake and you drop several grades. Unlike the course, Professor Qi is awesome. He made the otherwise boring course fun through his hilarious (and occasionally educational) stories.",
    "I would only recommend this course to people who have had exposure to the material beforehand.",
    "MATH 120 is a decent class. I guess many people would say that here too, but go for Miki's section if possible! This class should be okay manageable if you got placed into this.",
