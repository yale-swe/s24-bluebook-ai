    "Rigorous approach to writing about arts. We took a serious look at contemporary performing arts ranging from TV series to movies to our favorite new albums. This class has a consistent workload, with several small weekly assignments. But it's spread out in such a way that I never felt overwhelmed. Lots of small assignments and short prompts, which got me in the practice of writing almost every day. Professor Spillane takes our ideas very seriously, which made for class discussions in which people took risks and also thought rigorously about the readings. I enjoyed reading so much contemporary arts journalism--The New Yorker, Pitchfork, The New York Times, etc. There was a tacit but pervasive emphasis on non-white and female artists, which was excellent and enriching. Professor Spillane reads our work very closely, and keeps track of our growth to help us achieve specific goals. I highly recommend it to those with a true interest in writing and the arts!",
    "Would definitely recommend. For someone who loves to write about something they love and also get to really use your own voice in your writing and cultivate whatever that voice happens to be. I feel like I am much more confident in my own writing voice after taking this class.",
    "I would totally recommend this course if you're even remotely intrigued by the world of performing arts.",
    "Your writing will definitely improve quite a bit in this course, but you will need to spend a lot of time and energy. There's a rhythm to the class that isn't obvious from the syllabus: you'll be turning in an assignment every weekend, along with a weekly blog post. It's a lot of work with a lot of required viewings, and sometimes Professor Spillane adds a viewing or a reading with very little warning. You'll need to be able to make this class a priority in order to really get something out of it.",
    "It is a tough course to take, especially if you are not used to writing consistently. Ultimately, worth the effort, OF COURSE, but something to take into consideration when choosing other courses for the semester.",
    "A real gem. Take it to think critically about the arts and journalism. Discussion is a joy-- Prof Spillane is a great moderator and very open to student ideas and interests. The assignments are plentiful (a review draft or revision due every week, plus thorough responses to classmates' work due every other week), but always worthwhile. Prof. Spillane and your classmates will give you insightful feedback and you'll watch your writing (and thinking) get sharper and smarter."
