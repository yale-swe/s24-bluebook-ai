    "don't take this class, it will be a waste of your time. i took this as a requirement for mcdb. very superficial, just read some wikipedia for an afternoon and you will learn more than a whole semester of this.",
    "No this class sucks.",
    "Take it if you like biology, some people really enjoy it. Just know that 50% of your grade is a essentially a research paper.",
    "This is a great course, even for people not looking to major in E&EB. I would definitely recommend this course; it'll make you look at nature and the world differently.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who's honestly interested in Evolution, Ecology, and Behavior. A superficial curiosity about the subject really might not be enough. However, it's an excellently taught and well organized course. I would describe it as an overview of the diversity of life and the interaction between life and the environment.",
    "i would recommend it but it is hard to pay attention in lecture but it is only two test and a paper",
    "Strengths: Interesting topics. Learn a broad amount.Weaknesses: You don't really need to attend lectures. He just reads off of the powerpoints.Take it if you need to.",
    "Okay course, but a surprising amount of work. I ended up doing the readingwithout going to lecture, mostly because the books\/lectures are highly redundant (especially in the case of the evolution section, where Prof Stearns has literally written the book). The midterms were conceptual, which was a nice change of pace from other science midterms, though by no means easy. The biggest challenge in this course is the paper--if you are a good and organized writer, this won't be a huge issue. If you are a struggling writer, I'd suggest taking another writing course before this one. The course was frustrating in its dual focus (lecture vs writing) but overall I learned a tremendous amount about evolution and ecology.",
    "Don't take this class unless you need it for your major or something.",
    "This course covers a lot of interesting material about animals and their environment. I would definitely take this class, it is very easy to get through this class and learn a lot. The reading is very optional and the midterms are fairly easy. The only hard part is the paper depending on your TF.",
    "only take this class if you have to take it... or if you need an easy SC credit or WR credit",
    "This is a challenging course, but the material is very interesting. I found the ecology textbook to be great, while the evolution textbook tended to be dense and confusing. The exams were difficult but curved nicely, and the paper is not too daunting because of all the deadlines. Three lectures per week is a bit much. I would recommend it if you find the material compelling and are willing to work hard for a B.",
    "I would recommend EEB 122 to other students. I think it's a great intro class that gives you a taste of a lot of different aspects about the field. It whets your appetite just enough that you want to learn more. Definitely motivates you to try taking another EEB class.",
    "Even though I haven't been a fan of most of the introductory level sciences courses at Yale, I really enjoyed taking EEB 122. The professor was a great lecturer, approachable, and still a prominent researcher in his field. The final paper gives you good practice in science writing and reading primary research papers. The topics covered were interesting, and it has definitely shifted my interests towards EEB.",
    "YES. But only if you go to the lunches, and pick a paper topic that you really like.That's how you get the most out of this class. Advice: the first half of the course is a little more difficult than the second. Do the reading for it and your comprehension of the material will vastly improve.",
    "Yes. The paper is great practice for freshman planning to write.",
    "Take this if your interested in the subject, or for premed requirements. It's much more enjoyable than mcdb 120. It's a lot of reading though, 30-40 pages per class, 3 classes per week.",
    "This is a good introductory class even for people who took AP Biology before (since that class focuses more on molecular biology anyway). Make sure to go to most of the lectures and study for the tests.",
    "A good intro course, interesting lectures, takes a lot of effort to stay on top of the material yourself, the tests are kinda hard but curved nicely, the professor is really passionate and engaging, the final paper is daunting but manageable. Too much work if you are JUST taking it for a writing credit, in my opinion. But otherwise, recommended.",
    "Take it if you have to. It's pretty boring, unless you're really interested in the topic. Workload is manageable (non-existent) for the lecture, but the section for this class was the worst hour of my life every week. So boring\/awkward, and a lot of work, depending on your TA. Half of the grade for the class is the final paper, which is worked on in section, with checkpoint due dates along the way.",
    "It's a good class that is taught by a great lecturer (Stephen Stearns) and gives a great foundation in EEB.It's not a class to be taken lightly, though. It covers a lot of material, has 2 midterms, and the final paper assignment is extremely time consuming.",
    "The material was always interesting. I always learned something new that I ran back to share with my friends. Stearns is pretty much a giant in the field. However, maybe because of that, even though he was completely committed to the class and to getting his students to be better writers, he was extremely aloof with students. The exams were sort of tricky for the sake of being tricky.The TAs for the class are amazing. Every one of them comes to every class. Mine was a 6th year doctoral student who had assisted this class 1 or 2 times before--ridiculously over-qualified to be a TA. Don't expect to ever go over class material in section. It was difficult for me to never get any reinforcement of the material (no homework related to lecture). They expect a lot of you outside of class in terms of studying on your own.You'll be writing a 15-20 page scientific paper for the final. Work for it begins in the first weeks of the class, which is a great way to make yourself not procrastinate. I ended up changing my topic over spring break (a couple of weeks before the first draft was due), which was stressful, but I managed. However, it's a lot to expect of students. I had pretty much no background in biology, and definitely had never written a scientific paper. I ended up with a very clear, well-written, interestingpaper, but it was only after a LOT of work. Expect to get out of it (not just grade-wise, but skills-wise) what you put into it.",
    "Take this class if you are interested in the subject (or if you have to). If you have any doubts about the subject and dont have to take it, dont. I was not interested in it during shopping period, but convinced myself that I might become interested in it. I didn't.",
    "An interesting course, covering a lot of great material, and generally quite well taught by Stephan Sterns. Definitely worth taking. Apparently this upcoming year (spring 2012) is going to be the last time Sterns teaches it.",
    "Recommended for those interested. Decent for those who need it.",
    "Yes. The subjects covered in lecture are very interesting and good to know even for non-history majors like me. Particularly, I found some of the lectures onevolution to be the most interesting. The paper was something you will enjoy writing if you find a topic you are really passionate about. The tests were tricky but fair, and if you take care to keep up with the lecture material (which is hard to get yourself to do, because all lectures are available on Open Yale Courses), you should be fine.",
    "You should take it if you are considering taking more courses in the subject or majoring in it, or if you want a WR credit for writing a science paper.",
    "This class is an awesome, informative, fun, and comprehensive introduction to EEB. It convinced me to join the major. Professor Stearns is an excellent lecturer who will easily keep your attention, the tests are fair, and the paper is a great way to learn to do scientific writing (and tolearn how to process works.) My favorite parts of the class were the anecdotes by Professor Stearns, either about incredibly unique and strange organisms, or about interesting famous biologists he knows personally. I definitely recommend this course if you are interested in biology, want to consider the EEB major, or are looking for a fun, engaging science class!",
    "If you're at all interested in biology, you should definitely take this class. The material is fascinating, and the paper is actually pretty fun, because you get to write on anything that is related to ecology, biology, or behavior. Also, Professor Stearns is a fantastic teacher.",
    "Good basic intro course, covers a lot of ground, relatively painless grading scheme. Lecture slides are helpful, the reading is the lecture in a bit more detail, Prof. Stearns is amiable. It's worth writing a paper about a topic you're invested in \u0096 this class is a real opportunity to produce a piece of work to be proud of. The TAs are a bit of a crapshoot; my TA was Amanda Subalusky and she was fantastic, so try to get into her section if she does it next year!",
    "I would reccomend EEB 122 to another student only if they are interested in the material.",
    "I enjoyed EEB 122 because I felt that it left me with a strong understanding of evolution, ecology, and behavior (especially evolution) that went beyond what I had learned in high school. I think that the professor teaching the course has a large role in the success of a lecture course, and Professor Stearns definitely made this class great. I think it could have been much more bland and boring without him. The research paper is a big component of the class, so if a student does not want to spend a significant amount of time writing a research paper, he\/she should reconsider taking this class, as I spent a sleepless night or two scrambling to get my rough draft prepared in time!",
    "Great course.I found the material interesting and the professor really made the course great.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course if you're interested in a ecology\/biology class. This class is fairly popular, only because it was a requirement for the ecology\/biology major. I don't think many students would take this as a fun elective science course.",
    "An interesting class, but I wouldn't recommend it. The lectures are much more complicated\/confusing than they need to be. The 20 pg paper is an interesting aspect, and it really isn't that much work. I felt like I learned a lot about the topic I wrote about, but not that much from the actual class. The exams are difficult, and it is such a large lecture class. Prof. Stearns is a little awkward and arrogant, but he means well and has put a lot of effort into helpinghis students.",
    "I would recommend the course to another student interested in learning about scientific writing. The paper assignment is a large undertaking and I did not find it to be directly related to learning the basics of ecology and evolution. The writing credit is a nice benefit but the time I spent on the paper detracted from time spent mastering course material.",
    "Going in, the worst part seemed to be the 20 page paper. I don't feel I learned much about paper writing, but I do now feel confident that I am capable of writing a really long research based paper, given enough time (which the course does). Lecture was boring and reading didn't need to be done. There was no homework except for section stuff, so it was a fairly easy class. Stearns looks like Darwin and makes himself very available via online feedback and lunch\/office hours, but I he addressed me very condescendingly on multiple occasions. There is no final and the exams aren't cumulative.This class isn't fantastic, but if you're taking it, you probably have to, and it isn't that bad.",
    "I would. It was fascinating, fun, and at the end of the course I feel like I have acheived something in writing my paper.",
    "This was a great intro Bio class with a Lot of work.",
    "E&EB 122 is a great introductory ecology course. The material is interesting and the class is low-stress. The way Professor Stearns has it organized (a different professor will have different course requirements) is that 50% of the course is comprised by your grade on 2 midterm exams. This is very low-stress because there are no problem sets or quizzes of any kind. The other 50% of your course grade is determined by your grade on a final paper due at the end of the semester. This is a massive 15-20 page paper that requires work throughout the entire semester in order to be manageable. Overall, E&EB 122 is a very enjoyable course.",
    "good, thorough overview of evolution. As a person already into this field, I still learned quite a bit.",
    "I would say it's a great survey course. Take it if you're interested, you won't regret it.",
    "I would recommend this class. Its a pretty good way to get a writing credit and lecture is very interesting making it worthwhile unlike a lot of other classes taken for writing credits. Even if you are coming from what you consider a 'harder science' than EEB, you'll find lecture really interested and you'll be thinking\/learning about stuff that you probably haven't looked at in a which which is great. Professor Stearns is great and I think made the class. So not sure for recommendations if another Prof is teaching. One thing about the paper: you only write one 15-20 page paper. You do it in a lot of steps (outline roughdraft, peer review etc.) so it ends up being relatively painless. However, writing a single long paper can be tough as you eventually get bored of your topic\/thesis and just want to move on. Since you're not an expert in the material, your arguments can feel sort of pointly\/boring unlike if you were writing such a large paper for you major or some other topic you knew a ton a bout. So sometimes you'll wish you took a class with more frequent but shorter papers. Just something to consider.",
    "I would recommend for pre-meds or those with a science background.",
    "It was a required course for me, but I ended up really enjoying it- Stearns is awesome, the lectures are interesting, and you learn a lot doing the paper.",
    "This course is a standard big lecture course on introductory evolutionary biology. I had absolutely no background in biology, but I was still able to keep up with the material with little effort. This class is pretty easy and the work load is really light (two exams, one paper--that's it). I had to take this course for a distributional requirement, but I really didn't have time to dedicate to it. I didn't attend lectures consistently, but I followed the course on Open Courses. I spent about 12 hours studying for each exam and wrote my paper in two days. That was all the work I put into the class the whole semester, and I still got a good grade. I think you could get a lot more out of the class if you put more effort into it than I did. The material is still somewhat interesting, even if you don't find it as awe-inspiring as Prof. Stearns. Take the class if you have a passing interest (or if you need the distributional requirement). If you don't have time to dedicate, you can still do well with little effort. If you do have the time, you can put a lot into the class (especially the paper) and get a lot out.",
    "I absolutely recommend this class to other students. Professor Stearns is great, the work is extremely manageable and the material is very interesting. Take it.",
    "Take it, great class. Essay is a bitch if you don't manage time correctly or are the type to bang out papers in a go, but if you can write in chunks you'll have no problem.",
    "I took this class as a non-science major looking for a writing credit. Not sure how I feel about the decision... The work load was reasonable since you write the paper over such a long period of time. On the other hand the material wasn't particularly interesting. There was a lot of repeat from AP bio and overlap with what I would consider general science knowledge. It felt like we glossed over any tougher topics that came up. So, if you just need a writing credit and are trying to diversify your education, I'd probably look elsewhere.",
    "No. It killed my enthusiasm for the subject matter by taking fascinating topics of things dealing with amazing living creatures and reducing them to numbers and graphs and presenting it in a way that was very dry and boring. I understand that much of this has to do with the way this field of science is operated, but still the class could have done much much more with the subject matter. Section is also quite useless and the paper was a miserable piece of work because it absolutely had nothing to do with the course material unless you chose a topic was relevant. I put in a lot of time and effort for the paper and the grade was far less than what I had hoped to get. Totally not worth the writing credit, if that's what you're looking for. My writing-science writing or otherwise- did not improve in the least bit.",
    "It's a really interesting and well-taught class. There isn't that much of a connection between the lectures and section. The final research paper wasn't too bad, and I thought that the TA was very helpful in every step of the writing process. Don't take it as a gut.",
    "This course was a fantastic introduction to EEB. The tests were fair, and the paper was an incredible way to (very supervisedly) dive into real scientific writing. So great. If you need a science credit, you can totally take this course and have a blast. If this class is a requirement for you (as it was for me), don't be scared; it's great.",
    "Do not take this class unless you need it for the Biology major or for the Psychology-neuroscience track major. It was a horribly taught class and I found the material to be very dull. Professor Stearns does not attempt to make the class interesting. A large amount of the material is unecessary and useless. That being said, the final paper was the best part of the class. The class consists of 2 midterms and a final paper, with a topic of your choice. The two midterms are brutal and ridiculous.",
    "Yes, it is a good class although the writing assignment takes a long time, but in the end it does make you a better scientific writer.",
    "Very interesting course, although very dependent on the 2 midterms. If one is messed up, there is little hope for retribution",
    "I'm a science major who took this class to get a writing credit. I advise AGAINST doing this. The 15 page paper consumed my entire spring break (people say it's spaced out in checkpoints, but the checkpoints are basically: 10 topics-->1 topic-->2 page outline-->HUGE PAPER). The paper is very stressful, although it does provide good experience with scientific writing.Other reviews told me the midterms are \"fair.\" This couldn't be farther from the truth. They feature very obscure or vague questions, and if you do not give the answer, WORD FOR WORD, that the T.A. wants, you will get a 0. I read the textbook every night, went to every lecture, and studied very hard, but I was still incredibly frustrated by the midterms. It is upsetting that there are many upperclassmen in the class who already know the material, don't go to class nor do the reading, yet still do better in the course.Every lecture consists of Stearns reading off a Powerpoint that most students have on their laptops (those that aren't on Facebook or email). Stearns explains things in a very convoluted manner, and I found myself turning to other sources (Google\/textbook) to learn almostall of the material.Overall, this class is very dull, and extremely frustrating. I now know some interesting facts about living organisms, and way too much about one (that my research paper was based on), but it certainly was not worth it.",
    "YES! take this course. I had to take it for my major (environmental studies) and I'm really glad. You definitely don't need to take the fall MCDB class to take this one, although it will probably help you a lot on the first midterm.",
    "EEB 122 is an awesome course! You should definitely take it with Prof Stearns. The lectures are interesting, and the two midterms are fair. The textbooks are a decent supplement to the lecture material, and are useful for explaining fuzzy concepts. The 15-20pg paper is a bit time-consuming, but rewarding if you choose a topic you like. Also, you turn in plenty of drafts and get feedback the whole way through, so it's definitely manageable. Take it!",
    "EEB is a class about ecology and the environment. It is powerpoint driven. The paper is manageable. I would not recommend unless required.",
    "A wonderful intro course. Take it if you have any interest in biology! Don't be afraid of the research paper - the numerous little deadlines on the way make it easy and smooth (if you follow them, that is).",
    "This is an okay course. If given the choice, I probably wouldn't take it again. I only took it because it is a pre-req for Psych-Neuro. This is not my kind of Biology. However, it was interesting and if you have a knack for this kind of biology, you'll most likely enjoy this class. It just wasn't for me.",
    "This is an intro class, so you have to take it as a bio major. The class isn't always stimulating, but the information is interesting. It's a good way to get a WR credit, especially for science majors. The deadlines will keep you pretty on-track. I found it helpful to do my literature research over spring break.",
    "There is a lot of material covered in a very short amount of time. Also, almost all of the sections focus on the paper and not the concepts. Good if you want to learn how to write a review paper or a research proposal, but be expected to be on your own for the information.",
    "There are 2 exams and one final 20 page paper. I don't think Stearns is teaching this class next year, so it might change. The final paper isn't bad because the bulk of the work is during the semester and not at the end. The exams kind of suck because there isn't really much emphasis during section and there is A LOT of information. You learn about the basic concepts behind evolution, ecology, and behavior. If you like that stuff, then take it. Also, don't take it senior year. Get it out of the way early on if you can.",
    "Take it for a major or a prerequisite; I wouldn't recommend it as an \"easy credit\" at all.",
    "Yes, this was one of my favorite classes this semester. Part of that is because I was already very interested in the subject, but other than that I really enjoyed how information was presented and the general approach taken with the class."
