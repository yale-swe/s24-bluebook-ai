   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It's interesting, taught by a great professor, and attracts people with a strong background in psychology so there are always really interesting discussion in class. The workload is totally manageable (weekly readings, about 5 reading response papers from these readings, 3 reading quizzes, and a final paper that's 10 pages but 20 pages if you're taking this class for one of your senior requirements in the psychology major).",
    "I would recommend. Good survey of psych literature about kids, fairly laid back, nice professor.",
    "PSYC433 is a really good senior seminar that fulfills a list A requirement. It's actually an interesting class, even if you don't like babies that much, and you'll get a lot more out of it than you would in a big lecture. I absolutely recommend it to anyone, even if you're more interested in neuro or biology, this class was definitely relevant.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in psychology in general, because it does cover a wide array of topics, just from a developmental perspective. Even as a psych major who has taken A LOT of psych classes at Yale, I still think I learned a lot.",
    "Yes, the material is really interesting, and the workload isn't too heavy, so you really get to enjoy the material.",
    "We learn about the developmental origins of theory of mind, altruism, prejudice, etc. The workload is completely reasonable, the readings are interesting (especially the material about prejudice), and Professor Olson is a smart, knowledgeable, and generally great professor. Take this class!",
    "It's good... small seminar where everyone gets a chance to talk, which is nice. There are 3 small quizzes but if you do the reading (which you should as you are spending 2 hours talking about it every week) you should do fine. There's also a final paper for which you can write either 10 or 20 pages and get credit for the senior req. which is also good because the subject material is BABIES"
