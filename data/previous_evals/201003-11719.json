    "There were several out of class assignments during the semester. My one wish is that they would have been announced at least two weeks prior to their due date. I would have liked to spend more time on them and do a much better job on them. Each homework assignment was announced just one week prior to their due date. This was sufficient but it made for a sleepless week.",
    "Question 3: The HGR report would have been more useful if it was focused around am applied problem and\/or had clearer description.Question 7: The TA was very helpful and kept the course on schedule.",
    "Important to note that I audited this class only.",
    "(1) It would be helpful to have some more basic readings to provide a foundation for people who are new to hydrology.(2) I think we should have started with some basics before jumping right in. Not just for review for those new to the topic, but just to provide better structure to the course.(3) I found the assignments to be very frustrating--they required a lot of busywork but did not result in a better understanding of the concepts. They could be much better designed.(7) Natalie did a good job organizing field trips and such, but could have gone further to help us understand the material and prepare for assignments\/exams.",
    "General: Jim is a very experienced practitioner with years of varied water resource engineering and restoration work under his belt. He knows a LOT. Unfortunately, the pacing of his classroom lectures is often too fast as he moves from detail to detail and too slow as he transitions from general concept to general concept. He also has a hard time, given the enormous wealth of information he has to share, with indicating which parts are more and less important to pay attention to. The result is sort of a long mishmash of information which, when you review your notes after lecture, you're not sure which bits of information to focus on and draw connections from, which to try to memorize, and which are just interesting trivia.Q1: Cool that he used agency manuals and primary articles, but he also has a handbook that he has written with materials for the whole course. I did not purchase this handbook and only read two chapters specifically assigned for a paper; those chapters suffered from the same organizational problems as Jim's lectures do.Q9: FIELD TRIPS were by far the best part of this course. I only wish we could have done more. Jim's knowledge and teaching style comes alive in the field, you can see from how he works and thinks about rivers which parts of his material are important to know."

   "comments": [
    "James MacBroom has a great deal of enthusiasm and loves talking about rivers. This comes across during his teaching. He is extremely knowledgeable AND experienced.",
    "The group final project is very very valuable. I think the applied nature of the project and the fact that it is completed for a client is the best part of the class.",
    "Jim is an amazing professor who has so much knowledge on the topic as well as many other fields. I was impressed by how much he knew as well as how willing and eager he was to share this information with the class. He was one of the nicest and most caring professors I've ever had and really made the class pleasant as well as informative.",
    "Great practitioner taking that approach to teaching means you learn a lot of interesting parts related to application.",
    "It is a pleasure to learn about this subject matter from an expert in the field. Professor MacBroom adds tremendous insight into difficult materials, and is especially engaging in the field. The field trips were fantastic.",
    "Field trips with Jim.",
    "Field trips and real-life projects really helped teach through actually application and use. Never felt like busy work.",
    "The field trips were great and Jim was extremely willing to help us with our course projects by taking us out in the field. These trips were the best part of the course.",
    "Field trips!",
    "The field trips were fantastic and by far the best part of the course. They offered an extremely useful way in which to understand concepts presented in class."

   "comments": [
    "I learned a great deal during the field trips. I wish we had more field trips.",
    "I think it would be good if the course had a clear syllabus, listing all assignments and their due dates.Some of the lectures seemed partially redundant. I think the course could be improved by better organizing the lecture subjects.The all day field trip for the final project was very useful. However, I think the other field trips either should be made longer (although this is capped by the class time, obviously) or made more applied (taking measurements, etc. rather than just an outside lecture.",
    "Jim's 3 hour lectures, which are too fast-paced for that long a session, in that format, that early in the morning.",
    "Some of the homework assignments, compared to the field trips and bigger projects, did feel like busy work. The 10 page paper on regime equations seemed a little bit excessive.",
    "The lectures were all interesting but three hours of lecture is a long time. I think the class could benefit from more discussion.",
    "I wish it could be done in twice weekly meetings rather than three-hour blocks...I think that might help with the problem of organizing information efficiently. Or, incorporating a short field trip every week or every other week for the second half of class.Also, instructions regarding the homework assignments (not the final paper) were very unclear, often provided at the last minute without any advance warning of due dates (like in high school), and had wildly unrealistic word count requirements. I could have written a satisfactory paper comparing hydraulic geometry with geomorphic equations in two pages rather than the assigned seven, for instance.",
    "While the quantitative problem set was quite useful for strengthening concepts learned in class, I found the qualitative assignments to not be as worthwhile as they could have been. Rather than having extensive length requirements for one topic, I would have preferred a variety of topics covered, each with smaller word requirements."

My one critique is the amount of discussion in the class, and I think the course could be improved by devoting half the class period to discussion of readings and\/or restoration projects. Jim hasso much great esperience and has done such interesting work, I think students would like the chance to talk and learn more about all of his projects.",
    "It exceeded them. I had read the reviews from previous years and it looked like the course would be pretty bad, but getting to know Jim was a pleasure and it just took some getting used to to figure out how to handle his teaching style.",

    "It was great to learn from other group members and to get to work on a group project, as most work is done in the professional world. However, it was a little frustrating when people did not turn in their work by an agreed upon date.",
    "Advantages were collaborating and bringing different areas of expertise to a project, but as with all group work differences in working styles created some problems but it was overall a great experience.",
    "I recommend limiting your group to 2 or 3--those with 4-5 group members had a much harder time making their schedules work.",
    "Great team work for a practical application.",
    "The group project for this course was the best group project I've done here at FES. The projects had components that could be easily divided, and Jim was extremely helpful in getting us out in the field.",
    "It was great. We could not have done our field measurements solo, and we were efficient in producing our final report.",
