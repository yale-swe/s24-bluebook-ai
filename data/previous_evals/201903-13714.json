    "I gained a better understanding of coastal ecosystems and the threats they are facing.",
    "Analyzing scientific papers, IDing marsh vegetation, climate change's impacts on coastal ecosystems, corals, lionfish",
    "I learned about the ecology and physical science of coastal ecosystems, as well as aspects of governance and human interactions with these ecosystems. While I am by no means an expert in coastal ecosystems, I feel that I now have a solid understanding of coastal ecosystems that I will be able to apply in my career in environmental management.",
    "A very thorough understanding of many coastal ecosystems (salt marshes, mangroves, rocky intertidal, beaches, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, etc.) and the threats they face.",
    "Knowledge about coastal ecosystems, especially in Long Island Sound",
    "Comprehensive understanding of coastal ecosystems",
    "A far greater understanding of the issues facing coastal regions, and the subsequent methods and existing studies.",
    "I learned how to more accurately interpret current scientific papers by focusing on key sections and understanding the graphs. I also gained a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interactions of coastal ecosystems and the diverse, overlapping challenges they face. The issues are often not black and white, and the answers or best management decisions will largely depend on a overarching understanding of the various players in the ecosystems."

    "Perfectly- this was a great class.",
    "They align well. Most of my work focuses on freshwater ecosystems and taking this class positions me to think about the connection between coastal ecosystems and freshwater ecosystems.",
    "Extremely well- everything that the syllabus said we would cover was covered, in an appropriate level of detail.",
    "Exceeded expectations!",
    "I learned way more than I expected to! I already had a lot of baseline knowledge about several coastal ecosystems but learned so much through this class and I'm really glad I took it.",
    "very well",
    "Beyond any expectations I could have had. My appreciation for a subject matter I did not know I could care for has grown by leaps and bounds. Enlightening.",
    "Exceeded all possible expectations - I learned more than I thought I could ever know about coastal systems, and the format of the class made me feel welcome and able to be vulnerable\/ask questions when I was unsure.",

   "comments": [
    "Shimi really holds you accountable for learning the course material on a weekly basis, which I think greatly improved my retention of course material. He is a very interesting lecturer and he is patient when students don't understand something. The field trips in this class were also a great learning experience. I'm not sure how it could be improved- this is probably the best class I have taken at FES.",
    "Shimi does a good job in organizing the slides and content on Canvas and it's easy to find information. I like that Shimi incorporates student input in his lectures. I also appreciate that Shimi makes himself available during finals for reviews.",
    "I thought this was the best class I have taken at FES. It was really well-taught, and provided a great overview of coastal ecosystems. I appreciated that the class covered social\/management\/economic considerations, not just the science. The field trips were great, and really helped me to understand the salt marsh systems in a way that I don't think I would have if I hadn't been to see them. The readings for the class were great, too, although I didn't particularly care for the Griggs book. I thought that it was helpful to have the quizzes to check in on my understanding of the previous week's concepts. The worksheets were a bit less helpful for checking my understanding--I think they could actually have been more rigorous. The discussions in the class were great! I don't think this class has any significant weaknesses, but here are two minor things: I thought that the plankton lab visit could have been a bit shorter (Mary Beth's lecture was great, but I think we didn't need so much time looking at the plankton under the microscopes.). I really appreciated Sharon's lecture, but I wish she had talked about coastal justice issues a bit more--perhaps a heavier hand in nudging her back on topic would have been good.",
    "I actually think that having a midterm would help students feel less overwhelmed with the amount of content covered on the final exam. Although, the weekly quizzes did ensure that I kept up with the material.",
    "Field trips were great! lectures and structure of the course very well organized.",
    "The weekly quizzes helped me prepare for each class session.",
    "The professor is one of the kindest, most accessible, helpful, knowledgable, and in general wonderful I've ever encountered. Class was a joy and the fieldtrips worked perfectly to compliment the materials (would recommend more). Very rarely is a five hour class a welcome experience, but was one of the highlights of the week. The materials incorporate a wide breadth of approaches that are further scrutinized in the classroom, the Professor is available to assist at any point to further understanding and clarify any points. The only possible downside I can think of; would be that when there is an extended class period. the choice of cookies from Koffee is perhaps not the best option for snakes. (Atticus makes some great cookies, and also makes gluten free options.) To reiterate that point, this class was so ridiculously good that the only possible critique I can offer of it is that the cookies (and the coffee), which are provided by the professor for the betterment of the students, could be a little bit better.",
    "I'm not sure how this could be addressed, but my only complaint is that we would review previous week's material at the beginning of the next class's quiz. For weeks when there was a lot of reading to cover for that next class, I found myself often mixed up in what I had read where for which class. Maybe there would be an option to take the quiz the Monday prior, or over the weekend ? Logistically I'm not sure what the solution would be, but it was my only complaint.",
    "One of the greatest strengths is the professor. It is clear that he cares how much the students learn, and he puts in effort and incorporates different ways to keep us engaged. Another strength is the amount of current scientific papers we read in order to learn about the relevant issues and up to date findings. Rather than only reading a text book that might have out-dated information, I'm confident that I was receiving information that's recent and applicable. The field trips were also a great way to see some of the topics first hand."

    "Absolutely take the class and try to get a headstart on studying for the final. Also, take advantage of the reading responses as a good time to ask questions!",
    "Shimi is an amazing instructor and even if you have some knowledge of coastal issues, this course is important to take.",
    "excellent course, especially if you are interested in anything coastal (conservation, resilience, etc)",
    "One of the best courses Ive taken at FES!",
    "Take it. Whether you have a passing interest in coastal ecosystems, no understanding, no interest, or plan on making it your career, take the course.",
    "Take it. Don't even think twice - this was the best class I took this semester."
