   "comments": [
    "If you are unsure about whether to continue DS for the spring semester, H&P Spring is a good reason to drop out and take other, better courses. The syllabus of H&P Spring has way too much reading, very poorly excerpted. I'm convinced, for example, that the only reason any reading was assigned from Volume II of Smith's Wealth of Nations was so that we would have both volumes in our \"DS Library\" at the end of the course. The problem with H&P is that it is politics without a focus on application or real events, with the notable exceptions of Du Bois and Arendt. Basically, DS Spring is probably not worth it because of H&P.",
    "I would strongly recommend this course to another student. The works that we read were formative for our political systems of thought today, and I think that this class is very interesting.",
    "A generally coherent survey of historical and political thought (i.e., political philosophy) from Machiavelli on. It's kind of a confused class, however, and certainly the weakest of the DS triumvirate: it isn't ever as \"in the text\" as it should, as literature is, but doesn't quite make the leap to completely \"out of the text\", as philosophy is. Take it because you should stick with DS for the second semester. But it isn't anything great in its own right.",
    "DS H&P in general depends greatly on the students in your section, as well as the section professor you have. If those two things work out, you're in for a wonderful time, since the reading and the lectures are fantastic. Overall, highly recommended if you are interested in covering some ground on historical and political THOUGHT quickly, NOT a course on history itself.",
    "This is my least favorite DS class, but I would recommend the program to certain students.",
    "This course is a lot of fun, as the works are obviously in conversation with one another. This allows for interesting discussion and paper topics that will not only improve your ability to analyze texts but to think about what the best society really does look like.",
    "Depends wholly on the teacher and your fellow students. I think that Professor El Amine is good, though it depends on the kind of person that you are. If anything, shop it and see for yourself, but I think I would generally recommend Professor El Amine."
