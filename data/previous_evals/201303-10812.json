    "Step 1. Realize Chang DGAF. Step 2. Double-check to see if you'll actually want to read centuries of Chinese poetry and literature in translation. Step 3. Enroll or don't enroll in the class. That is it. If you liked the way step 1 and 2 sound, do it. I thought I did, but lost interest very quickly and it sucked. The rest of the class seemed to like it, though, and Chang is an absolute sweetheart that I could easily see as my really smart and able grandma.",
    "I would recommend this class for anyone who is interested in learning about eastern literature. This is a great introduction as well as in-depth discussion for any level student.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in learning about ancient Chinese poetry or even just Chinese history. Going through a few thousand years of Chinese poetry really allows one to see the patterns of the rise and fall of dynasties and the poetry of those periods that reflect such changes. Professor Chang is very fun and very wise and I loved the class!"
