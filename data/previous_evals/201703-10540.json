   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Standard for lab reports are very high, with very specific but not always clearly stated requirements. Lab reports often seem like busywork.",
    "Strength: experiments can be interesting? Weakness: how you have to basically self-teach all the prelab material.",
    "The class helps us to interesting experiments, but it often feels like we are just cramming a whole bunch of information for one day and then use it to write the lab report and then we move on to the next thing the following week. I don;t feel as if I truly gained a good grasp on any concept.",
    "The class was well organized",
    "Boring, Professor was not understanding at all, too strict, the quizzes were too long for the time given and they were hard to study from. It was not clear from the experiment instructions how the quizzes would test the content of them, and some things tested were not included in the instructions. The lab reports are super long and should not be due the same day as the experiment, or at least they should be due at midnight instead of 6 pm to have more time to ask the TA questions about them before finishing them after the lab day.",
    "This course is extremely subjectively graded. I can submit a report extremely similar to or better than a student that had taken the course with Professor Parr and I would receive an arbitrary grade of 20 points less. This is a widely agreed upon evaluation.",
    "This was a frustrating course that was the low point of every week. The experiments were overly long, annoying and the level of instruction was very poor. The only strength of this course is that it made me appreciate the days I did not have lab.",
    "I found the accessibility of the professor to be poor. While he does offer students the opportunity to talk to him should they have any questions, his disregard for tone and tact disincentivizes this strongly. The grading is also harsh to the extent that student concern themselves with format more than content, as seen in the fact that a grammar mistake is just as costly as a miscalculation. The feedback is minimal, largely inconveniencing both the professor and the students who are trying to learn the materials. A very disappointingly taught course. I hope either a new instructor revives it or this instructor changes fundamentally, seeing as the alternative would be the continued turning away of possible chemistry majors from the field."

The lab reports are super long and should not be due the same day as the experiment at 6 pm.",
