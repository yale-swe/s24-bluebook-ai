   "comments": [
    "This course is a great introduction to the full range of functions of SAS and R. It covers a lot of material and is very useful for anyone that wants to advance programming skills. Labs could benefit from being a little more interactive- they usually involve a brief run-through of an example of code then independent work on homework. It also would have been nice to spend some more time on things like dplyr and ggplot which can be really useful but require a fair amount of time to understand the full depth of the libraries, although to be honest there wasn't enough time in the course to cover more content. Really it would be nice if this was a two semester course, given that the school of public health doesn't offer many other courses in R.",
    "The course mainly aims improving computational skills, and I would appreciated it if it is involved in more statistical programming, like introducing more statistical packages or commands like exact test, regression model so on and so forth.",
    "We do not learn the really useful information from the course. Instead, all the things we can learn in the course, which is trivial, are not adequate for data analysis.",
    "I loved this class, and think holding it in the computer lab is critical to how well it runs. I think the pace could have been a little slower, since it sometimes takes a while to understand the code. The topics we went over in SAS and R I thought were excellent, useful choices. I feel like I will use what I learned in this class for a very long time.",
    "The professor was very good at teaching SAS and her notes were very organized. We moved from topic to topic in a very concise way. However, when it got to the R section of the course, things seemed a lot more unorganized. It didn't seem like we were building upon topics in class and more of just a random assortment of topics was taught to us. I think that in order to take this class, it is best to have both a foundation in SAS and R that you can build upon. Coming in with little familiarity of the subjects might act as a disadvantage.",
    "The classroom condition and facility cause some trouble for studying during lecture when not sitting at the first three rows. We cannot see the screen clearly from the back. And also instructor have to yell during the whole lecture to ensure clarity.",
    "A very systematic course to learn SAS and R",
    "This course is useful in learning some basic methods in SAS and R, but to be honest it doesn't demonstrate how to use the codes well. I was basically copying and pasting the codes the instructor provided in the lecture for my homework and finals.",
    "The lectures are helpful in getting students started with SAS and R programming. The lecture notes are well commented and easy to read and review. The course would be even better if we have an outline of the contents of all lecture notes and then it would be easier to find specific parts of the notes. And maybe the contents of the homework could be adjusted so that there are less repetitive work (like entering all the formats in lab 2\/8) and more work that requires flexible application of the techniques covered in class (like most of the homework).",
    "This course provides very practical and basic knowledge which is very useful to other advanced courses and my future career.",
    "Strengths: Talk about two programming languages. Weaknesses: Lecture notes are embedded in codes, which is an inefficient way of teaching. The grading criteria is not clearly specified in the homework and project assignments. The classroom is too small to hold such a large class; it is extremely hard for those sitting in the back to see the screen.",
    "Workload is extremely heavy, if not interested into statistic methodology, don't take it. if interested in advanced statistic project coding, take with caution.",
    "Strength: comprehensive coverage, detailed slides and excellent lab class weakness: too much workload",
    "This is a great course.",
    "The course covers several topics and assigns assignments that do a good job in encompassing fundamentals of the course and using them in combination to perform more complex functions. The only issue I had with the course would be more information on how to complete the assignments, such as what techniques need to be included to receive full credit.",
    "Combining both R and SAS together felt like too much. With a background in SAS and not R, the SAS portion of the course felt too much of a review in the beginning to be an advance course and by the time we got to the advance topics they were quickly gone through to get to R. With not a lot of background in R, the beginning of the course needed to be more in depth. I was lost and confused with R after the first few lectures. This course almost needs to be broken up into four course. SAS Basic and advance and likewise for R. Since this is the only coding course available students are forced to take it to learn any coding and without in-depth basic course it is hard to understand what the program is doing to really learn the advance topics. For me the end of the SAS material was the most helpful and I was just try to survive the R portion which made me feel as if I didn't really learn any R coding.",
    "Strength: learn additional tricks in SAS, learn R (which we don't really do at all in other courses) Weakness: not enough time in a semester",
    "Very good"

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0The instruction was excellent and Dr. Esserman is great at responding to questions and concerns.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0I think the instructor really put effort to make more clear explanation of the course and will make notes for every questions and issues came up in the class, and absolute great amount of time grading our homework, the comments are really helpful and help me set up a good habit of coding. What I would like to suggest, it is due to personal reference, so, if it is costing too much time, the instructor can just ignore it. I am not very comfortable reading the comments in the notes since they are all upper case, and I am not very used to it. And, I would be more appreciated if there could be an outline for each section, because I think it would help me better understanding the course in an structural way. One more thing that I think that YSPH or the university could do is to provide instructor with a microphone since each time the instructor was forced to shout loud so that everyone could heart it and I think it is really exhausting for the instructor . Anyway, thanks for teaching the class and it helps me a lot as a new beginner of both SAS and R software.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Her ability is limited. She focuses on trivial things instead of the really useful information The knowledge we can learn in this course is limited. Her written English is poor. The information she wants to express is really confusing. So we need to spend a lot of time to figure out what she really wants us to do.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Dr. Esserman is one of my favorite people at Yale. Super approachable, and always willing to help with the assignments. It also says a lot that she always follows up on questions from lecture that she didn't have an answer to.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Conscientious. Topics covered are great. Homework or project description lack clarity sometimes and we may lose points when having a different interpretation with the instructor.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0She is very responsible for every question asked, and lectures are clear and she grades homework very strictly",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0She is a great teacher, but I feel that she was in rush to give us all the codes. I got confused sometimes.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Dr. Esserman is patient and responsive to our questions, and always reminds us of many details when writing codes (comments, formats, label, title of plots, etc). The interaction between students and instructor in class is frequent and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0She is excellent! I like her so much! She's very careful and responsible.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0She is a great instructor.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Professor Esserman is a nice instructor. As a student, here are my suggestions for improvement. 1. Lecture notes: Embedding lecture notes in code is not an efficient way for us to learn, since it is hard to print the entire code for reviewing purposes. Also, it would be much clearer if Professor Esserman could write some slides to present the lecture. In that way, the problem of viewing the screen from the back of the lab could be solved at the same time. 2. Homework assignments: I appreciate that Prof. Esserman graded our assignment carefully. However, some of our points got deducted because of some minor issues, such as typos in comments and in-perfect variable names. BIS 679 is a programming class; thus, I believe the grading should focus on programming techniques. As long as the code could run as desired, then there shouldn't be any points deducted. If there are some issues in areas that is not related to programming, I think the best solution is to give a warning instead of treating it as an error and reduce our score. In addition, those issues were not clearly specified in the assignments. If there can be a clear grading requirement, it would be much easier for us to avoid the issues in advance. I hope this course could be better in the future.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0A very nice professor, but sometimes the assignment is a little unclear. Usually need a lot of time to understand the question. Maybe improve in being more specific and clear about requirements.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Patient, nice and also very strict instructor, overall excellent",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0She is welcome to answer every question we ask her. The only weakness of this course is that some homework (or the project) is not explained clearly by the given instruction. I have to ask the instructor to figure out what is the exact meaning of the project.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Very good teaching. Patient and professional.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0The instructor is very responsive and helpful when approached about questions.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Instructor was great. Very helpful and available to answer all questions",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Very clear instructor. Liked the format of the course, where the lecture sessions were broken up into 2 different 1-hr session days. The programs she created for instruction with the clearly commented code was all extremely helpful.",
    "Instructor: Denise Esserman \u00a0Very good"
