    "If you can't imagine finding any landscape painting interesting, you're in for an agonizing series of gallery visits. If you're open to the subject, though, this class is a pleasant surprise, even if you don't have an art history background. Professor Postle is intimidatingly expert in the subject, but he makes himself readily available for meetings, and is eager to help if you know what you're asking. I was surprised how much I learned from this class.",
    "British Art and Landscape is an introduction to eighteenth-century British landscape painters, particularly focusing on Richard Wilson, Thomas Gainsborough, John Constable, and JMW Turner. It is a rather obscure topic, but if you can get into the flow of the course, it becomes interesting. The obvious strength of the course is the fact that you can see the paintings firsthand in galleries around London, and also see the sights from the paintings firsthand, which changes the experience of looking at the paintings. A weakness of the course is that it deals with a topic that the average non-art student might not have considered in the past, and so it might be difficult for the average student to grasp art concepts or to even be interested in the paintings at first.",
    "British Art and Landscape discusses the development of British landscape art from the late 17th century through the mid 19th century, focusing mainly on Wilson, Gainsborough, Constable and Turner. The course takes full advantage of London galleries and British landscape with frequent class trips. Professor Postle is an expert in the field yet still makes the material understandable and enjoyable for students with no art history background. It's a really unique and wonderful course.",
    "This was by far my favorite Yale in London class, a real multidisciplinary affair. Lectures, half of the time, were in art galleries around London, and we took spectacular all-day field trips. Overall, it really informed us not only about the British artists we studied, but about the development of the landscapes we lived in and around. I feel like a much more informed museum-goer and art historian. The work load was incredibly fair--two papers and an exam. Professor Postle is unbelievably knowledgeable, and was a lot of fun.",
    "You go to museums and look at landscape paintings, and sit in class and look at landscape paintings.",
    "If you like to go to museums, look at landscapes for over two hours and, while standing up, be lectured at with names and dates, while never informed of the significance of any of these things, then take this class. If you want a final exam for which you have to memorize not only the title and artist and dates of paintings, but also what museum they currently hang in, take this class. If you want to think, do not.",
    "Good intro to Brit landscape with probably the best professor you could find on the subject. Basic survey but a real treat-- especially when you are taken to the places where these pieces were painted. Field trips to the country and backstage tours at museums like the Royal Academy were fantastic. Gallery visits with Martin were a treat.",
    "If you have never taken an art history class before, this is a great introduction."
