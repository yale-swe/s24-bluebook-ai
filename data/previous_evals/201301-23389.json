    "A chill EEB seminar. There are few EEB classes which actually go in depth. This one does--take it.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend it! Fascinating material if you're interested in development, evolution, and genetics. The workload is really not bad at all; you read one or two papers before every class and write up a couple of discussion questions. Also, Professor Monteiro is awesome -- clear, smart, and very fair! Take it if you can (although I think she's moving to Yale-NUS, so I don't know if this course will be offered in future years).",
    "This class overviewed topics relating to the evolution of development through the lens of many recent primary papers. We learned by teaching the material, under the watchful eye of Professor Monteiro, focusing most of our efforts on understanding morphological novelties. Professor Monteiro kindly incorporated our interests into the syllabus (notably, animal behavior).",
    "would DEFINITELY recommend. you read one or two papers per week, and discuss the underlying concepts in depth in class. grade is based on weekly questions you have about the reading that you submit, 2 midterms, and a grant proposal paper."
