    "Lots of learning! Great for improving Chinese!",
    "I am very glad that I took this class because it is not only a class about the language but it also introduces you to the current issues in China. Whether or not you improve your speaking in this class depends on how you motivate yourself to practice and review the materials.",
    "Of course if you are in CHNS 150 you're not just taking it for shits and giggles--it's either part of your language requirement or you are doing this for the East Asian Studies major. So it is a must take course. Saying that, the workload for this course is insane and you have to be on top of your shit. This is a very hard class. Do not take it for granted at all. Be ready to spend hours per night studying characters for a short 5 minute pre-class quiz. Though I feel as if my Chinese has greatly improved--I still feel that my oral is the weakest skill. You also learn about Chinese culture in this class which is a new feature compared to the previous levels.",
    "Lots of work. Is Chinese something you want to continue for ever? No. Dont take it.",
    "I started with CHNS L1 and L2 last year, followed by the light fellowship L3 and L4. CHNS 150 was a great next step. Of course, the class seems underwhelming after two months of intensive full-day Chinese classes, however CHNS 150 was a great way to keep up my Chinese listening and writing skills. However, I lost a lot of fluency, which was expected. We had 3 professors and they were all awesome. They are all very strict, yet kind, warm, and eager to help. The homework is time-consuming, but I would recommend this class for anyone who wants to keep up their speaking, listening, and writing skills.",
    "If you've taken Chinese at Yale before you know what to expect. It's a great way to improve your vocab and if you did Light to not forget everything that you learned over the summer. I'd recommend it, but not without a warning that it's not exactly a grade booster.",
    "Interesting topics discussed, makes learning Chinese fun and relevant.",
    "A strong advanced Chinese class, highly recommended.",
    "Great course for committed language learners. It requires a significant amount of time outside of class, but the professors and tutors are clearly very devoted, which validates their high expectations.",
    "Yes. I took Chinese 150 as a way to revamp my Chinese. I thought it would be easier because I was already fluent. The workload in Chinese, however, is always quite heavy.",
    "The Chinese department at Yale has always been phenomenal due to the amazing teachers and small classes. CHNS 150 is no different. That being said, if you are a returning Light Fellow as I was, you're oral ability will almost certainly decline due to a lack of speaking opportunities in class, which I found a bit frustrating. However, I do believe my written ability improved. It is worth taking this class for sure, if anything to delay the rate you lose what you learned over the summer.",
