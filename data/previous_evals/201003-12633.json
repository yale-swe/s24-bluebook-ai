    "It's a wonderful class, I enjoyed all two hours of it every morning. It's also not that much work, although it demands a fair bit of work beyond that asked by Prof. Stern to incorporate the material. That said, there are days when we do nothing in class but hear a particularly pleasant rant, and you have to be willing to put up with that, and with some self-satisfied verbal tics. Have a thick skin, be ready to be teased severely.",
    "If you want to master German, take this course. If you just want to learn how to chat with Germans, this might be a little grammar intensive. Two hours a day, five days a week of grammar, grammar, grammar and the intense\/insightful\/formidable Herr Stern. There's a test every Friday and homework every night, but the workload is not too bad. You will learn a lot, but you cannot slack off because you'll fall behind very quickly. Herr Stern is reason enough to take this course.",
    "Highly, highly recommended. If you want to really learn German, don't waste your time doing anything else.",
    "German 125 is code for \"the most awesome language course I have ever taken.\" Don't be misled by the simple title."
