   "question_text": "Looking back on this course, what is your overall assessment of the course:  What are its strengths and weaknesses, and in what ways might it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course provides a nice overview of designing interventions and the tools to do so effectively. The course moves quickly and the work load is quite heavy.",
    "Perfect way to end my time a YSPH. Brought together all the skills and made them USEFUL. Now I know I can turn a pile of journal articles into health improvement for real people.",
    "The course is very comprehensive and provides a strong summary of what we have learned thus far. Trace is great at what he does. A weakness of the course is that it is very time consuming for something that is not real. You are asked to conduct interviews with community leaders and use their very real time for a class project. That was upsetting for me. The amoung of resources that go into the class project are, in my opinion, excessive if it's not going to benefit a real community partner.",
    "I believe that this is one of the most useful courses offered at YSPH. It teaches a practical skill and allows you to follow a project from initial conceptualization to final evaluation. Students can also develop interventions that will be used by partner organizations. Overall a great course. The course is a lot of work, however, because it is a group project, the burden of work should not fall on a single student. Trace also provides several workshop days where students can work on their projects during class time. Theater testing was one of the best parts of this class.",
    "Very practical class; thorough and robust Very demanding class; would rather take in first year (2nd semester of 2nd year is stressful with job search\/thesis), but realize how more experience i public health make the learning better.",
    "This class teaches a very important skill, but it feels as though certain things should be prerequisites. Questionnaire development and qualitative method should both be required before this course is taught or at least taught alongside them.",
    "I think this is an important class to teach the fundamental theory and practice behind developing an intervention. However, without the intervention actually being used or implemented, it is hard to stay invested in a project that requires so much work. I think the class would be better if we were assigned or could chose from a real community partner that is looking for an intervention deisgn\/implementation. I also think the readings\/class structure was not very cohesive. I didn't feel that I got out of the class what I had hoped because I often felt the readings were not useful and classtime was slow-paced and lax.",
    "A strength of this class is Trace! He's an engaging professor and really cares about the students. I also enjoyed the theater testing lectures, where we had to present an aspect of our intervention to the class for feedback. A big weakness in the class is the group structure of the course. I wish there was a way to hold group members accountable for their contributions to their group projects and not just wait until the end of the course to give them a grade. Since there are three main assignments throughout the class, this gives groups quite a bit of time to work on each part, so people tend to slack off and leave things until the last minute. There should be a way where there is a check-in with the professor more regularly. It would also be a much stronger class if each of the three assignment sections was split up so that there was an assignment every week. Although this would be more grading for Trace, it would provide groups more feedback throughout the semester and ultimately improve their intervention.",
    "This is a great class, it's hands on, practical, but very difficult. Don't underestimate the workload!",
    "Strength - provided a clear understanding of how to develop an intervention manual. Informative of real work in public health settings. Weakness - required too much work per assignment Ways to improve - potentially splitting up assignments in more than just three large assignments",
    "You learn how to systematically design and evaluate a theoretically grounded intervention. However, the class should be a two semester capstone, as many aspects are glossed over.",
    "Strengths: great summation of work from 2 years at YSPH coming together in developing an intervention, especially with the evaluation portion. Very rigorous class and a good lesson in learning how to do group work efficiently. Challenges: A bit difficult to balance with thesis work, although I think we were all aware of the time commitment when we started the class.",
    "A strength of this course is that you truly learn how to create and evaluate an intervention from start to finish. It is a great deal of work and depending on your group dynamic it can feel a bit untenable while done at the same time as the thesis."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a great professor. He offers thoughtful feedback throughout the course to ensure completion of a successful intervention project. He is a bit of a hard grader though!",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is a godsend. He's helpful without being overbearing, and also really ready to work with students to help them have the best possible experience.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was very accessible and knowlegable. He met with each group individually and provided constant feedback. Class was engaging.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is one of the best professors at Yale. He is very dedicated to his students, knowledgeable about designing and implementing interventions, and all around a great person. Trace really takes the time to ensure that every student understands the content and meets with students to discuss their projects several times throughout the semester. Trace is also very responsive to feedback and the wants and needs of the class in terms of timing, and content of his lectures.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace clearly cares a lot about his students and the subject material. His personality is definitely reflected in his style of teaching. However, I sometimes I interpreted his easy-going personality for not caring\/being invested in the class (which I know isn't true). I also wish, at times, that the classes were more structured with activities\/lessons that relate specifically to intervention design and implmentation. Sometimes I left the class confused about what the point was or the takeaways from that day.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace was awesome! You can tell that he really cares about every student and always makes himself available if you need to discuss anything at all. I wish he would reach out to groups more often to check in with them and their progress, and not just at the end of every group assignment.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is awesome and I don't think you truly appreciate his teaching style and his wisdom until you are in his class.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Strength - challenged students to think critically about assignments Ways to improve teaching - have regular check ins regarding the amount each assignment requires and what other large assignments\/exams are occurring during the same time",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Very knowledgeable",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Great instructor, good use of case examples and thorough methods to show us what he means. Good explanations of difficult concepts. Tough grader on initial assignments which did feel a bit discouraging - but in the end made for a stellar final product. We worked hard to meet the high expectations of the course.",
    "Instructor: Trace Kershaw \u00a0Trace is wonderful and has such attention to detail. I think I would have just liked to see him play a greater role as mediator when necessary."

   "question_text": "How would you summarize this course for a fellow student? Would you recommend it to another student? Why or why not?",
   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in designing interventions in the future.",
    "This course takes you step by step through developing an intervention. You will address the need for the intervention, implementation, and evaluation. Course is comprehensive in regard to behavioral theory and public health measures. It's required and I think I'm innately apprehensive towards required courses.",
    "This course allows you to create an intervention from start to finish. The student is allowed to develop an intervention on any public health issue, describe the background and significance of the issue, detail the intervention components and how the intervention will be evaluated. This is an extremely useful skill to have whether the student is planning to go into public health practice or academia after graduation. I would highly recommend this course to all MPH students and other students who plan to deliver interventions of some kind. The final intervention manual, developed throughout the course, is a great product to share with interviewers and future employers\/supervisors.",
    "It's a lot of work but you learn a critical skill for public health practice.",
    "This is a required class for SBS students. Be smart about choosing your group, as you will be working with them for the duration of the semester. Also, I think it would be more rewarding if the intervention you choose was actually going to be implemented or used by an organization. Otherwise, for so much work, sometimes it is hard to stay motivated. All in all, Trace is a fun professor and the class is rewarding in the end.",
    "Great class! I would just recommend selecting a group at the beginning of the semester that you know you will work well with. This course requires a lot of work outside of class, so select a group that will actually pull their weight and contribute equally to the project.",
    "Everyone should take this class! Be prepared to work hard, pay attention, and listen carefully to Trace. Definitely worth taking!",
    "Good course - challenging with amount of work, but got me to critically think about designing, implementing, and evaluating an intervention",
    "If you are going into public health practice, and think you will design and intervention, you should definitely take this course.",
    "Project based class, that i recommend if you're interested in developing an intervention! I think it's an important class for everyone to take though.",
    "Would highly recommend to students interested in health promotion, because you create a tangible product of high caliber from the class. It is a TON of work, but the only type of course in health promotion that YSPH offers. Plus, if you are SBS, you have to take it :)",
    "Take this class! Here you learn exactly what evidence-based research is and consequently why so few people use it... cuz it's a beast!"
