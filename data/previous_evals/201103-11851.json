    "This class is required for senior Linguistics majors, and this year no one else took the class. I probably wouldn't recommend it for a non-major, but I really enjoyed the class and got a lot out of it, both for my senior essay and for life after college. We talked a lot about things that could apply to any job, such as cover letters, resumes, applications, interviews, etc. Really good class. Jelena was fun and pretty laid-back, but thought a lot about our questions and was always available to help us or brainstorm.",
    "You should only take this class if you are a senior linguistics major. If you are a senior linguistics major, you have to take this class. So here we are. Expect to extensively develop your senior essay topic during the semester\u0097in many respects, the linguistics major does have a full-year essay requirement. So we ended the semester with a revised outline. That's a great head start for next semester, but I think it caught a lot of people by surprise, since they weren't expecting to develop a topic so quickly.",
    "If you're a linguistics major, you have to take this, so make sure you've done some reading on possible senior essay topics - it will make your life easier. If you're not a linguistics major, you probably won't get anything out of it, so don't bother.",
    "This class is cross-listed with psych, but the way it was done this year really tailors the class towards senior linguistics majors. Though the major only has a spring senior thesis, this essentially made it into a year-long project. It wasn't fun at the time, but it is nice to know exactly what you're doing by the end of the semester.",
    "Well, it's required for the linguistics major, so if you're reading this evaluation, you're definitely taking the class anyway. Basically you have an assignment every week to help you decide on your senior essay proposal, and by the end of the semester you've done a detailed outline, bibliography, and short presentation on the topic. It is VERY helpful to go in with at least some idea of what your topic is, or who your senior thesis adviser is going to be.",
    "Well you have to take it if you're a major. A lot of the lessons aren't super useful, but are good things to keep in the back of your mind. Make sure to keep working on your senior essay each week (even if it's not much). If you're able to pin down a topic and resources early, make a schedule for yourself, because it will help."
