    "If you can get credit lessons, I would highly recommend them. Even if you don't get a professor, the graduate students are highly qualified to teach. I had a positive experience overall.",
    "I strongly recommend lessons for credit. They are fun, not too much work, rewarding, and tremendously helpful. My voice has undergone a complete transformation since starting. It's helped me develop a much fuller, more mature, operatic sound and given me good habits for vocal health in my other (a cappella, choir) singing commitments. It's low stress and lots of fun."
