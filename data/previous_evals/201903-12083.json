    "Understandings about Japanese history\/film theory\/historical trends in Japanese films\/film categories in Japan, and select information + context regarding different minorities [ethnic\/racial\/sexual\/gender, etc] in Japan.",
    "I got practice writing film analysis which focused on film technique, something I had never done before. I built upon previous knowledge of several of Japan's othered groups. Also, coming from very little knowledge of Japanese cinema, I learned a lot about its history, tropes, common genres, and famous producers. Finally, I gained a much greater appreciation for cinema, filming technique, and the vitality of the communities that form around cinema. I had never been particularly interested in live action films from a visual standpoint, but several films I encountered in this course completely changed that perception.",
    "I had relatively no knowledge about Japanese film before taking this course. Having finished the course, I have a newfound knowledge and interest not only in Japanese cinema, but in Japanese history, culture and modern society as well. Due to the exposure of the course, I have seen so many films I would not have seen otherwise. Additionally, I have developed my ability to critically analyze films and the concepts they address."

   "comments": [
    "Professor edified most student thoughts. nice balance between lecture and discussion. lectures were pretty seamless and a diversity of material was incorporated into both lecture and discussion. Great class.",
    "In my opinion, the strength of the course lies in the lens through which we viewed and considered each film. The driving themes of the course came from the way the course focused on the \"others\" in Japanese films. The vast number and variety of films we watched kept the course interesting and engaging, and the theme of the \"other\" was always the central point of discussion. In terms of the assignments, the presentation was a very unique way to engage with the themes of the course, and the freedom of the assignment allowed for some really great projects."
