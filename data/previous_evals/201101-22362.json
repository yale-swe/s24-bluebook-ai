   "comments": [
    "Definitely take this if it's offered again. This class is great for people who have had no exposure to the topic and people who have already done a lot of work in queer theory and LGBT studies. Everyone can get a lot out of this class, even if you don't think you have an interest in or know anything about queer theory.",
    "Really great syllabus and a chance to push yourself in a type of thinking rarely done elsewhere.",
    "It's really hard to describe what Queer Theory is; it's basically a theory of dispensing with social\/sexual categories and the implications of doing so. But it's much more complicated and encompasses every aspect of your life. Seriously...life-changing class!",
    "DEFINITELY",
    "This is an amazing class. The syllabus is one of the best at Yale, and no other course has made me think as hard or care as much about the material. Professor Warner is brilliant and an excellent teacher. Take it!",
    "A fun and nuanced introduction to the first 30 years of queer theory. Be prepared for lots of (often mind-bending) reading, followed by some slow discussions that pick up as the semester wears on. Michael Warner is a great instructor. Not only is he one of the most prominent queer theorists working today, he's accessible, friendly with students, and hyper-intelligent. I wouldn't want to take this course with anyone else.",
    "The readings for this course are mostly fascinating, entertaining, and thought provoking. Prof. Warner is a brilliant thinker& a founder of the field. He is particularly good at explaining complex concepts. He was always ready to clearly& concisely explain to us the history of debates in queer theory-- because he was there. His insights are so valuable. He feels connected to the subject matter, and in many ways feels ownership over it (so keep differing opinions to yourself). Queer theory presents a set of valuable insights for us; take it to practice reading and writing about issues of gender& sexuality, and to see how you might apply those insights.",
    "Incredible class. The syallbus here is among the best you'll find at Yale and Michael is one of the best professors that you'll find in this country period. You'll learn a lot but not feel overwhelmed by the sheer volume of new material -- it's more about learning a mindset than anything else."
