   "comments": [
    "I absolutely loved this course, in large part because the people in the class were all incredibly passionate about the material. The course each week covers a topic relevant to computer science and law by assigning two readings: one technical solution and one legal review. Then, one or two students present on the topic by introducing the technical solution and using the legal review to consider whether the technical solution actually solves the problem. I absolutely loved this approach which I found to avoid the \"technology is destroying everything\" rabbit hole and instead get to the heart of what computer scientists can do to fix the problems caused by technology. I now have a much stronger understanding of the location of technology and computer science within the legal landscape and I hope to continue exploring what I learned in this course for years to come.",
    "This course covered a variety of topics that relate to Computer Science and Law. The course topics change depending on what students express interest in but in the Fall of 2019 we covered algorithmic biases, cryptocurrency, cyberwar, and targeted advertising among others. If you are interested in the intersection of Computer Science and Law this is the course to take.",
    "Learned a lot about the issues lying at the intersection CS and Law. Was able to figure out how to present such complex subjects in digestible manner as well as formulate coherent discussion arguments to better explore such issues.",
    "Each week, you read one technical paper (a typical 10 page, two column paper published somewhere like IEEE) and a legal paper (a 60+ page paper published somewhere like the Yale Law Journal). The technical paper provides you with a more rigorous backdrop for understanding the legal paper, and the legal paper provides you with social\/legal\/historical info for contextualizing the technical paper. Throughout the class, you're analyzing issues like algorithm fairness, algorithmic transparency, content moderation, and exceptional access through this joint technical and legal lens."

   "comments": [
    "I loved the size of the class (15 or so people). Since we were all very devoted to the topics we covered, the seminar was never boring and always led to the sharing of interesting conclusions and perspectives. My main critique, however, was that Professor Feigenbaum often interrupted students she disagreed with, or straight up told students that their opinions were wrong or \"stupid\", which I did not think was an appropriate choice by a professor. While students and Professor Feigenbaum often had very different perspectives on certain issues, that does not mean that the students were wrong and I would have appreciated if the class allowed for greater debate.",
    "The strength of the course was the content covered. Every topic was interesting and the discussion with members of the class was engaging. One way the course could be improved is there could be more graded assessments or the grading could be made clearer. There were only two full assignments, a class presentation and a final paper and it was not really clear the requirements of the assignments. Maybe that is just how graduate classes work.",
    "Strengths: Seminar style is amazing. Become extremely close with fellow classmates. Feigenbaum is funny, though she wont laugh with you. Topics are interesting. Student presentations are rewarding to listen to. Weaknesses: Feigenbaum does not know how to lead a seminar, as she interjects a lot with her own opinion and overrides students.",
    "Joan Feigenbaum is amazing. She is so passionate and caring a great mentor overall.",
    "I wish that the last three classes weren't spent on student presentations alone. I would have preferred if we continued to have our weekly readings and discussions. Perhaps presentations could be cut in half and the second half of the class could be devoted to them."

    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in understanding the state of computer science within our legal, political, and ethical landscape. I would also recommend it to anyone who has an interest in zero-knowledge, verification, cryptography, labeling, and other emerging algorithmic fields and would like to see how they can be applied to an area outside of pure computer science.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student and would take it again if I had the opportunity. This might have been my favorite course I have taken while at Yale. The smaller class size allows for rich discussion on topics and the topics covered were very interesting. The intersection of computer science and law is increasingly important and this course dives deep into it.",
    "YES! Amazing and makes us more aware of the repercussions of technology.",
    "yes",
    "Take this course! Joan will lead fascinating discussions, and will allow you to think about some of the most important legal and ethical issues in CS. Great for CS or non-CS majors.",
    "No.",
    "Yes! This class is amazing. It's not often that you have the chance to take a 10 student class in the CS major. The readings are short and interesting enough that everyone (for the part) actually does them. Professor Feigenbaum is a pioneer in this field. She is incredibly easy to talk to and cares a lot about her students. If you care about tech, society, ethics, etc., you will love this class."
