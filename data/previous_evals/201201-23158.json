    "An introduction to Classical Ethiopic (Ge\u02bbez). I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Great class, great teacher. The interest is small enough to where anyone wanting to learn the language would take it no matter what.",
    "It should be noted (as Prof. Butts had indicated) that this is a graduate level class and requires prior background in Semitic languages. The paces is extremely fast and the workload heavy. Prof. Butts, however, takes great pains to make the material as accessible as possible. While rigorous, this is nevertheless, probably one of the best opportunities to learn Ethiopic in the country."

   "comments": [
    "Crucial for understanding Second Temple literature. I am currently working on a paper on Jubilees for a different class, and my Ethiopic has already come in handy. As someone interested in working in Rewritten Bible texts, this class was great in establishing a foundation for language work in the genre.",
    "This course has allowed me to expand the range of my research capabilities by allowing me access to important texts that would be otherwise impossible to examine firsthand. Already I have seen some of the possible benefits of Ethiopic in my research and will certainly continue in the course."
