    "It is a course that gets you to know the big picture about European econ history from Black Death until WWI. Informative, but requires a lot of reading.",
    "I would recommend the course. It requires a great amount of time to do the readings and the papers, but it is an interesting course even if you are not into history in general."

    "It made me realize that while I greatly enjoy reading economic history articles, I don't want to do economic history research, which was pretty valuable! Not a knock on the class, just saying that it helped me discover my personal preferences, which was valuable. And I learned a lot of things that will be helpful in thinking about my chosen fields.",
    "it was a nice experience taking this course.",
    "Provided plenty of experience of research and review related to my discipline. The course contributed a lot.",
    "I don't know how much did this course help me deepen my knowledge in Economics, but it did help me have more sense of some important events related to it."
