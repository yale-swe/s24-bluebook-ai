Reading ethnographies, questioning accepted ways of developing and implementing D or C projects, and generally being critical and looking sideways at issues that involve the fate of the developing world will only make us more humble, empathetic and understanding. Development is not about money. This course opens your eyes to that."

    "Critical reading (leading to thesis sentences), conceptual material, and the ability to integrate class concepts into a paper topic of our choice",
    "The readings (specifically the Mitchell, Scott and Carpenter, which I liked best of all) for this course are thoughtfully selected and help students to understand the concept of a black box from many angles. The pace of the course is deliberate without feeling overly repetitive--spending three weeks on the topics of community and household, respectively, allowed a close reading of those concepts. I really appreciate that Carol insists on thesis sentences because it forces you to distill sometimes difficult jargon into a concise summary of an argument. This exercise has influenced the way I read, making me more attentive and better able to digest dense academic texts, and also the way I write thesis sentences in my own essays."

    "My only comment relates to the class discussions. I think sometimes students should be given more opportunities to speak during class. This is not to say that Dr Carpenter's comments are less important or not well-received. Rather, sometimes talking about the topic helps me to process the topic even more than listening would.",
    "The specific guidelines for the paper need to be given to students much much earlier than they were this semester.",
    "I do wish that discussions had been a bit more lively and generative. There were definitely weeks when that was the case, when everyone came with ideas they wanted to test out and we felt, as a class, able to follow those and add our own. I think the last class period, where we took turns sharing the topics of our final papers, was fascinating and made it clear to me just how much I had learned during the semester. However, many of the discussions were shepherded along\/directed by Carol which could make it hard to feel like there was time and space to respond to fellow classmates' ideas. I think if we had been allowed a bit more uncomfortable silence in which to think and respond (instead of having Carol jump in immediately unless she saw someone else about to speak), perhaps we could have really felt like we were working through ideas as a team. That said, I think Carol has a lot of relevant experience and even her digressions do add to the course."

   "comments": [
    "This was touched on a bit above. I think Carol gives amazing lectures--they are clear, feel a bit like she is uncovering the mysteries of difficult readings while acknowledging all the nuances. I like that the line between lecture and discussion is blurred so that we can ask questions and voice thoughts while she is lecturing. I think a bit more time to let the week's discussion leaders really lead the discussion could make the discussion more fruitful."

    "The course has helped me to be more self-aware. It has also improved my ability to be more critical in a constructive way. The course has improved my ability to question my assumptions and those of others. These skills are important in any field. I think it is fair to say that the material is not only useful for those working in conservation\/development\/ or anthropology. In fact, I suppose some FES faculty would benefit from these concepts as well."

Since that time, I became interested in conservation and spent some time doing research in a village in Madagascar and observing the way conservation and development projects play out in a particular place. This course seemed to be the perfect way to have another chance to take a class with Carol while giving me tools to understand what I was seeing in my research."

    "Even though reading the material and writing a thesis statement for each reading sounds simple and straightforward, it is actually much more time-intensive than I realized. It is a valuable skill that takes time to do well. I would recommend leaving plenty of time to digest and distill the information in the course reading assignments.",
    "This course is eye-opening and gives you a lot to think on, especially if you have worked in the implementation of any sort of Conservation or Development project. It will give you new ways of looking at the way the universal aspects of policy shift and fragment when they come into contact with the realities on the ground. This class is not very hopeful and you might leave feeling a little depressed about the state of the world, about the fact that development projects often do more harm than good. But the critiques are important to understand and grapple with if we are going to try to find any solutions. You should be prepared for some long readings and doing weekly thesis sentences means you have to read closely and attentively. That said, the work load is not excessive. Carol is a wonderful teacher, very encouraging, fun to talk with and has many important insights."
