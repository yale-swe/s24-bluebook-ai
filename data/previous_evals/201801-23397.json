    "Strengths: I appreciated the variety of assignments- quizzes, reading summary, blog post, annotated bibliography, etc. and the lecture topics. The field trips offered were really cool, too. Weaknesses: The reading summary presentations were a bit monotonous after the first 3-4 people presented. Areas of improvement: Perhaps, have students do group presentations so there are less overall presentations by students over the course of the semester. Penalize students for not adhering to blog post schedule. There was a glut of posts at the end of the semester so I didn't have a chance to read most of them.",
    "Informative course on oceanography Maybe it should be a 5 credit course",
    "Instructor and TA were both terrific, content and structure of the course outstanding. Nice mix of quizzes, exams, paper, blog and presentation requirements and great to have two field trips. Lectures were interactive with discussion. All really good. No suggestions for improvement. I almost wish it could have gone on longer!"

   "comments": [
    "A nice course to understand marine ecology",
    "Keep up with the readings, don't get behind. Ask questions if you don't understand something because the instructor wants you to understand. Dig into the science as better understanding the fundamentals of the science helps with the higher level understanding of the importance of the various topics."
