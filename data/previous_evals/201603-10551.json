    "Chinese 110 teaches students twenty dialogues to help establish a foundation for students' Chinese grammar and vocabulary. Most importantly though, the class highlights pronunciation. I feel as though my pronunciation after taking one semester of Chinese is far more polished than the pronunciation of friends of mine who have to taken Chinese for multiple years at other institutions.",
    "I learned basic skills of speaking and writing Chinese, including pronunciation and grammar.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of speaking and writing in Chinese.",
    "Some proficiency in reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Lots of good basic communication skills, but learned grammar rules etc behind what we learned, didn't just memorize phrases.",
    "I got a new appreciation for studying from this course; if you don't study every night, you will not do well. I learned about 300 Chinese characters and can now have basic conversations after only taking one level, so I feel really accomplished.",
    "I developed a good fundamental knowledge base for the Chinese language and culture, which I hope to expand in future semesters.",
    "I learned Chinese and how to speak, write, read Chinese.",
    "Considering I knew no Chinese before taking this class, I feel I have learned a lot for such a short time. We started from the very basics -- learning to pronounce the pinyin sounds and articulate sounds, to reading and writing characters and having simple conversations. Chinese is a hard but beautiful language in many ways. The grammar is really simple and the way words are formed is often fun -- for example, the word for a film literally means \"electric shadow\", and airport is \"flying machine field\". The difficulty in learning comes from having to memorize characters for every word you learn and learning to pronounce sounds you likely haven't encountered before."

   "comments": [
    "I do not think the course has any weaknesses. The class has a very intimate structure that allows students to receive direct feedback from professors everyday. Although there is a substantial amount of work, all of it is crucial in helping students improve their speaking ability. Every assignment in the class seems purposeful.",
    "Great engagement with students. No real weaknesses",
    "I thought the teachers were really nice and did a good job explaining the concepts in class. A lot of work though.",
    "Was a very strong course.",
    "I don't see anything wrong with the setup of the course. Every aspect has helped me grow as a Chinese learner and speaker in some way. My section only had seven students, so we were able to get to know all of the teachers and their different teaching styles. That was definitely a plus, as is the emphasis on pronunciation.",
    "The course is very fast, and you will get a lot of practice with the language. It is strong in its structure and effectiveness, but weak in how little time it leaves you to review\/prepare for examinations.",
    "The daily quizzes force you to stay on top of everything. But sometimes the lessons could be a bit quick and difficult to follow.",
    "Strengths include level of engagement with the professors, mandatory tutoring ( which allows students to work on their weaknesses on a one to one basis) and comprehensive tests. Weaknesses include oral examinations- students must take their oral exams next to their classmates, which makes it really difficult for you to concentrate and hear your own response, obstructing your overall performance on the test.",
    "I don't feel like the class could have been organized in a better way than it was"

   "comments": [
    "Yes, do it. The Chinese department at Yale is very engaging and strong. You'll be putting in a lot of work, but it's super rewarding and you won't feel it as a burden.",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to any student interested in learning Chinese. However, because of the workload, I would encourage only fully committed students to take it. This is not the class to take for an easy language credit, but I would say it is the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale so far.",
    "I would recommend this course to others--great learning experience!",
    "I would recommend if you were ever interested in learning Chinese.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course. Chinese is a cool language, and the necessity of writing in characters adds to that. Great students and teachers. A very good class. Also, not as much work as it was cracked up to be -- I could do the homework in 30min every day, and studied before quizzes while walking to class (and did well in the class). I think if you've learning other languages fun and easy, this isn't too bad (if that isn't you, this comment may not be very helpful to you).",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I have discovered new learning capabilities within myself after taking only one semester of Chinese, and learning the language itself is empowering.",
    "I would recommend this course, because it was very effective in teaching the language and enjoyable. My only caution is that if you aren't great at picking up languages quickly or don't enjoy learning new vocabulary, this might not be the best course for you.",
    "Yes! It was a lot of fun.",
    "If you genuinely want to learn Chinese, take this course. If you are taking Chinese to fulfill a language credit, run far, far away. Expect to work at least 2 hours a day.",
    "If you want to learn Chinese from scratch, there can't be a better place to start than this class. It is incredibly frustrating at first, having to learn to pronounce new tones and sounds, and memorizing characters that make no sense to you. However, as time goes on, it becomes much more rewarding -- pronunciation is no longer something you constantly think about, and you get better at remembering characters and words. Mind the time required outside class -- students are expected to read the lessons in advance, and you'll need some time to practise writing characters (expect 6 new characters each day). There are also daily quizzes to make sure everyone is on track, and TA sessions that help you practise prononciation one-on-one. Overall, you learn a great deal for just one semester, and it's a class I strongly recommend for anyone interested in learning a new language."
