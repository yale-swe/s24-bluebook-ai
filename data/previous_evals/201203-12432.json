    "Its a good class",
    "Take it! might be basic if you have alot of sociology experience (She warned us about this the first class). But as a non-social science person this was at a good introductory level and the class was really fun. Readings are interesting and the applied format of the papers taught me alot\/was more fun to do!",
    "It's a broad view of the various intersections of sex, sexuality, gender, race, and class, with emphasis on gender. When I say it's changed the way I view gender in society, I am not kidding. I somewhat annoy my friends with the saying \"well, that's a really gendered phenomenon.\" You see the strings that tie together the system. I took it because I had never taken a WGSS or Sociology class before. It's a great intro course.",
    "One of the classes at Yale that will change the way you look at the world for the rest of your life. EVERYONE at Yale should take this course. The readings were mostly interesting. The quizzes are easy if you go to class. The papers are open to a topic of your own interest. Great class! Take it!",
    "Absolutely take it",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! It's the perfect entry into WGSS or SOCY. The workload is very manageable; don't start off with credit D (which is what I did, and I wish I could have used it as a safety net for another class). However, if the topics in the syllabus don't interest you, don't take the class; it is (rightfully) pretty heavy on gender theory and feminist perspectives. VERY important work, in my opinion, but difficult to work with \/ sit through each week if you aren't into it.",
    "If you haven't taken a WGSS class before, definitely. This class will go at a steady pace and really ease you into the topics at hand. The lectures are fun and the discussion sessions are really interesting.If you have taken a WGSS class before, probably not. The topics will be very introductory and if you're familiar with certain terms (like intersectionality), the class might be really repetitive.",
    "Definitely. The workload was really manageable, and the information is really interesting. I find myself talking about things I've learned in class a lot.",
    "This class was great! Super straightforward, engaging, and the course outline following the human life through the lens of gender was fantastic. The quizzes were easy, the readings (though sometimes tedious) were great, and the papers were fun to write. My only criticism is that we did not have detailed instructions for the big papers, so the first one was a hit-and-miss in order to figure out what to write for the second paper.",
    "I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in thefield of sociology or women's and gender studies. It is a very comprehensive class and a great introduction to many of the concepts. The workload is very doable, and the readings are interesting. The papers allow for the chance to apply some of the concepts about interview and survey research learned in class (and they mean that there isn't a final!) Quizzes are all very straightforward, and the class is very doable if you go to lecture and do the readings.",
    "Yes!!",
    "not a difficult class, I would recommend it if you're interested it the field, if you're not it'll get boring.",
    "Sex and Gender in Society is an amazing class. Professor Almeling makes lectures so interesting and the material covered in class is fascinating.Take it!",
    "Totally recommend this class. The workload is just nightly, super interesting readings and then two 5 page papers and 2 quizzes. Was my least challenging class this semester, but the class I learned the most in and enjoyed the most.",
    "The course introduces the basic knowledge required to grasp the implications of the term \"gender\" in western societies.This course should be recommended, the topics analyzed can be used to reflect upon life experiences, taking knowledge outside the classroom.",
    "This class was very interesting and had a manageable amount of work. The material was really interesting, the kind of stuff that you wouldn't learn or talk about in most other classes. Professor Almeling is a great instructor. The workload is very decent, only two papers and two quizzes. Overall, great way to learn the introductory principles of sociology.",
    "It is a good mix of reading sociological papers and theory on sex and gender. The readings are interesting and class is engaging. I would recommend the class.",
    "Sex& Gender is a great introductory sociology course that I highly recommend to anyone considering the majors associated with it. As someone who had never payed much attention to sex and gender, I feel that I now constantly view things through \"gender goggles\" (in a non-negative way). This class definitely opened my eyes to the subtle instances of gender discrimination that occur daily. It is not a difficult course to handle; there are two research papers (one interview based and one survey based) and two quizzes (midterm and final). The quizzes were based on the readings and lecture, but really they just required paying attention in lecture.",
    "Great course! Very interesting! Great professor and interesting material. Sometimes the reading can be lengthy but you dont have to get through it all to do well in the class. The quizes and class assignments are not too demanding. Very low key, interesting class. If you're considering it, take it! You wont regret it.",
    "Yes! This was a great course. In addition to teaching you about the ways in which gender shapes our society, you'll learn how to do social science research. There's one interview-based paper and one survey-based paper over the semester (although this might be changing, I think) and Professor Almeling provides very good guidance on how to approach these. We even did a workshop one day in class to practice writing interview questions and interviewing people. I'm sure that knowing how to do original research will be really useful going forward.I was expecting the class to be a survey of the ways in which women are oppressed, but it really wasn't that at all. Professor Almeling did a good job of looking at how both men and women are advantaged\/ disadvantaged by different gendered expectations.The assessment structure was great- a two-page research proposal, two five-page papers and two quizes. It's great to do a little more work at the beginning of the semester so that, by the time finals roll around, you're completely done.",
    "Great class, whether or not you're previously experienced with sociology or WGSS. Incredibly interesting readings (you'll actually want to do them) and Professor Almeling is a really great lecturer that uses the lectures to add concepts to and bring together the readings and course themes. This semester we had two short quizzes (very easy) and two \"research\" papers (5-6 pages each, but the expectations were too high for the length and scope). Overall, I'd recommend it highly! Make sure to do your readings and start your papers early, though - have your TF read a draft first."
