    "I found this course to be extremely interesting. The structure of the course helped me build my understanding of the course material and then apply it to a real life situation. At times, lectures felt a little rushed, but overall, I really enjoyed this course and found the assignments, including 3 labs, to be very helpful and comprehensive.",
    "This is a great survey course. It is structured well, beginning with a review of theory followed by specific case studies and methods. There should be more courses on this topic!",
    "Very interesting course. The material was fascinating. However, its main weakness was that lectures were dry at times and it could have been more interactive. The class was small enough that it could have been directed more as a seminar.",
    "I really enjoyed taking this course with Maria. She is a great instructor\/lecturer and introduces a lot of interesting topics tying together ecology and epidemiology.",
    "Excellent course is an introduction to for extension of ecoepidemiology. Combination of lecture material and labs were extremely helpful. Lecture format was straightforward and slides were clear. Reading material support of and showed practical application of principles learned in class.",
    "Strengths:i) A multi-disciplinary approach. (ecology, epidemiology, vector borne diseases, geo-spatial analysis)ii) A diverse student group. (public health, forestry)iii) A peer-reviewed grant proposal.Weaknesses:i) Some concepts can be repetitive depending upon your background.",
    "Lots of different topics covered, but perhaps meeting with students and choosing areas of focus for the duration of the course could make it more enjoyable."

    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Maria is wonderful. She's a great lecturer and responds well to students. She is patient and understanding and is always available if you want to discuss something more. Definitely take a course with her if you can!",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Professor Diuk-Wasser was extremely helpful and receptive. She was a ton of help in writing the research paper, and was really always there to help the students.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Excellent instructor. Clear lecture material and emphasized the appropriate themes. She has significant experience in the field to answer practical questions. Very willing to be available to help with projects. Flexible with assignments when necessary.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0Great lecturer, very knowledgeable and engaging. Readings were sometimes dense but were used well in the curriculum. Homework assignments were decent, but greater collaboration between the groups and the professor may improve the quality of presentations and assignments from each SLD.",
    "Instructor: Maria Diuk-Wasser \u00a0She is wonderful and very understanding in terms of extending due dates, providing more information, etc. Lectures are a little fast paced and mostly powerpoint based, which can get monotonous."

    "Instructor: Marina Antillon \u00a0Great job taking over for professor when she was not present. Printed notes were also appreciated. Labs could be a little more polished in the future, as some parts were skipped over.",
    "Instructor: Marina Antillon \u00a0So helpful! Some of the labs were a little unclear but she went above and beyond to be available outside of class to provide help."

    "I would recommend this course. I learned a great deal from this course and the labs.",
    "Highly recommend.",
    "Yes take it! If you are at all interested in epidemiology, this is a great introduction to it that will change the way you think. The coursework is not too heavy, a couple homework assignments, a student led discussion, 3 labs, a midterm and a final project. The final project is really a great learning experience.",
    "Excellent course for the student interested in this particular field. Some experience helpful but not necessary. Diverse assignments including midterm and final project helpful in highlighting major points that are central to this course.",
    "This course provides a great look at the large intersectionbetween ecology and epidemiology. I would recommend the course to someone interested in global epidemiology or zoonotic disease.",
    "If you are interested in vector borne disease, yes, definitely take this course! If not, you will not like this course and not learn enough public health skills that can be applied to other diseases. Builds on Infectious Diseases class nicely."
