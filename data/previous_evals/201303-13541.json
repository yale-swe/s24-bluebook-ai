    "I think the class is tough, but great.My thought is that it's extremely useful for quantitative analysis. But I also believe that I'm in the minority among FES students who are concerned about quantitative skills. I think many of my peers are more focused on qualitative skills... writing, policy, etc.",
    "The only reason I did not rate the class (1) Excellent is because it covers quite difficult material, and I don't want to mislead future students. In fact, it is deceptively hard because Professor Gregoire makes it seem so easy . . . until you try the work on your own!",
    "1. Fox\u00e2\u0080\u0099s R Companion to Applied Regression was helpful for navigating R, but the Fox text itself was less helpful than the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notes, and I rarely used it.10. While the instructor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notes were somewhat useful, my main complaint about the class is that the concepts were not explained in a way that really helped me to understand them. It would have been extremely helpful if the instructor used more graphical (even simplified graphical) illustrations to demonstrate concepts. The \u00e2\u0080\u009cnarrative\u00e2\u0080\u009d style of the lectures did not lend itself well to exploring what is inherently a very visual\/graphical subject. More active drawing on the whiteboard during lectures or more utilization of graphical examples would have gone a long way to making the concepts in this class more accessible.14. One thing I did take from this class is how extremely important regression modeling is for making use of environmental data. Use of regression is pervasive in forestry and environmental literature, so even achieving a very basic understanding of the practice was helpful to me.",

    "The lectures in this course were boring. The presentation of materiel on the form of a single pdf of notes is not effective. It is difficult to figure out what is important when information is presented this way. The lectures also did not go into much detail about about the why certain types of regression are better or worse.The progress of the course was also slow. At the depth we were covering material we could have covered a lot more.The problem sets at the start of the course were much too simple.Lecture is not the way to teach the R language the professor should present a single intro lecture to the R language and then direct student to the teaching fellow and the copious amounts of online resources to improve there understanding.",
    "The lectures could be a little more participatory\/dynamic",
    "Provide examples with more recent\/fun data.",
    "This class is almost like two classes in one: the concept of regression and an introduction to the R program\/language. Unfortunately, I feel as though I didn't really end up fully understanding either, and I wish it actually would have been two separate classes. My other main complaint is that the TA was very slow in returning homework assignments, and he was not very available for assistance with R (and I think that this is the class where it would have been the MOST helpful to me to get outside help).",
    "I think it may help to have a lab component to this course. Scripting in R is demanding of time and may be helpful to work more closely with others with experience."

I did not attend these, as I learned R just fine on my own.Noel's lateness in grading or giving feedback on assignments was quite frustrating. Assigned tasks often depended on previous ones, so it would have been helpful to know if the earlier ones had been done correctly. I had to tackle the final project without knowing whether I had done 3 of the 8 assignments correctly. When he did grade homeworks, Noel took points for trivial things like forgetting to put a legend on a chart, instead of actual helpful feedback about the content and procedures.I'm sure thisis a difficult class to grade, but I personally would have preferred more feedback all along to the early R sessions.",
