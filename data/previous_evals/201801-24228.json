    "Rather than purely posing discussion questions for each week, it might be useful to have students also summarize the text to make sure that everyone is on the same page in understanding the argument and how effective it is.",
    "I liked that many classes had a particular concept to unpack--price, property, wage, etc. It was also good to include the foundational readings (Marx, Polanyi, Wood). Class discussion was robust and expansive. A few of the weeks of reading could be maybe a little excessive. (Urban geography week--Self, Harvey, Gilmore comes to mind. Hard to complete that much reading in a week.) Maybe I'm a wimp, but when it's over 350 pages, it becomes very difficult to finish, especially with other classes' readings."
