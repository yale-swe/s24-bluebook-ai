    "This class is great. I think every Yalie would enjoy taking it credit d second semester senior year.",
    "Yes, take it. Lots of reading but very enjoyable and mostly easy reading. The papers can be annoying but the class quality is still quite high.",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS!! Even if you're not an English major, you should take it. It's a great excuse to read great books, and Professor Hungerford makes lecture interesting.",
    "Honestly, I think this lecture is overrated. The readings are awesome, but the lectures were far from amazing. Solid, but nothing more. My favorite part was my section. If you ever have the opportunity to be with Ms. Cep, take it.",
    "Read great books, talk about great authors, enhance your reading experience.",
    "Take the WR section if you can. Since you have no exams, you don't really have to go to lecture and can cherry pick which books to read and write your essays on. They grade essays harshly but if you write well, you'll be fine.",
    "Take it WR with Sam Fallon if you can",
    "Take it. For some people, reading a novel a week is a challenge, but I promise you'll enjoy reading most of the texts on the syllabus. I didn't always agree with Professor Hungerford's interpretations, but I was always impressed by the way she delivered them.",
    "Yeah, it was great! Choose your TA carefully--grading is pretty arbitrary. But the content is fun!",
    "I definitely recommend the class. The writing requirement is pretty easy to fulfill: 3 papers (2-4p, 5-6p, 5-6) and the final paper is a significant revision of one of the earlier ones. Hungerford is interesting and brings great insights into the class.",
    "Overall, it's a great English course. You get to read novels, which on the whole are more enjoyable. Hungerford is a great lecturer, and her arguments are well delivered and well structured. I felt like I learned a lot about literature in America. It's definitely a lot of reading, and you get a lot more out of the class if you actually do it (true for almost everything). The Non-WR option is fine. The final wasn't the best, and her IDs are VERY VERY specific (like one word things).",
    "A really good course, quite stimulating and entertaining. The reading list consisted of must-reads! I would recommend taking the course Credit\/D because the grading was sort of hard. You might consider taking it for a WR credit, because that way there is no final exam (which is kind of tough) and participation counts for more. Its only one extra paper with the writing credit.",
    "LOVED IT. take it if you can. a novel a week is a lot, but it's worth it: the reading list is *great*, and professor hungerford's a phenomenal lecturer.",
    "Good course overall, grading is needlessly harsh for some reason. Didn't think it was really all that it was cracked up to be but enjoyable nonetheless. Took it to fill my American Lit credit as an English major; probably wouldn't recommend doing that mostly because of aforementioned grading issue. Take it credit\/d as a fun course and it'll be enjoyable--the books are good and Hungerford is a really great lecturer, and really passionate about books and the value of reading, which shows in her lectures.",
    "American Novel should be called Amy's Book Club because it feels less like a class than an enjoyable commitment to becoming more cultured and well-read. You read a satisfying collection of the most important books since 1945, listen to the most thought-provoking, intelligent lectures, discuss your own ideas in an intimate section, and apply your thoughts in persuasive writing. Professor Hungerford lectures freely and eloquently with minimal use of notes, and you'll go home pondering not only literature in itself but also American history, visual culture, the novel as a genre, etc. This was my favorite class this semester. For those of you worried about grading and whatnot, don't worry - you don't have to be an English major to succeed in the class (there weren't any in my section, I don't think, and I'd say we all were comfortable accessing the ideas and material). To choose between the WR or non-WR: the non-WR students are held more accountable for details from all the books because they still have to take the final exam, so if you think you might not be able to read a lot of the books, maybe do WR since you can choose what you write on and you don't take the final. That said, if you're not reading most of the books if not all of the books, why take the class anyway? Also, this class is an investment of your time... but it is a great investment, so make sure you have enough room in your schedule. By all means, take the course and come out of it proud that you've finally set aside time to read those books you always wanted to but couldn't because \"school got in the way.\"",
    "I would! A great class wether you're a freshman starting out english, or a senior looking for a fun reading list before you graduate.",
    "Take to\u00e2\u0080\u0094not as easy as you may or may not have heard it to be.NON WR students, you've been warned\u00e2\u0080\u0094Your TA is really important in determining your grade, especially considering the difference in backgrounds of the TAs given the courses cross-listing.With that said, AH will make you a better reader. She's an excellent lecturer, and I couldn't imagine getting anything more from a lit. lecture.",
    "Definitely take it. I am not an english major and I loved this course.",
    "yes great reading list and fun class. Lecture very good",
    "I would recommend it.",
    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student, especially with this version of the reading list. If you have time to do the reading, this course is incredibly rewarding. These are books anyone should read, regardless of his or her major, as they are thought-provoking, inspiring, and entertaining reads. The course work is manageable, so choosing to enroll in this course should be a personal decision about the time you have to give to the reading. I promise that doing the reading is incredibly rewarding!",
    "Great, reading list is amazing. highly recommended for that reason alone. The fact that professor hungerford is an awesome lecturer is just a bonus.",
    "Though it's just a one semester reading list, these are books that are must-reads. Take this class to have the books under your belt and to enjoy Amy Hungerford's fast-paced and interesting lectures.",
    "I highly recommend this class! The reading list was great this year and I trust Professor Hungerford to put together a great one in the next years as well. My knowledge of this period of literature has definitely expanded. The work for this class was a pleasure to do because it involved reading great but challenging literature.",
    "The course focuses on very contemporary fiction, and requires reading a novel a week to keep up. Although the course homework and lectures are very interesting, it moves through the novels too quickly and impersonally.",
    "I really enjoyed having the opportunity to read all the different novels, and Prof Hungerford is masterful at lecturing and tying everything together. If you aren't an English major, maybe consider taking it Credit\/D, because apparently Prof Hungerford doesn't like the teaching fellows giving out too many A's. Also sometimes the grading is very subjective. The workload isn't too bad (for non-writing, it is 3 short papers and a final). After this class, I think I will read books in a more analytical way.",
    "Take this class if you grew up reading novels. It is an incredibly refreshing, incredibly edifying experience to take the genre of literature you grew up with and fly with it into a more deeply analytic, deeply academic, still yet joyful sphere. This is a thoroughly excellent course. I have never learned more in a literature class--possibly because I have never taken a lecture course on literature before--but what a course! what literature! and what a professor! Professor Hungerford has meaningful and unexpected insight to offer on every text the course covers (which are many, because it's a book a week in this class!) to the point that every class is filled with the sound of rainfall, a veritable patter of keyboards clicking away. Take this course. It's a blast.",
    "Amy Hungerford is one of the best lecturers I've had at yale. Brilliant. And the book list is great and different from anything else you'll get at yale. Gradin is hard. Credit d is a great option.",
    "I would recommend this class",
    "Amazing reading list, great lecturer. I took this credit\/D and was glad I did, because I didn't quite get to all the books and because it made it easy to just enjoy the course.",
    "Certainly one of the finest lectures at Yale. This class will leave you wanting more of Professor Hungerford's eloquent talks, wanting more modern novel, and feeling like you can pick up any novel and think about what it is worth and where it lies in the canon of American novels.",
    "Absolutely take it. It's a fabulous English class as well as being a great time; Prof. Hungerford picks great books, discusses them with great facility and ability, and ensures the course is as meaningful as students want to make it.",
    "Survey in modern American literature.",
    "If you like really analytical close readings, take it. If you want to just learn about cool books, the lectures are a little too english-y and not as broad as i would have hoped.",
    "Yes. Great readings and lectures.",
    "Take it! The reading list is great, Hungerford is a great lecturer, etc. There is a novel per week, but they all fly by (except for Barth), so the workload isn't too awful.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It's one of those classes that everyone should take before they graduate.",
    "I highly recommend this course to those who want to try reading contemporary American literature in a class setting rather than just for pleasure, if they are willing to put in some work since this course is very reading-heavy. I do not recommend it for those who are looking for a humanities\/writing credit unless they are strong readers and writers already.",
    "DEFINITELY TAKE IT!! I took 127 (American Lit), followed by this course, and I have read so many interesting books that I absolutely love. Yes, you have to be prepared for a lot of reading, but in the end it's completely worth it. I loved this class!",
    "American Novel is a must-take. The reading list rocks and changes every year, Prof. Hungerford's lectures are fascinating, and the workload is very manageable if you take the course non-WR. The reading is fast-paced (a novel a week, some of which are long) and some readings try your patience (exhibit 1: Lost in the Funhouse, a book that tries to annoy you on purpose), but on the whole, doing your homework will be engaging and fun. One of the best classes I've taken so far at Yale. I learned so much. You will, too.",
    "YES! Take this class. It is a great lecture with an incredible booklist, which makes the work enjoyable.",
    "To the American Studies folk considering AmNov, take it if you're an AmStud major because you wanted something interdisciplinary. But don't be fooled. This is an English class. A great English class, but definitely squarely in that department in spite of one day of talk about censorship and Lolita. There is also some expected background in American Lit. Not having it won't affect you grade-wise, but does give you unequal footing in some discussions. I truly think everyone should take this class, though. The reading list is stellar, and the themes we discuss are applicable to an even larger list of postwar books. Professor Hungerford is a delight. Talk to her personally, either after class or at office hours, if you want to get the most out of the experience.",
    "Read 12 wonderful books and discuss. Amazing.",
    "yes, take this! really take it! you read such good modern\/contemporary stuff. like some of the best books i've ever read and most incredible ideas i've been exposed to. do it!",
    "Solid class with an interesting reading list \u00e2\u0080\u0093\u00c2\u00a0Hungerford is a good lecturer, and the books are great. I would recommend this class.(Caveat: it sounds like the professor is taking the new grading guidelines to heart, and advising her TAs to grade more harshly and give out only a limited number of As, so don't necessarily sign up for this class looking for an easy grade.)",
    "Great class to take senior year if you want to read some good books and listen to a really good lecture. Take it credit\/D\/fail. The grading of the essays is a bit harsh.",
    "This class is a great opportunity to read some of the books you always wanted to read, but never buckled down to actually read, plus a few that you might not of heard of but that are interesting\/ enjoyable. There is a lot of reading, but it's usually quite enjoyable because it's fiction! I recommend taking it Cr\/D as the grading on papers is rather tough and there is a lot of material to digest if you'rereally worried about your grade.",
    "Great class that teaches you about American history and literature.",
    "I think this is a great American lit class for AMST majors, but beware that it is very challenging and the workload is quite heavy. Also, if you want to take a WR section, beware that itis the kind of class that lots of upper level English majors take, which will make it harder for certain other, non-English majors to do well. It is a fun and worthwhile class in the sense that Hungerford is a great professor and the reading list is great. So basically: more fun than ENGL 127 but harder& more work.",
    "The syllabus includes fantastic books, although it is difficult to keep up with an entire novel every week (although we did read 2 graphic novels, which were quick). Lecture was hit-or-miss - Hungerford is engaging, witty, and insanely intelligent, but sometimes the arguments she was making were seemingly a little ludicrous and probably only appreciated\/understood by English majors. Overall, I would definitely recommend.",
    "Great class! Professor Hungerford is an amazing lecturer and can make any book interesting. That said, she also picked a great syllabus, so most of the books were great. Super accessible to people who are not English majors. Take this class!",
    "This class is really a pleasure -- I genuinely feel like I've become a more intelligent reader because of it, but always had a wonderful time doing the reading (and even, for the most part, enjoyed writing the papers). Well worth the time you'll spend on it.",
    "If you are good at writing and can dedicate a lot of time to reading the books!",
    "Yes, it's great. It is a good amount of reading, but it's fun reading so it goes quickly. There is not too much work, though it is graded more rigorously than you might expect from a lit survey class. I definitely recommend it!",
    "AMST 261 was a great course on modern American literature. Would recommend the course for a straightforward WR credit or if you are interested in reading literature at all.",
    "It's a lot of work. A lot, a lot of work. A novel a week and it's very hard to catch up if you fall behind. You have much less of an incentive to come to lecture and pay attention if you haven't read. That said, Hungerford makes some very interesting arguments about the novels (even though her lectures can get a little ridiculous at times.)",
    "This class covers a variety of novels that are very different from one another. Be prepared to do a ton of reading, because it moves very quickly, and it's hard to catch up. I didn't like a lot of the syllabus, which made it a little difficult, but that is personal preference, so do a bit of research on the novels when you're deciding if you should take it. Professor Hungerford is great and does really well making the material engaging.",
    "Take this! If the reading list interests you there is no better way to read these books. The exam is hard though."
