    "Everyone Chinese should take this course or at least read the materials from it.",
    "I took it as an introduction to anthropology and it is indeed a decent class - i did learn to view china and body culture in a very different perspective which was what I had intended coming into this course. There is however a decent amount of work to be taken as an introductory class as you read four whole books during the semesters and have to write a 5 page paper as a response to each of those books. There is also a midterm and a presentation, as well as a final exam, so definitely quite a bit of a workload. Wouldn't say it is a bad class but neither did I find it amazing so consider it only if the topic interests you.",
    "Definitely. Especially if you are an athlete or interested in gender studies.",
    "Great class. Definitely take it if you're interested in studying popular chinese culture or are interested in anything related to the body--sports\/modeling\/acting\/etc. Teacher is great and workload is very manageable. I enjoyed it!",
    "Yes, if this class is ever offered again and a student is interested in contemporary Chinese culture, or even body culture in general, I would recommend it wholeheartedly."
