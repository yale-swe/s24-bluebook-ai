   "comments": [
    "Take this class if: you are self-motivated and are interested to read all of Kafka and a bunch of other fictions and theories related to his work. If you don't motivate yourself to do these things, you won't be taking advantage of the class fully, no one will make you do a thing, and Sussman's talks will be less meaningful. Take this class if you'd like to sit and listen to a frantically joyous critic speak about some fairly interesting things.",
    "Insane, no assignments, creative project at the end with no specifications.",
    "I certainly would, but I would make sure that this style of seminar - mainly the professor talking - appeals to you.",
    "kafka kafka kafka whacky sussman kafka.",
    "Take it! You'll read incredible novels and relate them to incredible theorists and modern writers.",
    "definitely recommend",
    "Great. Highly recommended. Try to get in. If you do, take it.",
    "The course was broad in scope, to its credit. \"Around Kafka\" is one of those rare courses at Yale that requires students to take command of their education. Students are encouraged to read as much as they can, and due to the flexible structure and expansive nature of the class, an focus on certain literary and critical texts develops individually.Professor Sussman is fantastic. He's a rare breed at Yale. He hesitates to impose a strict structure on the course, instead allowing the structure to develop naturally as literary concerns arise. He takes a multi-disciplinary approach, including the history of art, photography and graphic novels in his exploration of Kafka -- this approach is particularly appropriate to the subject.",
    "Sussman provides a glimpse for undergraduates into complex worlds of theory, and Kafka provides a terrific entry point. The class is unique, but the approach has its wages. He can be, at times, too enthusiastic in the notions he is willing to entertain, and the class sometimes veers into certain arcane traditions of thinking to which many of the students have no access.Classic skills in close-reading will be less valued here than elsewhere. Theory, and reading Kafka as a site for theory, is the preferred mode. It can be eye-opening, but be prepared. Read the deconstructionist critics he suggests at the beginning of class to position yourself for a fulfilling experience.",
    "It would be absurd to do a conventional class of kafka. this class was anything but conventional. bravo!"
