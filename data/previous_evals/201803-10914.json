   "comments": [
    "I thought that the problem sets were an important and valuable part of the course. The one-page summaries required by Phil Haile provided a good accountability mechanism to ensure I at least understood the broad strokes of the paper before attending the relevant class. I also enjoyed Phil's somewhat philosophical lecture on modeling and estimation. Both instructors gave good lectures. It would have been nice to have feedback on the problem sets. I don't expect it's feasible for the professors to check our code for errors and bugs, but I do believe that they have knowledge vastly surpassing mine when it comes to writing code and especially solving the practical issues that arise in these models, and I would have liked for them to have directly imparted more of that knowledge (as, for example, Cormac O'Dea does in his class). In the absence of a posted example solution code, some high-level comments about correcting common mistakes and following best practices for efficient coding might be useful.",
    "Great course. Well structured. Challenging but well-defined problem sets. Should have got feedback on psets.",
    "Strengths: rigorous Weakness: more of a personal thing, but I didn't find auctions that interesting",
    "Strengths: Quality of instruction. Well-designed problem sets."

   "comments": [
    "I would strongly recommend this class to any student who wanted to understand workhorse Empirical IO models and\/or the estimation of structural models.",
    "Yes. Psets are really useful. Good lectures. Well organized.",
    "I took this class because I initially was considering IO as one of my fields. I decided not to take the field exam because I don't see myself doing IO research, but I'm really glad I took the class. It offers good methods training and exposure to material that every economist should know, like discrete choice models and production function estimation.",
    "Yes.",
    "Yale has a great group of IO researchers. It was great to take this course."
