   "comments": [
    "Question 10: I found this to be a very valuable course that exposed me to new frameworks for thinking about and advocating for environmental protection through an economic lens.My interests include social ecology and environmental policy and this course is extremely relevant for students with an interest in environmental policy. However, I did find it very difficult (and I think this may be true for the discourse of economics in general) to integrate ideas from social ecology such as environmental justice, and alternative frameworks such as human rights, indigenous rights, as well as spiritual values that cannot be reduced to monetary terms and willingness to pay, and simply my own indigenous cultural frameworks.I think it would be great to possibly merge ideas and dialogue among the fields of economics and social ecology in future courses at FES (which the linkages courses may already be initiating).",
    "I think this is an exceptional core class. I would not have taken it if it weren't a core class, and I learned a lot from it. The homework assignments made me do the work and I learned quite a bit from them. I would encourage all students to take this class and I hope to take more economics class next semester to further my understanding. Matt is an interesting and engaging lecturer. The material plus the professor made it an excellent class.",
    "A brief note (perhaps in reference to question 10):I was strongly encouraged (pre-required?) to take Microeconomics before coming to FES and I did so at considerable effort. I was somewhat dismayed to find that the first three weeks of this course were completely microeconomics review. Perhaps more could be covered by skipping the micro-review (completely unnecessary for me) and instead having ta sessions for people without micro background?",
    "I loved this course--I loved the content, his teaching style, the readings, the problem sets--all of it. I appreciated that Matt steps out of assigning simply scientific papers--in the workworld I operated it for 10 years, opinion papers and NGO reports and such have more value than academic papers--so it was refreshing to pull from outside of the narrow academic bubble for readings. I would have appreciated even more readings, however, and a bit more sprightly pace to the course. I felt cheated of all the additional learning I could have been exposed to if we'd moved faster. While I sometimes appreciated class interaction (LOTS of questions from students and back-and-forth with Matt), I felt like it was often a trade-off from getting better information straight from his lectures.",
    "I think a textbook would be helpful for this course. The readings were good but it would have been useful to have a text to reference.",
    "This was a good introduction course to economics for the environment. It was a large class with the new MEM requirements, but Professor Kotchen did a good job conveying information in class. Some parts of the semester went too fast (the first half) while the second half of the semester were too drawn out. The problem sets were challenging but fair as were the exams (although there were some trick questions that were more challenging). The TAs were not very helpful with the problem sets as they often had not looked at them before help sessions.",
    "Pace was too slow after midterm",
    "Both the TAs and the professor dedicated a lot of time via office hours and review sessions to the students.",
    "I was excited to take this class at the beginning of the semester. At Yale, I expected the best from all of my courses. If Professor Kotchen is indeed one of the \u0093best,\u0094 he certainly did not show it in this course. An economist Prof. Kotchen certainly is, a teacher he was certainly not for this course. His course management is amateurish at best. So, Prof. Kotchen, if you do not want to teach, there are plenty of think tanks out there which might value another Ph.D (but maybe not your attitude).",
    "Question 8 - Overall, a solid course. Could have used more in-depth analysis.",
    "This class is very important to students at FES and was the largest of my courses. But the professor didn't use a textbook, developed the syllabus as he went along, and overall, did not seem to put adequate preparation into the course. The readings were good but we needed to go into greater depth of many of the topics. For instance, the Hotelling model discuss should have required reading to go along with it. In addition, there was a lack of communication between the professor and the TAs. A number of the problem set answer keys were corrected multiple times after they were published because mistakes were found. This includes on the night before the midterm, which was extremely stressful for those using the answer keys as models of correct information. This class was overall structured well but needs vast quality improvements.",
    "Question 1 The articles assigned at the end of the class concerning non-market valuation were very useful for those topics. Keohane& Olmstead's book \"Markets and the Environment\" was also quite useful. This publication was recommended to me by the TA, but I would suggest that the professor should also mention at the beginning of the semester that it is a useful reference for the course. I would have liked to have had some reading made available concerning the Hotelling Model (particularly the 4 panel graphs) discussed during the last few lectures, particularly if the final exam is going to focus so much on these two lectures.Question 3 While I found the assignments useful for learning and applying the course material, they become a bit of a burden during the first half of the semester as they were quite lengthy and assigned nearly weekly. I would prefer that the assignments were due on Mondays rather than on Fridays. Since the assignments generally cover the material presented that week during class (Tuesdays and Thursdays), a couple of extra days at the end of the week to complete them would be greatly appreciated.Question 7a The instructor was excellent. He certainly seemed to recall what it was like to be a graduate student and often addressed concerns in class. He showed great enthusiasm for the subject, but he also recognized the limitations of the subject and was sure to address these in class.Question 7c Both of the TAs for the course were extremely knowledgable, helpful, and patient. I attended TA office hours\/discussion sections on average once every two weeks.",
    "Question 7: The TAs were very helpful and friendly, and definitely made lots of the material more understandable.",
    "1. The materials recommended were helpful, but it would have been helpful to have more recommendations. Several of the concepts discussed in class didn't have corresponding publications to reference. The material was very new to me and I would have liked to have more reference materials to learn the basics.7c Both TAs offered great guidance to all of the students. They were willing to put in extra time to explain the concepts to us. I was really impressed with the amount of time they dedicated to the class.10. The applications and concepts discussed in the class are crucial. Conservation professionals must be familiar with the concepts.",
    "6. The pace of the class up until the midterm was too fast. After the midterm, it was too slow until the last two weeks where it felt rushed again.7b. Both TAs were overwhelmed with the number of students in the class - it would have been helpful to have at least one more TA and more review\/help sessions. Even so, several of the review sessions were unhelpful - we would get information\/explanations on our homework that would later turn out to be incorrect, and be penalized on our homework grades. When we lost marks on our homework, there was never any explanation of why we lost points or which parts of our explanations were wrong.",
    "Question 7:Agha Akram: an excellent TAAli was clear, helpful, and VERY responsive to questions I had over email. Ali always knew how to answer the questions to the homework and led us down the right path in an effective way to understand how to solve a problem.Yaniv StopnitzkyYaniv was less clear, and didn't seem to know answers to our questions for the homework. I spent too much time trying to figure out the eventual wrong answer with Yaniv.",
    "The course was a little light on the technical side. It could have used more in depth coverage of the economic concepts and calculations.",
    "Question 1 - having an econ book would have been extremely useful. Ali recommended a book which I ended up using the entire semester and I was so glad to have it. The slides in class did not give enough of an explanation.",
    "While I enjoyed the first half of the class I was very disappointed with the second half of the class. I and many of my fellow classmates disengaged with the class in the second half because too much emphasis was placed on how to put together studies. While I understand that this is a very important part of practical environmental economics I think too much time was spent here given the particular interests of students. I think and hope that there are more concepts and theories that could have replaced 1-2 of the classes that focused on how to put together studies. While this criticism may be harsh, it actually appeared as though the professor ran out of material to review and was buying time in these particular lectures.",
    "Question 3 - Although the problem sets were essential to learning the material, the questions were sometimes extremely vague. And I am not just talking about the True\/False questions which the professor said you were open to interpretation, but even the questions with numerical answers were frequently difficult to understand because there was more than one way to interpret it. I did very well on the midterm in this class, and have no lack of understanding of the concepts. The class material was simple to me, but reading the problem sets, there were frequently details missing from the question. This ended up being very frustrating, as students in study groups would sit around debating what the question was asking rather than discussing the actual class material.While on the topic of problem sets, the other issue is that I always disagreed with the grading. In almost every problem set there were 2 or 3 points that weren't worth fighting but that shouldn't have been marked off.Lastly, the problem set answers that were posted online by the TAs often had typos in them which would only be caught right before the exams. The professor should have taken responsibility for reviewing the answers and making sure they are accurate.",
    "I only attended one TA session and I found it to be very unhelpful. Having an additional TA would have been helpful since there were so many students in the class.I really liked having the problem sets at the end of every week. They really helped me to solidify the concepts and ensure that I understood the material.",
    "A fantastic class, extremely well planned and taught. Excellent feedback and support was given by the instructor and the TAs. For one who had no background whatsoever in economics it was a challenge, but well worth it!",
    "Question 1: Requiring a text, or strongly recommending a text book and assigning recommended readings to compliment course material would be extremely useful, especially for people with weaker quantitative backgrounds.Question 3: Weekly problem sets seemed to apply lecture material to additional problems and scenarios. It would have been extremely beneficial to include a few additional problems that started with the explicit content from lecture as a starting point (i.e., a few repetitive drills). This way, basic concepts and problems would be better understood by students (through repetition, etc), allowing for greater comprehension of more advanced applications and analysis. This would also decrease frustration on the part of the instructor and TA's. Furthermore, it was frustrating that correct answers could not be understood or obtained by going to multiple help sessions and working in semester-long study groups. Despite an honest effort to understand and apply the course material in the problem sets, there was a lot of confusion.Question 7: The TA's were extremely responsive and eager to help, but would have benefited from better general communication with the instructor as well as better communication about what was expected for problem set questions. Attending help sessions for problem sets sometimes led to more confusion rather than greater understanding of questions and course content.",
    "1. Readings were too many to catch up in2. Instructor just went on to cases without much explanation of the readings.3. Out of class assignments were TOO MANY and unfortunately did not help my understanding of the course - it seemed like a rush to catch up with all that the course (readings, problem sets, lectures, study groups etc) was about coupled with the load from other courses,",
    "It was a good course but more readings and background was needed.",
    "Q10- As a general manager and not one interested in furture economic studies, wherein I would feel very well prepared if I were to pursue, it would be more helpful to learn more about how what was learned applied across numerous real world examples (permit trading and SO2 under Clean Air Act, etc.)",
    "1. The readings were useful, giving us a good base for class discussion. Nevertheless, they were not enough. I would argue that a text-book would provide many of the students with more practice and a way to better grasp the concepts.If a text-book is considered too much, there are many websites (found by the students during the course) which gave us much of the answers we needed during the homework.7. From the lesson on Values& Non-market valuation up to the end of the course, lectures were often too abstract for us to handle. The presentations were not clear enough and the lack of a strong text to rely on made it frustrating at time. Even at TA sessions, as a group, we were not well prepared to take care of some problems, and so the TAs had to go to the professor to ask for our questions and get back to us. The class would be improved if we were given a text that could direct us better through exercises and theory.",
    "This course started off very strong, but I thought it dropped off in the middle as we got into the subject of non-market valuation.",
    "This class moved painfully slow. It should be renamed Environmental Economics for Dummies. I understand that it is a foundation course, but does that excuse the class from rigor? The last third of the class was completely conceptual and not applied, which created a discontinuity in the class structure since most of the early material was basic applied economics.Prof Kotchen is a great Pnofessor but this was not a good course. He is strong at explaining material but not at directing the progress of class. It is one thing to be open to student questions\/comments, it is another thing to allow students questioning the basic discipline of economics to derail the content of a given class. This was not intended to be a philosophy course and yet time and time again some student with come out of left field with a commenty about to the effect of \"how can you place a value on the environment?\" (which frankly showed that they had not been paying attention) and Kotchen would for some reason entertain their question and waste the rest of the students time.If this is going to be a real economics class, then it should be more rigorous-- otherwise any student who has any understanding of economics whatsoever should stay abreast of the course.",
    "It was great to see the professor at a number of the student\/faculty events as well as general talks - he seemed a very active participant in the school's intellectual and social life.On numerous occasions the homework required knowledge, skills, and understanding that was not covered in class. Ensuring that homework pairs better with the class work examined would be helpful.",
    "Prof. Kotchen is awesome. Classes are dynamic, interesting and entertaining.",
    "2, Dr. Kotchen did a good job to explain the concept.",
    "Would have liked more reading material- if explanations in class were not clear, the reading often did not cover all the material in class.Optional problem sets, or directions to similar problem sets, would have been helpful for those students needing extra practice."

    "Prof. Kotchen is superb.",
    "The first half of the class (before the midterm) was much more interesting than the second half of the class. I think being able to work through problem sets really affects how I interact with the class material so I think it would have been nice to have problem sets stay weekly even if we weren't covering material as fast as we were in the first half.",
    "The professors kept the class very interested and entertained throughout the semester.",
    "The lectures were interesting. I liked having information be presented on the chalk board, the room location, and the ease of asking questions in class.",
    "Professor Kotchen. He is a delightful, engaging, and entertaining lecturer. Class discussions were heated and interesting. Kotchen's demonstrations were excellent and his pacing very good. A surprising amount of fun for 9am...",
    "Matt's style of teaching and subject matter that covered real-world issues like cap and trade and carbon taxes.",

    "The Professor was great!",
    "Prof. Kotchen's clarity and his encouragement of class discussion.",
    "Experience with problem sets.",
    "Great application of economics to real world problems",
    "I really loved this course. In fact, it might have consistently been my favorite course and also the most enriching course that I took this semester. There were a number of reasons why. First, Matt Kotchen is a great instructor. It is clear that he is passionate about economics and that he is very focused on teaching when he is in the classroom. I thought he did an amazing job making a very large class in a very large room an intimate, personal learning experience. The way that he answers students' questions, although there are moments when it can be a little demoralizing for students in the manner in which Kotchen responds to silly questions, ultimately cultivates a sense of inspiredthinking and exploration on the topic of environmental economics.Second, I very much appreciated that there were not readings in this course that were \"filler\" or that for the most part, what was taught in the classroom was not exactly what was assigned as reading. I found this to be the case in another class and then there is truly very little motivation to read materials and have class sessions be entirely review. The reading assignments were instead focused and valuable as were the homework assignments. I remember Matt getting frustrated with students actually doing the reading, and I had been one that had read consistently, there were just times when we seemed to be one class behind, and it was challenging to recollect a reading from the week before. So my suggestion would be to make sure readings align with topics. Also, a very much appreciated when readings were as contemporary as possible, or when they brought in research or thinking from Yale FES or SOM, which Matt did often.Third, although this class was fun, and Matt can be a little goofy now and then - which is great, there was a professionalism to this class that I can't say appears to be consistent at FES in my time thus far. It was clear when assignments were due and how they should be submitted. The TAs were well-organized. Matt had great review sessions before each exam, and even those were challenging but aligned with what was taught throughout the class. Class started on time, and did not divert for long.",

    "case study examples",

    "exploring different models, but at the same time trying to learn how to implement techniques at actual world conditions.",
    "Positive energy of Professor Kotchen",
    "The TAs - both TAs, but especially Ali, picked up the Professor's slack and significantly helped review course materials and provide useful feedback about student performance.",
    "Kotchen's engaging lecture style",
    "Excellent and engaging professor that made 9am lecture more tolerable than it otherwise would have been. Kotchen was the best part of the course by far. The material was sometimes riveting, other times incredibly dry. The pacing of the class up until the midterm was excellent but after the midterms things got a little bogged down in discussions of the readings and too many in class questions.",

    "The class was very interesting. There was a lot of discussion between the students and the professor and the three hours every week were very pleasant.",
    "The sections of the course that dealt with externalities, taxes, cap-and-trade systems, and natural resource extraction. I really enjoyed the parts of the course that focused on the theoretical economic challenges and how to address them.",
    "The opportunity to jump into modern, real-world economic ideas that were currently being debated. Readings were fairly interesting and often useful.",
    "While the problem sets were quite lengthy and time-consuming, they were very helpful in understanding and applying the concepts.",
    "Kotchen: He is one of the best professors I've yet had at Yale--openly passionate about the material in a way that inspires students, and more interested in student engagement than lecturing. He takes all question and enjoys engaging in dialog or debate.Principles: the basic economic principles underlying all of the work in the class are critical to anyone interested in environmental work, whether or not his or her intention is to work with economics.",
    "The variety of topics covered, in particular key concepts such as cap and trade, taxes, cost benefit analysis.",
    "The course was pretty interesting: the lectures were interesting.",
    "- Knowing that the material we learned in class was very relevant to the work we do in the real world.-The ideas that were discussed in class were extremely interesting and applicable.-Economics is something that almost always comes up in other classes so much of the information that we learned in this class overlapped with and came up in other courses.-The professor answered all questions asked in class and was open to discussion. Professors like Mendelson put students down and was quite rude when students asked questions during his guest lecture, but Kotchen did a fantastic job of making students feel involved and that their ideas and questions were important.",
    "Professor Kotchen was an excellent teacher and explained all of the concepts well. He tried hard to choose relevant readings that weren't too long. The homework assignments really helped us to master the concepts. I found what we learned to be fundamental and helpful for my future coursework in economics.",
    "The lecture is essential, and cannot be missed. The best lectures involved no powerpoint slides. I learned the most through graphs drawn on the chalkboard, and through practicing on problem sets.",
    "Applications of economic concepts towards environmental issues.",

In addition, he was very clear when communicating the material.I really liked when he did NOT use powerpoint and relied on the chalkboard for lectures. This method of teaching makes the lecture easier to follow and helps to keep my attention. Powerpoint tends to be abused by the overuse of writing.",
    "Prof. Kotchen is a fantastic teacher. Honestly this course fulfilled one of my bin requirements and I was not expecting to enjoy or do well at it.

    "For several sessions after the midterm, the expectations were unclear. The classes were interesting, but perhaps more theory could have been introduced during that time rather than the extensive reviews of articles.",
    "1. Mistakes were too common in the posted answers to assignment. The night before the Midterm, around 5-10 corrections were posted onto the V2 server regarding problem sets. How can students be expected to take a course seriously that cannot even provide something as simple as accurate feedback? Pathetic!2. The grading of the problem sets contained errors \u0096 right answers were counted wrong. Miscommunication happens, but should not happen consistently. If I cannot make mistakes on my answers, then the course administrators should not either.3. Lectures were unorganized and sloppy, especially the three weeks preceding Thanksgiving. Since the course did not feature a main text or readings which supported GRADED material, it was difficult to match lectures with expectations on the assignments\/midterm\/final. Readings were posted too often the night before the lecture. Prof. Kotchen, did you ever consider students might work on\/off campus and thus need to stick to a schedule? SOM certainly seems to understand this. The assigned readings might be interesting for cocktail parties, but had little practical contributions for graded material in the course. Please consider your audience and need for concrete materials that correspond directly to graded material.4. It was clear the graded material was sloppily put together form older tests\/quizzes the Professor had on file; materials contained spelling errors and were numbered incorrectly. Because of this, graded materials did not correspond directly to material covered in class. Please take the time to make respectful, adequate testing materials for next year's class which do not contain petty errors.",
    "Perhaps more analysis of actual situations in problem sets (to accompany the existing theoretical material we learned)",
    "It was nice to discuss in class and look at things in a different angle but sometimes it took too much time and we could't keep up our schedule. We could've covered much more materials and themes if it was better organized.",

    "Readings.",
    "This course was great. I can't think of anything that needs improving.",
    "1. Better organization and planning ahead of time to manage& communicate course logistics such as classroom location, exam schedule etc.",
    "I feel that the course did not cover as many topics as it intended. In my opinion, I would have liked to have spent MUCH LESS time discussing non-market valuation techniques and spent MORE time on the specific topics of environmental and natural resource economics. Several topics were listed at the end of the syllabus that were not covered at all or in very little detail (climate change, forestry, fisheries, sustainable development, international trade, etc.). I would have liked to have had an introduction to these topics and was quite disappointed that they were not addressed.",
    "I, along with many other students, think we spent far too much time on values and non-market evaluation. I would have preferred to go over that portion more quickly and then jump into more complicated env econ topics.",
    "A textbook would be very useful. Otherwise I think the course lacks defined structure.",
    "Felt like the classes were far less thought out in terms of ordering and fit post mid-term.",
    "This is a bit of a stretch - many students had questions\/comments that were fairly broad and perhaps better suited for office hrs discussions, which the professor was willing to entertain in class. I actually think that to an extent this added to the class, but on occasion a significant portion of the class time would be taken going far down a tangential path, at which point there were fewer students taking much from it, I believe.",
    "The professor needs to give more handouts of the covered material.",
    "We need a Textbook, more practice with problem sets.",
    "Student tardiness. The professor should not tolerate students entering 10 and 15 minutes late for each class period repeatedly, it is very distracting.",
    "Way too much time spent on survey methodology. Not why I took this course.",
    "Problem sets were often a bit repetitive, though it was valuable to think about the economic reasoning underlying some of the problems. I wish we had covered a greater percentage of material on the syllabus, and had spent some time discussing some of the current provocative ideas in economics, such as ecosystem services, sustainable development, renewable resources, etc. I had a microecon course before, so I was already comfortable with economic reasoning, but for the sake of other students, I think more background reading should be provided to think through more basic microeconomics. We never talked about elasticity, how monopolies function and set prices, game theory, etc. Given lack of time, some extra optional readings could have been provided even if they were not discussed in class.",
    "It would be helpful to have recommended readings on background materials discussed in class or recommendations for additional problem sets to practice materials. I conducted a lot of google searches for additional materials and even contacted professionals in the field for recommendations.",
    "We really needed a textbook for more background reading!!! Several of us asked for suggestions and did not receive any helpful leads. A textbook would have greatly aided those like myself who have no previous economics background.",
    "Some classes did not seem very interesting, in particular, conducting surveys, and the agriculture class.",
    "Preparing students for the exams. After going through the entire course, going to every single class, completing all the homework, I still found myself unable to answer questions on the exams. Basically, it seemed like the questions on exams were in a format no student had seen before and was more \"tricky\" than meant to show one's knowledge of the course. I don't think that providing a new type of question on an exam is a way to reinforce the knowledge a student has learned throughout the course.",
    "- Don't have an \"introductory\" class filled with students that already have strong backgrounds in economics. This was incredibly frustrating. There was definitely a large group of students who already were extremely familiar\/comfortable with economics (i.e. had taught econ before, were econ undergrad majors, had econ related jobs). These folks should not be in an introductory class. The professor should not assume that everyone in the class is well versed in economics and should not lecture in a way that assumes that students already know the equations and terms that he uses.- Two Teaching Assistants were not enough for this class. Ali was phenomenal but Yaniv was terrible. More people would go to Ali's office hours and it was hard to ask questions because there were always so many people there and and hour wasn't enough time for him to answer everyone's questions- Make sure you get TAs who know and understand econ. Ali was great but Yaniv was confusing, would often get problems wrong while explaining them to students, and on several occasions students had to correct him during his explanations.- More prep for the midterm. More practice tests available for students ahead of time possibly?",
    "It would have been helpful to have a textbook to reference when we didn't understand the concepts. Also, it would have been extremely helpful if the TAs fully understood the course concepts and homework assignments and could have served as a better resource for help. Lastly, the homework and exam questions could have been more clear and less vague in some cases.",
    "There needs to be an optional textbook for this course. There is no way to clarify the concepts if you don't understand them immediately in class. The readings were only supplemental to fully understanding the concepts.",
    "The professor needs to control the class participation. Questions that are unconstructive and negative externalities should not be allowed to take over significant classroom time as it was on a number of occasions. These questions should be addressed after class or at office hours. For a class of such a large size, time needs to be appropriately used for all students and not the time of just a few. This is a subject of major criticism of mine.",
    "The 'middle' section of the course, in which we focused on contingent valuation, was heavy on irrelevant data, and light on substance. I can see the value of learning this material, but would have appreciated it if approached differently.",
    "We spent too much time talking about surveys and how to develop them. I really lost interest after the midterm. Then, we had to rush through the non-renewable resource section. He should have cut the non-market valuation portion in half and left more time for the last topic.",
    "Additional TAs would have been helpful.",
    "It would have been helpful to have some better supplementary reading early in the term for those of us who haven't had any real econ since high school.",
    "The pace is slow at times because too many questions wandering off the subject under discussion slow down class. Only simplified analyses of economic problems or situations were dealt with but some more advanced and more applied analysis should build on that.",
    "The final exam was too difficult and seemed to cover concepts we had not learned to apply our material to in class. But this is the only recommendation for improvement.",
    "The section following the midterm on more qualitative applications lagged and a lot of the material at times felt superfluous.",
    "For those with weaker quantitative backgrounds, a recommended text with recommended readings that compliment lecture content would be especially useful.The average student would benefit from a few repetitive questions on weekly problem sets, especially in consideration of lecture content. Content in lecture is quickly introduced, and the instructor assumes proficiency after this introduction. There is never an opportunity to practice these basic methods and concepts. Weekly problem sets could be revised to address these issues, perhaps by having a few additional questions that ensure comprehension of the basic techniques and concepts from that week. It is difficult to achieve this on your own without a background in the field.",
    "1. Rearranging the structure of the course to be better understandable to non-economic major students2. Reducing the volume of topics in the current syllabus'3. The frequency of the assignments were too much and demanding in relation to time needed for other course loads",
    "explaining complexities of inter-related material.",
    "Perhaps the pace? It was a little too fast for some.",
    "For the 2-3 weeks after the midterm, the course took a long detour into contingent valuation and survey design. While this ground certainly needs to be covered, it seemed to be at least 2 lectures too long. Prof Kotchen does a lot of work in this particular area, so I'm sure it's close to his heart, but the more technical graphical work before and after this segment was more interesting and seemed more important.",
    "The last few topics of the course were a bit disjointed from the earlier material.",
    "Improve on relating the theory to reality",
    "Not to be taught (or less so) as a spring board for future economic studies and to be taught to general environmental managers.",
    "Being a course at a Graduate level, I feel that Economics of the Environment could use much more work on the second part of the semester. Non-Market Valuation, Payment for environmental services, and fisheries are topics of great interest for us, and these were not explained fully. I realize as well that the 'time' factor is against us and so we need to fly through topics. I would like to recommend putting a group project in the semester. Our group discussions would be enriched if we had a set goal. Furthermore, giving us the opportunity to work more on the topics of our own interest will allow us to fill in the gap of whatever we think is necessary.",
    "Giving clarity to the TAs about the material before problem sets go out.",
    "The second portion of the course. Some of the answer keys provided for problem sets were also extremely difficult to follow.",
    "The use of class time (see above). Sometimes the assignments were unclear. I was appalled when I came up to a TA asking a clarifying question about a problem on the final exam and was told thateverything I needed to answer the question was there and then have the Professor come in twenty minutes later and explain that in fact a entire sentence with key details was missing. Very frustrating.",
    "I think he can improve on avoiding stalled moments in class when student comments are off topic. Generally quite good on this point though.",
    "Reduce the time spent on valuation methods and touch deeper on other subjects",
    "the structure of the class. the course has spent too much time on case studies in non-market valuation.",
    "The second part of the course is the most important however we had to few classes and the teaching method wasn't as good as the one deployed in the first half. We should spend more time in natural resources economics topics.PLEASE do not evaluate only with exams is not fair!!",
    "Adequate reading material to supplement lectures."

    "The office hours\/discussion sections held by the TAs were very helpful. Sometimes, however, it appeared as though the TAs were also unclear about the nature and intent of the questions we were being asked on our problem sets. This led to a considerable amount of confusion because each of the TAs would instruct us to approach a certain problem differently.",
    "Agha Akram was one of the TA's that was very helpful throughout the semester and was always responsive to any questions I had.",
    "It was challenging to receive help from the TAs on homework assignment because they didn't know the correct answers. Often TA sessions were spent going over a single question, only to receive an email later on that we were addressing the problem incorrectly. It made TA office hours frustrating and a bit useless. Despite this challenge, the TAs always made themselves available and tried to help as best they could.",
    "His TA's need to be much more prepared--they often didn't know the answers to the problem sets. Matt should draft answers, give to them, they can familiarize themselves with it, and then teach us. That wasn't the case. They often bungled through the questions with us. They were both very generous with time and support, and bent over backward to help us, but I felt like most of my lab time with them was wasted. And why did this course only have 2 TAs? I had another course with only 22 students that had 2 TAs, and certainly didn't need it--and then this course must have had near 100 students. Seems like a flawed distribution of resources. And these two guys needed more help.Matt was great in office hours.",
    "Great",
    "I didn't often get the feeling that Matt was very available. I have to say that this might be a false perception, because I didn't often seek his help; however, I felt as though it was preferred that we work with the TAs of the course compared to getting time with Matt. As I mentioned in an earlier response, the quality of Matt's instruction was for me without question, and he would stay around after class to help; however, it seems as though he is a busy person, and helping students outside of the classroom isn't a priority.I only had direct experience working with Ali as a TA, and as I mentioned before, I thought he did a GREAT GREAT job. Truly, he was passionate, instructive, concerned about whether students were really getting the concepts, very attached to making sure that what he himself was saying was right, and he followed up on email promptly.Overall, quality of instruction in this class was great, and I look forward to taking another class with Matt Kotchen (and maybe even Ali) in the future. Truly, bravo.",
    "The TA , Yaniv, to be specific is one of the best fortune I get from the class, each session is unbelievable clarifying and he is always patient and really helpful. I am lucky to be able to interact with such a talented and thoughtful TA in Yale",
    "The availability of Professor Kotchen and the TAs were great. The information they provided was not always helpful, especially from the TAs. The problem sets sometimes had multiple or open ended answers and the information TAs gave in the help session sometimes proved to be wrong on the problem set. For next year, it will be important that the questions on homeworks and exams are VERY well defined in terms of what they are asking for.",
    "Emails were answered promptly and in good detail.",
    "They answered my questions pretty fast. But there are quite a few mistakes in the answer key prepared by the TA.",

    "Ali was an exceptionally helpful TA - he went above and beyond (setting up group meeting times, meeting upon request, and always ready with a helpful explanation and good at finding answers to students' outside-the-box questions) to make sure we understood the material.",
    "Ali was one of the most responsive and available TAs I've ever worked with. He was gracious, knowledgeable, and prompt.Yaniv seemed great as well I just didn't contact him as often.I never contacted Kotchen directly, didn't feel the need to. In retrospect, I should have because he seems like an awesome dude.",

    "The TAs were always available for questions. They did a great job.",
    "Due to class conflicts, I mostly attended the office hours\/discussion sections hosted by Ali. He was extremely patient and helpful. In addition, he responded promptly to emails. I can't imagine that he was able to get much of his own work done this semester based on how much I assume he was working for this course! I only met with Yaniv once or twice, but he was also very helpful and responsive.",
    "TA's worked hard and were responsive, but did not always seem to have full clarity and understanding of all the of the homework questions.",
    "Great, TAs were very helpful and always willing to help.",
    "Excellent. Sometimes though, the TAs were not prepared in advance to discuss the homework.",
    "TA's offered a lot of time to meet\/review. Occasionally, and especially at the beginning of the semester, it seemed that they hadn't had an opportunity to sync with the Professor, so not all questions\/concepts were adequately covered at the first pass. They would always make an effort to follow up with a response to student questions in these instances however.I did not make an effort to meet with the professor outside of class, but he was approachable immediately following class periods for comments, questions.",

    "It was always good with the TAs.",
    "The TAs went out of their way to review the materials with us.",
    "Ali was very generous with his time outside of his scheduled office hours. He was always available via email, and quick to agree to meet with students individually for sometimes long periods of time to go over homework or review for the exam - much, much appreciated!",
    "I only met with Agha (Ali), and he was an absolutely wonderful TA--patient, knowledgeable, and invested in the work of the class and the students. Fantastic. Deserves a bonus, a raise, whatever.",
    "Never had to go to instructor, always the TA. Yaniv is awesome!",
    "Ali was extremely responsive and the quality of help was excellent.Yaniv's quality of help was not as good as Ali's.",
    "- Ali went above and beyond what a TA should have to do. He held extra office hours and did one-on-ones with students if they asked him. He almost always went well past the hour-long mark for the usual office hours (the day before the final he spent ALL day meeting with students to answer questions and go over material). His explanations were clear, he was always patient, and the books he recommended for us to use for supplemental help\/explanations were extremely helpful. If he didn't know the answer to a problem he would get back to us and send us emails to help clarify the problem more. Ali is quite possibly the best TA I have ever had and he is the reason I was able to make it through this class.-Yaniv did not know the material and was not helpful at all. It was incredibly frustrating to go to a TA and then leave even more confused. I attended several of his sessions but eventually stopped going because I did not receive the help I needed. His explanations were confusing and he would often get things wrong. On several occasions students had to correct him and help him with his explanations. It seemed as though this was not material he was familiar with. If you're going to have TAs, please make sure they know the material and are qualified to teach students.",
    "Ali was a really great TA and he made a great effort to email us with additional help for the homework sets.",
    "The TA's (especially Ali) were trying very hard to help, but often students would leave the help sessions more confused than before we attended them. Professor Kotchen was helpful in office hours, but usually gave the impression that he was too busy to talk with students, and was annoyed if we hadn't understood concepts immediately from the lecture.",
    "I interacted primarily with the TAs, both of whom were excellent, if occasionally disorganized. While he was charming and friendly during class, outside of class Professor Kotchen was slightly unapproachable.",
    "Again, the TAs were in high demand and it was difficult to get individual help at times.",
    "I went to the TAs for clarification concerning the problem sets and they were always very responsive and did an effort to make me understand.",
    "Excellent - Matt Kotchen deserves a teaching award. And the TAs, Ali and Yaniv, were fantastic as well.",
    "I contacted both the instructor and the TA. They were both available- I received tremendous help and explanations from the TA - Ali (Agha Akram)and was a little better off after sessions with the TA- I wasn't better of with meeting with the instructor even though he is highly accessible and willing to be very helpful",

They were always on time for their sessions and had a good sense of commitment with us; sending us reminders and emails that aimed to better explain the concepts.The professor was very approachable after classes, staying extra minutes to answer our questions, and often walked and talked with us towards his office. I cannot speak for his office hours as I didn't make use of them.",
    "The availability and enthusiasm was great, but often the understanding was not there",
    "I didn't need help, but TAs were responsive about other questions.",
    "The TAs were extremely available. I never got a sense of when it would be appropriate to contact Matt directly since the TAs actively advertised the times they were available and so I felt more comfortable speaking with them about the course.",
    "It was ok, but it was clear that they would show up on TA sessions unprepared, but they would get back to us with answers. So, it was just a delayed help.",
    "The instructor is pretty helpful, didn't really interact with TA that much.",
    "Excellent, they were always available for us.",
    "the TA were super helpful, Ali stayed like 6 hours in a row answering questions before the final. Matt was also available and willing to help.",

We need to strongly consider how the incentives of people, firms, and governments should be structured and promoted in order to solve some of our major problems. I don't think this great importance of env economics was really ever placed into relief in order to emphasize the importance. We spent lots of time drawing MB and MC curves (with various names), but I feel it was there was some repetitive busywork.

I can understand the reasons why we might want to promote economic valuation of certain things that we normally have ignored, and I understand the pitfalls of putting everything in dollar values for cost-benefit analysis.

I know lots of friends who still had some curious assumptions about simple changes in demand, or measuring benefit, etc. This will help make the environmental concepts much more accessible and perhaps allow the class to go more quickly into the main topics. I would still recommend the class, though I don't believe people should expect to understand things clearly from\u00a0only sitting through the lectures.

Since there is no textbook and the TAs are incredibly informed about the concepts taught in the class, it is best to rely on fellow students and Kotchen for help. Do the readings when they seem useful. This course is a good intro to economics but if you haven't had econ in a long time it would be good to get a lot of extra help in the beginning to get caught up on some critical concepts that are very quickly covered in the first week.
