    "A boring lecture about interesting things. Take if, and only if, interested in the material. Not recommended as a first linguistics class.",
    "This course was really interesting and it's taught at a reasonable pace, but I would not recommend taking it if you haven't taken any linguistics classes before. It doesn't technically have any prerequisites, but everyone in there is either a grad student or a linguistics major, and there are a lot of things that you are assumed to already know. Just make sure you keep up with the reading and listen in lecture, and going to section really helps if you don't understand something."
