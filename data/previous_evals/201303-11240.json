    "It's worth taking. Definitely.",
    "The philosophical evolution of Western thought from Greece to Rome to Christian Europe, with unforgettable readings that are difficult but will make you think in a way you've never had to before. Very worth taking for he complexity of thought it'll put you through and the familiarity it will give you with Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, et al.",
    "Wonderful! It's a great survey of ancient\/medieval philosophy. Take it!",
    "A survey of Classical Philosophy\u00e2\u0080\u0094mainly Plato and Aristotle, obviously\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a little bit of Medieval\/early Muslim philosophy at the end. I would highly recommend this course to another student\u00e2\u0080\u0094I don't plan to pursue philosophy much further, but this course introduced me to a completely different way of thinking that I found interesting in an academic sense but has also influenced my whole worldview, which I think is an indicator of a great class. Plato and Aristotle are challenging yet so rewarding, and the other philosophers are a great counterpoint to them.",
    "DS Philosophy is a great intro to philosophical thought and history. I would definitely recommend it. It has taught me to look at life and at writing papers in a new way.",
    "Professor Winkler is the kind of professor I hoped to have at Yale. He is obviously brilliant and extremely knowledgeable in his field. Yet he also takes a personal interest in his students and takes our contributions to section seriously. He gives extensive and very helpful feedback on papers, and his office hours are very helpful for the paper-writing process. But perhaps most importantly, he is obviously excited about the course material, which makes all the difference. If you have the tremendous fortune of having him as section leader, thank your lucky stars and don't switch for the world.",
    "A comprehensive overview of Western philosophy from Plato to Thomas Aquinas. I would definitely recommend this course because it teaches you how to think.",
    "The material was incredibly difficult but Professor Winkler made it accessible. Discussions were enlightening and exciting; I'd continue thinking about them long after I'd left. The class was so meta and profound. It was definitely my favorite of the semester!",
    "100%. This class was great. The stuff we read was confusing but exciting, and winkler made it understandable so I felt lucky to be in this class."
