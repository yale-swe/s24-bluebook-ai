   "comments": [
    "Be prepared to work and study outside of class in order to keep up with all of the new concepts that are introduced in a short period of time, but I would definitely recommend the course if you want to learn Spanish.",
    "Unlike most of the people in L1, I had already fulfilled my language requirement so I was taking Spanish...to actually learn it! Yes, there are a lot of people who have taken it in high school, but it's not hard to keep up. Sebastian is so kind and funny and helpful, if you can take it with him, I wholeheartedly recommend it. You can ask him questions without feeling dumb. After the first week, it gets a lot easier! Just make sure you do your homework and study a little for the exams. If you have any sort of problem (i.e. forget your homework), Sebastian will do his best to accommodate you.",
    "If you want to study Spanish then YES!!! It's time consuming and everyone already have some experience with Spanish, but if you'll put the effort, there is no reason not to get an A or A-.If you're lucky enough to get Sebastian's section, then go for it!!! He is amazing and he is super funny, you would like to go to class every day and he will help you if you have a hard time.",
    "The workload is very manageable. Make sure to attend class, it is tedious to have section every day but the pace keeps going, so it would take more effort to catch up. Don't be afraid to ask for help from friends and the professor. Learning a new language can be tough and confusing at times.",
    "A very good introduction to Spanish, including oral and written work. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "an introduction to spanish",
    "Great for those who have never spoken Spanish, but please don't ruin it for others by taking it if you have knowledge regarding the Spanish.",
    "An easy course.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Spanish. It moves quickly, but most students seemed able to keep up. Sebastian is an amazing and fun teacher who really cares about his students!"
