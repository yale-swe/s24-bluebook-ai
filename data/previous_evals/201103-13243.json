   "comments": [
    "It was a good course. Due to the number of MD students in the course, the topic often shifted to a very medical discussion, which made it hard to follow sometimes.",
    "A good overview of worker health problems, and in dealing with environmental concerns in health.",
    "Strengths:focus on cardio-respiratory issues with occupational and environmental medicineWeaknesses:Early morning class, really early before children's day care start, not tailored for parents.Different presenters though bought in different perspectives, limited instructor interaction and caused vague discussions at times.No information on the finals in terms of previous years exams posted to provide an overview of the format.",
    "Ok. A grading rubric should be provided for the midterm exam.",
    "This course is an introduction to environmental and occupational medicine. I think it is well-taught and designed, and covers the basic aspects of this field. I appreciated lectures from non-physicians such as industrial engineers, because as a physician we are not trained to think like they do and it was interesting to hear their approach.",
    "Strength: Guest lectures made the class more interesting and informativeWeakness: Could use more guidance on mid-term and final studying.",
    "Very interesting. Mostly guest speakers. I really got to see the breadth of Environmental and Occupational health. I didn't think it extended to zoonotic diseases or to Health Impact Assessments. I felt like I learned a lot from very informative and interactive lectures, and I didn't have to do very much work--just a few readings and a midterm and final. With that combination, I'd say this course is ideal for busy students.",
    "Good course, especially for people without medical background. Medical professionals may find it a bit redundant. Would like to see more material on environmental impact.",
    "I think the lectures were excellent.",
    "Interesting topic each week. Some lecturers focused a lot on medicine, which became hard for non-physician. The content for each week does not overlap and to me connects poorly. Hence no re-enforcement of knowledge until final exam.",
    "Interesting discussion and a diverse class."

   "comments": [
    "This course was a great course. It was an opportunity to learn about environmental health in a different way that is applicable to people's everydaylives. It was nice to have different topics every week and to hear from different people.",
    "The course is an extremely broad overview. Vague at times",
    "Ok",
    "This is a good introduction to environmental and occupational medicine. The course does not require too much work and is interesting. I feel that, as a physician, I had somewhat of an advantage in this course just because many of the lectures were about specific organ damage that can be caused by toxins, and I wonder what this course was like for non physicians. Anyway, I would recommend this course.",
    "Good course. Lots of practical applications. Would recommend because work load appropriate and interesting topics",
    "Yes, if you're a busy student who wants to learn but doesn't have time to do a lot of work, this class is great. Most of the learning comes from in-class lectures and discussions and not so much from outside readings. Warning: the class is at 8am. It's very early, and Meredith does not like it when you're late. So if you can't get up that early, don't take this class.",
    "Good introductory course for non-medical background students",
    "I enjoy this class. It helped me to have an understanding of the risk at work and in the environment.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for a fellow student. It is a great course because it gives you a comprehensive view of the occupational medicine field.",
    "An easy and very interesting class, enjoyed all the lectures and the discussions."
