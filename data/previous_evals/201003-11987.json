   "comments": [
    "Do not take...exessive amounts of work and bad structure. Great reading though and intresting stories at times from Instructore. But in balance, I really regretted taking this course.",
    "The class skims the major issues that globalization entails. Course does a good job of incorporating and analyzing all points of view on each issue. While the student presentations get a bit tiresome, if you did the readings, you'll get a lot out of the course.",
    "There's a LOT of reading. You learn a lot as a result, but it's still kind of overkill. Zedillo is a really interesting, engaging guy and it was awesome to hear him speak when he did, but most of the time you just listen to mediocre student presentations (a problem with all econ seminars).",
    "Take this class! It's a fascinating subject and where else could you have Ernesto Zedillo as your professor?The caveat is that the student presentations may not always be the most engaging way to discuss the material, but it's worth it for the times when Zedillo is teaching and for the guest speakers he brings in.",
    "Great material, a TON of reading (way too much), but a painful class. Prof Zedillo will never lecture, and you'll be stuck listening to student presentations\/student-led discussions all semester (except when you have visitors - who are really interesting and engaging).Take it if you are super-into the materials, because the reading is great... but frankly, I wouldn't recommend it. Huge amounts of work, you really only \"learn\" from eachother, and the grading is unpredictable (you get no real barometer on how you are doing.. for some reason it appears to be secret).",
    "Great TA. Very attentive and always available.",
    "\"Debating Globalization\" provides a survey of global economic interconnectivity, and the difficulties posed as long as political systems remain relatively more fragmented than economic systems. Beginning with a review of global economic history, the development of multilateral economic agreements, and international trade theory, the course then surveys the contested benefits and costs of globalization. Topics include financial market stability; wealth distribution, inequality, and development; and global public goods problems, like climate change. This syllabus is excellent for a survey of the topics. Though a seminar in name, the course is more accurately a hybrid seminar-lecture. Professor Zedillo and a number of his friends from academia give lectures on many topics; students give one or two presentations per semester, recapitulating each week's reading; and, depending on the time left per session, there is some time for Q& A with the professor or lecturer. There is rarely round-table seminar discussion (questions and answers directed from student to student, mediated by the professor). The course readings are introductory, with concepts described often for a popular rather than a technically proficient audience, and are sometimes redundant. On the whole, if you are deeply interested in globalization but have yet to tackle a survey of the issue from an economics perspective, this is clearly the course for you. If you already feel you have a substantial understanding of arguments for international free trade and the arguments against, then perhaps this is not. I would recommend reading the first couple chapters of Douglas Irwin's \"Free Trade Under Fire,\" and the first couple chapters of Joseph Stiglitz' \"Making Globalization Work\"; if these initial chapters thrill you, take the course.",
    "It is a lot a lot of work. Professor Zedillo is great, but he expects a lot and does not conduct a class that leaves much time for discussion. Still, if you stick it out, by the end of the semester you will be shocked by how much you've learned.",
    "If you're interested in globalization, take it.",
    "Take this course- learning from Professor Zedillo is a joy and a privilege.",
    "The course provides a good background on international economics including topics like migration, the financial crisis and emerging economies... however, discussion is poor as most of the class time is taken up by class presentations. Weekly reading responses were good practice but the amount of reading got a little out of control at times.",
    "A lot of reading and work. Not an easy seminar. Has a midterm. Great experience to learn from the former president of Mexico though.",
    "I would recommend ECON 465 to other senior econ majors. The readings were very interesting overall, and I came out of the class having a strong understanding of many issues regarding globalization. It is definitely a lot of work - doing the readings and the weekly reading responses (2 pages) usually took me all of Saturday and half of Sunday - but it is rewarded with how much you learn. Zedillo is a politician - he is very smart, but also very fun. Always try to push to have as much as time for discussion in seminar as possible."
