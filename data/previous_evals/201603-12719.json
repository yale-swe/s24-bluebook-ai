   "comments": [
    "Larger class size but few students talked, it might help to go around the room at the start and ask everyone to rate the paper on a scale of 1-10, getting people to talk at least once at the start can make it seem like less of a jump to talk later. Additionally dedicating 1 lecture (full 2 hours) to going over techniques etc would be appreciated, this part of the course felt really rushed and I think its forgotten that many students havent thought about metabolism since undergrad.",
    "Strengths: Interactive class, good papers Weaknesses: Low diversity of topics, too mitochondria-oriented.",
    "Discussion based seminar - always depends on the participation level of the enrolled students.",
    "The teaching team is great and really encouraging. Weakness is that sometimes it is difficult to spark active discussion during class.",
    "Assigning a few review articles may have been helpful in engaging discussion."

    "Absolutely, great coverage of seminal papers and it helped me gain an understanding of how the field is thinking",
    "Yes, because immnometabolism is a booming field.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone with interests in metabolism and metabolic shape of the immune system.",
    "Yes, I think this course is a great exercise for budding immunology students to think about the ways that the immune system is affected by other principles besides classical ideas of linearge commitment, differentiation, and activation.",
    "For students interested in going into the field of immunometabolism, this is definitely a course to take."
