    "Well, you have to take it anyways if you're a senior in the major. The earlier you get this stuff done, the more at ease you'll be toward deadlines. Class doesn't meet much towards the middle of the semester; it feels like you aren't even taking a class until, oops, you have 20 pages due some Wednesday. Student presentations at the end are a cool opportunity to see what other students in the major are working on.",
