    "This is a wonderful course! Overall well-designed and thorough. The student is truly able to learn the language.",
    "This course does a good job of having students interact with each other so that they can learn about each other. It could do a better job of teaching kids simpler classroom objects as words.",
    "The professors in the hebrew dept are wonderful and this course was well designed for my learning! I loved this course",
    "The strengths include engaging students fully in Hebrew learning, looking at the language from the side of Judaism, Israel and how the language itself was developed. I really love Hebrew as a language now. Another strength is the feedback and the varied assignments that we were given. A weakness is that even though we meet every day it's hard to retain new vocabulary and I still don't feel very confident speaking.",
    "Strengths: are good teaching \/ high engagement. Weaknesses: Would have been better with fewer nightly homeworks and no final project (which didn't teach me much) but harder weekly quizzes. That would have helped me learn the vocab better."

    "Absolutely. I think it is fun and easy to learn Hebrew and the department does a fantastic job of making you fall in love with it. Plus, the instructors are phenomenal.",
    "I would recommend Hebrew to anyone looking for a language credit",
    "I would. I don't even think you really have to have an intense interest in Hebrew or Israel. It's a very fun course and an interesting language to learn. I would watch out for the workload, because there is consistent homework every night - but the voice recordings and journal entries makes it more thoughtful than just busy work."
