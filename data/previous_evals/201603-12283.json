   "comments": [
    "The strengths of this course were in the pedagogical structure of the lectures. In my opinion, the lectures moved a slow pace through at least the first half of the term. As a result, many of the interested topics that I was more interested in seemed to be rushed toward the end of the term.",
    "Strengths: I really liked that course was entirely self-contained. The lecture notes were excellent and very helpful. Lectures were thorough and conceptually motivated. A possible improvement: I would have benefitted from more example problems with solutions in the notes."

    "I would definitely recommend the course, especially to anyone in Qlab or RSL.",
    "Definitely. It is a good introduction to measurement and any experimental physicist or electrical engineer should understand this material.",
    "Yes. This course is extremely helpful if you work on optomechanics.",
    "Yes, this course is a great challenge for student but the great professor makes this course interesting and quite meaningful.",
    "Yes, this was a very unique and useful course. Prof. Devoret is extremely knowledgeable and a gifted teacher."
