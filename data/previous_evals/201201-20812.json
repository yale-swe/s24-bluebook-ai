   "comments": [
    "Excellent course to cover system design issues.",
    "Definitely. I think the reason we call us computer science major, not computer engineering, it that we should know what happens in the system. This course is excellent to understand how database is built.",
    "CS 538 is a great course if you are interested in understanding how a database works under the hood. Also it is very helpful to learn how compromises are made in system designs. highly recommended!",
    "This is a class for people who need to know how the internals of databases work, not merely for those who want to use databases. I only took it because the Computer Science department's course selection was pathetic, and this was the only class that covered a wholly new subject for me.",
    "I will recommend, if this fellow student really like database and want to dig into advanced topics and spend time on it. CPSC538 is not an easy course, and it needs interest and diligence.",
    "Yes.You will learn how databases really work.To get the most out of this course: Only take this course if all your other courses that term are super-light.",
    "Take this class. The material is cutting edge, the papers seminal, and the professor is great. Expect to work hard and be prepared to think a lot about the concepts presented.",
    "Very relavent to anyone interested in the field."

    "I knew little about database architecture. Now I can understand it.",
    "This course is very related to my future endeavors and I feel really luck that Yale has this course. it is extremely helpful to my future career!",
    "It broadened my knowledge of computer science by teaching me about database systems. I would be hard pressed to think of when I might possibly ever use this information again, however. As I say, I took this class only because there was nothing else to take.",
    "I learned a ton about the nuts and bolts of database systems, how companies think about data storage needs, and where the future of dbms can be headed. I week i have a much richer background than before when i think about interacting with databases daily."
