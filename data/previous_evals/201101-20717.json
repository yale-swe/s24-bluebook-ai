   "comments": [
    "This is a great class if you are looking to incorporate some microscopy into your thesis work. By the end of the course you will have a great background for approaching any project you desire. Most of the information is fairly basic over a wide range of techniques. I would definitely recommend this class for anyone who wants to broaden their range of knowledge of imaging techniques.",
    "If you are considering working with microscopy in the future, I would highly recommend this course.",
    "Definitely recommend! I learned so much practical information on microscopes and the way it was taught made me want to learn more.",
    "CBIO701 is a high-yield introduction to the basic principles, major platforms, and latest innovations in live cell imaging. I would strongly recommend this to another student. The course was engaging, well-taught, brought in a variety of experts, and use of microscopy is only likely to grow dueto its advantages in assessing heterogeneity and in vivo dynamics of cellular and intercellular processes.",
    "A great way to learn about a number of modern microscopy approaches. I would recommend the class to anyone interested in imaging because it demonstrated the power of such approaches and the unique biological questions that can be probed by each.",
    "It's an extensive course on microscopy principles and has emphasis on current techniques and issues of the field."

   "comments": [
    "This course has given me the knowledge necessary to approach imaging projects and literature more intelligently and pragmatically. I will most certainly use the knowledge I gained in this course when developing protocols for my own research.",
    "Expanded my knowledge about the tremendous advances now available in microscopy. Even if I don't use some of the approaches inmy dissertation research, it's great to become familiar with some of the awesome things soon to be published.",
    "This course helped a great deal. I now feel like I can use a microscope and not just go through the paces but actually understand what I'm doing when I change parameters. Also, I now know a plethora of new techniques that I can use in my research.",
    "I had little practical understanding of microscopy until this course. It was an excellent overview, highly relevant to my current doctoral studies, and has motivated me--as well as supplied the conceptual tools and awareness of possible experimental arrangements--to use novel in vivo microscopy methods in my thesis.",
    "The coarse gave me a broad overview of a number of imaging techniques that I could possibly use in creative ways.",
    "It contributed a great deal, and provided me with new insight on my research."
