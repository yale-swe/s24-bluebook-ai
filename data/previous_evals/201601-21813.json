   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely take this course 100%, you will gain invaluable skills, such as the ability and confidence to read\/interpret primarily literature and apply it to a greater context. Both professors are very passionate about this course, which makes it that much more enjoyable. You get to see ancient climates and how this information plays a role in the decisions we make today related to Earth & the environment. It is a very interdisciplinary course that will expose you to geochemistry\/science and research in a new way.",
    ". Take it! The class will give you a good overview over how we are able understand past climates throughout Earth's history. Most importantly, it will teach you how to read primary scientific literature. The class format is a little weird, with one 1.5hr lecture being basically all you need to do. Of course, you're also supposed to be in class and have done the readings every time, but since your knowledge of the readings is never really tested it can get hard to find the necessary motivation to actually do so... (which will actually fuck you over) So definitely take it if you think you're sufficiently interested in palaeoclimatology to motivate yourself to do the readings, think twice before taking it as a gut class.",
    "This course is great for anyone needing to know how climate change is actually measured, and the reasons why it is considered a scientific fact. Take this course, read the papers, and you will know more about what climate science is than 99% of Congress.",
    "Take it if you are interested in climate science. Not a ton of work, but very rewarding regardless.",
    "This class is kind of like being thrown into water to learn how to swim. In line with that metaphor I would recommend finding a geochemistry textbook to reference for some of the proxies mentioned by the papers (since some are really difficult to find summaries of online) as a sort of life vest but other than that, I think reading tough scientific papers is a very useful though at times demoralizing way to learn science. Noah and Mark give great insights into how scientists work and think about these issues along the way, which I found super valuable.",
    "A strange yet somehow fun class dedicated not so much to studying paleoclimates but to studying the ways by which we research paleoclimates and their strengths and flaws. You'll learn a lot about general geoscience and will get really good at comparing arguments in the scientific literature. There is almost no structure to the class. Each day is a different paleoclimatic event\/era. There are a few papers to read for each class and each lecture is given by a student. You only give the lecture for one class period throughout the semester. It is very laid back an you'll get constantly interrupted as the class gets distracted on tangents. Besides your one lecture, there is no real way by which you're held accountable for doing the reading, so this class can be essentially zero work if you want it to, but you won't get much out of it. You also have no idea where your grade comes from. Take it! Why not!",
    "A class unlike any offered at yale but super accessible and valuable. Learned a ton, especially considering I come from a non STEM background. Professors were dope",
    "You read scientific papers and present on them, that is all. BUT ITS GREAT! Especially if you love geology. Way easier if you're a geo major.",
    "I thought this was a great class. It is mainly comprised of student presentations on various issues in paleoclimates. Students read various papers on the topic for each session, and one student must present on the papers and help lead a discussion. The topics are definitely challenging, and I am not a G&G major, so I think I had to put more time into the material to fully grasp the concepts, but most of the topics are really interesting, and it is very fulfilling to leave a class feeling like you can discuss these ideas intelligently. Some of the papers are tough, and the workload varies from week to week. I also put a ton of time into my presentation. Still, the workload is more than reasonable. I think I would have gotten more out of the class if I had known more about the topic going into it, but I am still really glad I took it. Professor Pagani is one of the best professors I have had at Yale, so it was worth it just to take a class with him.",
    "Really good class for anyone interested in climate science and paleoclimates. The material can be a little hard to grasp at first, but if you are diligent with reading the papers, it's a great experience. The individual student-taught lectures are a great way to become accountable for material and learn it more confidently.",
    "took as a nonmajor with some experience in the sciences. a lot of the technical material went over my head but i felt i learned a ton and enjoyed the class overall. would be a good credit\/d for nonmajors"
