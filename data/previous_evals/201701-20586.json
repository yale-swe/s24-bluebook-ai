    "The experience of writing a feature-length screenplay over the course of a year and receiving feedback from a wise professor and thoughtful peers is an incredible one. You learn so much about the process of writing, about yourself as a writer, about what makes a story compelling over 100 pages, and so much more. The feedback was invaluable.",
    "Elaborated upon in the professor evaluation.",
    "How to pace my writing, and how important multiple drafts of a screenplay is!",
    "Learning to work in the structure of longer form storytelling, how to juggle various storylines necessary to keep a feature engaging, how to create meaningful arcs for dimensional characters, etc. As well as lots of important industry related information relevant to pursuing screenwriting as a career into the future.",
    "What a privilege to graduate with a feature length screenplay that's been peer reviewed by so many of my friends. Honestly will be going toLA with a new perspective on screenwriting!"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is very strong. A year is a good amount of time to write a screenplay, and the system of rotating through two scripts every week works very well. Its a reasonable amount of material for classmates to read and consider in a given week, and it also moves through the class at a pace where people are pretty to submit their next draft right around when their turn comes back up. Everyone gets at least a couple rounds of feedback. Not really much of a way to improve it.",
    "My only suggestion for improvement would be more studies of professional scripts during weeks where nobody is prepared to present a screenplay, those were a highlight of the intro\/intermediate courses, and it would be interesting to see how our analyses developed with another year of experience.",
    "This course was a great atmosphere for peers to influence others and gain perspective.",
    "You build close relations with your peers and with your work. I struggle to think of structural ways to improve the course; it's format is really ideal for what it is."

    "I would definitely recommend this course to other students interested in screenwriting. The exercise of writing a feature-length over the course of a year is a really good one, and the feedback you receive from Marc and your classmates is excellent, likely far better than any youll be able to receive over an extended period in the real world. You learn so much about yourself as a writer and the process of creating a compelling narrative that lasts 100 pages. And you get to see what awesome stories your peers are doing as well, which is so neat! By now, you presumably have worked with Marc before and know his style, so that helps; hes a big personality, but such a caring guy who will push you to do your best work and be proud of you however much or little of his advice you apply to your script. Its a great way to cap off your Yale career if youve been studying film and screenwriting, and its very fulfilling and fun.",
    "Yes if you want to be a screenwriting major :p",
    "If you want to write a real feature at Yale and develop it and learn from your peers and get feedback from a professional, this is the only option. So take this course if that's something you're interested in. There's a lot that could be improved about the program, but this is by far the best way to gain screenwriting skills at Yale.",
    "Yes, if you care deeply for writing for the screen. Otherwise you'll just waste your time and the time of your peers.",
    "If you're considering taking this course, you probably know what you're getting into. Marc is simultaneously a wise, endlessly helpful, patient professor and kind of a crazy man with a crazy agenda. He pushed us all to write something vaguely resembling an 80s-crime drama that helped us push our stories into more thrilling places, but he also was often dismissive of our other plans. That said, he always is flghting for us and wanting our good, even if he doesn't quite get what we think good is. I'd really definitely recommend taking this class with friends and sticking with them throughout - having buds in the class made it entirely worth it. Plus, I've graduated with a feature length screenplay!"
