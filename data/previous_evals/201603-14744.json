   "comments": [
    "Speaking Hebrew more confidently and writing longer passages.",
    "I learned how to speak more fluently and write better. Additionally, I learned many of the more tricky conjugations and sentence structures that then allowed me to formulate more complicated sentences and consequently express more complex thoughts and ideas.",
    "This course gave me an incredibly strong foundation in conversational and written Modern Hebrew. It is so pragmatically focused and effective that I overheard a cab driver speaking Hebrew, addressed him in Hebrew, and he thought I was Israeli. I cannot stress enough how strong the Hebrew program at Yale is, combining so many different tools in order to provide a large repertoire of real-life skills when it comes to Hebrew.",
    "My Hebrew improved significantly and I learned a lot about Israeli culture.",
    "Expanded on my conversational Hebrew with knowledge of more vocabulary and future tense forms of verbs.",
    "Learned a lot about both the language and about Israeli culture.",
    "I learned how to communicate via email and converse in hebrew which are both helpful for immersive skills."

    "an overall great class. The staff is attentive and very helpful.",
    "It had many strengths. Professor Goren taught the information very well and even the difficult concepts were explained very clearly and precisely. The information given was organized and made interesting.",
    "The strengths of the course are the pragmatic application-based focus and the dynamic and engaging nature of the class. They really make sure that you engage with the language in a number of diverse and vibrant ways. I can't think of any weaknesses.",
    "The biggest strength of the course is definitely the Professors. All of the Hebrew professors that I have had are excellent and I have heard great things about the ones I have never had the pleasure of learning from.",
    "We covered a lot of material in a short amount of time, and I now feel comfortably conversational in Hebrew.The in-class exercises and out-of-class requirements, particularly sections with Naama, were really helpful.",
    "The course could use some more quiz evaluations to hammer in vocab and verbs"

   "comments": [
    "Yes definitely. If you're interested in the Hebrew language\/Israel then you should definitely take this.",
    "Yes. It is taught very well, the concepts are explained clearly, and it will greatly improve the intellectual level of your Hebrew.",
    "Anyone who is looking to achieve fluency in a language as fast as possible while still looking forward to every class should take Hebrew. It's exciting, engaging, and incredibly rewarding.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Hebrew, or anyone who needs to fulfill the language requirement and is looking for a language to do so.",
    "I loved reading the short stories and writing responses to them. The ones chosen were informative, interesting, and a great read. I also liked the emphasis on conversational hebrew, rather than rote grammar. Finally, I loved the sense of community fostered by the class, especially with how the classes are run when there are group projects\/class assignments. Homework seemed fair, once in a while would go a bit over my head when we haven't learned some of the words. Otherwise, was a good amount. Could've been less, since it was about as much as the L1-2 classes but we didn't receive the extra half credit for it. I really enjoyed the whatsapp conversations. I understood the purpose of the online homework, but sometimes it felt like busy work. I loved listening to music in class, however filling in the blanks seemed quite pointless when that wasn't what we were learning about at the time (like filling in \"\" or \"\" when we were learning about vocab or \"to you\" \"about you\" constructions). I think it would make more sense to have the whole song printed out so we could focus on the lyrics, and then work through and translate it. Hebrew tables were fun, a great way to meet with the class outside of class time and a great way to practice hebrew. The Israeli events at Yale are also top notch, and I would've gone to them anyways. No complaints here. There is a \"social business project\" which I hope gets scrapped in future years. It seemed fairly unorganized, and we didn't produce much in terms of a deliverable. Our company wouldn't respond, and a lot of the time it felt like we were flailing around not knowing what to do. Also, it was had to find motivation when the project felt so bland.",
    "Yes; the Hebrew department has really incredible faculty who care a lot about their students in and out of class. Class is both fun and challenging, and I really enjoyed this semester.",
    "yes i would"
