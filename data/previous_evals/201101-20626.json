    "The course looks at colonialism in Africa from several standpoints, covering its implementation, entrenchment, and legacies. It approaches colonialism from social science as well as humanity perspectives, and does a great deal to add nuance to most traditional narratives of colonialism.",
    "Colonialism in Africa was a review of the historiographical literature on the different issues related to colonialism. Learned a great deal and would definitely recommend the course.",
    "I would. If anything, it is unfortunate that more students are not interested in African topics.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone interested in British history or European imperialism generally."

    "This course combined theoretical readings with case studies to provide a good overview of the historiography on colonial Africa.",
