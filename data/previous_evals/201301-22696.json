   "comments": [
    "One of the best seminars I've taken in four years. I wasn't particularly interested in South Asia, but Professor Thachil used South Asia to look at broader development issues. It was a very well run class too; Professor Thachil does an excellent of balancing discussion with instruction. Highly recommended!",
    "I did really badly on the papers, but this class is really useful if you're interested in development or in South Asia. The reading is pretty dense but helpful and Thachil will actually force you to learn. He really values student opinions and participation, and makes you defend the things you voice in class. Content and style are really useful tools you'll get out of it.",
    "take it! great class",
    "Interesting and engaging political science seminar, even for a non-major. As someone without a strong economics background or interest, I did feel a little lost in the second unit, but learned a lot about relations in South Asia and particularly how to read poli sci publications, a skill I really appreciated. Tariq Thachil is funny and a decent seminar leader, and a great mix of people in the class.",
    "Great discussions moderated and structured well by Prof Thachil, interesting readings, a bit tough grading.",
    "As an econ major, I was surprised \u00e2\u0080\u0094 wrongly, given the course listing \u00e2\u0080\u0094 at how much this course focused on political development. Still, the strength of this course is Prof. Thachil. He's great at promoting discussion and provoking a laugh, and he could often salvage a coherent point when a student either garbled his or her idea or used too much jargon. The more ethnographic readings were enjoyable.Weaknesses: Many of the readings were poorly written, too long, OR (not and) about things that were just plain boring. (A few stand out: Siddiqa, Bennett-Jones, Kohli, Lal, Amsden, Belassa, Weiner, Weiss.) This was particularly true at the beginning of the course. Also, the lack of guidance provided for the response papers could be frustrating at times, and I wish the requirements and expectations of the papers had been reiterated.",
    "I highly recommend the course. The material was fascinating and thought-provoking, and covered a wide variety of topics that were all interrelated (i.e. democracy, South Asian politics, gender equality, economic growth). Prof. Thachil kept the class engaging - discussions were very thought-provoking and kept on track. I really appreciate that he asked questions and pushed students. Connections between readings\/authors across various weeks were brought up, which helped tie the course together. His humor made a two hour seminar in the morning very enjoyable as well. I looked forward to the class every week.",
    "yes, take it not only if you're interested in South Asia but even in the broader themes of economic development.",
    "Development in South Asia is a great seminar course for people of diverse backgrounds -- the conversations are enhanced by people steeped in various regions in South Asia as well as by people of various disciplines.Prof Thachil is superb and the conversations and discussions in this class are extremely important, interesting and thought-provoking.I would highly recommend this course, as it has been one of the best I've taken at Yale! Taking a class with Prof Thachil should definitely be on your Yale Bucket List.",
    "Excellent, informative, and inspiring! You do not need a South Asian studies background for this: if you're at all interested in development, this is a must-take course. We read literature on what helps economic growth and poverty alleviation, and apply that to South Asia (mostly India and a bit of Pakistan). But this course really gives you the techniques to apply this to any developing country, and a good look at some of the best economics\/political science papers on the topic, synthesized by one of the best political science professors at Yale. Tariq is charismatic, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. You won't regret taking this class unless you completely don't care about the developing world.",
    "A good class on an interesting topic. Professor Thachil has a great presence as a teacher, and is clear and engaging. However, he's not very approachable, which was one of the more disappointing parts of the course. However, he does do a great job of picking a well- rounded group of students for the class. Everyone contributes a different perspective, so the seminar discussions tend to be pretty good. In addition, the class is a good long-term investment, because Professor Thachil takes time to explain useful statistical concepts and methods of analysis.There was a lot of reading, but the readings were hit or miss. Instead of skimming all of the readings, I would recommend scanning the intro and conclusion of all the pieces, picking the readings that you actually want to read, and then reading those carefully.",
    "Course covers a range of topics with respect to development in South Asia."
