   "comments": [
    "Take it. It's a solid intro class with a low workload and pretty universally interesting material (if you're a human). Professor Olson is leaving Yale, so I can't really comment on future Intro Psych courses, but this one was fun and I'd recommend it.",
    "Many students will say you need to take intro psych during the first semester so that you are taught by Marvin Chun or Paul Bloom, but don't be discouraged to take this course during the second semester with Professor Olson. You learn a ton, the readings are interesting, and the lectures are fun to go to. My only complaint is that at times the lectures feel rushed because Professor Olson speaks quickly.",
    "I would recommend this course. It's a prereq for most psych courses, so psych majors have to take it anyway. But even for non-psych majors, this class was genuinely interesting and it taught me things that are useful for general life. The lecture and powerpoints were neat and organized and the exams well-spaced and reasonable. I found the tests easy, but studying is required as they were mostly memorization. I stopped reading mid-way through the semester but I attended every lecture and am doing well in the course.",
    "Yes but consider taking it Credit\/D\/Fail. The material is interesting but the curve is harsh. This class has been my lowest grade so far (B).",
    "Do not take this course. It is too difficult for the introductory level.",
    "Definitely worth taking regardless of what your interests are. The course is broad enough that you will surely find a lot that applies to your field of study and to your own life.",
    "definitely. comprehensive class with low workload and interesting material.",
    "Different people probably took this class for different reasons. I took this class as a gut Credit\/D, and for that it was perfect. All I had to do was go to lectures, which were entertaining\/interesting enough, do the easy forums every week, and then study for one or two days before the test. The tests are non-cumulative, which is huge. And there is no final.Although I think if you really wanted to invest in the material, one could get a lot out of it.",
    "Basic intro psych class. Professor Olson is very clear and interesting to listen to; her lectures are interesting with lots of cool examples.",
    "Yes! If you don't need it as a grade then take it Credit D",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. As long as you study hard, it's a great course that isn't too hard and will teach you a lot.",
    "No, I would not recommend it. I thought it was a little boring and too broad.",
    "Yes",
    "It's a fun class! Take it for sure.",
    "Introduction to all of the different branches of Psychology.",
    "Definitely recommend. The material isn't difficult, and the stuff you learn is so applicable to real life situations.",
    "This is a course everyone at Yale should. It is definitely interesting and sharpens your way of thinking about humans in general.",
    "An amazing intro psych class. I would recommend to everyone.",
    "Intro Psych is a great course. I learned a ton. The lectures were often fascinating, and the readings, while a bit long, really did help to provide a deeper understanding of the material. Beware though that the exams are a lot of memorization.",
    "An interesting but impersonal course. I would recommend it.",
    "This was a great introduction to the field of Psychology. I would absolutely recommend it to every student at Yale, not just students considering a major or career in Psychology or medicine. There is information in this course that everyone should know, and it was taught extremely well.",
    "Good overview of many aspects of paychology",
    "Psych 110 proved more fascinating than I initially gave credit for. You become far more aware of basic interactions and patterns of behavior that I didn't realize were already codified and described in academic literature. The curve is a bit difficult because people have already taken the class before, but it's good information to know for life.",
    "I would highly reccomend this course for anyone with even a remote interest in psychology.",
    "Take Intro Psych if you want a fun class that is very straightforward.",
    "Intro Psych is a really fun class and a great way to learn about psychology before leaving Yale. I took it as a senior and highly recommend it as an interesting, but really enjoyable elective class. There is a good deal of memorization for the tests, but it is extremely manageable as is the overall workload.",
    "I would most certainly recommend Psychology 110. Even though the research is changing every day, the things that are quite plainly established are a lot of fun to learn about, and Yale seems to have an all-star Intro Psych faculty. My best advice for you is to actually attend the classes (as tempting as it may be to skip) and do all of the reading by test time. Sounds simple, but failing to do so can really hurt your grade. Also, whatever you do, go to Peter Salovey's guest lecture. That guy is charisma central, and it's so fun to hear him speak!",
    "Psyc110 is a good broad overview of psychology and I highly recommed it to a fellow student, especially a premed who also has an interest in social science.",
    "It was a solid class. The material was interesting and the lectures were pretty decent. There was an alright amount of work, although the forums got annoying. The exams were very fair. Overall I would recommend it.",
    "I thought it was an interesting class even for someone who is not very interested in psychology. The workload is very manageable, and the professor is interesting. I would recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class. While it is not the most interesting class in the planet, you need it to take upper level psychology classes which get more interesting. The teacher was great. The tests are very detail oriented, so expect that. Otherwise, it's a basic intro course, so don't expect to have your mind blown.",
    "Intro psych is an interesting class and not too much work. It is a great social science credit",
    "I would highly recommend to another student if they never had AP Psych or plan on being pre-med. Depending on who the instructor is, you should also definitely take the course to get a great survey. If you're geared more towards neuroscience or one area of psychology but don't want to go past an intro level, consider cog sci or perspectives on human nature.",
    "Interesting class, very basic. Requirement for many upper-level classes but it is not annoying at all. It touches on a wide variety of topics. I would recommend it to a fellow student considering a psych major or who just wanted to get a feel for the discipline.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I loved it and I think that many people consider it the classic college course.",
    "I would recommend this course. All of the topics are interesting especially when guest lecturers come to class.",
    "Yes, it was a very good class and I think everyone should take an intro psych class at Yale. The psych department here is very strong and taught very well.",
    "Definitely... very interesting class",
    "I would recommend psych 101 if you are a psych major, potential pre-med, or even just interested in general psychology. The class does require effort for an A so don't take it if you think its an easy A. Take it with either Marvin Chun or Paul Bloom who are considered to be the superstar lecturers of this course.",
    "This classes teaches a lot of information that is interesting and actually useful in daily life. I highly recommend it. However, a lot of the success of the class is due to Prof. Olson's teachings and she is leaving the university soon. I'm not sure how the experience will be under a different professor.",
    "Yes I would recommend it, you must take good lecture notes nd do all the readings.",
    "I would recommend Psychology to anyone, although Prof. Kristina Olson won't be teaching anymore, it's a great course to take in college because it's cool! You learn really cool stuff, and sometimes the things you learn, you might try to integrate in your life to make your life more awesome. That's why this class is cool.",
    "Intro Psychology was a good intro class. You learn a lot of basics, but make sure to take it with Chun or Bloom.",
    "I would recommend it to another student as I feel that Psychology is an essential class to take in college. Not only is the information interesting and relevant, but it also places many other college goals and classes into perspective. We were required to participate in research studies and those were absolutely wonderful! This was we were also able to understand the material better and we had taken part in research studies ourselves.",
    "Not with Professor Olson--my roommate had Professor Bloom and was much more satisfied with the experience on the whole. I would, however, recommend taking the class at some point during your stay at Yale, because I feel like it's information you ought to learn!",
    "Intro Psych is an interesting and fun class. If you attend lecture and take notes, you should do fine on the exams. Olson is a great professor\u00e2\u0080\u0094no need to take this class with Chun or Bloom.",
    "I would recommend them to take it credit D. Too hard to take it any other way.",
    "I recommend this class. I think everyone should take an Intro Psychology class. You just learn about life.",
    "It is a difficult class that provides an overview of current psychological theories and past studies. Even though the course material is interesting, the test set-up is difficult and requires a lot of preparation. I would definitely recommend it to someone who is interested in the field, but not to those who are not.",
    "It's a great course to take, exams are very fair.",
    "Great intro into the fields of psychologyyou can pursue after this course. Necessary foundation for pursing a career in psych.",
    "The class was pretty good. I would take the fall semester class however.",
    "Intro Psych is a great class for anyone at Yale. Whether you are interested in psychology or not, you can definitely learn a lot from this class and benefit from taking it. It covers a range of topics, from sex and love to mental disorders. The work was very manageable and the exams were fair as well. The exam is interesting enough that any professor will be great.",
    "Very interesting with manageable work load.",
    "Psychology 110 02 basically explains every day life to you. It explains how sleep, dreams, memory, drugs, morality, consciousness, etc work, which are all things that everyone experiences daily.I would absolutely recommend the course to another student. The information in the course is applicable and relatable instead of useless, forgettable information.",
    "I would recommend Psych 110 to a student who is looking for an overview of the field of psychology. The workload is also not overbearing.",
    "This is a basic introductory psychology course. Professor Olson won't be teaching it anymore, so I won't speak to her particular teaching style. The class covers senses and perception, social psychology, developmental psychology, clinical psychology, and more. I would definitely recommend this class to everyone, not just potential psychology majors. There's a lot of good information in this semester, and you'll definitely get a lot out of it.",
    "I would say that it gives you the basics of the field, very helpful if you've never seen any of the Psych stuff before and want to know stuff like Milgram's experiment, social psychology, intro to clinical psychology. I would recommend if you're planning on med school (required), or want to take higher level psych courses. If just taking for the sake of taking, I would probably do something else.",
    "I would recommend Psych to another student. I learned a lot, the material was interesting.",
    "It is your typical introduction class. It can be interesting at times but it's pretty much a ton of memorization and it can be bland at times.",
    "I would recommend this to another student, because it was interesting, not super challenging, and there are a lot of people in it, so it's likely that this is a class you could end up taking with a friend or suitemate. Also, it was great that the final was scheduled for an in class within the normal schedule, so it wasn't something you would have to worry about during finals period.",
    "It was a fair course in introductory psychology. I liked taking it with Olson because she had three non-cumulative midterms, but this was her last year teaching at Yale. The course can drag a bit when they get to topics that aren't as interesting to each person.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic. Even if you are not going to be a psych major, you can learn a lot that can actually be useful in other career pursuits and in everyday life.",
    "Psych 110 is a good class if you're pre-med or just interested in psych. It's definitely not a gut but I always felt like it was totally manageable just from going to class, doing all the reading, and studying for the tests. As a pre-med, I wanted to take it anyway because social science will eventually be on the MCAT, but I was surprised by how much I genuinely enjoyed the class. I found it interesting, especially the guest lectures.",
    "This is a really fascinating course, one whose material will follow you around your everyday life. You'll learn everything from how to psychoanalyze your friends (not recommended) to how to study better. It's really a class you should take before graduating because it's information that's super useful and you won't ever get it after undergrad. But don't go in thinking it's an easy fifth class--it isn't a gut if you want a good grade. If you want to take it credit\/D, you'll be fine. Also, Kristina Olson is awesome!",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to another student. It's so interesting, and I think it retains information that every student should be aware of.",
    "I would say that it is basically a condensed, more fast-paced version of AP Psychology. It is also mostly information recall, which is nice, but doesn't approach the material on a more in-depth level.",
    "Good introductory class to psychology. Not too hard as long as you study the textbook and lecture notes for the three exams. I would recommend it if you're interested in understanding why people behave the way they do.",
    "Intro to Psych is one of those must-take courses at Yale. Although much of the material seems to be things that one already knew before taking the course, one has to be careful to not become complacent or over-confident in the face of exams because of this, understanding that there are a lot of specific pieces of information that one likely did not know before taking the course. But if one keeps this in mind, it really is an amazingly eye-opening course.",
    "It's a great credit\/d if you don't need the distribution credit. If you try, you'll do well enough. The topics are interesting, and the work isn't too bad. Pay attention to the syllabus. It's very helpful to help you stay on top of things. Attending lectures is necessary; reading is too unless you have a group of friends who are willing to rotate the readings and make a study guide for that section with terms and cases.",
    "I would recommend it for a good overview of Psychology with much interesting detail. It's definitely worth taking; it got me interested in majoring in psychology.",
    "-Fantastic course, especially with Professor Olson!-The material is very interesting and very applicable to the real world-The grade distribution is very fair--there were 3 tests throughout the semester, weekly forum posts, and in-class questions. This allowed for the grade to be distributed throughout the semester, which I think is a more accurate representation of how much work is put into a class, and also makes sure you are consistently engaging with the material-Tip: Make sure you read or skim the textbook before tests because it's important to also know some of the material from the textbook!-Overall, I would definitely recommend Psychology 110 to another student"
