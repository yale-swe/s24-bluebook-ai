   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to any students who is prepared to do serious research and read serious books. It is a historical take on a region that is often neglected professionally speaking. This class requires that the student clearly examines a landscape and infers what certain actions or tendencies say about identity.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE. Professor Gilmore is incredible. The subject matter is fascinating and relevant. This is a seminar for those interested by the subject, prepared to work hard and ready to rethink their understanding of modern American society. I cannot recommend the class enough. My only regret is that the class had to end. You will not regret taking this class and learning from Professor Gilmore.",
    "A really incredible look at Southern history. The reading list is super interesting and expanding. I feel really lucky to have been able to take this class!",
    "This class may be the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor Gilmore is wonderful, the readings are some of the best readings I've ever done, and the research paper was a rewarding and fulfilling experience. Professor Gilmore also took time to discuss racial discrimination on campus with us, and related current events and our personal experiences to the course material. She also plays music for you a lot and even made us sing along one time. Pre-register for this class if you can - you really don't want to miss out on it.",
    "I would recommend this class. Professor Gilmore is a great professor and class is always relaxed and interesting. There are weekly reading responses, a midterm and the final research paper.",
    "Professor Gilmore has so much knowledge about Southern history and how intersectional identities are at its core. I loved that. Many of the readings were really good too, often with a focus on oral history. I wish more of the readings were by Black authors and that the classroom environment was more inclusive. The instructor confused the names of some of the Black women in the class and they were not always allowed to finish their thoughts before classmates interrupted.",
    "I would highly recommend AFAM 255 as an overview of Southern history since reconstruction that through a carefully chosen reading list forces you to think critically about the South in a way you may never have before. As a Southerner, I was able to look at the many parts that make up my home and historicize them with the help of the readings and Professor Gilmore. Everyone should take this class--or at least read the reading list.",
    "This is an amazing seminar. Professor Gilmore is a great teacher, and she has so much firsthand experience in southern history.",
    "Awesome choice for a history seminar if you're willing to put in the work. Glenda is awesome and the reading list is great. Definitely a must take for people interested in American history.",
    "It's the best. Take it."
