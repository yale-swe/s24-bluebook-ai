    "I would say it is a mix between a neurobiology course and a physiology course. It exposes you to a range of topics, but it is not effectively organized, and some topics are done a huge disservice. I would recommend this class but only because it is the only class that serves this particular purpose and not because of the actual merits of the class itself.",

    "This course did fill some minor gaps I had in my background knowledge specifically with regards to the visual system, however I do not plan on studying this system in any detail in my future work. Overall it provided minor benefit when considering it took a large amount of my time away from being in lab, because of the commit to science hill three times a week. Ideally I would like to see a course designed and paced for graduate students who have some level of background in the topics, taught on the med campus, rather than a class shared with undergrads who are being exposed to this material for the first time.",
    "This class hinders advancement in the field because many terms used by the professor in the course are inconsistent with the primary literature and some data was so out of date that it has been disproven. The class would only help someone who wants to go back in time."
