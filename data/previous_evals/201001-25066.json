    "Good class to pretty rigorously get a foundation in Plato and Aristotle.",
    "This is an excellent class, and Matt Evans is an excellent professor. The presocratics are a little crazy, but they are worth studying because they help you understand Plato and Aristotle. Basically, the class proceeds as follows: the professor writes down the premises and conclusion of a a few arguments, and then everyone criticizes the arguments. If you have a section a**whole, then this could be a problem, but everyone in our class was pretty respectful, and it made for some of the greatest class discussions I had at Yale. Basically, if you believe that this material is important, you'll love the class, but if you think Metaphysics might just all be sophistry, you might find this incredibly boring."
