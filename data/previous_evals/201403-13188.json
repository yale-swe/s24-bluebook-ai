    "Though there aren't many classes available at Yale for exploring Caribbean culture, this one is truly a gem. There isn't an overwhelming amount of work (weekly blog posts and two papers), which allows you to become intimately acquainted with the texts assigned. You will garner both an appreciation for poetry and an appreciation for the Caribbean from this class.",
    "You get to analyze a lot of poetry you would probably not have come across in any other situation in life, and write about it. The Professor is really kind and accessible, which means class discussion is active without being competitive\/intimidating. He also listens to everyone's contribution to the class, and includes it to the larger conversation, which, as a student, motivated me to participate.",
    "This is a really cool class, if you're interested in exploring literature that isn't usually studied. Professor Reed is great. Just realize that this is not a gut. Don't let the absence of papers fool you -- you have to work in order to do well.",
    "Take this course. The syllabus is wonderful and Professor Reed is a very smart, cool person.",
    "An enjoyable class. It's a good survey of Caribbean poetry, with some history and context for those who don't know the region. It is a very approachable seminar, although perhaps a bit unstructured. If you are willing to spend time doing close readings, and you are flexible in class, you will get a lot out of the course. The material for the second half of the semester was a bit experimental for my taste, but the course covers a fairly wide range of poetry. There is something for just about everyone.",
    "A pretty good class. I recommend it."
