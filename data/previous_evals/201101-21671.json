   "comments": [
    "I would NOT recommend working on a show with Daniel as the director. He is a wonderful, intelligent person, but not a good director. While we created a wonderful show, the process was unnecessarily challenging because he is not a good leader or manager.",
    "If you like theater, yep yep!",
    "I don't know if they'll offer it again....but sure? Caucasian Chalk Circle was a blast.",
    "Doing a production seminar with Larlham is great. He takes risks and works on his feet. Do it if you take the chance. Be warned: Larlham expects a huge time-commitment in the tech weeks, of which there were three this time around.",
    "If you are interested in the intersection of theater theory and pratical theater work- take it.",
    "Take it, but only if you're willing to make it your biggest course commitment of the semester.",
    "I would recommend it, but I would be aware of the time commitment outside of class this class requires. You are putting up a show. It felt like some people were incredibly invested and others not so much. I wish everyone had had an equal commitment level. The show turned out great in the end and it was wonderful to be so involved from a production standpoint.",
    "LLOTTT OF TIMEE SPENT REHEARSING, but it all paid off--people thought the production was at a new level of theater and was one of the best, if not the best thing they had seen at Yale, in a large part due to Daniel's directing of staging devices. Enjoyed the entire cast and the process, though stressful, is something I am so thankful to have as part of my college experience."
