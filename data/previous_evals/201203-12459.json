   "comments": [
    "This class is basically a history of the development of cultural sociology, a discipline that asserts that culture (symbolic codes, values etc) have just as much as role shaping life as do more material forces (the economy, legal system etc). Really interesting discussion of politics in terms of performance studies, the cultural forces that shape war and other material things. It really changed how I thought about history, politics, pop culture and art. Definitely worth taking for a different theoretical perspective than you receive in most other classes.",
    "Yes. This course will change your perspective on society and the narrative systems in which we live!",
    "Summary: Interesting.I would recommend it to another student interested in sociology or culture or anthropology.",
    "This is an amazing class. The best class I've taken at Yale. Professor Alexander shares his passion without seeming kitschy or overly-enthusiastic. He is THE cultural sociologist and makes the class feel like part of an evolving debate. The syllabus is structured to present the material perfectly. This class had changed how I see the world."
