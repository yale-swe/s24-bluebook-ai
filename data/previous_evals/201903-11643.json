   "comments": [
    "The course offered several opportunities to practice Portuguese but it did not teach new concepts (not well at least).",
    "The glaring weakness of the class was the professor. He treated people unfairly and was rude to everyone in the class. He seemed to care more about mansplaining and interrupting people whenever they spoke and imparting random knowledge that had nothing to do with class topics just to show off how smart he was. He even interrupted guest speakers that he invited to class. Also, because not as many people take portuguese classes, its sometimes difficult for people who have no prior knowledge of portuguese or other romance languages before taking this class. Over half of the class were heritage speakers of portuguese or spanish. I talked to the professor once about how his style of teaching that assumed spanish knowledge or other things was unhelpful to me and how I felt that I was at a disadvantage compared to others without any support to move forward and he just told me that that was the way it was. I never had a problem getting up at 9:25 every day and walking across campus to learn language but this professor really ruined it for me. In addition, I felt that there was not enough practice with spoken portuguese and command of the language without a word bank or a whole weekend to proofread your work.",
    "The course itself can be described as \"weak\". The organization does very little to create an educational environment. This course needs to be completely redefined to truly teach students anything. The class had people with very different Portuguese skills which led to more advanced students learning nothing."

    "Do not take this class unless you need to it continue learning Portuguese. The curriculum is truly poor and I have not taken a less intellectually stimulating class since middle school."
