   "comments": [
    "MATH 115 is a good class, I recommend taking it if you like calculus or need it to fulfill any type of requirement. It is not extremely hard and it is very straightforward. I also really recommend taking it with Flor, she is an amazing instructor!",
    "I found it very tough overall, but the course is fair.",
    "The class was well-taught and informative.",
    "Take this class if you want a solid grounding in calc for the rest of your college career. I am not a stem kid, but glad I took it",
    "MATH 115 is a good intro to relevant material needed for a lot of other classes, but the way in which it was taught was particularly unhelpful. I would recommend MATH 115 mostly because its a prerequisite to a lot of interesting classes, but not just for the sake of learning.",
    "Math 115 certainly requires a deal of effort on behalf of the student. It requires taking the time to understand the concepts then applying the knowledge and doing practice problems. The midterms and final test not only your ability to do the problems, but your understanding of the concepts, as well.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Math 115 will probably be like what you'd expect. It's Calc II. You'll learn calculus, but you probably won't be fascinated by the material. Take it if you're into math or you need to, but don't expect it to be life changing.",
    "Math 115 is a necessary evil. The flipped classroom is rough, in that it feels like you never really get a strong background in any particular subject. In class, you go over problems, but it feels like you never get a hold on all of the material or the potential problems they can ask because the information is so scattered. If you can take Math 120, I would take it instead of Math 115. Despite the structure of the class being difficult, Flor was an amazing teacher who was always willing to meet outside of class for extra help. I met with her so often, and she was always so generous and kind with her time, and even offered me tea during every meeting. I would not recommend 115, but seeing as a lot of people need to take it for prereqs, taking it with Flor is a good option.",
    "Your go-to basic Calc 2 course. problem sets are manageable as long as you start them over the weekend, and you can work with classmates. Exams were manageable with enough studying\/preparation.",
    "MATH115 is a lot of integration and a lot of series. The flipped classroom is a good idea but probably only works for certain students. I was not one of them and fond that the videos only helped for revision. The textbook and instructors are a great resource though. Also, OFFICE HOURS! (I wish I went for more office hours)"
