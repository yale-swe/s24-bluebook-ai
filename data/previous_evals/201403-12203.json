    "Professor Semmel has such an awesome sense of humor and is so kind. He exudes confidence when leading discussions and is a smooth, calm talker. You will most likely appreciate this and find that it helps you keep your mind focused on the material. Nonetheless, H&P can be kind of boring sometimes. Professor Semmel understands this and understands that not everyone can do all of the reading. He asks you questions during discussion that sometimes require you to have done the reading, but this is not always the case. Sometimes we discussed things that were more removed from the text, and this was very refreshing. This was the only DS section where we talked about Directed Studies as a program itself, and I found this to be invaluable. The paper topics are straightforward, and his comments on the papers are always helpful. Go to his office hours! Will you enjoy having Professor Semmel? Absolutely. Will you enjoy this class? Probably. But also probably not at many times. Unless you love reading hundreds of pages detailing the specifics of ancient wars, you will likely only find yourself doing some of the reading. Regardless, writing the papers truly does help you develop important writing skills, and the prompts force you to think creatively but critically.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class.",
    "Absolutely - as long as that person is committed to putting in the necessary work, and has some humanities-oriented interest, DS should be a great experience. While it's not for everyone, it's proving very helpful for me as a course, and I think I'm getting a lot out of it. It's a lot of close reading, and you really do need to do the reading at least pretty carefully, because without some understanding of the text going in to class, you won't get nearly as good of an experience.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone who wishes he\/she had read more Greek and Roman history. If you have taken Latin or Greek in high school, and are already familiar with the texts, maybe look to a more challenging, subject-specific class.",
    "This class requires a lot of reading, and the papers can be challenging, but it definitely worth it.",
    "I would recommend it to them, but they would have to be well aware of the reading workload and intensity of the course.",
    "Fall H\/P is probably the weakest of the DS sections, for the amount of reading and the lack of apparent cohesion. Be warned, this is not a normal history class, which your professor will emphasize with the title Historical and Political THOUGHT. The focus switches between opinions on historiography and opinions on types of government, with additional tangents on the strengths and weaknesses of leaders like Nero and Xerxes. My biggest advice to a DS student is to find, at the BEGINNING of the year, the study guides and book outlines people made for last year's final. When you do the reading throughout the year, do it WITH those outlines. Focusing on those themes and passages in advance will better prepare you for discussion, and save you time from trying to analyze irrelevant passages. Semmel is a really nice, funny guy and a fair grader too. He's a bit complacent in discussions, however. He has each student start one discussion a semester, and your discussions end up following the tangents introduced by that student and others, so the connections between books can get a bit blurred.",
    "Although I enjoyed Directed Studies H&P this semester, I think that can mainly be attributed to Professor Semmels wonderful presence. He is genuinely interested in his students and curious about the material at handrare qualities in any teacher. I would highly recommend any class with him-- I would even take another history class to have him again. The H&P class itself was a mixed bag. It alternated between being fascinating and boring; I loved some authors and loathed others, a problem that is not so much particular to H&P as it is to the entire Directed Studies program. While there was a lot of reading, each assignment seemed to have a core important section that was most essential to discussions, so the reading was pretty much what I made of it. Lectures were also up in the air. While some were phenomenal, others were dry and seemed irrelevant to what we were actually studying. On the other hand, H&P was the only class that attempted to bring together what we were learning in all three DS sections, providing some cohesion that is (very disappointingly) lacking in the program. After a semester of DS, I would recommend the program with some reservations. It is a phenomenal opportunity, and the papers offer you a fantastic chance to work on your college-level writing skills. Additionally, the authors you encounter are vastly influential, and offer at the very least a solid foundation of tradition in each of the three subjects. There are times, however, when DS seems to be more about academic posturing than actual learning. Your happiness within the DS program depends on how much of this you can stomach-- and how truly interested you are in the subjects."
