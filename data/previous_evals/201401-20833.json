    "I would absolutely recommend KREN 120 to everyone because it is a fun way to learn an otherwise challenging language. If you keep up with the vocab learning, you really learn a lot by the end of the semester. You get homework basically every day, but it is very manageable most of the time.",
    "To be honest, Chinese and Japanese are probably going to be more useful in the future. Most Korean students speak English quite well. Learning Korean is going to be more for fun than for practical reasons.",
    "KREN 110 with Professor Lee is wonderful, fun, and helpful. I felt like L2 dipped far more often into useful grammar structures than did L1, which was a welcome development. You'll walk away having learned a lot of Korean in a friendly classroom setting.",
    "Definitely recommend, take Korean as your language requirement.",
    "Not unreasonable amount of work but you learn a lot and its a ton of fun, even though t meets every morning"
