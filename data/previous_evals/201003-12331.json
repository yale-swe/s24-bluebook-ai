    "I would certainly recommend this course. This class is a great break from the research-heavy curriculum in the psych major. Although some students had difficulty with their practicum placements (i.e., they didn't have a placement), (if you did get placed somewhere) the practicum experience is amazing. In my placement, I really get to observe mentally ill individuals and talk with them. In class, we work in small groups on active listening and helping skills, and it's really helpful. The readings, if you're interested in clinical psych, are very interesting and applicable to your placement and to your future career. If you want to go into a helping profession, this is a must-take course.",
    "If you are at all interested in Clinical Psychology, take this class!",
    "Ahhhh!! YESSSS! Take this course! Kristi Lockhart is not only one of the sweetest professors (who also, by the way, hosts the class in her house and every Wednesday has bagel breakfasts prepared for us!) but the subject is super interesting and the field placements are extremely rewarding. I look forward to next semester!!",
    "I would definitely recommend it. A chance at an amazing learning experience!!",
    "definitely take it",
    "TAKE THIS NO QUESTION. It is amazing. Not a terrible work load, and several opportunities to get hands on experience with mentally ill patients. Lots of journal entries, but if you work hard you'll do great!",
    "Unfortunately, due to a lot of bad luck and timing, I was one of the few students who didn't get started at any placement this semester. The places we were supposed to go to were disorganized, and one place was just plain rude to us and completely disrespectful of our time. This was incredibly frustrating, but it looks like we'll be able to be placed next semester, which I'm looking forward to. The class itself was relaxed and generally pretty helpful, and doing the reading responses and final paper actually gave me a lot of insight into myself and the mentally ill population. I wish we had a better idea of how we were being graded, though; it was a little worrying to not know all semester how I was doing in the class.",
    "Absolutely take this class. You will learn so much about yourself and how you can help others.",
    "this is a great class to introduce a student to clinical psychology. great experience in a placement to work with clinical population."
