    "I would recommend this class 100% - definitely! The workload is hard, but manageable, and trust me, it definitely is worth it in the end when you see all that you have accomplished in one semester! It also inspires you to continue photographing - I know that after this class, I will never stop :)",
    "I would recommend this course to other students. Warning: This class requires a lot of of time outside class to edit and print photos. You could also learn everything we learn in this course in a day from someone who has taken the class before.",
    "Absolutely recommend. Great blend of art history, technical photography, and digital manipulation.",
    "I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, it was a beneficial experience in that it forced me to take pictures almost every day and share them with classmates during critiques. I entered the class as someone who casually did photography as a hobby, but the experience of taking an art class helped refine it into something that actually felt artistic. The workload wasn't bad; I spent around 5-7 hours a week editing photos and printing them in the DMCA, though some weeks we students were rushed to finish photos in time for critiques (which were spaced rather irregularly). On the other hand, the instruction left a lot to be desired. We spent only a few classes on actual technique: using a camera in manual mode, color corrections, black and white conversions, and basic Photoshop. Honestly, you can teach yourself all of this by reading some good online articles. During many other classes, we spent two hours sitting through slideshows about famous (mostly film and not digital) photographers. Sure, it's important to learn about these historically significant photographers, but there could have been more emphasis on learning technique during class. It was frustrating how little constructive feedback we received on our work. During critiques, we received rather general criticism on our work, and on our written grade reports, there were rarely any suggestions for improvement or explanation of our grades. In fact, grading was extremely ambiguous. It's extremely difficult to get an A, and we definitely weren't graded on improvement. I have no idea how I got the same exact grade on every critique, even though I would always be told that I was making enormous progress. tl;dr: If you have some experience with digital (DSLR) photography and would like to improve your ability\/become more artistic\/learn to shoot manual and edit\/learn more about the art, definitely consider taking a photography course. But maybe consider one of the other sections, as the instructor for this one wasn't too helpful.",
    "Interesting assignments, definitely feel like I became a better photographer. Kate showed us a ton of great photography, took the time to meet one-on-one with us, and introduced us to the amazing legacy of the Yale photography program. Would have appreciated a more comprehensive Photoshop tutorial; I feel like I didn't understand how to properly edit photos until later in the semester. Zak, the TA, was great--always super helpful and offered great insights.",
    "Definitely an art class. You'll learn about and analyze the work of famous photographers, groundbreaking contemporary photographers, and attempt to apply the concepts of what makes art photography to your own work. You'll also work on camera technique as you go, but that isn't this class's emphasis, though it's completely feasible to come into the class with no experience. You'll also learn a fair bit about Photoshop, which is awesome. A challenging course that demands creative growth, and real analysis of what you're photographing, why, how to make it a truly timeless photo- worth taking, not a 5th class by any means. Takes effort, but if you're interested in photography, it's fun!"
