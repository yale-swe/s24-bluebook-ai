   "comments": [
    "Depends on who is teaching the class, but the workload isn't bad at all. However, if you are not good at analyzing literature you may not do so well on the exams which are graded pretty subjectively (as you would probably guess).",
    "Take it! The class is great; the workload is manageable, and you learn a lot about Latin American literature. Professor Adorno is a great teacher, who is very eager to interact with students and help them improve on anything they are struggling with.",
    "It's a broad survey of latin american literature in which you read fairly challenging texts. It's a lecture so you won't practice your spanish so much. The workload is decent, and Professor Adorno is not a difficult grader, which makes it a nice L5 class. I would recommend it.",
    "Spanish 267 is magnificent survey of the best Latin American literature. Any student who is proficient in Spanish should take it.",
    "This class was an amazing class for anyone interested in Latin American culture and literature. We read a lot of interesting stories, poems, essays, and a novel.",
    "Take it! You get to read some of the best works Latin America has to offer (although, if you took AP Spanish Lit in high school, you have read some of these works before). More discussion, less lecturing. Best of all, it's an all-Spanish class!",
    "Great course. Will get you caught up on Spanish Literature very quickly. Take it.",
    "The material in the course is not very difficult, but it is very very interesting and engaging. Anyone who has any interest in latin American history and or literature should take this course, they would not regret it!"
