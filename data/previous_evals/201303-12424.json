   "comments": [
    "I would recommend the class to an undergraduate - it was comprehensive and very valuable material. However, I would only recommend the class to a graduate student if they weren't taking many other courses.",
    "I think this course is a truly excellent course for undergraduate students preparing for medical school. However, it is an extraordinary amount of work, especially for graduate students for whom coursework is supposed to secondary to research. This course covered the material in far more detail than I needed or wanted, and I would probably not recommend this course to anyone except a pre-med student or a first year physiology graduate student.",
    "Definitely yes. The topics covered in this course are essential and deep enough. Although the exams and homework are difficult (and i didn't do well in those), I did learn a lot of knowledge from it.",
    "It was a good overview of physiological systems. I would recommend this course to anyone who has never taken anything similar before, since it provides good a good foundation for health-related research.",
    "Physiological Systems is a comprehensive class that provides a lot of general information in quite a bit of detail about the function of the human body. I would recommend it to other students, because it is an excellent way to obtain an overview of many systems in the body.",
    "Yes. Completely. It's a great class with very important info for someone going into the biomedical sciences.",
    "This course is a LOT of memorization, and it takes a lot of time in and out of class. Even having taken physiology as an undergrad, I found it useful because it is such a dense subject area. I felt it was the most rewarding of the courses I took during my first semester and would highly recommend it.",
    "It is a good course but feels very much like an \"undergrad\" course (despite the graduate sections) due to the format of weekly quizzes and multiple choice exams",
    "I'd recommend the class. It was an overall organized and informative class",
    "A course which extensively covers the structure-function relationships among the organ systems of the human body. I would highly recommend this course to all other ENAS students, particularly those from Biomedical Engineering programs. This is because I believe this course provides the necessary foundation and understanding that every engineer should have when working to optimize, improve, or design technologies relevant to the medical field.",
    "Physiological Systems is a great survey course for general human physiology. I would recommend this course to anyone interested in physiology or medicine. I feel like I have a good general understanding of the molecular and cellular function of many organ systems after this course.",
    "Yes absolutely! I really loved this class, even though it was very demanding. The wealth of material is absolutely worth the workload.",
    "Quick overview of human physiology with an emphasis on concepts. Lots of examples and clinical insights regarding human disease. I would certainly recommend the course to anyone with a basic background in biology."

   "comments": [
    "Considering that I'm interested in disease-related research, this course was very pertinent to my understand of organ systems and molecular mechanisms involved in system failure.",
    "This course did increase my knowledge of physiology exponentially. I took it as a requirement for a graduate program, and I'm not sure this course will prove helpful for my research, but that is a matter for my graduate program and is no fault of the course.",
    "This course has definitely deepened my knowledge in my profession in medical imaging. It dissects the human body system I am studying in a much more complicated yet intriguing way, since I am more familiar with the engineering tools before.",
    "Again, this class provided me with the background information I need to understand presentations and papers relevant to my field and other similar fields in the health sciences.",
    "It allowed me to relate my background in neuroscience to other systems of the body. It will contribute to the translational aspect of the research by using my knowledge of overall physiological function to inform my studies in neuroscience.",
    "A tremendous amount. This class was invaluable.",
    "This course was a good refresher, and I learned a lot of new material as well. I think it is important to have these topics fresh in your mind when doing biomedical research. However, my research is mostly at the cellular level, so it may be less useful for my research than a cellular physiology or biology class would be.",
    "It helped me to better understand basic physiological mechanisms",
    "Extensively deepened my understanding of the organ systems that I am working with for my thesis. The material learned in this course has provided me with a great foundation from which I will work and reference during the course of my thesis.",
    "I had very limited understanding of lung mechanics, kidney and GI function, the endocrine system, and sensory physiology before taking this class. Although I'm still determining the specific area of my dissertation, this course helped lay a foundation in the basics of electrophysiology and sensory physiology that is important for my current rotation."
