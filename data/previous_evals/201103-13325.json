    "TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR GUY! He will drastically improve your writing. He's funny, personable, makes class interesting, and always makes time to meet with students for suggestions on papers. If you don't take this with Professor Guy YOU ARE MISSING OUT.",
    "This course is difficult because there is a ton of writing involved. If you are one of those people who can whip out an essay in no time then you will do well. If not, you will be like me and spend many hours working on draft after draft. Professor is fantastic though and you will learn a ton. He also doesn't seem to give out any grades below a B- if you put in any effort so don't worry about failing the class.",
    "Yes I would recommend it.",
    "YES. I definitely recommend this course. Prof. Guy is also very respectful of international students' opinion. If you are an international student and are not sure which writing course to take, it might be the safest choice for you to take the course with Prof. Guy.",
    "I don't know how useful it is, but it was very interesting and you actually improve your writing if you do all the exercises and homework. Prof Guy was the best teacher I had this semester. A great professional who is always cheerful, enthusiastic and willing to help. A good experience overall.",
    "Yes, definitely yes. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Professor Guy is the best. He is funny and enthusiastic and absolutely brilliant. Taking his class will make you a much better writer.",
    "Yes. As Professor Guy teaches you alot.",
    "English 114 helped me develop my writing skills. Make sure you choose a topic that you really want to explore and write about because that will be what you are doing all semester. PROFESSOR GUY IS THE BEST!!!!",
    "No doubt that I would recommend this class for another student. It taught me about writing and myself.",
    "In this class , we read common texts, have in class discussions, work on preparatory writing assignments, and finally write an essay. There are only four essays in this class, so the workload is not overwheimg., just enough to keep us inspired.",
    "I would recommend all the freshman, especially the international students to definitely take this class. It is a struggle but it really teaches you to write at the level expected of a college student. But my advice would be to choose a topic that you are genuinely interested in. I initially didn't pay much heed to this advice but i would recommend that you do.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class for another student, because its interesting and also very helpful."
