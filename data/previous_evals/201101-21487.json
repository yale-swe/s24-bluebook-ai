    "A very easy intro class about special education. Very eye-opening, but often lacks rigor and sometimes feels slow. Unfortunately there's no theory involved.",
    "A course all about special education. You learn about different disabilities and how to plan for meeting the needs of students with disabilities. The professor is extremely knowledgeable and incorporates anecdotes from many years of teaching. I would definitely recommend the course if you are thinking of going into teaching. It's a must-take. Professor Shiller is amazing, and it's very necessary to know about this information as a teacher.",
    "This class will no longer be offered due to Yale's decision to shut down its highly successful teacher preparation program. This course was fantastic and gave you a great depth of knowledge about the different types of learners one may encounter in a classroom and how to accomodate them so that their progress is not negatively impacted. Whether or not you had plans to be a teacher, this course was certainly very informative and well taught.",
    "Take it! Except that you can't because it's not being offered again. (Which is a large shame..)"
