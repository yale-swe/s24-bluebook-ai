    "Learn about philosophy and how to apply it to the world.",
    "A philosophical examination of issues facing the world today. Gender inequality, global poverty, torture, climate change, patriotism, just war, and international institutions are just some of the topics covered in the class.",
    "This was a fantastic course that gave me an overview of the best scholarship on various topics like global distributive justice, just war, immigration, climate change, public health and much more. The strengths of this course are in the subject material and Professor Pogge's lectures.The lectures are a bit dry, but they are super helpful, and the workload isn't too bad if you pay attention in class. If you're newto philosophy, this is a great course because it is so relevant to current events.",
    "Very solid introductory philosophy course. The readings and lectures will force you to confront practical challenges in a normatively rigorous way. Also well-suited to those with more philosophical experience, looking to apply some of their background and training to practical political questions. Not an overwhelming amount of work, but the tests force you to memorize quite a bit. Midterm, final, two papers (one something like 6-8 pages, the other something like 8-10).",
    "If you are interested in political philosophy, take this course. If you're not, steer clear. The class is basically a survey of modern philosophical theories on international affairs --- from terrorism, to torture, to assisting the global poor, and so on. The class is very reading heavy, but the things you read will definitely help you see current issues in a new light. It can get very theoretical at times (which isn't necessarily good or bad by itself, just be warned that it is not very rooted in real world events). Though Pogge's lectures can be a bit dry, he is one of the few philosophers who works with international institutions like the UN. He's an extremely bright guy and is willing to help you understand the sometimes esoteric ideas he presents.",
    "I'd recommend it - it's a marvelous introduction to political philosophy, applied to international affairs; the syllabus is well put-together, and Professor Pogge is excellent. Basically, it covers three major themes: global resource distribution, national borders, and just war theory. The workload is a bit on the heavy side, with two papers and two exams in addition to the readings for every class. It'd be even better as a seminar than a lecture (especially since there were only twelve students this term), but take it either way!",
    "This was a compilation of various topics in international affairs, as seen from the viewpoint of philosophers. It carefully goes through specific (and current) philosophical readings and contextualizes the arguments, as well as pushes against them.The course was a bit dry, especially for a morning lecture (as it was this semester). If a student wishes to take the course, they would get *much* more out of it by diligently doing the readings *before* lecture. Professor Pogge very much likes to be refuted \/ asked questions, and he is very willing to engage in a tangent of interest to you.",
    "If you are interested in International Relations or Global Affairs YOU MUST TAKE THIS COURSE! No question about it. It is a philosophy course in which you will read 4-5 essays by prominent moral philosophers per week each ranging at around 20-30 pages. It is difficult to keep up at first but you get better at it very quickly. This class is essential for an IR-minded student because it gives you a philosophical grounding for all the practical questions you want to address in the world. We read and talked about things like distributive justice and responsibilities, immigration, sovereignty and borders, foreign aid as it relates to poverty and hunger, nationalism and patriotism, just war, human rights, gender, population and the environment, terrorism, global health, torture, and global justice. We go really in depth into deep moral and philosophical questions about these topics which are very useful to be able to draw upon when trying to make decisions about what should happen in the real world. Definitely take it if you want to do IR.",
    "A good philosophy course that focuses on ethics and politics."
