    "I developed better writing, speaking, and listening skills in Spanish.",
    "I was able to improve my conversational, written, and reading comprehension skills in Spanish dramatically with this class. The course rigor demands that we approach every assignment with not only an intention to improve grammar but also to become a better thinker in the language.",
    "I developed a strong grasp of Spanish grammar, vocabulary, and oral communication."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The strengths were that it truly was created to advance your skills in speaking and writing. Profesora Sab is a phenomenal professor who cares very deeply about seeing her students succeed. She is very understanding, approachable, and fair. The only weakness is that this course has a huge workload. Expect work every day, and sometimes even several (short) essays a week. Some nights had grammar assignments on top of a reading and vocabulary on top of an essay and a short film. But the homework is all listed in the syllabus, so there is absolutely zero surprises. If you plan ahead and work diligently, you will be fine. And if you actually do all the work, there is no way you won't succeed in terms of your grade and in improving your Spanish abilities.",
    "Strengths: flexible and great teacher, lots of great feedback on assignments, interesting topics of discussion\/reading Weaknesses: workload can be a lot for one class if you don't manage time well",
    "The strengths are that it allowed for good participation, provided a diverse array of assignments (in terms of foreign language skills used, type of media, topics, etc), and truly helped me better my language skills. The biggest weakness is that the workload was very heavy and at times hard to manage, but the instructor was very flexible with deadlines which eased some of the burden.",
    "The class is very well structured, it is extremely clear what is required of the students. However, I believe some of the assignments (there were some really long homework assignments that weren't even graded) were excessively difficult and lengthy. I enjoyed the novel aspect, and the small size of the class made it almost like a book club when we discussed our readings. We also always spoke in Spanish so it was almost like being transported to another world.",
    "The small class size allowed for everyone to participate. Tests were based on the homework and content covered in class."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to someone looking to either practice their Spanish speaking abilities, or for someone who needs an L5 Spanish class for the language requirement. I highly highly recommend taking this with Profesora Sab. She is an exceptional professor, and she really does everything she can to help students succeed. The course does have a huge workload, which is definitely something to keep in mind.",
    "Yes! Fantastic and kind teacher with a heavy but valuable workload. Take if you want stronger conversational skills\/fluency in Spanish in general.",
    "Yes, as your communication skills in Spanish will greatly improve. Just be sure to plan out time to complete the assignments and put effort into the class, as that is the only way to get the most out of it.",
    "Yes, I would. I spoke to some members of the Spanish department and learned that it's a new course that is ever-changing, so I expect that it will only improve as the semesters progress. The class is extremely beneficial to anyone who would like to achieve fluency in the Spanish language.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student because the themes and stories from the readings were interesting; grammar practices helped greatly with my speaking."
