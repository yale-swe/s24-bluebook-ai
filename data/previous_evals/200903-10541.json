    "This is a very good microeconomics course, but be prepared to be challenged with difficult problem sets and exams. It is not a course where you should seek to get honors, but when where you will definitely learn.",
    "I would recommend this course if you have an interest in economic theory.",
    "Good course for micro.",
    "I would not recommend the class unless you have to take it for your program, but it is definitely more approachable than the PhD level microecon class.",
    "I would recommend Econ 545 to other students. It provides a solid analytical base for graduates wishing to study microeconomics and is accessible for those who have little background in the subject whilst also challenging those with undergraduate micro experience.",
    "Summary: Introduction to a slightly more advanced level of microeconomics than undergraduate. Would recommend to others, provided the student is well-versed in the previous materials."

    "I feel as thoughI now have much better knowledge about Economics in general. I would have liked to have learned a bit more about how all of this can be applied - it would have been nice if the professor referred us to relevant studies about how the material related to the field of development and microfinance.",
    "Very much so.",
    "Gained a better understanding of game theory.",
    "I am not in a field that closely related to economics, but I feel that it is useful for me to have a solid knowledge of microeconomics, and the course was helpful in furthering that knowledge.",
    "The course built upon my undergraduate micro classes by providing a more mathematical approach to familiar concepts as well as introducing new theory. It has increased my technical proficiency and analytical economic skill."
