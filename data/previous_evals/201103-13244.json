   "comments": [
    "The course is a great introduction to Immunology. The lectures very closely follow the topics in the book, which was great for exam preparation. However, it was sometimes difficult to stay focused on large blocks of text that reiterated what was read the night before.",
    "Good course. Learned a lot. Enjoyed lectures and guest lecturers.Discussion section was okay, but maybe should be used to go into depth during lecture more about topics covered. The discussion papers were difficult to understand with the immunology learned from class.",
    "Very basic immunology.",
    "I liked this class a lot. I came in with zero knowledge on this topic and so it was obvious to see how much I was learning. I like the set up of the course, with the midterm and final early, and the last half of the class as guest lecturers and working on a paper. Alexia Belperron also was a guest teacher, and I really enjoyed her lectures.",
    "I appreciated the designed of the course, with two exams and a final paper. The lectures provided adequate preparation for the exams. I did not appreciate, however, the multiple-multiple choice design of the exam. I feel as if it did not accurately test students knowledge of the material.",
    "Prof Krause reads off of slides jam-packed with information, but immunology itself is not really explained in detail as well. It might be better to leave some of the details out and to focus on explaining how things work and not just giving us a list of facts to look at.The multiple answer multiple choice on the exams are definitely tricky. Writing a paper on an immunologic area of interest has been interesting, but the expectations for the paper are a bit unclear.It would be helpful if the professor\/ta could discuss major concepts of the exams rather than just saying to focus on everything on the slides and in the book...",
    "It's good.",
    "This was a good course, very tough, but I learned a lot. It was an interesting set up, because we basically did an entire semester of immunology by early November. At the time it really sucked but I'm actually very grateful that I didn't have to study for a final exam for that class at the same time as all my other finals. The lectures are pretty dry but Dr. Krause is a good teacher and I learned a lot.",
    "Good course. Covers a lot of material, but reasonable. I enjoyed guest lecturers and student-led discussion section. Would be nice to have more lecture time because a lot of material is covered very quickly.",
    "Good basis of immunology.",
    "This was my favorite course of the semester. Immunology is a very tough subject but I really enjoyed the material and obtaining a better understanding of how the immune system works.At the end of the course I wish to learn more about the immune system and this is all to the credit of how this course was taught.",
    "I like all the guest lectures. It was nice to have something different. The discussion assignment was inadequate and lacks critical thinking. I would like to see something more thought provoking than watching students repeat what was already mentioned in the article.",
    "The material was interesting, but the class wasn't. I did like the guest speakers though!",
    "I really appreciated the understanding of immunology that I gained from the class. The lectures went very well with the textbook. The discussion readings also reinforced the concepts. One weakness is the lack of subject explanation varying from the text. For example, there could have been more discussion of diseases during the first part of the course.",
    "The class provided a wonderful overview of some of the main immunology concepts. Through review of recent articles, we were able to apply these concepts to specific diseases. However, since the final was conducted in early November, we rushed through some materials we could have reviewed in detail.",
    "The course material was covered far too quickly. The first two thirds should have been spread out and incorporated with the last third of the course. I was eager to take immunology because it was something I knew I was missing in my education, but I don't feel as if the set up of the course allowed me to actually learn the material effectively.",
    "I think it should really be restructured. The first half of the class hit us like a tsunami--a wave of information, text-heavy slides, fast pace, and little explanation. The second portion, with lectures on the applications of immunology, was interesting, but I think we as students would have been better served if these had been interspersed throughout the semester instead of all at the end. Many times it was during these lectures that I finally understood some concept, long, long after the exam had come and gone. Rescheduling these guest lecturers will help students put the didactic sessions into context and provide a much-needed respite from the onslaught of information in this course.",
    "This is an excellent course. A lot of material is presented very quickly, but it is all very interesting. I enjoyed applying what I learned in lecture to a disease of my choice in the final paper and believe this assignment really helped me to retain the course material.",
    "This was a great course to introduce and clarify immunology within a public health context. The lectures given by Dr. Krause and guest speakers were very thorough and topical. A suggestion would be to post the lecture slides before the lectures themselves to make it easier to take notes. Otherwise, the required texts and discussion articles were excellent."

    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Professor Krause is excellent and very willing to help students in the class. He also brought in many excellent speakers at the end of the semester.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Good instructor. Helpful with questions.Also liked Alexia's lectures.Maybe should use discussion time to go into depth about material covered more.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Goes fast in lecture and can answer questions thoroughly.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause, is a good teacher. His power point slides are dense and he speaks really quickly, but I still learned everything and feel like I have a ver good knowledge of introductory immunology now. He is very approachable and helpful.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was an excellent professor. He covered all of the necessary material in class, and provided helpful and prompt feedback outside the classroom.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr Krause is very approachable though and is extraordinarily knowledgeable. Clearly brilliant. When he lets it show, he is quite funny. One of the best comments of the year was that immunoglobulins are shaped like Ys, Y for Yale....best ever comment.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0He's nice.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause's lectures are pretty dry and monotone, but it's a lot of information and i think he did a pretty good job of conveying everythign to us.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Very knowledgeable and professional. Speaks very fast in lecture and whizzes through topics. Would be nice for him to slow down at times. Perhaps the course could be composed of 2.5 hours of lecture per week and 1\/2 hour of section? Would allow for Dr. Krause to lecture more thoroughly.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Though he just simply read through the slides, he was genuinely interested in his students and their progress. He was very easy to talk to about any questions or just about life in general.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Kraus was an excellent teacher.Though at first I felt he spoke to quickly during lecture, I found that within a few lectures I was able to keep up with the material. He also was able to and happy to answer any questions I asked about the taught subject matter or subject matter that went beyond the scope of the class.Thank you!",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was very nice and approachable. He can be very passionate about the material, but most of the time he was dry. He pretty much copied and pasted the information from the textbook onto his slides and read them word by word during each lecture. He would be a great auctioneer.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0The instructor is very knowledgeable and kind. However, he wasn't able to make the class as interesting.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was a very knowledgable and well-organized lecturer. I gained an understanding of immunology that I did not previously have from his presentations. He could have added more anecdotal information or slowed down at times but overall, his teaching was effective.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Professor Krause is very knowledgeable and passionate about immunology. His class would be more interesting if he made the lectures more interactive. Perhaps, usage of other materials in addition to powerpoint presentations would be helpful.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause had powerpoint presentations that he appears to have been using for years, and he quickly read through them, covering but not thoroughly explaining the material. It was difficult to follow and too dense, and it did not facilitate understanding of the course material.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Prof. Krause is clearly brilliant, extremely knowledgeable, and passionate about his area of expertise. I so enjoyed his lecture on his own research--he was funny, made the material accessible, and spoke at a level and pace that I could follow.However, during the first half of the class, I felt lost all the time. The pace was so rapid, I had to give up taking notes, although this is critical to my learning process. Slides were absurdly text-heavy and Prof. Krause read them word for word, rarely departing to offer additional explanation. Frequently, he would not see students' raised hands because his eyes were glued to the computer screen. I feel bad about being so harsh because I like him as a person but this is simply not good teaching.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause is very good at presenting the course material clearly. He invites questions in class and offers help out of class. He makes every effort to help his students succeed.",
    "Instructor: Peter James Krause \u00a0Dr. Krause was an excellent professor, who had an almost encyclopedic knowledge of immunology and various infectious diseases. He was engaging and very approachable."

    "He's good.",
    "TA: MichaelGreat TA! Michael did a great job answering questions, and being available to the class. I liked how he lead our discussion sections because he let the students lead section to cover the discussion articles. He did a great job reviewing exam material, and providing students with suggested study material. Michael would be an even more effective TA if he exuded more confidence. He is very knowledgeable and does a great job as a leader.",
    "Michael was great. Always open to questions, both in class and email, and had a good knowledge of immunology.",
    "Michael did a good job facilitating discussions after lecture. If he picked the articles himself I also thought he had an good diverse selection. I also liked the fact he gave us study advice for the midterms.Thanks Mike!I also really enjoyed Alexia as an occasional lecturer. If she is looking to become a professor for Immunology, she has my full approval.",
    "Michael AraasHe's a nice TA. The practice problems he posted before each exam were very helpful.",
    "The TA was great! Always helpful, and brought in some good guest speakers.",
    "Michael was a very good TA. I thought the papers he chose for discussion fit well with the concepts. He was attentive and available if we had questions or issues.",
    "Michael AraasMichael was a good TA. He was helpful with review sessions for exams. He could have done more for discussion sessions.",
    "Michael AraasDid not seem like he had too many responsibilities for the course, but he provided some feedback on reading responses to articles and guidance for (most of) the student presentations. He provided guidance as to what to study forexams, and while it may have assisted with understanding of immunology, it's not clear that it actually helped for exam preparation.",
    "Mike was a great guy but the \"Discussion\" sessions were a waste of time. We had to read an article, regurgitate what the article said in a 1 page response, and then sit through an hour of \"Discussion\" entirely devoid of discussion where groups would present PowerPoints regurgitating what the article said. To be fair, this is not the only class at YSPH where discussion section hovers around comprehension-level assessment; nevertheless, this is still inexcusable. We're students in graduate school; please give us the opportunity to think for ourselves.",
    "Mike is a wonderful TA. He is comfortable with the material and willing to answer questions or even meet.",
    "The TA for this course was Michael Araas. Mike was a good instructor, using more of a hands-off approach to let us, the students, lead the discussion as we saw appropriate. That being said, he was very knowledgeable and approachable."

    "Introduction to immunology. Yes, if student is interested in using immunology in research.",
    "Informative but don't take if you have had immunology before.",
    "I really enjoyed this class because I felt like I learned so much from it. I have absolutely no background in any science and I still did well in it, so I would recommend it to someone even if they were nervous about taking it.",
    "Similar to comments I read from previous years. Dr. Krause is a really nice man outside of class. The immunology class is set such that the final is in early November and after that lots of speakers come in to discuss immunology as it relates to various diseases, which is really interesting. That practical application is fascinating.This class is partially what you make of it. Definitely a lot of material, but some of it is really quite interesting.",
    "It's good.",
    "Good class, very tough though. I had never taken an immunology class before so it was probably harder for me than some other people, but I learned an awful lot and i'm gladI took it. recommended",
    "The course covers a lot of material. At times it feels like you cannot keep up with lecture, but with dedication to studying outside of the classroom you will learn the material. I enjoyed working hard during the first half of the semester to complete the midterm and final, then change course to focus on guest lecturers and writing the paper. with the amount of material covered in the course, it was better to have the exams before all other classes because I could focus more on studying for this class.",
    "For a basic immunology course it was good.",
    "Yes. It will be a tough class, but the more you put in the more you will be rewarded.",
    "It's a requirement for EMD division. If you can waive out of this class, do it! I know it's titled \"immunology for epidemiologists\", but I didn't see much public health in this class. It was purely hardcore immunology.",
    "Overall, not a very interesting class. Could be better though!",
    "Immunology was a very condensed course because the entire textbook was covered in the first two thirds of the semester. It was useful and appropriate for providing a foundation of the basic concepts. I would definitely recommend it to students in the microbial disease division.",
    "I would recommend this class for those who are interested in immunology but do not have a strong immunology background.",
    "If you really want to learn immunology... try a different course.",
    "As I said before, the need for reorganization and a different approach to instruction is apparent. Its current state was a detriment to my ability to internalize information, so as a result, I feel like now, only a few weeks later, I have retained very little.Another note note Iwould like to add is that I seriously question why this class is required for all students in the EMD division. We all have very different interests and goals and for many of us, this is a terminal degree, meaning that every class in this short, two-year period must be carefully selected and meaningful. I do not believe that this class can be justified as a divisional requirement.",
    "This course is lecture based and moves quickly,but the instructor is great. I would recommend the course because the material is interesting, the workload is average and the instructor is wonderful.",
    "This course provides an in-depth but not overwhelming treatment of immunological topics, especially as they pertain to public health and epidemiologists."
