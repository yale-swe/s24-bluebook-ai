    "This course provides insight into key concepts, ideas and philosophies that are the foundations of the current international system of world order. It explores both classic and modern literature and philosophical concepts which explain the way in which international affairs operate and how the individuals driving it strategize and approach current dilemmas facing the state of international relations. I would recommend this course toothers students because it offers a rich understanding of fundamental ideas that have tremendous explanatory power for issues in today's global affairs.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It's not the most time-consuming class and you'll get a lot of out of it.",
    "I'm not sure that I would recommend the course. It's not suitable for students who have already studied the texts on the syllabus, because it does not explore the texts in much depth, but skims each one. But neither do I think it is particularly suitable for students who are new to the texts, because we were so reliant upon the instructor's interpretation of the texts and this made me uncomfortable. Then again, it does provide a useful overview of the main texts in the history of western political thought. You just have to take the instructor's interpretations with a large pinch of salt. At times when I had knowledge of the area under discussion, I could see that the instructor's rendition was biased, but at times when I had little knowledge of what was being discussed, I had no idea how much to take as read what the instructor was telling us.",
    "Yes, I would absolutely recommend everyone I know to take the class.I think it does an amazing job to survey the major works of Western political philosophy. Whether it is for students in history, political science, or international relations, or any other discipline, taking this class is like receiving concentrated version of a humanist education."

   "comments": [
    "This course has helped me approach thinking about current issues in global affairs from an entirely new and revelatory perspective. I am now able to make deeper connections on why certain events in global affairs happen the way they do and identify the motivations and incentives that drive key players in international relations. I now have a stronger understanding of key philosophical concepts and foundational ideas which has helped me think more creatively when approaching certain questions and problems facing current strategies of world order.",
    "What you'll get out of this course is a new way toapproach international relations that other professors at Yale probably haven't demonstrated.",
    "The course was useful as an introduction to many of the key texts of western political thought. I now feel like I have a good overview of what many of the key philosophers have opined. But it felt more like increasing the breadth of my knowledge than increasing the depth, because we had to cover so many authors in such a short time.",
    "Before I took this class, I encountered the ideas of philosophers on a very spotty and random basis. I knew things here and there but cannot put them in relationship to each other. More than anything else, this class helped me put into perspective the relevance of ideas and of history. It introduced me to a wide range of literature that I will certainly benefit from for the rest of my life."
