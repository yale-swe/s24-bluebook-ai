    "The course enabled me to really delve into research. I learned how to conduct research, validate everything, draft manuscripts\/cover letters, and follow a project from start to completion.",
    "Research Skills. Great course to take so that you can focus on research during the school year.",
    "I improved my scientific writing skills and oral presentation skills. Writing the research report really helped me understand the research I've been doing for the past year, and I now have a record of the progress I made.",
    "I learned how to write a research proposal and final report, to frame a narrative around research work, to collect, analyze, and interpret data, and to deliver scientific presentations.",
    "I gained insight into the actual \"scientific method\" as used in biology labs...I feel much more confident now that I could design an experiment and execute it fairly independently. 6 months ago I couldn't have possibly done that. I also am learning to navigate the world of research papers, journal clubs, supplementary tombs, and online databases.",
    "More useful than almost any class I've taken at Yale. Hands on, you learn real science, and you get to choose the direction of your research! It's a win-win."

   "comments": [
    "This course gives a lot of freedom for students to pursue research, which I am very grateful for. I only wish I had gotten the initial research proposal returned with suggestions. Other than this smail detail, I have nothing bad to say about the course.",
    "The strength of this course is that it pushed me to try and get as much done in a semester as I could. However, that was really not a good idea as research necessarily moves pretty slowly - even more slowly when balancing a demanding major and other requirements. I felt very stressed about getting data and because of the nature of my project, that didn't end up happening this semester - despite putting in over 30 hours a week.",
    "The course is highly flexible and the deadlines and expectations are set well in advance. More feedback on the proposal might be helpful in writing the final report.",
    "I don't think that the final project of a 12-15 page paper should be so long. Although there is a lot to include in a research paper, often times 2 months of research doesn't amount to much data, which is why it's difficult to say anything interesting or explain simple things for a minimum of 12 pages.",
    "Strengths: Provides students enough flexibility in their work but also benchmarks to guide Weaknesses: Research report could possibly be shorter because a semester of research is not a long time to fill over 12+ pages",
    "I think this course is well-designed and well-executed. The example for the research proposal was very clear, as was the syllabus for the research report. I appreciated the email reminders that we received about deadlines.",
    "No weaknesses."

    "This course gives a lot of freedom for students to pursue research, which I am very grateful for. I only wish I had gotten the initial research proposal returned with suggestions. Other than this smail detail, I have nothing bad to say about the course.",
    "It depends on the situation. One semester could be difficult to start working in a new lab, develop a hypothesis and test it. But, if you have experience in that research and with that lab, definitely do it!",
    "Yes if you really want to do research and get credit. Be careful about course loads though, you pretty much need to have non-challenging classes or only one or two advanced classes if you're taking this because you will need a lot of time to do a good job.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who is already working in a lab and wants to get credit towards the MB&B major.",
    "I would recommend MB&B 470 - it adds a little more structure that complements lab work. I'm glad it gave me a chance to present my project to my lab and felt good about being able to produce a research report. Ten hours a week can be a good amount of time, but if you're working in a lab it's probably the same amount of time.",
    "470 is a great chance to do fairly independent research. Compared to 251L or whatever the bio lab class of your choice is, there will be some pros and cons. Pros: you get to experience a quasi-full cycle of research in 470. You write a proposal for a project, (hopefully) execute it, and then write up your results in a report. You get to set your own hours (probably also will have to align with a grad student or post-doc mentor), can choose a lab whose work interests you, you get to meet with a PI, you can attend lab meetings and journal clubs, and you get to make lots of friends outside the undergrad world. Cons: your project might go slowly, or not be as interesting as you thought. In a lab class like 251L, at least everything is *supposed* to work (I haven't actually taken 251L but I figure that's the case). In 251L, you get a broad array of work and experiments designed to teach you lots of broad biochem skills, whereas in a lab project, you might only focus on one or two specific skills or assays. Also, beware that 470 requires a long report at the end as well as a lab talk. Don't procrastinate on these. Srsly. I would recommend 470 if you're looking to get a real research experience, and 251L or another lab class if you're looking to gain a broad base of biochemical skills (again, disclaimer, haven't taken 251 so I can't speak to how good the class actually is).",
    "100%. If you're an MB&B major, you'd be wrong not to take this. Make sure you choose a good PI though!",
    "Everything depends on the lab you choose to do research with. MB&B registrar's end of things is very chill and understanding."
