   "comments": [
    "Good introduction to \"political ecology\" whatever that means. I'd recommend it as a fun really high brow environmental studies class. If you aren't into theory and debating the \"meanings behind meanings\" then you should probably avoid it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. It will change the way you think about environmental issues in a way that I think is really important. the subject matter is dense, but its fascinating. I think it's a really important class to take for anyone interested in the environment.",
    "Great seminar! Just don't get caught up in trying to find an answer. Also, unlike most seminars, the reading load was manageable so people actually did all the reading instead of giving up.",
    "Yes, I would. I think that political ecology is a very interesting lens to frame political, social, and environmental issues. It's a really good foil to economics and other \"apolitical\" areas.",
    "by far the most thought provoking class i've taken at Yale. raises deep and important questions about Yale + academia and its shaky place within world power relations. if you don't believe in myths\/want to get your myths about the world busted--come here",
    "A very interesting and mind-opening class. It will definitely teach you to think critically and differently about many environmental issues.",
    "Good class if you're interested in the political aspect of conservation and modern environmental studies. It's a perspective you don't get in most other evst classes, and it's really useful if you actually plan on working in the conservation\/ngo\/or environmental research field. Professor Doolitle is really nice too, although the class is mostly student discussion.",
    "A great view point to anyone who thinks about the environment, it lays a lot of assumptions you may have had open."
