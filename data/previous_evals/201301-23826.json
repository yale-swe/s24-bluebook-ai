   "comments": [
    "I would highly recommend it; it was a great E&M class, especially if you haven't taken any calculus-based physics before.",
    "Physics 181 is a very fast moving course, and expects a lot of mathematical knowledge and manipulation. If you are considering different introductory physics course levels, I would honestly recommend a higher level course because I think you will probably learn much more. This course spends a lot of time on proofs and deriving formulas that are given in the book and that most intro physics students have no problem simply accepting.",
    "Not a great course. You probably have to take it, and none of the other physics intro courses are any better. Don't bother going to class, you won't learn anything useful. Parker goes on a ton of tangents and spends the majority of his time doing algebra on the board while you have no idea what exactly he's trying to get at. But the problem sets can be done pretty easily just using the textbook. Again, you probably have to take it, but you won't enjoy it.",
    "It's not a great class. Only take it if you have to.",
    "Not bad. The tests and psets were reasonable. Take advantage of the study hall. Then you can do your psets in 3 hours instead of 6 or 7.",
    "A boring prereq that you have to take to get to better stuff. The exams are heavily formula-based, so if you're bad at remembering equations, you're pretty much screwed.",
    "Yes! Great class!",
    "Yes.",
    "I do not recommend this class unless you can rely on your own prior physics knowledge and refreshing from the textbook to get you through.",
    "So Parker wasn't all that great of a professor, but having moved down from PHYS 200, I am so glad I took 181! Although lectures in 181 were sometimes just a little slow and boring, compared to the incomprehensibility of 200, this made for such abetter experience, and I really learned a lot.Don't put yourself in any higher than 181 (or 180) unless you have a _really_ strong calculus-based physics background. You don't gain much by going to a higher number course unless you expect to be bored out of your wits. Better to start in 181 (or 180) and change to a higher course later than the other way around.",
    "It's definitely a livable class, it's not too hard if you are a physics person",
    "This did not seem like an introductory course at all. The material was very poorly taught, and most of the actual learning takes place out of the internet than from class or the book. Maybe now that someone else is teaching it, the course might become more enjoyable. But as far as my experience went with this year, I would not recommend this class if it isn't a prerequisite. Most of the class was just spent deriving equations than actually going over concepts.",
    "As far as intro science classes go, it wasn't bad.",
    "Standard introductory Physics course. Will cover E&M and some other topics, though only superficially (e.g. special relativity). Go to the TAs if you take it -- they're great.",
    "The typical intro E&M course. Goes pretty deep into the subject, and we were touching on quantum mechanics by the end of the year. Peter Parker liked to do many derivations and tons of math, which is pretty clear once you understand the subject of interest. Take this course if you're more mathy, but take 171 if you haven't taken too much calculus, else you'll be learning integrals in this class too.",
    "You are probably thinking about taking this class because you have to. It's basically AP Physics C level E&M physics plus relativity and other miscellaneous topics. You'll definitely need to self-teach yourself everything, as I found lectures weren't very helpful. However, Parker probably will not be teaching it next year, so it is hard to offer advice about the course exams\/homeworks. I don't think the material being covered is too hard. Just make sure you put the time into reviewing physics and perhaps invest in a AP Physics C review book.",
    "If you need to take physics, this class is fine. Parker's retiring and whoever's next probably won't be much better. The math is do able, so it's a good choice if you haven't taken multivariable (or have taken it a long time ago).",
    "This class was good, and I appreciated Professor Parker's derivations given in class. The subject was also very interesting and answered a lot of questions I had about magnetism and electricity. I would recommend it.",
    "It takes quite a bit of work and studying.",
    "PHYS 181 is a lot of fun, especially if you like spatial thinking (similar to MATH 120). Take this over PHYS 171 (which covers random, obscure topics that will never help you for the MCAT or really anything else) or PHYS 201 (unless you're considering the physics major or want physics to be the focus of your semester).",
    "It's a standard Physics class, I guess. I would recommend it because this information will be useful in the future.",
    "Comprehensive introduction to physics",
    "Take it because you have to. It is not a good course. Intro Physics 180\/181 are BOTH PRETTY BAD.",
    "My most difficult class at Yale. It was not enjoyable and if you can afford to do so, do not take this class",
    "I would recommend this course. It is much better than the 200 level course which I took first semester. The tests are mostly fair and the problem sets are not absurdly time consuming.",
    "Standard E&M stuff with some relativity. Take it over 171, especially if you're not a biology major. Read the chapters before class and get a head start on the psets and you should be fine.",
    "Yeah I'd recommend it",
    "Only take it if you need it for your major.",
    "Physics 181 is a sold course. Take this even if you took AP Physics in high school, but are not really comfortable with physics yet. I don't know who the lecturer will be next time, since Peter Parker is retiring, but the textbook is solid. Also, the psets are difficult, but possible. Just work in groups, and go to the study sessions. Also, the problems (at least for this year) were from the PHYS 200 textbook.",
    "I feel that most introductory level physic courses at Yale are poorly taught. This is not an exception. However, I do applaud the effort that Professor Parker makes to try to make the material digestible. It is just that his lectures are slightly disorienting. His lecture notes jump from one thought to the other. I had taken PHYS200 first semester with Golling and it was harsh. This class was hard in terms of not so much the material but that the lectures were confusing. If you can self-study well then take this class.",
    "goes at a fast pace through E and M, and not everything is completely explained. if you do the homeworks well, though, you should be prepared for the tests. Homework help sessions were extremely helpful!",
    "It was not a difficult class, unless you actually wanted to learn stuff and then it essentially required independent study to actually learn how to apply the physical concepts. I would recommend 201 before 181, which is probably more difficult but has a more engaging professor who is easier to learn from.",
    "Physics 181 covers electricity and magnetism, but it also goes through light, waves, relativity, and atomic physics. I took both AP Physics levels as well as IB Physics, but I still felt challenged due to the disconnect between the teaching and the problem sets, for which I relied heavily on the textbook. I've heard Professor Parker tries to scare students who haven't taken Math 120 away with surface\/line integrals, and although the class is somewhat integral-heavy, the Math 120 concepts weren't very difficult at all. I would recommend 181 over 171 for students who want a physics class that isn't too difficult but is still somewhat challenging and time-consuming.",
    "This class is inferior to high school AP Physics B\/C classes so if you took those in high school you will be prepared. The problem is that Professor Parker chose to spend at least half of his lectures on theory. The midterm averages were generally very low and the final was dreadful: we never saw 2\/3rds of those problem types before. He doesn't really teach to the problem-sets or the tests, which is a very painful experience.",
    "As long as you're prepared to teach yourself pretty much all the material, you'll be fine. Parker is a confusing professor and going to lecture really only made me more confused. Reading the book and doing practice problems is enough to do well in the class though. Just don't get behind because it moves pretty quickly.",
    "I would say that unless physics comes naturally, physics 181 might be a challenging class that will require some time to review class notes and the textbook and to complete the problem sets. The homework review sessions are very helpful, although it would be nice if the TAs also held office hours. I would recommend physics to anyone who has an interest in understanding how the world works.",
    "I would not recommend this course to students if Peter Parker is teaching it. I also would recommend students who feel comfortable with math to take the Physics 200\/201 series because it seems to be better taught despite being a little bit harder. I feel like I learned very little despite the stress and work from this class.",
    "I took this class after having taken physics 200 first semester. This class is certainly much more manageable than 200 was in terms of the structure of the class and the pace of the class. That being said, to d o well in the class you will need to commit a significant amount of effort and time into it, and often seek out resources like tutors and the problem sessions in order to learn the material well. Professor Parker does a good job of taking questions in lecture and structuring each lecture so that the class understands what he's doing at all times, but if you are going to take it I recommend seeking a tutor and going to problem sessions, as the class will be hard to handle without those.",
    "Whew. Physics 181 was a struggle, not so much because of the material, but mostly because of the structure of the class and the professor. IF you have to take it, be prepared for frustration."
