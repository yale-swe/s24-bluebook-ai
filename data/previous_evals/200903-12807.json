    "good class. lots of repetition. really learned a lot from this class and had a good time doing so",
    "I recommend French 130 to another student with the caution that the 1.5 credit demarcation is deserved. You will be doing a significant amount of french every single night, and the results are visible in your improved ability.If you have the opportunity to take this class with Ruth Koizim, do so. She is a fantastic professor--the best I've ever had for French. She makes the language and class (which can get a bit tedious and dull) exciting and humorous.",
    "In some ways, L3 is more manageable than L1\/L2. For one thing, tests are biweekly. Also, no more Mireille and Robert.That said, be prepared to devote at least two hours a night to homework. The class meets every day, right through reading week.Definitely take the class with Ruth Koizim. I built my class schedule around her class, and that was one of the best decisions I made this semester. Her love for the language is infectious, and it's impossible to not improve.",
    "Yes, Koizim is the best professor by a long shot",
    "It's NOT like 110 or 120 in that you have to read actual French novels and you have about twice as much homework, but you really learn a lot.",
    "French 130 with Ruth Koizim was a wonderful class, and I would recommend it to anyone! It's your standard L3 language class, but Madame Koizim makes it so much fun. She's a great professor who makes even our daily grammar lessons interesting. There seemed to be a large range in levels of proficiency within our class, which made it more difficult for people at either end of the spectrum. If you have to and\/or want to take French 130, definitely take it with Professor Koizim."
