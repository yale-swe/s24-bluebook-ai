   "comments": [
    "You learn about computational aspects of Lie algebras, SO(n), U(n), SU(n). Somewhat cook-book like, the vast majority of homework assignments were applications of basic formulas and stuff that a smart high-school student could do, but still interesting. Not too much theory, which was somewhat disappointing, but Iachello is really smart and clear and adds lots to the subject mater.",
    "Highly recommend the course. Material is critical to a real understanding of what is happening in many areas of physics.",
    "PHYS 624 is an excellent class for students who are interested in mathematical physics. The class moves at a rapid pace, and requires a significant amount of self study in order to learn all of the material that is covered."

    "PHYS 624 introduced me to many interesting applications of algebraic methods in physics. I believe that this background will be very useful for pursuing graduate research in particle physics or condensed matter physics."
