    "I would definitely recommend SPAN 130, especially if taught by Reymundi.This section of Spanish was beyond amazing. Professor Reymundi made the class really fun. There are only strengths: we spoke in Spanish every day, we went through lecture slides that helped solidify the information we read the night before, and videos were fantastic as visual stimulations for learning the material. I wish we experienced more accents from different regions, or talked a bit more about different cultures, but that is probably covered in a different class. Honestly the best Spanish class I've taken at Yale.",
    "It was an overall very good spanish class.",
    "SPAN 130 is a great class. Take it with Lissette if you can, she's a great teacher, she really helps you understand the material and practice your speaking so that it becomes a lot more natural over the course of the semester, she prepares a different powerpoint for every class, and she starts every class with another music video from pop culture in the Spanish-speaking world, which was a lot of fun but also great exposure. This class has more daily work than L1 or L2, and tests become much more writing-based than they were in the past (i.e. rather than a fill-in-the-blank section for vocab, there's a picture and you have to write a paragraph about it using words from the chapter), and in the span of one semester you basically cover all the grammar from L1 and L2 plus more, so there's lots of material, but the tests are very fair and straight-forward. Chances are you have to take this for a distributional requirement, so enjoy, but try to get Lissette if you can.",
    "This class is an intermediate level Spanish class. If you have taken L2 or already have some background in the language, I would highly suggest it. I think that it wasn't too hard for me yet challenged me in the right way."
