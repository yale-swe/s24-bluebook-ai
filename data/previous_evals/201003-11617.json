   "comments": [
    "Q7: We had 2 TAs, and I would rate them differently.Gil was excellent. He was reachable and responsive, and very helpful overall. He seemed legitimately interested in helping students.Dave was less available, and I did not have opportunity to interact with him much. He seemed very knowledgeable, but from my experience was less accessible.",
    "Question 7: I think overall prof. grubler is an excellent professor, very knowledgeable in this field, I wish this class could be longer so we can learn more about energy systems.",
    "Q9 - I refer to the problem sets in place of lab work. The problem sets were very meaningful and a reflection of what we encounter in real life. A little help on the problem sets or class discussions on some of the aspects will make the learning complete.",
    "Instructor was downrated as he frequently overran allotted class times. Also because his problem sets were not always very clear in terms of their wording.",
    "The course is hard -- a lot of work, but the Problem Sets (as much grief as they caused), were very effective at making me think through the critcal energy concepts and perfect energy unit conversion skills.Arnulf is a personality, and his tangents can sometimes distract from the lectures. But, if you pay decent attention and put in the work for the problem sets, you'll learn a lot the important basics about energy and its influence on the environment.",
    "Prof. Gruebler is an energy expert and his course is informative. The course might have run more smoothly if some of the lecture material was reduced slightly such that depth could be prioritized over coverage. In addition, the wording of problem sets could improve - some students wasted a lot of time attempting to figure out the message\/information presented in some of the problem sets from a linguistic perspective.For future students, please note that the ESA is absolutely worth your time, but will require work. However, Prof. Gruebler is a foremost expert in his field and for this reason more than any other is worth taking the course. This is not to say you won't be frustrated by the problem sets or the exam.",
    "This course provided invaluable energy analysis experience.",
    "Question 1: The majority of the readings were out-of-date and irrelevant. There are a number of relevant, constructive potential course readings I would have chosen before those that were actually assigned by the professor.Question 2: The professor failed to focus on a number of key subjects for more than a few minutes, leaving many students more confused than before taking the course.Question 3: Out of class assignments were unusually frustrating and time consuming, often seeming like busy work without true purpose or usefulness. The TAs and the professor were unwilling to actually answer questions regarding these assignments, which was particularly frustrating and seemed to undermine the supposedly \"implied\" learning of the course homework assignments.Question 4: The workload for this course would have been manageable if the TAs had been willing to actually answer questions about the homework, rather than repeatedly telling us to read the homework questions more carefully and think about what they are really asking for.Question 5: The professor consistently gave off an attitude of not caring what students thought of the course, or whether the material aligned with the initial course description or the enrolled students interests.Question 6: The course attempts to cover a LARGE spectrum of material, and ends up not doing this very well. Thus, many subjects were sped through without adequate coverage.Question 7: I was not impressed with the professor. I'd expected better quality and teaching at F&ES.",
    "Regarding question 1 on the readings - there was simply no time to read them. The problem sets were already too much work. This was not a big deal, because we were not evaluated on the optional readings in the final exam.Regarding question 2, Grubler sometimes makes you feel dumb, like somehting is obvious and you should know it.Regarding question 3, the problem sets were helpful up to the first 8 hours or so. After that, and all of them went much longer, we just wanted to get them done and could care less for understanding the results we were coming up with.Regarding question 6, there was a ton of material covered too quickly. But this is not necessarily a complaint. I am not sure how else you go about providing an introductory survey to energy systems without presenting a ton of material very quickly. Grubler's approach to depth is the problem sets.Regarding question 7, Gil was most helpful, though he definitely does not give away any answers. David Parsons seems to have disappeared in the second half of the class.",
    "A well-done introduction to the processes underlying the modern energy system.",
    "Its a lot of material for one semester, and Grubler likes to digress a lot but his digressions are quite illustrative."

    "large amount of information, all well structured. very good learning experience and exposed me to new frontierthe student presentation is interactive and bonus point is good.social events and dinners with guest speakers are great experience for us to have as well.",
    "Great introduction to concepts",
    "The professor and the richness of the lectures. Arnulf is a genius and thinks in systems. Sitting in class and seeing him think is inspiring and richly educational. I loved how analytically rigorous the course was. I will now be able to keep up with energy conversations with specialists because I understand the measurement units, conversions, and language of energy. But way beyond this the lectures gave me a deeply integrated perspective on energy and energy systems, enabling me to spot false arguments and see the linkages between social, economic, and environmental systems and frameworks. This class is a true treasure and was the best taught class I have ever taken. Thank you Arnulf. I would also like to say that the final and the problem sets were very useful. The final was rigorous and fast and required real answers, not soft arguements. The problem sets really gave me great analytical practice. As an anthropology undergraduate I have had enough of soft arguement essay assignments. I learned a lot from these assignments and will apply my learning. I have talked with a couple of energy specialists since this course who have been amazed at the perspectives and understanding I gained from one course.",

    "The free material we received and the free beer sessions.",
    "Grubler is a smart man.The course is very realistic, sometimes depressing if you have a rosy everything-is-going-to-be-ok view of the future. It's a good \"wake-up\" to reality class.",
    "The instructor is very knowledgeable about the subject and challenges the students to think about energy issues by offering contrasting points of view.",
    "Problem assignments. Comprehensive and daunting, but incredibly valuable in elucidating concepts.",
    "I appreciated that Professor Gr\u00fcbler sketched out the overall outlines of how our modern society interacts with energy systems, both on the supply and demand sides. This kind of cohesive view was reinforced with problem sets that required real work and strengthened our understanding of energy interrelationships.",
    "Although the problem sets were time-consuming and challenging, they were very rewarding to complete. After finishing a problem set, I felt as though I had substantially increased both my knowledge and my research skills."

    "PPT design should be more clear and helpful for review.",
    "The problem sets were poorly written, which made it challenging to understand the question being asked. They also asked questions unrelated to anything we had learned in class or read about, which means I felt like a person stumbling around in a dark room. It would have been helpful to provide relevant sources to search for answers and to cover some of the basic components related to the homework in class. As someone with no energy background, I found the lack of explanation frustrating. Some assignments I spent more than 25 hours on and instead of feeling like I understood the material at the end, I merely felt frustrated.It might be worth auditing this class, instead of taking it for a letter grade, as the lectures were interesting, but the homework assignments were stifling.",
    "get a much clearer course slides, and a textbook besides the Energy Primer.",
    "Need to have a greater connect between problem sets and what's being taught in class.",
    "I regret not being involved in a study group for this class. It would be nice if the study group was more formalized to help go over class material.",
    "Slides can be made more clear. It is hard to follow or review because you can only keep certain amount of notes, but not enough to capture the fast pace of the lecture and information.Some homework requires too much work.Would be good to have a easy mid-term to make students to consolidate ideas from the first half of semester.",
    "I wish the homework sets were more concise -- I think more topics could have been covered if material was presented in a more concise way",
    "The class slides need updation and a little more explanation. Also there should be more frequent review sessions for the problem sets.",
    "Often, language in the problem sets was unclear.There should be some review of the problem sets, so we can learn how to fix what we do wrong.",
    "Nothing. Great course.",
    "The classroom we were in this semester was just too small -- that could be improved.There's also a ton of information presented in lectures, much of which wasn't really that critical to main skills and concepts of the class. While perhaps helpful to painting a full context picture, it also meant that sometimes the really important points were harder to distill out.It also would have been helpful to have more TA sessions -- I missed the only one offered to go over the first two problem sets.",
    "It's better to place more grades on the problem sets to release the pressure for the finals. It may be helpful to have a midterm exams or more TA sessions to review the problem sets.",
    "More integration of readings with the lectures and problem sets. More exploration of energy system modeling.",
    "The weight of assignments. Although the assignments were too heavy, but they had only 40% of the grade.",
    "it would be helpful if at least some of the Problem Sets were discussed in class",
    "Homework assignments were unnecessarily difficult\/time consuming. Same material could have been learned more effectively with some additional guidance on the assignments",
    "Perhaps more a little more information (background) about the problem sets prior to assigning them.",
    "With regard to question 10 in particular, I was terribly disappointed in this course. Energy is my careerfocus and I thought this class, the only introductory\/overview course on energy at F&ES, was too broad to adequately convey many of the most important concepts and topics. The professor is not entirely at fault - rather, maybe this course should be divided into several courses with a greater degree of attention to subjects covered.",
    "Relating the assignments to the actual work.",
