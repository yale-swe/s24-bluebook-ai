    "Despite what some majors might tell you, Critical Approaches is not something to dread or get anxious about. Rather, its a course that will probably vastly improve your art history papers, introduce you to many other majors, and still give you the freedom to explore your particular interests within the discipline. All in all a good experience.",
    "This is a fun class in which to learn a wide variety of theories of art history.",
    "A range of topics that are essential to know for the field of art history. Loved this class. Everything you should know if you are interested in art history, but that you wouldn't learn in any other art history class.",
    "I really thought that this class was going to be too flaky and theoretical for my taste, and that I would just deal with taking it since it's required for the major, but I ended up really liking it. Professor Joselit does a very good job teaching it, and I think he was realistic in his approach to the class and presented it really as what it should be, which is to help us realize that there are many ways of looking at art history, some of which we will understand or \"buy into\" more than others, and that this is okay. The only assignments are three papers (2 4-6 pages, one longer research paper), two of which were unlike anything that I had ever been asked to write for an art history class before, and I think they really made me push myself into thinking more critically about how I should approach writing about art history and what questions I should ask. The scope of the papers are broad enough that you can really write about any type of works that interest you, and I can honestly say that they were some of the most enjoyable assignments that I've had to do so far at Yale.",
    "You don't have to be an art history major to take this class. It's looking at art history from a different angle so everyone is more or less new to the subject. You do need to know a little about art though and be comfortable bringing up examples to support whatever you need to say. The readings are great.",
    "Absolutely take this class!",
    "I definitely would. The class is not too much work but gets you thinking about things that have informed an influence each of my other art history classes. Because the papers are so open ended I had the chance to write about extremely interesting topics and that I never would have had the chance to otherwise.",
    "It can get a bit survey-seminar-eyy, but all the information is worth learning and discussing. This is not a course to skimp on the reading. The seminars will be incredibly boring and a waste of time if you dont do all the reading. That said Joselit's use of slides and the museum is a great way to apply the information you've learned right away.",
    "Don't take it if you don't have to.",
    "I would really only take this course if you are an art history major (and need it to fulfill the major), or if you are really really interested in the philosophy of aesthetics or a particular approach to writing history.",
    "Although this course is required for History of Art majors, about a quarter of the class was composed of non-majors (art, humanities, philosophy, renaissance studies). You basically go through and read different art historians to understand the different ways of approaching the field. It sounds dry, but is actually really interesting, especially for someone who was used to seemingly unfounded formal analysis of works of art. Joselit is an amazing professor, very patient and kind. He would stop every half hour or so and say, \"is everyone getting this?\" just to make sure we all understood what was going on. We had 2 short papers (4\u00966 pages), a longer final paper (8\u009612 pages), and a short presentation on one of the authors we read in class."
