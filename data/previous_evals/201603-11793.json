   "comments": [
    "The notes were very good and encompassed the entirety of most chapters, though I felt that they could have been incorporated in ways that were easier to understand for those with no prior experience in economics.",
    "Econ 110 is a very rigorous and fast paced introductory course. Those who have no prior experience with microeconomics should expect to learn a very long list of terms and concepts over a brief span of time. It is very rewarding, but also challenging to say the least. Tolga is a very nice guy, and it's apparent that he wants his students to succeed. However, if you expect to learn everything from the lectures be aware: Tolga spends a disproportionate amount of time on (somewhat) related anecdotes and examples, which sometimes means that he is forced to go over the actual content very hastily.",
    "The information was covered efficiently but towards the end of the year was somewhat rushed due to time constraints. I also thought the problems on the problem sets could have been discussed in greater detail in class.",
    "Strengths: The course builds a strong mathematical basis without being overly confusing, connecting the math to important conceptual considerations.",
    "This course was really wonderful, largely to Tolga being such an amazing teacher. A suggestion for improvement, if feasible, would be using an online forum (like Piazza) for students to ask questions outside of class. A lot of times I would follow along during class, but look over notes later and have lots of questions. Since office hours are largely used to look over P-sets, it would sometimes be difficult to get to Tolga and have my questions answered."

   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who takes an interest in economics and is able to understand the principles outlined in the course. For someone who simply wants to explore the subject and finds difficulty in specific quantitative concepts and often mixes up formulas and terms - do not take this course.",
    "I'd recommend this course in the sense that you definitely will learn a lot very fast. My only disclaimer is that the lectures sometimes are frustrating, and you should expect to spend a lot of time with your nose in the textbook.",
    "I would recommend it. The seminar-format makes it easy to pay attention and learn and the material is presented in a compelling and interesting way.",
    "Yes I would recommend this course to another student because I believe it is essential to have some form of understanding of how the market operates.",
    "Yes, although the class if much more difficult that the lecture class (in particular due to the less generous curve), you do in fact learn certain concepts with a deeper understanding and build a more solid logistical foundation\/approach to economics.",
    "I would only recommend taking ECON110 if you have had prior experience with economics. I had absolutely no exposure to economics before taking this course and it was difficult for me to keep up with topic. Econ110 is a lot of work and though my performance does not reflect this, I was completely engaged in class. Moreover, the curve is far less forgiving than the lecture. If you decide to take ECON110, I would highly recommend taking it with Tolga.",
    "Most definitely take this class. Econ seminar is much better than the lecture (don't let the curve scare you away), and you will absolutely love Tolga from the first day you meet him. You will learn a lot and do so with an amazing professor!"
