   "comments": [
    "You read interesting Japanese texts of increasing difficulty in Japanese and discuss them in English. There are no quizzes, tests or papers. I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to anyone who has the linguistic skills required for it, and who is interested in Japanese literature. Professor Treat isreally interesting to listen to, and your Japanese reading comprehension will get much better.",
    "If you like Japanese I highly recommend this class. John Treat is awesome, and the material you read is awesome. All you do is come to class and translate Japanese works, and your grade is based solely upon the work you do in class. By far one of the most enjoyable and rewarding classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "I would suggest it for getting some familiarity in reading Japanese works in the original but not really as a means of maintaining reading skills to be honest. It also won't give you that much of an introduction to literature of the humanities since the class is more focused on translation. If translation is of interest to you, take the class.",
    "If your Japanese is of the appropriate level or above, take this class. It does require actual effort, but it may also be the most fun you\u0092ll have at Yale. The professor is great, the small class dynamic promotes excellent discussion, and the readings are challenging and interesting. This was possibly my favorite class in my 3.5 years at Yale so far.",
    "The pre-requisite level to take this class is to be in 4th year Japanese, but there will also be students at a level much higher than that. The material gets oriented and adjusted to something that can challenge everyone, which meant for me, (enrolled in 4th year) it was HARD. But in pushing me that far, it did a lot to improve my kanji recognition and especially my ability to use a huge range of reference resources to make sense of advanced literary readings in Japanese. Plus, it made the level of reading involved in my 4th year Japanese language class extraordinarily easy by comparison, giving me a leg up in that class.",
    "It's a course with absolutely no obligations besides preparing the texts you are assigned and coming to class, so it's a bit of a joke. That being said, you need to be at at least the fourth-year or higher level for this class, or the reading will just take you too long - many students had spent a year in Japan, or read Chinese. The problem with the course is that class moves very slowly, taking time to translate sentence by sentence. As a result, I felt like we really hadn't done much by the end of the semester.",
    "Japanese 159 is a laid back translation course that looks at the different resources and research techniques one needs when translating Japanese literature. The class works entirely on in-class participation, so how much you get out of it depends entirely on how much you participate in the conversation. Although there is a general syllabus, there is also some room for students to add texts (songs, plays, etc.) that they are interested in. I would definitely recommend the class to another student."
