    "I thought that it was a fantastic course. I think that students might have benefited from some background in feminist theory. I really enjoyed the synergy of the multi-disciplinary approach and the instructor was extremenly knowledgeable about the subject matter.",
    "Excellent course. Provides a new perspective on a lot of things!",
    "This course was designed to be interdisciplinary, but it was heavily weighted toward law and international relation students. I felt that as a YSPH student, it was hard to get involved. The workload - especially the reading was rather heavy as one of five classes. The topics and themes were interesting, but there was very little time for discussion."

    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0I think that she is absolutely brilliant and the level of discourse was unmatched in my experience so far at Yale.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Really well articulate, and passionate about what the professor teaches.",
    "Instructor: Alice M Miller \u00a0Without a doubt, Professor Miller is one of the most intelligent people I have met, but she has no idea how to teach those who are not experts in her area of interest. This class was not a seminar that facilitated discussion; rather, a lecture in which she never stopped talking. I understand she is an expert and has many things to say, but she is very condescending towards students who try to participate and offer their point of view if their opinion does not align with hers. For example, one day I felt ostracized for being \"straight\" and not \"gay.\" I also felt rather dumb at almost every class. Classes are to LEARN, not to be belittled. I hope she canchange this in the future, because her class has the potential to be amazing."

    "A genius professor who has no idea how to teach law and human rights to those who do not really have a background in these areas. Health is rarely involved in discussion."
