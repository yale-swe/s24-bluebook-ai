   "comments": [
    "I was able to get a great understanding of many different trade theories and their applicability to the world around us by studying econometric papers.",
    "Knolwedge of trade models and trade dynamics in general",
    "I learned how to use models to analyze various trade policies and their effects on welfare. I also learned about recent empirical studies regarding trade and trade policies.",
    "I learned to think (mostly qualitatively) about the various factors can influence a country's decision to use trade protection.",
    "I gained so much from this course. The breadth and depth of material is really quite amazing. We cover everything: basic trade models, all types of policy instruments and their welfare effects, how different market types may change the effects of the policy, the dynamics and strategy of choosing a trade policy, investigation into why we see the policies we see in the world, arguments for and against protection, and background on the WTO and trade disputes. It was almost entirely new information, not at all repetitive of ECON 184, and I think honestly so worth your time.",
    "I developed a deeper knowledge of trade policy and trade restrictions (e.g. the effects of tariffs, quotas, QRs, export subsidies, etc.) beyond the material covered in ECON 184, and I also gained a deeper knowledge of the political economy factors driving trade policy and the models (e.g. Grossman Helpman) to help model them. Since I had not yet taken a course in IO, the exposure to duopolistic and monopolistic market structures as well as game theoretic models of firm entry and exit were interesting as well."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Great engagement and perfect balance of fun and content.",
    "I thought this course was perfectly executed.",
    "The models were presented clearly in class. There were also lots of empirical studies regarding current trade research.",
    "I think the material was inherently interesting, but it could have been presented in much more rigor. I was expecting a course at least at the level of intermediate micro; the entire class complained when we had to check the second order conditions for a single problem, thinking this was too challenging. \"Proofs\" presented in class were very handwavy, and only the most trivial level of math was used. I had hoped to put the material of Econ 184 (international trade) on a stronger mathematical basis, but if anything, the models of this course were presented in even simpler terms. There is enormous room for improvement in this regard.",
    "This course is incredibly well planned and designed, and I think it accomplishes exactly what it is intended to do. It takes a broad swath of relevant material and incorporates it all into a course which, as a whole, gives you a deep and exciting look at trade policy from many angles. I was very impressed with the structure of the class, the breadth of material we were able to cover, and also the individual attention that we were able to pay to each topic. The problem sets are enough to make us consider quantitative implications of things, but not so much to be overwhelming. There is a presentation at the end which is as much of an opportunity to learn as you make it. And the lecture material itself - how it is structured and laid out and put together - I would say is little less than amazing. The professor also produces an amazing set of lecture notes that give you a solid record to fall back on and study from in order to really understand the material. This class is really something quite impressive and absolutely worth spending your semester doing.",
    "Strengths: Low workload and manageable problem sets (especially if you work cooperatively with other members of the seminar), good balance between quantitative and qualitative material, final exam that was straightforward for the most part, lecture notes posted online, an accessible and engaging professor who is always eager to answer questions and go deeper into the material, interesting syllabus and topics covered, relaxed classroom atmosphere. Weaknesses: Not too many. If anything, the final presentation was a bit open ended (and at times a bit confusing in that regard). It also may have been nice to go over a few more papers as well and focus more time on political economy."

   "comments": [
    "Yes phenomenal course with a wonderful teacher",
    "This is a fantastic course. Professor Maggi is extremely caring and flexible, but also very intelligent and knowledgeable. The material is quite interesting as you review the various trade model and apply to current international concerns. Really laid back and interesting course, I would definitely recommend it.",
    "The first few lectures are a review of International Economics. After that, you learn about models focused on trade policy instruments, the politics behind trade policies, empirical studies, etc. Take good notes in class. It will help with psets and studying for the final.",
    "I do not recommend this course--what could be extremely interesting material is presented simplistically, and the course does not attempt to intellectually push students.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Maggi is great to be in class with. He cares very deeply about the material and presents it in a way that clearly shows how excited he is about it. He is also very approachable and friendly, and is always willing to listen to students' ideas. Lectures are very enjoyable. The material itself is also fascinating. It was unfortunate for me that my time was so fractured and strapped this semester (for unrelated reasons), because it meant that I was not able to absorb much of the material very deeply as we learned it. But at the end of the semester before the exam I was finally able to give it the time it deserved, and I am so glad I got that chance to do this. I was amazed by how much we had gone through, how interesting and relevant it all was, and also how well it was laid out and structured. This class is definitely worth your time.",
    "Yes! Professor Maggi is awesome. He's so chill--there were only 8 or 9 of us in the class so he let us choose the date of our final. The material is interesting, it is more policy oriented than Schott's interantional econ so it doesn't get too repetitive although a lot of the frameworks are the same.",
    "I'm actually somewhat surprised at some of the mixed reviews this class has received in the past, as I quite enjoyed this class and may have been one of my favorites this semester. The class is a small lecture format, which for the 400-level is ideal in my opinion. The course goes over trade policy and trade restrictions, and with it's more academic\/theoretical bent and focus on political economy, it's a great follow-up to ECON 184. The problem sets were manageable and of a good level of quantitative rigor, the final was also manageable, and there was a final presentation on a trade policy dispute which, while a bit open ended, was not too much work. Prof. Maggi was a great professor, very accessible and always eager to answer questions or go into the material further. I thought he did a great job of facilitating discussion and engagement with the material and for keeping a relaxed classroom atmosphere. Maliheh, the TF, was also quite helpful as well. Whether you're interested in trade or political economy and want to delve further into them, or you're simply looking for another 400-level Econ course, this is definitely a great choice."
