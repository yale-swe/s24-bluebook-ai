    "I certainly would not recommend this class to a fellow student. Yale and America didn't feel like much of a seminar in that we rarely ever discussed the readings and we rarely ever actually discussed anything. It was mostly the professor lecturing and the more pretentious students interjecting with their thoughts. The material is interesting, definitely and Professor Gitlin is so passionate, but I really did not love this course. We spent time preparing presentations that we never got to because Gitlin does not have a sense of time and preferred to lecture for a good 2 hours. We were also weeks and weeks behind and glazed over some very interesting stuff. Again, not strongly recommended.",
    "Awesome class. Not too much work, but you'll take a lot out of it. You'll also dwell a lot on what Yale means to you, which I think is pretty important. If you get in (big if) TAKE IT.",
    "Absolutely. One of the best courses at Yale.",
    "Absolutely take this class if you can get in. Professor Gitlin is awesome - funny, kind, all round fun. And hey it's learning all about Yale. Best history seminar at Yale.",
    "An interesting class. I enjoyed learning about American history with a \"Yale lens.\" It was like we looked at US history while weaving Yale's involvement through the story (more relevant and interesting than it might seem when you tell a non-Yalie and they give you a blank stare that seems to say hmm how self-indulgent of you)",
    "Professor Gitlin is a gem. He encourages original, creative thinking in his students and inspires his students to work hard. He really exemplified what it means to be a person interested in the history of ideas that uses this enthusiasm to understand the world.",
    "You can choose to write a research paper on whatever about Yale interests you - really an incredible experience.",
    "The content is very interesting and Yale's relationship with and contribution to America is astonishing.",
    "You will never take a class like this at Yale. Preregister if you can, shop it aggressively if you can't. You won't regret it.",
    "An overview of key periods of Yale's history, and the larger trends in America occurring simultaneously. I recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn about Yale's past in order to better understand how the institution we know today formed. I also recommend this course to someone who wants to have a fun time. I do not recommend this course to someone who will treat it as a gut. Doing the work is crucial to getting the most out of the class. By the end of the semester, people who treated it as a gut seemed more disappointed than students who participated actively and kept up with the reading throughout the class.",
    "Don't take this course because of the hype around getting in to the seminar, but rather because you have a genuine interest in Yale history and having a class with a great professor. Yale and America is a mix of Yale history and American history through the lens of Yale people. The reading is not too intense, and the two writing assignments are actually quite interesting. The class can get sidetracked at times, but this is when you get to hear the best stories from Prof. Gitlin. This is an excellent course, especially for seniors, since it will give you an even deeper appreciation for our school."
