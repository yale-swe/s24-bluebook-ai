    "I would definitely recommend this class.",
    "I would recommend this class for someone who already has some knowledge in number theory and can understand some of the motivation for this field of study",
    "A good introduction class to get into the world of analytic number theory. Through out this class, we show the connection between modular form and modular curve and also topological properties of the fundamental domain of the congruence subgroup.",
    "If you don't know or only vaguely know about modular forms, and you're too lazy to study on your own, this is a pretty good course to take. I would recommend this to anyone (in lower years) interested in number theory.",
    "It's an introduction to the basic theory of modular forms in all its aspects. Recommended.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it to other students.",
    "As said above, this course is perfect for anyone with a basic knowledge of algebra, number theory, and analysis who wishes to learn about modular forms."

   "comments": [
    "It gave me an introduction to a key subject in number theory",
    "My interest is combinatorial number theory and analytic number theory whee both have deep connection to modular forms and also require enough understanding of the properties of it and connection to other mathematical objects such as generating function and partitions statistics. Therefore, I believe it helps for my preparation in this area",
    "Yes I guess one of my goal in my research is to obtain some modularity (in some object that I'm studying), so it was definitely a goodbackground for my future research. Even if I don't use it, it's a pretty good thing to know.",
    "Opened up ideas that are of constant value in the rest of mathematics.",
    "Since I am not a number theory specialist, this course does not have a big impact on my own research, but it is certainly very useful to learn about modular forms for background since they come up in many different areas. More importantly, the materialwas interesting and was presented well, which is really all that matters in a course."
