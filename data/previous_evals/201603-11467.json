   "comments": [
    "This class taught me so much about the tools physicists use. I feel very competent in using a variety of methods that I had never heard of before taking this class. The P-Sets were tough, but I got a lot out of all of them and so did my peers. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "This class was really great content wise, covering Lagrangian mechanics, orbital motion, coupled oscillators, and a bunch of other stuff.",
    "This course is a really engaging class that will make you familiar with advanced classical mechanics (Lagrangian formalism, motion in non-inertial frames, 3D rotations, oscillations, etc.). The material was conceptually interesting although the class could use a bit more theory at the beginning (cf. principle of least action)",
    "Takes physics 101 and makes it more interesting (and difficult). Decent math background recommended - does a decent job of tying the math (i.e. linear algebra, complex numbers, calculus of variations) and physics together.",
    "I shopped 410 on a whim because I don't know what I'm doing with my life ha ha ha, and Harris' lecture on the second day, in which we shifted from Newton's laws to the principle of least action, made me re-realize how amazing and beautiful physics is. There's so much out there beyond Newton's laws in classical mechanics, which is clear now and I'm completely humbled for it (especially after that final... ), and to think I would have missed this gem of a class otherwise! This is a class that makes you think, and it's a definite departure from the physics classes of yore in its rigor and theories. I particularly loved the spring networks and the derivation of the wave equation from a string with tiny masses.",
    "I learned about calculus of variations, the Lagrangian method of solving mechanics problems, and other advanced topics (coupled oscillators, moment of inertia viewed as a tensor, non-inertial reference frames) in more depth than an introductory mechanics course would offer. I also gained skills in learning how to do \"practical\" physics: I developed my intuition for choosing convenient coordinates, and I practiced making appropriate approximations to make problems possible to solve.",
    "I come out of it feeling deeply confident about my grasp of the principle of least action, Lagrangian mechanics, non-inertial reference frames, and coupled oscillators. I was uncertain coming out of the 200 intro track but now I am excited to be a physics major.",
    "If you take this course you will learn everything you ever wanted to know about Classical Mechanics! In a good way.",
    "PHYS 410 provided an in depth analysis of classical mechanics. While the problems solved weren't always applicable, the course helped teach some formalism in math techniques and approaches to new concepts and problems that were particularly useful. It also touched on and expanded on older concepts like moment of inertia, coupled oscillators, and lagrangian mechanics.",
    "Lots of practice with Lagrangian mechanics, studied gravitation and trajectories of planets, Euler angles and rotational-related stuff, and complicated oscillations.",
    "I learned about various more advanced topics in classical mechanics and gained an appreciation for the mathematical underpinnings of physics. Professor Harris often made an attempt to point out the commonalities in Physics which tie together disparate theories (e.g. the principle of least action, which plays a key role in both classical and quantum mechanics).",
    "This class primarily taught me the theory and application of lagrangian mechanics, gave me a better appreciation for the powerful concept of potential energy, and gave me my first taste of applications of linear algebra and differential equations.",
    "I learned a lot. I came in with 0 physics knowledge and walked out with a good understanding of mechanics.",
    "I gained a good grasp on the key topics of classical mechanics and was also introduced to aspects of it we did not fully cover. This course helped me gain a better idea of the framework of physics and different levels of abstraction.",
    "I learned intriguing physics I did not know before and learned new mathematical methods for approaching particular differential and matrix equations.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of classical mechanics such as the Euler-Lagrange Equations, and we learned most of the material on the curriculum.",
    "This class covered Lagrangian mechanics, rigid body rotation, orbital motion, harmonic oscillations, non-inertial reference frames and coupled oscillations.",
    "I became much more competent with regards to the mathematical methods associated with physics, and I feel as if I have a fairly solid understanding of intermediate-level classical mechanics.",
    "I learned how to use the Lagrangian technique to solve a wide variety of difficult physics problems and how it can be applied to new situations such as rotating systems and coupled oscillators.",
    "The primary insights I gained from this course were largely those pertaining to mathematical concepts as they related to physics. A recurring theme in the course was the \"general case\", which was a challenging though satisfying departure from the highly specific nature of scenarios used in previous physics classes to depict concepts. I feel that I gained a greater ability to consider how simplifying a problem to as few degrees of freedom as possible greatly eased the challenge of dealing with too many variables at once, which was greatly helpful.",
    "Nothing beyond what was described in the syllabus.",
    "I learned some general techniques used to analyze classical systems.",
    "As someone who took physics 200\/201, this was a great introduction to new concepts. It was the first time I felt like a physics class covered truly novel topics instead of rehashing previous topics in increasing detail. I really enjoyed the Taylor Classical Mechanics textbook, and felt it moved at a good pace."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Perhaps more office hours? Or office hours offered at a variety times? Can't think of anything else I would change at the moment!",
    "This class was very well taught. The material was interesting and organized well, the lectures were easy to follow and well-paced, and the psets corresponded generally very well with what was taught in class. I can't think of any specific weaknesses.",
    "The class offers a really engaging conceptual material. I wish the psets were a bit less math-y and more theoretical. Some of the psets were indeed basically math (e.g. computations, working with complex numbers, etc.).",
    "No significant complaints about the course - Prof. Harris was a clear and engaging lecturer, although some problem set questions weren't that related to the work done in class.",
    "Strengths: having a class where every lecture is enjoyable and presents new-to-me theories in classical mech. Weaknesses: Where were the Hamiltonians?? their appearance was so brief",
    "This course follows the textbook (Taylor's Classical Mechanics) pretty much exactly. Since it's a great textbook, the course was also pretty good. Practice problems were generally good for making sure we understood the concept, and they usually did not involve needlessly long calculations. The few times that we diverged from the textbook, however, explanations were not particularly clear.",
    "This course was very strong. I think both professor Harris's teaching and the organization of the psets demands full engagement from students. Taylor was an excellent textbook. I'm not sure how it could be improved.",
    "The strengths of the course are the way of thinking and new concepts and techniques that it introduces. Jack Harris was an effective teacher and most of his lectures were clear and insightful. The weaknesses were small, but at times the problem sets seemed to be more tedious algebra rather than working on the new concepts. Perhaps a TA problem solving session could have helped in understanding and mastering the material.",
    "Way too much focus on Lagrangian mechanics, especially for students coming out of PHYS 260, which already discusses it. The tool is important and powerful, of course, but we spent half the semester on it. However, the gravitation stuff was really cool. The oscillation derivations in class were tedious and not that enlightening.",
    "The course was very theoretical. While I enjoyed this and felt that it helped me to see physics as something more than \"a set of equations that you plug numbers into,\" I would have appreciated more concrete examples in class. I also felt that the homework was often too short -- I think that many students would have benefited from dong more practice problems in order to internalize the material. I also wish that Hamiltonian Mechanics had been covered.",
    "Some of the weaknesses of this course were in the lectures, which I found to be not particularly engaging or helpful in tackling the problems we were given. Most of my learning came directly from the textbook. Additionally, several problem sets included some mindless busy work which felt like an improper use of time. One strength the course had was that the examinations were balanced and fair compared to the work done in the class.",
    "The course focuses a long period of time on Lagrangian Mechanics. Learning and solving problems on finding functions that minimize functionals gave a good insight into how physics can alternately be formulated. It would be nice to spend more time on Hamiltonian Mechanics as well. Although we briefly mentioned a simple derivation through Lagrangian Mechanics, it would be good to learn it as a separate topic. Since it's a good model for the formulation of quantum mechanics, physics majors would appreciate learning more on it.",
    "It could probably move a bit faster and cover more material.",
    "The course covered a lot of topics in classical mechanics at a higher level than in previous classes which I thought was a real strength. However, I wish that the topics would have been covered in a bit more depth. I was left a little dissatisfied by how little we covered about a topic at times.",
    "The strengths are in the numerous proofs and examples taught in class that help understand the material. However, the problem sets are still pretty difficult to figure out and often take a long time.",
    "The class covers a lot. I think it could be best be improved by having better organization. The material came from two textbooks, one of which was recommend and the other required and sometimes it would be hard to know where to look if you were confused by something in lecture because there wasn't a clear schedule of the material we planned to cover.",
    "Professor Harris was fantastic and the psets were challenging but doable. The tests were somewhat odd; the final in particular didn't really test a lot of things we did in the class. I wish that this class had moved slightly faster so that we could have gotten to some of chapters at the end of Taylor.",
    "The course did a good job of explaining the various techniques that can be used and giving examples of how to apply them successfully. However, the derivations of why these techniques can be used left something to be desired; it seemed like the professor wanted to do more rigorous mathematical proofs but either skipped through some algebra or just stated the results after getting to a certain point, which seemed a little off-putting to me.",
    "Others in the class generally seemed to find it to be challenging though not extremely difficult to manage; however the most significant issue I had with the class was that it was taught under a general assumption that students came from at least PHYS 200\/201, and seemed geared more towards students from that course as well as 260\/261. Coming from the equivalent of 180\/181, the course was extremely difficult and I found myself having to spend as much time on the new concepts as I did on trying to tie them to concepts from 180-level physics. Since the class is a requirement for those on the intensive track for the physics major, I think the jump from 180-level to 410 could be eased by greater availability of office hours (more than one night, greater amount of time between TA office hours and problem set due dates, etc.), since the scheduled office hours conflicted with my lab time for 205 (I was not the only student who had this issue). With those changes, this course would be made more accessible for varied levels of physics backgrounds, and I think would overall be more effective.",
    "The only strength I can think of was the textbook. My other responses describe some of its weaknesses.",
    "I felt this class didn't go very in-depth into the material. Most of the psets could be done with only a cursory understanding of the equations, and so I emerged feeling mostly unchallenged.",
    "I think both the topics and pace at which the class covered them are excellent. My suggestion would be that the TA's hold office hours earlier than the night before the pset, or just additional hours in general, so that there might be an opportunity to discuss the class material or ask conceptual questions rather than pest-specific questions."

    "I would certainly recommend this course to another student! This class taught me so much about the tools physicists use. I feel very competent in using a variety of methods that I had never heard of before taking this class. The P-Sets were tough, but I got a lot out of all of them and so did my peers. 10\/10 would recommend!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course, especially if it is taught by Professor Harris. It's a lot of work at times, but definitely worth it if you want a solid understanding of classical mechanics (and how mechanics fits into the broader scheme of physics as a whole).",
    "Yes, I would. The material is really interesting, it's a must-have in classical mechanics.",
    "Good course to take if you're interested in physics and have the mathematical background. (Disclaimer: I'm not a physics or math major.) Learning about the richness of Lagrangians is fun, but the class can be challenging. Exams are fair (as in, I know that I should know how to do this), but the course is not easy.",
    "I would recommend this course to another student. Physics 410 covers some Lagrangian mechanics, orbital mechanics, mechanics in nonintertial frames, rigid body rotations, and systems of coupled and uncoupled harmonic oscillators. That material corresponds roughly to the portions of John Taylor's Classical Mechanics textbook that are not covered in Physics 260, though neither course covers chaos or delves deeply into Hamiltonian Mechanics. The workload and exams are fair, and Professor Harris is an engaging lecturer. 410 is definitely a good continuation of the 260-261 introductory sequence.",
    "I shopped 410 on a whim because I don't know what I'm doing with my life ha ha ha, and Harris' lecture on the second day, in which we shifted from Newton's laws to the principle of least action, made me re-realize how amazing and beautiful physics is.

This is a class that makes you think, and it's a definite departure from the physics classes of yore in its rigor and theories.",
    "This course is not the most exciting (it's mechanics, after all), but it's solidly taught and you will become more comfortable with various approaches to solving problems in classical mechanics. If you are interested in physics, this course is worth taking.",
    "If you are a physics major, you are almost sure to take this, but if you are deciding between this and PHYS 401, I would definitely take this course. This course provides a good amount of intellectual challenge without becoming to burdensome. Also, if you able to take this with Professor Harris, he does an amazing job of teaching the material so that you feel prepared to do well on problem sets and exams. Overall, it's just a great introduction to a upper-level physics.",
    "If you are a Physics major, take this over 401, it's a much better course. I come out of it feeling deeply confident about my grasp of the principle of least action, Lagrangian mechanics, non-inertial reference frames, and coupled oscillators. Harris is also a great professor and really does and excellent job in lecture. (If you have him, ask him about Celtic music or Old English at some point). 410 is a lot of work so make sure you schedule ~12 hours for each pset and find one or more people who you can work on them with. Psets are 50% of your grade and 90% of how you learn the material so they really count!",
    "This is a good physics class for someone who is interested in physics. Both exams were very fair but required a lot of studying.",
    "I'd recommend this course to Physics majors or people interested in taking multiple physics classes, specifically moving onto PHYS 440 and more. On its own, it seems to be more of a course that prepares you for the next step in a physics education. The course is interesting in the elegance of the concepts, but their applications are not as interesting.",
    "Mechanics is a repeat of introductory physics but with more mathematical rigor. If you feel comfortable with linear algebra, differential equations, and multi variable calculus, this class is a walk in the park. For students with no formal physics background, it would be worth pursuing an introductory text before this course. For everyone, work with other students on problem sets. This is a doable class!",
    "Overall it was a pretty good class - Jack Harris is a great lecturer. The most frustrating thing was the lack of feedback on psets and the midterm: there'd frequently be points taken off without any explanation of why or how to do better the next time",
    "We spent about half the semester on Lagrangian mechanics, so if you did 260, you may be bored at the beginning; however, I think this also has a silver lining because it allows people who haven't looked at Lagrangians before to get good at them. There weren't many PHYS 180\/181 people in our class, but I think it's totally doable if you took that and got really interested in physics. Take it! The problem sets were alright. Except for the one that was out of a different book, the Taylor book could teach you everything you needed to know to get through the homework. The tests were pretty much the difficulty level of the homework, with less tedium, and you could bring in notes (1 single-sided for the midterm, 1 double-sided for the final). Lecture was okay. One day I loved is when we talked about Lagrangian points and the conspiracy theory that there is a planet (\"Nemesis\") exactly opposite Earth, on the other side of the sun. Planning to visit soon. Class will certainly have three-plus people who ask a lot of questions that don't help anyone in the class (you're probably used to it, though). No idea how it compares to 401.",
    "I would recommend Classical Mechanics. I enjoyed this course, and while the subject matter is not the focus of very much research in modern physics, it's still important to understand \"the basics\" before you move on to more advanced subjects.",
    "If you are primarily a math student, this course may be interesting. However, the physics concepts and applications learned in this course are fairly limited, so I would suggest trying one of the other courses offered if you're looking for lots of types of problems.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone who would like to get a good grasp of classical mechanics beyond the Newtonian formulation.",
    "I would recommend it to quantitatively knowledgeable freshmen and sophomores interested in exploring physics as a possible major.",
    "This is a good higher level introduction to classical mechanics. It develops mechanics mathematically and applied the theories to many interesting systems and problems. It is a good class for physics majors.",
    "I would recommend this course. The material is a requirement but still useful for any physics major. The instructor was clear and obviously knowledgeable about the material.",
    "I would recommend the course to someone who's interested in physics, problem solving and math. I have a much better understanding of classical mechanics than I did in intro physics and I'm glad I took the class but it was definitely challenging and you need to put in a lot of work to understand things and then solve the problem set problems. The stuff you'll learn is pretty cool though.",
    "This course is very well taught, and you the content is incredibly interesing. You use the basics of lagrangian mechanics to explore all of the concepts you've learned in intro mechanics and beyond that. The psets and tests can be difficult, but i efinitely recommend taking this over 401.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to any physics major. The techniques learned are incredibly useful to solving a wide variety of problems and the course goes into a good amount of detail towards applying them correctly.",
    "I would recommend this course, for physics majors at least. While it was a fair bit of work and quite challenging at times, Jack Harris was a fantastic professor and brings an awesome perspective to classical mechanics.",
    "I feel generally positive about recommending the course to another student; however, I think that students considering the course should be aware that it would be of great benefit to have previously taken linear algebra and perhaps differential equations as well. While this will not make or break one's success in the course (PHYS 301, when taken concurrently with 410, will help, to some degree, to equip students with a number of mathematical tools), I found that this class was most engaging and most effective when the mathematics served as a clear representation of the underlying physics concepts. However, there were a number of instances where I found myself focusing more on the arduous math than on the \"bigger picture\" concepts that were the primary focus of a given chapter, and this often hindered my ability to fully grasp the material. Overall, it is a very challenging yet highly interesting class, but it will probably be much more enjoyable for those with a solid background in linear algebra and differential equations.",
    "The course is fine, so take it if you must. However, if you're taking it to satisfy personal interest you would be better off just reading the relevant sections from the textbook (Taylor's Classical Mechanics). Nearly everything we did in class was covered more clearly and concisely there. Prof. Harris's lectures were uninspired on a good day and counterfactual on a bad day.",
    "This class was solidly adequate. While I did learn classical mechanics, it wasn't presented in a particularly insightful or challenging way. I wouldn't recommend against taking this class, but don't expect it to revolutionize your understanding of physics.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in learning physics. I took it with Jack Harris, and I really enjoyed his lectures. I would warn that I found it very challenging and time-intensive: I probably should have invested even more time in truly understanding the psets, as that's your window to check your understanding before exams."
