    "It's a great class overall, if you've never had a global health course but are interested. It also isn't difficult if you do the reading. You could probably get through it without doing a lot of the reading, and I did skim a fair amount of it. But it really is worth putting some effort in. The professor and TA were both really into the material and if you have an interest it's a good class.",
    "Interesting information, readings required to do well on quizzes.",
    "This class was fairly easy and lecture slides were put up online so class attendance wasn't that important. You do have to study for each of the quizzes though. The midterm and final have a great format.",
    "This is a great course and I would highly recommend it. Quizzes are mostly based on the lectures, although the readings are very interesting. Professor Panter-Brick is great and tries to listen to what the students want to learn about and changes the lecture topics accordingly. You see the mid-term and final questions beforehand, and have ample time to prepare. It was just a great introduction to global health for me, and is the first course in what I know will be a growing list of global health courses in my Yale career. Professor Panter-Brick includes both theoretical aspects of global health with practical applications, and often discusses her own research (which is amazing!)",
    "Yes a very very easy course, great 5th class. No section, reading is not necessary, quizzes are easy if you just study the slides shes posts online, and the midterm and final essay questions are given to you beforehand. I'm sure they'll probably change the class around if they offer it again though.",
    "It's a good class if you want a survey of global health issues. If you're a realist like me, however, you'll soon find that a lot of the material you are reading are idealistic and impractical recommendations to improve global health. What I most enjoyed about the class was the examples of fieldwork that the professor gave.",
    "It's pretty easy, but the professor isn't the best ever, though. Part of that may simply be the fact that this was her first semester. Overall, it's pretty intersting and teh workload is pretty light.",
    "Take it if you need an extra class that requires zero work. You can basically skip all of the weekly readings and lectures, then just study for an hour before each test and get a good grade. I frequently forgot that I was even taking this class.",
    "This class was insightful, eye-opening, and interesting. I would definitely recommend it to another student. Professor Panter-Brick was great.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone with the slightest interest in global health. It requires minimal work - I barely did any of the readings. But I attended most of the lectures because the topics covered were extremely interesting and there were many great guest lecturers. The professor is amazing, I suggest trying to get to know her. The quizzes and exams are pretty straightforward and easy.",
    "Definitely if you are remotely interested in the field of global health. It is a great overview.",
    "I would recommend this to a student who is interested in global health. I took this class not because of interest in global health but because I needed an anthropology class for the anthropology major. Other people seemed to enjoy it more than I did because they were very interested in global or public health. However, I really was interested in the material and kept up with all the readings. It's nice to learn about something, even if you aren't completely mesmerized by everything being taught. It definitely broadened my perspective and taught me things that I should know to be a citizen of this world.The class was well structured - four quizzes that force you to keep up with the material (20% of final grade), and a midterm and final exam (40% each). So the workload wasn't bad. The lectures were good and Professor Panter-Brick does a good job conveying the material. The TAs were also wonderful.I would recommend this class to someone interested in the material. But for an anthropology major, there are certainly other better classes.",
    "This class is perfect. The best I've taken at Yale.",
    "Though the amount of material we covered was vast, all of our readings and lectures centered on the central theme of global health\u0097that is, an area that aims to improve the health of all human beings equitably. As it\u0092s fairly broad in nature, the class would appeal to anyone interested in medicine, social justice, human rights, international relations, human culture, etc.I wholeheartedly recommend the course and hope to major in Global Health when it\u0092s available\u0097the material is that compelling.",
    "If you want to study medical anthropology, take this class. Initially, it introduces a lot of anthro jargon which can get boring for non-anthro majors but the second half of the class really picks up with real life examples and case studies. Prof Panter-brick has also done some really cool work in Afghanistan and Pakistan and she makes sure to highlight those in her lectures. The coursework is fairly simply, 2 inclass exams and weekly quizzes. The quizzes can be challenging if you don't do the readings but as long as you stay on top of your work, I think you'll do well.",
    "This course is cross-listed under many categories, but it is very much an anthropology course. I feel that the first half of the course was very interesting, and as a potential pre-med\/health professional, it really put into perspective the importance of understanding other cultures in order to effectively treat health outside of the West. However, beware that it is, yes, an anthropology course and thus, it seemed at times to bash the medical profession as one that had almost unsurmountable odds to overcome before it could adequately address global health issues. That said, the course is not very difficult, readings are easy to handle and are actually very interesting for the most part, and the instructor is clearly very impassioned on the issue, and can speak with great experience on the themes you learn in class.",
    "Biocultural Perspectives on Global Health is a class that looks at the global health agenda as well as the ethical, social, cultural, and environmental issues pertaining to global health. It is a lecture but often it is run in a seminar style making it engaging and interactive.",
    "This class in an introduction to global health, or the intersection of biomedicine and medical anthropology. It helps to show why an interdisciplinary approach will be the only long-term effective one, and makes students pause and consider how many effects a single intervention has (often unintended ones). Basically, this class makes you step back and consider your steps more carefully when approaching global health, international research, etc.",
    "Very easy course. Take it if you'll actually put in the time to learn more than some definitions relating to global health. Also, if you're really interested in learning about global health, since it's the only class relating to it for undergrads.",
    "I would recommend it, with qualifications.The course had no work assigned outside of class--only readings, which were rarely referred to in lecture. The quizzes and the midterm& final exams were fair, but there should be better ways to ensure that students do the reading. Instead, most students treated the course with very little attention or respect.I'm not sure if it's the fault of the course, or of the entire discipline of Global Health, but there didn't seem to be any \"core\" of information to take away from it. It could have done with more organization, better prioritized presentations (clearer statements, supported by examples, etc.), instead of the powerpoint slides that were often redundant.Nonetheless, I did learn a great deal--or I'm at least impressed with how hard it is to practice global health\/public health\/medical anthropology. Prof. Panter-Brick certainly gave us a new perspective, and everyone could benefit from it.",
    "I would definetly recommend the course for any student interested in Global Health or wants to learn about the rising concerns related to it.",
    "This was a pretty good, interesting course. Catherine Panter-Brick was very cool, and her photo-metaphors are especially amusing (you'll see what I mean if you take the course). There was a bit of a disorganization problem this year due to it being the first year (and also because they had to switch it from a seminar to lecture format due to the unexpectedly large number of students that wanted to take it), but I have no doubt that this problem will be solved by next year. The quizzes and exams were very fair, and I found this course to be very manageable in terms of workload. If you're looking for a goodintroductory course to the issues surrounding medical anthropology\/global health\/etc., take this course!",
    "Yes, if you like wishy washy material and interesting world topics.",
    "No- not very insightful. Just regurgitating facts, no original thought necessary for this class.",
    "Though admittedly you can get by the class without reading much (or at all, really) the readings are sometimes interesting, though sometimes excessive and repetitive. I look back and I can't say what I learned from the class really needed an entire semester. The teacher was disorganized and though she tries, it is not a very engaging of a class. That being said, I did learn to look at global health in an entirely new light, which obviously the point of the class, but the concepts often seemed vague i.e. we understand the problems but we don't really learn what to do about them. Only if you're really interested in global health would i recommend it, but i'm sure a more comprehensive class can be found elsewhere.",
    "This was only the first year of the course; hopefully they will improve it next year. The problems were all issues that come with a new course: lack of organization\/coherency, lack of thoughtful discussion (there were no discussion sections), etc. The first half of the course was useful and interesting though, butmidway through the course everything fell apart and no one found it worthwhile to come to class. That being said, Professor Panter-Brick is amazing though - she is incredibly nice to her students and her research in Afghanistan was very thought-provoking. I'm sure she will make this class even better in the future.",
    "yes, it is an important topic and you do learn the major themes of global health without too demanding of course work.",
    "ANTH 257 is an overview of all the components of global health. It is a great introduction to the field of global health from an anthropological perspective. I would definitely recommend this course -- the readings and lectures are really interesting and Professor Panter-Brick is great and has lots of experience!",
    "An interesting course, though sometimes frustratingly idealistic. Not particularly well organized. You really don't needto do any of the course readings to succeed in the class, but be warned that the exams are graded harshly.",
    "The concepts from this class are very interesting and the workload is not too bad. However, it is easy to become disengaged in the course because of its loose structure. If this happens to you, you will find yourself scrambling through the readings to prepare for the quizzes (4 total), the midterm, and the final. Overall a cool course but again, easy to become disengaged.",
    "I would recommend this class if you are really interested in doing the readings. The lectures are pretty straightforward and the tests are pretty much from the lectures, so it's not necessarily a really difficult class. The first half of the class is really good. The second half of the class was pretty boring.",
    "Global Health in a nutshell",
    "Definitely take it! especially if you are interested in global health",
    "I highly recommend this class, so interesting and important. Not very much work.",
    "I would take it if you are in any way interested in Global Health. This class does a good job of introducing you to some of the major issues in the field. It is not a big time commitment and all of the readings are fascinating. Grading is generous too.",
    "Take it if you are interested in global health, but if you aren't, I wouldn't recommend it.",
    "Excellent course! No matter what your future career plans are, take this. It will make you a better human being. I honestly felt that attending lectures or doing readings for this course were often the most meaningful parts of my day. Professor Panter-Brick is a great teacher and really dedicated. The workload is very manageable. Of course, the more you put into the course, the more you will get out of it, but if you're having a difficult week with other courses, you can postpone work on this course and will be fine.",
    "This was a new class this year, so the syllabus and many points of the class are probably going to fluctuate a lot.The class is taught much like a practical how-to in conducting global health research, designing gh policies, and understanding gh research and issues, with a VERY heavy anthropology bias. The class, and the field of medical anthropology in general, is not especially kind to Western medicine, and often unfairly points out its flaws without giving due attention to its benefits. The class also frames every global health issue in terms of an anthropological viewpoint. While this is not the full picture of global health, it is a fascinating one, and one which you could learn no better than from Prof. Panter-Brick, who is a real expert in the field.The class was a little bit disorganized this year (syllabus changed a number of times), but overall the reading load was pretty light and usually easy, and the questions on the midterm and final (each 1 hr 15, each 40% of the grade) were given beforehand and the 4 quizzes were graded generously. Overall a good and interesting 5th class.",
    "Great class, that is fairly easy if you do the readings which are relatively short. No prior knowledge of global health is required, and the professor is great."
