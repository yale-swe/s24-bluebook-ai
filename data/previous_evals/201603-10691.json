   "comments": [
    "The most important thing I learned in English 114 was the importance of organization. In high school, our papers were never long enough to need a creative organization, just an introduction, 3 paragraphs and conclusion. In this class, we brainstormed and talked about many ways to organize a paper that actually enhance your thesis. This is the most important knowledge that I developed in the course, although because it's a writing class, I learned many more writing skills as well.",
    "Dr. Hopper structured the class in a way that let us make the most of the writing assignments. She gave us plenty of time to draft and make revisions. Most importantly, she gave succinct, pointed, and practical feedback. I'm going to take the lessons learned in this class and apply it to every writing assignment for the rest of my Yale career",
    "I believe that taking ENGL 114 under Dr. Hopper improved my writing skills exponentially. Things that I knew I learned better, things that I thought I knew I learned, and things that I wouldn't think about in terms of writing I learned. I also feel that I have better adapted to providing and responding to constructive criticism.",
    "I definitely learnt to write better!",
    "I gained a much more thorough understanding of how to structure an articulate academic argument and plan to apply what I learned in this course to writing assessments in all of my future courses.",
    "This class gave me a clear set of guidelines for writing effective academic essays. Among those guidelines were those concerning how to formulate a proper thesis, how to go about selecting and integrate evidence\" into an academic argument and how to articulate analysis effectively. The course also covers other aspects of the academic essay, such as structure and transition, and touches upon many other, less basic principles.",
    "I look at religion in a different way after taking this class.",
    "I definitely learned to write both short and long academic essays!! Very valuable.",
    "This class was really helpful to developing my confidence and skills with writing for college, especially for research papers.",
    "I became a better writer. I learned how to portray my ideas more clearly and concisely. I also learned a great deal about how we view and study religion in this incredibly diverse country.",
    "I learned a lot about structuring and writing papers that I will use for the rest of my academic career. I also became more skilled in researching for a topic and dissecting sources to find better support for my argument."

   "comments": [
    "Honestly, I can't think of any weaknesses. The course was great. The class size gave us all opportunities to have our thoughts heard and get to know each other. The set-up of the class into three gradually longer papers eased us in to college writing. The workshops built in to the class gave us feedback from our peers, as well as our professors. They also helped us learn what worked and didn't work in an essay by reading other people's. We talked about all of the basics of good writing in class, so we weren't just expected to know things that we didn't know. It's a good introductory course.",
    "On the last assignment, we were only given a week to make a 7-9 page draft, and the rest of the assigned time was for revision. If the two were split equally, I would've felt more comfortable revising my paper with a clear thesis in mind rather than scrambling with possibly a new thesis, draft, and revision.",
    "This course was the best of my first semester at Yale. Dr. Hopper brought so many interesting readings and concepts to class and we had such wonderful class discussions that always left me feeling happy after class. I really appreciated Dr. Hopper's feedback on my work and it was usually provided in a promptly manner.",
    "It is a wonderful class taught very creatively by the professor. It would be great if we can have more exposure to other minority religions such as Buddhism, and talk about religion and immigration.",
    "I decided to take this course because I wanted to have a firm foundation in writing academic essays as I advanced in my future studies. I expected (and would have preferred there be) more direct instruction on many of the aspects of successful academic writing; this is not to say that there was no direct instruction--my professor did take time to lecture the class on style and form--but there were also more classes in which the style of the class was less focused on our writing and more focused on student discussion, which, while enjoyable, seemed a bit unproductive given the courses objective. That said, I feel like Ive left the class with a sound understanding of academic essays and the aspects that make one successful. The courses structure certainly facilitates improvement, as almost all assignments have at least one draft and provide ample time for revision. While sometimes mundane, the material certainly has changed the manner in which I write common college papers.",
    "Honestly don't see any weaknesses. It was organized, smooth, and every class was interesting, informative, and fun to participate in.",
    "This class is amazing! Dr. Hopper is a wonderful professor, who really gives attention to each student and is very open to questions and knowledgeable about the writing process. The small class size was also very beneficial, and formed a community within the class.",
    "I liked the diversity of readings we did throughout the year. I also liked the freedom we received in units 2-4, where we were free to explore topics that interested us. I wish we were able to do more short writing exercises in class.",
    "The course has a good balance of reading and writing, as it goes over how to understand academic sources better to create an arguable and debatable thesis. The topic of religion in America allowed for great discussion and many different resources."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. English 114 is a great introduction to college writing, so I think all freshmen should take it. Furthermore, Professor Hopper is such a good professor that I would recommend this section to anyone, regardless of their level of interest in religious studies.",
    "Yes, I would. This class gives you the tools to make clear and easily-understood academic arguments. That is a skill that will go further than the collegiate level of writing.",
    "Absolutely. If you get in, take this class. If you don't get in, put your name on the waitlist and try to get in. If you are interested in the study of religion in America from an historical, sociological, and literary perspective, this is your class. You will learn so much from Dr. Hopper in terms of both material and your writing abilities. Make sure you get to know your classmates as well, as it will make class very enjoyable and more beneficial for you and them.",
    "Yes I would recommend it because the professor is just wonderful! Definitely take it if you are interested in religion or want to know an amazing professor!",
    "Take this course if youre looking to establish an applicable foundation of principles for good academic writing. The structure of the course really does a good job of facilitating improvement over the course of the semester. I enjoyed my section, which consisted of a conversational group of underclassmen and often entertained interesting discussions of Religion in America (mostly discussions of religious identity and religious plurality). Just know that this course is primarily focused on learning how to write pretty boxy, unvarying academic analytical arguments, so you should only take this course if this is a skill you want to and are willing to learn.",
    "Yes of course. This was my most interesting class this semester.",
    "Yes!",
    "Yes! Take this course -- the discussions are really interesting and relevant, and Dr. Hopper is an excellent professor.",
    "This class is an excellent way to improve your writing. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is an enjoyable class that will help you improve in all of your classes due to the importance of its lessons while also allowing you to explore religion in a new way."
