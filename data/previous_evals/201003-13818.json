   "question_id": "AC350",
   "question_text": "Were the resources available to you - library, fabrication labs, classroom, software, desk space, etc. adequate for the fulfillment of the assigned work?  If not, please make suggestions.",
   "comments": [
    "Yes all the resources were adequate",
    "Yes.",
    "During midterms, when everyone was immersed in the fabrication lab, it was difficult to produce output with 17 people (+ every other student) fighting for time on the equipment. I don't know how adjusting this is possible or even feasible given what seem to be very fair guidelines for time on the machines.",
    "The resources were available. We did a lot of work in the shop and the shop staff was very helpful when we needed their assistance.",
    "Yes.",
    "There was a decided hindrance when it came to monetary matters (the appropriation and payment\/reimbursement of materials), as we were severely limited in reimbursable amounts when compared to other fabrication-based seminars. In my own experience, this limitation definitely impacted my choice of materials (cheaper the better), ultimately affecting my final fabricated pieces in quality. A greater commitment from the school in the future might ensure such compromises could be avoided.",
    "The mill breaking at the end of the semester caused problems for the final review, but I dont think it greatly affected the effectiveness of the course. There should be at least a textbook explaining the programs we are supposed to be learning since John seems to just recite existing online tutorials.",
    "no. Machines break down too frequently.",
    "This is one of the greatest things about Yale, and particularly for this course.The resources are always there. A perfect 10 in this category.",
    "The large mill was down for quite a while this semester, other then that the resources were very adequate.",
    "Resources are never a problem.",
    "Resources were more than adequate, although as mentioned above, because the design of the major projects was emphasized over the method\/exploration\/etc. they ended up being quite costly (financially) and quite time consuming for the students. More costly and time consuming than might be expected for a 3 credit course.",
    "Tim and Josh were helpful in the shop and helped our class enormously. As mentioned in the TA evaluation, Tim, Josh, and James had to work very hard to keep up with the demands of our class (explaining how to use certain machines, troubleshooting malfunctioning machines, talking to us to figure out the best approach to fabricate something, etc.)Also, requiring everyone to use the large CNC mill in a limited time frame for the first project made scheduling time difficult. Because everyone was a first time CNC mill user, everything took longer than expected and as a class we each found it very difficult to get the necessary time block to complete our projects.",
    "Classroom:I think the SB computer lab would have been a more effective location for our classes, since not everyone had a working computer during class in the 6th floor lab, James never had one to work at, and half the class had their backs to the screen John was teaching from.Shop monitors\/faculty\/hours:This is minor but significant for those of us who are new to the school during this course. We were never truly aware of who the shop monitors were and what their scheduled hours were, and the same was true for the full-time shop faculty (Josh, Taylor, Tim). Leading up to major project deadlines we were frantically trying to seek advice from the latter in particular, and it took us a long time to figure out they did not work weekends like the rest of us. As for monitors \u0096 there were print outs here and there with faces and emails but those never seemed to be the same faces we would see sitting in the chair outside the shop office. If there was a posted schedule I never found it.Assigments:I think the 2 major assignments for the course need to be re-considered. Though well-intentioned, the first assignment ended up being way too time-consuming and frustrating because of the ambitions of the task. As a result it took a lot of time away from studio right before our mid-term reviews. Even when someone would map out a manageable project to execute, my feeling is they were urged to go outside their comfort zone by adding levels of complexity, and in the end we weren\u0092t all able to finish.Instead, I would have preferred a series of manageable fabrication tasks done in pairs every 2 weeks, such that we could gain exposure to things like casting, finishing, welding etc that we simply didn\u0092t have time for if our design only included using the small mill and the water-jet. Those of us who tried to incorporate too many different processes into our designs were inundated with road-blocks towards the end and were not successful in any of them.My suggestion would be smaller tasks, more of them.Shop equipment:One team was not able to complete their final project because the mills were down the last week of classes. On a related note we were told that a medium mill had arrived at the beginning of the semester and by the end it was still not up and running. We were told the same about a new vacuum former that we never saw.I hope this new equipment will be up and running soon, I\u0092d be anxious to use them.Reimbursement:I\u0092m not sure why this is the case, but this course only provided a $50 reimbursement for materials, where 2 of my other electives (non-fabrication) provided $100 each. It seems to me that a course like this with a focus on fabrication should be allotted a higher reimbursement per student.",
