   "comments": [
    "This course is great for learning techniques you need in actual bio labs.I would recommend this course because the emphasis is on learning and not getting the answers right (e.g., even if you did something wrong, as long as you recognize it, know how to fix it in future experiments, and can explain your results, that's all they care about).",
    "if you need it for premed take it.",
    "I had a great TA, so my judgement of the course is probably biased, but it was way better than chem lab. I think they've made changes from the lab in the past, and they are much improved. It's still lab though, and still as much work as my full-credit classes, if not more. You also get to play with fish.",
    "I would recommend it. the fly lab was the only bad part and that was largely because i don't have any background in genetics. other than that everything was well explained and easy to follow and interesting",
    "Yes! You're going to pull all nighters every night before a report is due, which will make you hate the lab short term. Big picture though, you'll learn a ton, especially if you haven't taken AP bio. Maria is marvelous as well. BE SURE to ask for her recommendations for what labs to take next if you are either premed or a biology major. Hell, she even knows the chemistry course requirements. Seriously, her advice is so much better than anything you will get from a rando advisor or UCS. Take the lab, and then get to know Maria.",
    "I would. I'd summarize it as a solid background to learn how a lab functions",
    "Definitely take it if you want to take an intro bio lab. Interesting and challenging, but worth it!",
    "The labs themselves are super cool (i thought so anyway) but the lab reports are very tedious and time consuming. They are good practice though I guess..",
    "Basic bio lab technique overview. Take it if you must for credit or your major or because you're premed. It's not the most enjoyable though.",
    "This class was great! I love the fact that it was based more on teaching and less on grading. It teaches invaluable research techniques and gives a hands-on opportunity to perform experiments that were groundbreaking. I actually loved this class! Some may complain about the length of the lab write-ups but they really aren't that bad. Even if you aren't interested in biology or the sciences, this class is still valuable.",
    "Only take it if you ABSOLUTELY have to.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student unless they needed to fulfill a bio lab requirement.",
    "It's a course I wouldn't have taken if I wasn't required to, but that being said the relaxed atmosphere really helped me enjoy it (but depends on the TA and the class).",
    "4 hour lab once a week, with lab reports due for about 2\/3 of the labs. The reports are quite long (the shortest one I submitted was 6 pages and the longest, 12). They take a long time to complete, but thankfully there aren't reports due for each lab.",
    "Yes, it was a lot of fun for a lab course.",
    "A typical introductory lab at Yale--lots of work, often tedious, for just a half credit. That being said, the experiments were interesting, for the most part, and I did learn how to write a biology lab report and how to perform many techniques in the lab that I didn't know beforehand.",
    "Lots of work but is manageable if a good TA is obtained.",
    "If you like to learn about model organisms and development of bacteria and animals, this is your class.",
    "it's definitely a lot of work but you learn a lot. the labs are long and kind of difficult but you will come out with a much better understanding of how to write a good lab report.",
    "Absolutely not. Okay, Dr. Moreno is very sweet, and a few of the labs are enjoyable-you often get out early, but NO. Don't even consider it. The amount of time you spend out of the classroom writing up crappy 10 page reports that take HOURS is not worth it. I didn't even learn that much about techniques or using microscopes. There are MUCH better labs out there that are both educational and will not suck the life out of you.",
    "Really interesting labs, and prof Moreno is intent on helping you discover what working in a research lab would be like. I think this is a great intro lab course and would recommend it to freshmen. I believe I would have found it easier to get into lab research more easilyif I had taken this class freshman year.The lab reports are a little tedious. But they're a good exercise in time management and you get better with time.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this class to other students for a pretty easy good grade.",
    "YES LOVED THIS LAB SO AWESOME.",
    "This class is a great introductory lab course. It teaches you a lot, but know that you will have to put in the time and effort in lab and on the lab write-ups to really learn. This class is time consuming but you should definitely take it if you want to learn more about biological research.",
    "Take it! Easy, fun and not that heavy of a workload. This lab has it all",
    "Intro bio lab. Go over all the basic techniques and model organisms that may be utilized in a lab at yale. Good for ppl who haven't had experience in bio labs and would like to find a type of research lab that would help them best.LONG ASS TIME to do the lab reports. Grading arbitrary at times. Make sure you understand what your TA wants asap b\/c no curve.",
    "It was essentially a basic lab to teach us all about organisms used in bio research.",
    "Not too much work, best science lab i've taken. Not too time consuming.",
    "MCDB121La is a pretty good introductory lab course to be taken with BIOL 101\/102. It helps expose you to lab technique and how to write a lab report. However, it wasn't the most enthralling lab course ever and the lab reports did take a long time. If you need a lab credit for bio though, I would recommend it.",
    "General intro bio lab, lab reports are tedious and take a while to write up.",
    "Experiments are cool. However, I never knew what I did wrong on my reports. There were no comments, but the results were different.",
    "A great intro lab. Don't underestimate the amount of work it will take ( a lot) but it's definitely worth taking. Take with Maria Moreno if you can.",
    "MCDB 121L is a very heavy lab to take, but it is still a very good course. If a student takes this class, he or she must be prepared to spend a lot of time working in the lab and many, many hours on reports outside the lab. Though this course requires a lot of time, the skills acquired in terms of writing detailed lab reports, using lab equipment, and learning the course material in depth is invaluable.I would certainly recommend this course to another student, especially those interested in biology and chemistry. This course will give students a strong foundation for building up the skills they need later on.",
    "This class is a lot of work. The lab reports took a very very long time to complete",
    "This class is an overview of important subjects in biology. The labs were sometimes difficult and confusing and writing the lab reports was very time consuming.",
    "This lab is good at helping you understand material from lecture better so taking it at the same time as the class is helpful. It also helps you understand what research is all about. However, this lab is incredibly time consuming.",
    "I would recommend this as a good introductory bio lab. You get to work with a lot of model organisms. The lab reports take a significant amount of time to write so I would not recommend starting them late.",
    "Weekly experiments. You usually work with a lab partner and must keep individual lab notebooks. The notebooks are collected twice during the semester. There are lab reports, but they are not due every week. Weekly online quizzes before lab. The final is not difficult at all.",
    "I recommend this class for someone who needs to figure out how lab works at Yale.",
    "Strengths: labs were interesting - often the experiment replicated part of an important experiment, which was very satisfyingWeaknesses: lab reports are boring and often graded harshly",
    "A basic introductory biology course focusing on various models for biological processes such as the fly, drosophila melanogaster, the worm, c. elegans, and E. Coli. I would recommend this course if you are taking the biological introductory series and you want to get a more hands on view of the knowledge taught in those courses. It is definitely a lot of work. The weekly reports often take between 8 pages and 12 pages single spaced (with tables and graphics throughout so not all text). All of it feels like busy work because it is not especially difficult but just very time consuming. So if you're going to take this, be prepared to work, but also do a little bit of the labs at a time- unless you want to be staying up a looooong time the night before they're due."
