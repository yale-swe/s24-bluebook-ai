    "Exploring travel writing and developing an interest in it are major motivators to take the course. Helps improve your writing. Recommend it.",
    "121 with Colleen Kinder was a journey in itself. We took it with her the first semester it was offered, and as such the syllabus was always in flux (helped along by a icy little storm named Nemo). Professor Kinder (affectionately Colleen in emails on which she was not CC'd) was always tweaking the class to make it better, and in doing so added a bit of stress to our schedules. It was tough keeping all the emails, texts, and schedule sheets together to know when the next essay was due, what the word limit was, and what the next reading would be.The class had six units, each one with its own essay, writing, or pitch, along with another exercise. When we landed on tough times, we could opt out of a unit, which provided some much needed respite in the heat of midterm period.We learned a lot about the life of a freelance author. We wrote pitches for pieces and eventually submitted our work to actual established journals (still waiting to hear back if mine made the cut). We heard from some amazing authors and learned about their processes. It was an interesting excursion into a world I have no desire to enter, but am still curious about.All things considered, the class was an unnecessary burden on my already packed schedule, and turned out to be quite comparable to 120, even without the extra essay. Next time around, I would C\/D\/F it, and not make it my fifth class.",
    "Take it. You wouldn't believe all the journeys you've taken in your life without even realizing it, and you'll write about a bunch of them. Professor Kinder will give you excellent readings and great advice... take this it you want to see a major development of your style and voice within a single semester.",
    "Excellent readings, a cool topic. Definitely worthwhile but as with most writing courses your enjoyment\/satisfaction is a product of what you put into it.",
    "Overall it was a fascinating course that made me improve as a writer. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in travel writing. It is a lot or reading and writing on a particular niche, one that I love, but you should make sure you love it too before committing to immerse yourself in it for the entire semester.",
    "Weekly essays are tough, but she said she might be changing that. If you want specific guidance on how to best improve your writing, this might not be the course to take. However, the subject matter is very intriguing, and you'll probably leave the class with a different perspective on traveling.",
    "If you like creative travel writing t you should take it, because that's exactly what you get to do: creative travel writing.Class discussion wasn't nearly as compelling as it is in other Yale courses (mainly because your talking about travel essays rather than great works of literature or global issues) but the in-class writing assignments are fun and creative.Prof. Kinder went out of her way to bring Pico Iyer to talk to our class which was a highlight and she meets with you personally after every assignment to talk about your work and how you can edit it. She's very nice and passionate about the class.The readings didn't seem to help my writing very much and sometimes I wasn't too compelled to do them. You can get by without reading and if you choose to do them they're pretty short, which is why I said the workload is less than most Yale classes. If you care about your writing though, the assignments can take a while.",
    "Take this course. Every assignment is enjoyable, and unlike anything you've ever written before. It makes you feel simultaneously professional and entirely naive. The readings are certainly on a spectrum in quality, but most are bunched up at the badass end of it. On one occasion I was stopping every three sentences and simply laughing about how well-written an essay was. You will fall back in love with travel, creativity, and the complexity of the world (and moving through it). Warning: You might come out of this class with a completely revised prospective career path.",
    "This course was a pretty solid introduction to the field of travel writing. Professor Kinder, herself a distinguished travel writer, did a great job of structuring the course and was able to use her own personal connections to bring in famous travel writers such as Pico Iyer to speak to the class. However, the workload for this course was entirely unreasonable. This may just be because it was the first time the class was being taught, but the amount of nightly reading we were assigned, in addition to having some sort of assignment (whether an \"exercise,\" adraft, or a final paper) due virtually every week, made the class extremely burdensome to keep up with. Most students ended up having to skip portions of the daily readings, which at times made class discussion less than fruitful, but there was a mutual acknowledgement among us that there was no way that we could have read everything and still kept up with the writing workload. Furthermore, if you do end up taking this class, be prepared to deal with grading that is unpredictable at best. Professor Kinder always seemed somewhat absentminded when reading papers, and the way she only left pencil markings, rather than written comments, on our drafts was frustrating without fail. While we did have one-on-one conferences before submitting the final draft, it was difficult to look at her scribbles the night before a paper was due and try to guess what she was trying to say about a particular word or phrase. In all, it was extremely difficult to guess what kind of grade you would receive on a paper, and I left with the impression that if she had read my papers on a different day or in a different mood, or if she had read them a 2nd or 3rd time, she might have graded differently--which is not something you want out of an English professor. I would recommend this class only if you have a vested interest in writing about travel experiences.",
    "Travel writing is an excellent excellent course, for a variety of reasons: the reading material, the discussions, the assignments, and the professor. You don't just learn about improving your writing, but also travel writing as a profession, and the cultures and traditions of places around the world."
