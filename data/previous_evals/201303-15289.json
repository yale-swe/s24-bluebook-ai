    "Best biology class I've taken by far. The seminar style of teaching science is fantastic, especially if you have a genius professor like Craig Crews. This guy knows something about everything and everything about some things. Reading papers and then discussing methods and critiquing them with him taught me more than any lecture class ever could about the actual work of being a scientist. The class is also not a lot of work--just two papers a week, a presentation, and a grant proposal at the end. The grant proposal was a beast of a thing, but slay it over Thanksgiving break and you'll be golden. Take it for the quality time with Prof Crews if nothing else.",
    "I would definitely recommend MCDB 482 to a senior who is looking to take an upper level seminar. It's not easy -- the grant will take a while so START EARLY -- but it's rewarding. I definitely feel that my ability to interpret research has way improved, and Professor Crews is a wonderful and supportive teacher.",
    "You have to take this class. It's a lot of work, but Crews is one of the best instructors I've had at Yale.",
    "This seminar was, without question, one of the most important classes I have taken at Yale. On paper, it seems simple: read a few papers every week, do a presentation, andwrite a final paper. In reality, the class is so much more. Professor Crews's knowledge of the field is unparalleled. While at times this can be extremely overwhelming, his dedication to his students is always evident. That being said, the first few weeks of the course were extremely intimidating. You truly have to understand each and every word of the papers presented inside and out. What's more, Professor Crews loves to rapidly dart from topic to topic, such that a substantial science background is all but necessary (and it helps to quickly be able to recall information from many aspects of cell biology). However, this is a class where the ends justify any stress during the semester. You will walk away unbelievably comfortable with not only several key canonical signaling pathways, but with reading any scientific manuscript thrown your way. Professor Crews was not kidding when he asserted this in the beginning of the semester. The assignments are also extremely worthwhile. The presentation is eye-opening at just how difficult consolidating and presenting scientific research can be, especially about broad pathways with decades of research. The grant presentation is a GAUNTLET. Never will you be so overwhelmed and simultaneously enthralled by an assignment. You'll come away feeling like a mini-expert in one small corner of the scientific community. This assignment also allows for an exciting and refreshing bit of creativity, something the MCDB major is vastly devoid of. Overall, if you're considering taking this course, take it. It should be mandatory for junior\/senior biology majors. It will help you bridge the gap between textbook\/classroom to tangible discovery and research. Only take this class, however, when you feel truly comfortable with your biology background. The class calls upon knowledge from many areas at the drop of a hat. Also, you will need so much time for the grant proposal. I cannot stress this enough. It is a beast.",
    "If you have the opportunity, absolutely take this class. Prof. Crews is an amazing seminar leader who succeeds in making each classroom discussion engaging and exciting. Papers are new and explore interesting areas of cell biology (unlike Landmark Papers).One of the best classes I have taken at Yale.",
    "This is an amazing class, I strongly urge anyone interested in cellular and molecular biology to take it. You will develop skills in reading and writing that you don't in larger biology classes. The material is fascinating, the workload is not too big. Prof Crews is a great teacher and super interesting."
