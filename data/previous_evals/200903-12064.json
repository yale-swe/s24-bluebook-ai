    "This was a great seminar--every topic was uniformly interesting and provocative, and there was almost always (civil) disagreement within the class, so we had some great discussions. You spend a lot of time working on your final paper, but you get to pick the topic yourself, so a lot of the reading\/research you do for the paper doesn't feel like work. I'd recommend this course to anyone with an interest in 20th century American culture and\/or the law.",
    "Excellent overview of the history\/analysis of censorship. Highly recommended.",
    "This was a very good class. I liked the variety: some sections were devoted to the readings for the week, whereas others were devoted to a \"workshop-style\" discussion about our research papers (and some even included field trips to the manuscripts archives, etc.). It was very rewarding to focus on one substantial research paper over the course of a whole semester. Sometimes the readings were not discussed much in class, which could be frustrating, but usually they were. The syllabus has a bit of a liberal bent -- obviously, a class about censorship at Yale will have that, but it would have been interesting to read a few more perspectives from the other side. At the end, I would have liked to have had a better broader view of the trajectory of censorship in America. But overall, I really enjoyed the class, and would recommend it to someone else interested in American culture. Professor Silverman is great -- very endearing, kind, and devoted to his students.",
    "This class is great. Professor Silverman is a wonderful professor who really pushes you and is also very helpful. The books are interesting and you will really engage with the topics and question your own ideas on free speech. This is a great scholarly seminar, one that will push you but is also manageable. take it if you are interested in censorship, free speech, religion, or sex education.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone interested in censorship, but keep in mind that it will be a very challenging course.",
    "It's a lot of work, but the individual research is very interesting and rewarding. If you can keep up on the massive amounts of reading each week, you'll get a lot out of this class.",
    "I would recommend this class. The subject is interesting as are the readings, and since it is an American Studies class discussion is going to be good."
