    "A lot of practical knowledge about central banking, federal reserve, etc. Prof. English is very approachable and highly qualified. He brought his years long experience at the Fed to the class and invited high profile speakers",
    "Learned a lot about central banking. Gave me insights into how central banks influence the economy.",
    "In this course, I learned about the goals and functions of central banks, central bank history, and the tools available to central banks to influence the economy. The course mainly focuses on the Federal Reserve and its goals\/functions\/tools."

   "comments": [
    "It was great. Ideally more structure to engage students with the lecture material more consistently throughout the semester.",
    "This class definitely teaches a ton of fascinating stuff, and English is honestly incredible. That said, the lectures can drag a little because they arent participatory - the in class exercises are, however, really engaging and interesting.",
    "The course material is presented in a very straightforward and easy-to-understand manner. The number of assignments for the course (problem sets, papers, case studies, and discussion exercises) were engaging and interesting. The course can be improved by changing to the way in-class discussions (case discussion and table top exercises) are graded. Often, it seemed like students felt pressure to speak (and say anything, even repeat material presented by others) in order to get the points for the assignment. Given that the class size was 30+, a class discussion that is 75 minutes long felt like an endless cycle of aggressively repeated takes. I think changes to the way discussions are graded and improvements to the case questions themselves could benefit the class."

   "comments": [
    "Yes if you are interested in public sector and monetary policies etc. and genuinely wants to learn about central banking without too much pressure on GPA",
    "Yes, if youre interested in central banking.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone interested in the functions of the Federal Reserve. The class is highly focused on the Fed and any mentioning of other central banks happen via comparisons to the Fed. Professor English does encourage exploration of other central banks for papers and other assignments.",
    "Yes, English is probably one of the best people to learn from about the American central banking system."
