    "Would recommend!",
    "Although the subject itself may not seem particularly thrilling, Advanced Spanish Grammar with Professor Seymour proved to be extremely helpful. You cover everything from the appropriate use of pronouns, to the pluperfect and all possible cases of subjunctive. I finished this course feeling a lot more confident in my Spanish writing abilities and would definitely recommend taking it with Professor Seymour.",
    "yes, recommended for non native Spanish speakers who want to improve, and also native Spanish speakers who want to improve their writing and grammar.",
    "If you are looking for an easy L5 course, do not take this. If you want to learn useful grammatical distinctions that you did not know before, even at the expense of your GPA, you should take it.",
    "I would recommend it to any student that wants to learn the more nuanced points of spanish grammar. Not very speaking\/listening intensive, more focused on comprehension, reading, and writing.",
    "Highly recommended",
    "If a student is considering taking an L5 Spanish course, I would recommend taking Advanced Spanish Grammar. After taking this course I have significantly improved my grammar skills and have a much firmer grip on the language as a whole. The workload is not minor, but that also means that there are plenty of opportunities to do well. If you're passionate about Spanish, you should take this course as it is designed to improve your knowledge and grant you access to the real world by allowing you to better and more precisely communicate with others.",
    "Overall, if you are looking for a course that focuses a lot on different grammatical rules and to put it in practice through a lot of \"busy work\", then this course may be for you.This course is so much fun and very dynamic at times.",
    "A great foundational course in Spanish grammar (particularly for non-native\/non-heritage learners); definitely gives you a ton of practice and will improve your comfort\/confidence with the language.",
    "It's one of the more difficult l5 classes with a good amount of nightly homework and online exercises. A good grasp on grammar is needed as with specific rules of the language as opposed to only a general understanding which may be needed in other classes."
