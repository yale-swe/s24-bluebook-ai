   "comments": [
    "In-depth conversations about theory. Writing and presenting theory.",
    "I learned how to think deeply about 20th century social and economic philosophy. This course gave me skills in thinking about economic thinkers that I had not encountered before. Professor Luban was excellent at providing context for these thinkers, and also at directing us towards the types of questions we should be asking when we encounter new thinkers. I also learned (and got a chance to practice) comparing and contrasting thinkers from different traditions, which was extremely useful.",
    "It's hard to distill what I took away from this course into a neat summary. Mostly, this is because of the texts we read. From the compatibility of socialism and democracy, to the danger of free-market fundamentalism; from problems with enlightenment thinking, to the ideal form of political participation, the five books we discussed spanned an immense range. Not only that, each seemed like an attempt at explaining the world. So perhaps what this course most provided was a diverse set of ways to think about the world.",
    "I had a chance to study and critically analyze prominent philosophical works written during and after World War II by migr philosophers as well as political theorists."

   "comments": [
    "Great class conversations!",
    "This was an excellent course. I felt like I learned a lot and also had seminar discussions that were well run and productive. I felt like I was able to bring my ideas about the text to the class, as well as learn things I had not considered. Professor Luban was excellent at leading discussions and guiding them when necessary, and letting us speak when we were on a roll.",
    "Overall, the course was very well structured. The reading list was fantasticin fact, it's what attracted me in the first place. However, I did feel like sometimes we sacrificed depth for breadth. A few of the more discrete readings could have been cut down to prevent us from attempting to talk about half a book in one class period. But that said, I did appreciate the satisfaction of having read these works cover to cover, and in some instances, you couldn't really do it any other way.",
    "I think this course gave us a great survey of major social theorists from the mid-20th century, and was extremely interesting in subject matter. That being said, I think that students would benefit from reading selections from multiple books by one author as opposed to one full book by each author, or perhaps a majority of a book with other primary or secondary sources to complement it. I really loved being able to learn one core text from each author, but I often felt like I was floating a bit without understanding how that text fit into the writer's general school of thought or how their theories developed. For example, I think it would have been awesome to read some of Arendt's On Revolution and Origins of Totalitarianism along with Human Condition, especially since we ended up talking about them in class anyway. But overall, I think this was a great course and I'm really glad I took it!",
    "I really enjoyed he syllabus. Professor Luban did an amazing job curating our list of readings. I also thought the presentations at the beginning of class each week were very helpful. However, I wish our discussions were a bit more structured."
