   "comments": [
    "Great! I would recommend it, but if Prof. Estrella is not teaching it, it's likely to be an entirely different class that goes back to the standard ways to read and analyze a poem that we've been doing since high school.",
    "It was a great experience. Professor Estrella care about his students and cares that we learn something new. He treats us like adults, and demands that we take a part in our own learning.",
    "This class is a very relaxed and interesting introduction to contemporary poetry in several forms and media. Take it if you want an easy-going class where you can learn about something you probably have never heard of before. Definitely worth it.",
    "Contemporary Poetry off the Page was one of my favorite classes this semester. It's a real shame that Ernesto is leaving, as he is about 90% of the reason the class was so good. The reading, listening, and viewing material (the class includes music and film in addition to poetry and literature) are all very interesting, but they are also rather esoteric and would not have been nearly as enjoyable without Ernesto's guidance. This is a highly unusual class, at least the way it was taught by Ernesto, and that was precisely what made it so incredible. Though it is impossible to explain what we learned in class in a short evaluation, suffice it to say that I learned more truly valuable lessons from one meeting of this class than I did in an entire semester of other classes.",
    "Definitely recommend it. You learn so many radical and necessary ways to approach poetry. But he's leaving so my response wouldn't matter, would it?",
    "It's a shame that Ernesto is no longer teaching at Yale, he is a great professor and this was a great class."
