   "comments": [
    "I would definitely recommend the course, not as much for its content as for the questions and challenges posed by the professor. To summarize: challenging but educationally and personally productive.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to others. Professor Lofton is a wonderful person to learn from, the variety of students and interests in the class seems like a rare opportunity, and the theoretical questions the class is organized around are incredibly important and interesting. Though I have no background in religious studies, and was sometimes unsure of how to parse or participate in the that field, I think the class would be useful and accessible to students with a range of intellectual backgrounds and interests.",
    "This is difficult class but it is worth the challenge.",
    "Yes I would definitely recommend it! It opened my eyes to issues and ideas I've never encountered in the classroom before."

   "question_text": "How did this course deepen your knowledge of your discipline\/profession? To what extent did this course contribute to your dissertation\/research?",
   "comments": [
    "The course introduced me to some of the important questions\/discrepancies\/debates embedded within ways of understanding religion and modernity. The course introduced me to genres of writing that I'll need to master as I continue in the field.",
    "This course gave me an eye I to a burgeoning field within American Relgious history. It also gave me some broader stylistic and pedagogical techniques that will prove useful in my teaching and work.",
    "Though I wish my final paper was more connected to or useful to the rest of my studies, I appreciate the opportunity to think about and write this kind of paper. I think as a genre of assignment and set of questions, it will remain relevant, even if the actual topic or research is less related. The class certainly raised methodological and theoretical questions about history and historical research that were exactly what I was looking for, and gave me a basis to continue work that is engaged with \"modernity\" in all its strangeness as a concept. It was also really nice to hear from people who are working in very different fields, and to work at making different frameworks and kinds of questions\/concerns intelligible to each other.",
    "Reading such a wide variety of texts that examined different intersections of religion and modernity with other consolidations of power such as (neo)colonialism, capitalism, the War on Terror, etc. demonstrated different genealogical tactics that these scholars used to analyze such emergences in modernity and helped shape how I thought about structuring my final genealogy.",
    "This course helped me to think through crucial issues at the center of my research topic. The work I have done for this class will directly impact the depth and quality of my dissertation prospectus."
