    "This is perhaps the most important course I took at Yale. It was very hard at first but as I look back I am amazed by how much we have learned. Moreover, I am amazed by how much I am able to do. Burak was always available and helpful. He even is nice enough to help guide me as I apply what I'm learning in this class to what I'm using in my other coursework and research. It makes me sad that he is leaving because NO ONE ELSE AT YALE teaches dynamic systems. This is not OK given that most of the MESC are researching dynamic systems interactions. I think this course should be mandatory for all MESCs. It should be noted that I have never written a response like this. This class, teacher and topic where amazing and essential to my education here. I am frustrated, like many of my other classmates, that we cannot pursue this form of analysis beyond an introductory level.PLEASE BRING BACK BURAK AND PLEASE CREATE MORE SYSTEM DYNAMICS CLASSES FOR US.",
    "I understand that the theoretical material is very dense and I guess difficult to explain in a dynamic way. However, theoretical classes were sometimes tough to follow through.",
    "This was an excellent course and I hope to be able to continue using systems modeling in some fashion during teh rest of my time at FES.",
    "There was clearly a lot of effort put into this class by Prof. Burak, he was also really accessible. But this class was an experiment, and due to the inexperience we were overworked with assignments of little value. Compared to the other classes this is the class I put most time to and from which I gained an average learning. The vensim trial version program was painful. Not sure if the professional program is more reliable but if so, I would highly recommend buying that version and providing a better tool to FES students. The TA was not helpful at all.The project was useful in applying the tools learned into something that was more relevant to my interests. Systems dynamics can in fact be a good framework and provide great tools for environmental managers. And I am sure that with time and some more experience Prof. Burak will do a great job teaching it.",
    "Intense but the only way to learn modeling.",
    "This was a good, hard class that took a lot of effort and time but i learned a lot. It was well taught and organized--sometimes a bit dry (especially the more theoretical lectures) but overall very interesting. He's a really nice guy also and very helpful individually.",
    "Lab work- often very time consuming (re-creating complex models) and sometimes did not contribute much to learningTA for the course- lectures given by the TA were not very useful; could have read the same information from the book; TA was not very helpful during lab sessions and not very responsive to email questions"

    "we need more of these courses!!!",
    "The laboratory and homework assignments. Also, and I know this is not possible, but the modeling software could also use quite a bit of work.",
    "The expectations for the labs and homework were very poorly explained. I felt like before I did the homework I had very little idea of what was being looked for. I felt like the grading for homeworks and the labs were a black box, homework in .... grades out.",
    "A gradient of assignments running from basic to advanced. We had about six straightforward assignments, then jumped into the deep end. The challenge was too much and I understood little about the details by the end of the class. (Conceptually, it was still fine.)",
    "Too many lab\/homework assignments.",
    "The number of assignments, particularly reading responses was a little heavy and did not necessarily add much to my learning. But, otherwise, no complaints.",
    "Some of the concepts were not explained with the greatest clarity, and sometimes (especially when they were not covered in labs) I had trouble seeing how they might be applied.I also think this course might benefit from a final exam, instead of a final project, which might help draw all the concepts from the different parts of the class together.",
    "I would include more model building from scratch -- the labs all involved models that were already built for us. The only time we built a model from scratch was for the term project.",
    "The lectures were a bit slow and sometimes hard to follow.",
    "It was a lot of work, especially at the beginning--labs and homework every week, plus quizzes, and a major final project and paper. Maybe a bit too much busy work at the beginning. Working in groups for the labs would have been helpful I think--sometimes you really needed to talk it out with someone else, and it probably would have gone faster. Some of the theoretical stuff lost us at the end.",
    "more useful lab assignments; fewer homework assignments that are designed to summarize readings; fewer homework assigments in general- the lab and homework assignments overlapped a great deal"

It was hard,especially at first, but we had to do all that modeling homework to be able to produce our final projectsI think I spoke to the TA once. She wasn't helpful (but perhaps that wasn't her fault)",
    "The TA was woefully unprepared for her role in this class, completely lacking advanced knowledge of the modeling software used for the laboratory assignments. In addition, what information she did have she was wholly unable to communicate in a meaningful way to the students. Her comments were often not only unclear but actually misleading. Her selection as TA for this course (or for that matter, any other which requires proficiency in the English language) was a highly suspect decision.",

    "Advantages: Modeling can't be done in just one session and there are so many complexities its great to have another mind to talk things through and bounce things off eachother. Plus modeling is a lot of work and by yourself it would be very difficult to get results in a short time frame.Disadvantages: being Yale students we are all really busy and finding time to meet in person was difficult.",
