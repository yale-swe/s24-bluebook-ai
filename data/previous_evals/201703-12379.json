    "It's a great course! It's very discussion and project based, so it really falls on you to enjoy. Do the readings and pick a capstone project that you like, and you'll enjoy the class.",
    "This class was poorly organized and an unfortunate end to a really great program.",
    "This course is simultaneously a class on human rights and a support system for students completing their senior capstone projects for the Multidisciplinary Academic Program in Human Rights. During the first half of the term, it leaned towards the former (more assigned readings, more discussions centered around outside texts); during the second half, it leaned towards the latter (more time to discuss and get feedback on ongoing capstone projects). At times, the syllabus felt a bit too ambitious -- students' attentions were spread between their capstone projects and course readings that sometimes felt unhelpful or only tangentially related to our projects. It would be helpful if there were less reading assigned at the beginning of the term, allowing professors the flexibility to assign readings as particular themes or questions came up, and allowing students to circulate readings that felt more relevant to their ongoing projects. My understanding is that students writing theses are able to focus their course readings around their chosen topics, rather than attempt to simultaneously take a course on a related field -- seniors in the Human Rights Program could benefit from something similar. Paul Linden-Retek and Jim Silk are both excellent and made this course a rewarding and enjoyable experience. I really appreciated their willingness to support me outside of class time, and their interest in encouraging a wide range of projects, which spanned a diversity of media, contexts, and topics. Finally, I appreciated this course as a culminating part of my time in the Human Rights Program. I deeply admire my peers and mentors in the Program, and it was a pleasure to engage with them regularly and intentionally in the context of this course."

    "Definitely something to look forward to in the human rights program. Jim and Paul are wonderful instructors who care the utmost about student learning. They craft the course with excellent readings and are skilled discussion facilitators. Make sure to choose a capstone project that you enjoy, otherwise you won't enjoy the class. But, if you do the readings, engage with ideas and theory, and work on a project you like, you'll love the course.",
