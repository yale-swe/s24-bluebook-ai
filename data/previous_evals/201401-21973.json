   "comments": [
    "I had never taken a WGSS course before, and had a truly positive experience. I learned a lot about how to analyze different autobiographies, and will definitely keep thinking about these things as I read memoirs\/other autobiographical works in the future. My favorite part about this class was the reading: getting to gobble up a hilarious, informative, and often extremely moving memoir about every week was a real treat, and hardly felt like homework. So refreshing to read books by people who aren't dead white men. And then Professor Chanda would deconstruct each book in a totally thought-provoking way I never even considered. I learned so much about the world, and about the different ways people construct their identities. Then I got to try it myself for the final project! Look, this is exactly the kind of class you go to a place like Yale for. Don't think any more, just try it.",
    "i would not recommend it to another student. i thought that the class was not super interesting or special and i wish i had taken another class that would actually make me think about the world in a new way, which i felt this class did not do. there is A LOT of work if you do it and almost none if you just skim or dont do the reading, which you can do and get away with.",
    "Professor Chanda is extremely strict. She expects you to put her class first all of the time and does not let you ask for extensions on papers--even in extenuating circumstances. If you have a really busy course schedule this term, this inflexibility is definitely something to carefully consider.",
    "Take the course!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course for someone who is interested in learning about autobiography and cultural\/historical literature. If you are interested in taking this class to learn about the Middle East, i would look elsewhere. You will learn something about personal stories of some women in the Middle East, but the discussions are much more focused about the nature of autobiography and less about history and culture.",
    "Would definitely recommend. Interesting class with not too bad of a workload.",
    "A lot of new readings that you probably wouldn't know to read on your own and a way to learn about yourself through learning about others.",
    "We read one or two memoirs a week (so quite a bit of reading) and spend class discussing them. There were 4 papers, the last one being a small personal memoir which was a really awesome experience writing. I would recommend it."
