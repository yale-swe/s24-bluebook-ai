   "comments": [
    "It's a great credit\/d because it's four 3 pg papers and a map quiz. You ace the map quiz and you can get D-'s on the papers...",
    "I would definitely recommend. It's very interesting and the readings are amazing.",
    "Great introduction to ethnographies of politics and development in modern Africa. Really interesting. Good for students looking to gain some knowledge about the continent, even if you aren't an African Studies major.",
    "Not that hard but painfully boring, full of very abstract anthropology readings.",
    "This class provides a good framework for thinking about Africa -- the anthropology approach seems to be to be more thoughtful and flexible than the political science one, and I'm happy I took this class as opposed to the polisci intro. McGovern cares deeply about the subject (and has spent many years there) and is a pretty good lecturer. The readings are interesting for the most part and provide good jumping-off points for further study.There are only four short essays (1,000 words each) and a geography quiz, so the workload is EXTREMELY minimal. (Although you do need to do the reading carefully in order to do well on the essays). Overall, a good way to learn more about the issues that confront Africa and the reasons for optimism about the region's future.",
    "If you know nothing about sub-Saharan Africa, this is a good class to take. It introduces you to basic themes and really breaks certain stereotypes. If you've taken courses\/been to sub-Saharan Africa before, like me, then this course will be boring to you.",
    "I took this class because I barely had any knowledge about Africa, and the description made it sound like a very interesting course. However, I was sorely disappointed. The lectures were extremely disjointed and very difficult to follow; they often felt like a series of tangents with no central theme at all. Also, I finished it feeling as if I had gained very little information about Africa. I would have liked some more basic background about the African states we covered. Rather than talking about the state's history, it's rulers, it's government, etc., we talked about casinos in South Africa and what they represent or how wearing American clothing is a symbolic gesture. If I was an expert on Africa already, this could have been more interesting, but I found myself wanting more basic information first. Also, the readings were PAINFULLY dry and an absolute chore to get through.Do not take this class.",
    "It is an exploration of different ways to look at an African state, and in doing so, it exposes different dimensions that, at least I, had never thought about before. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "YES. Especially if you're interested in Africa, its culture, its people, and the source of its problems today. The lectures were fascinating, and the coursework itself was very manageable. 4 papers each 3-4 pages long plus one geography quiz on Africa. No final or midterm. Great class and you'll feel like you learned a lot from it.",
    "I would only recommend it if you were a good writer. Work load is relatively easy, 4 short papers",
    "Take this class if you want a real introduction to African studies that does not prescribe to the general trends of intro history or anthro classes at Yale.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class. If you have never thoroughly studied Africa before, you should definitely take it! It gives you a lot of different perspectives on the continent, and leaves you wondering if the oft-made claim that Africa is the continent that got \"left behind\" is true at all (it's not). The texts are great as well, but there's a lot of reading - don't fall behind!",
    "Yes. Yes. Yes! Definitely take it. Especially if you already have some knowledge about Africa and Africans or if you have any interest in Anthropology at all. This class has changed my view on a lot of things considering African culture, development, aid and the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world. Lectures are amazing and you will learn so much just from hearing Prof McGovern talk. If you have ANY interest in Africa at all, you should most definitely take this class.",
    "I would highly recommend this class. It provides a deep, complex, and dynamic image of Africa as a \"place-in-the-world,\" countering stereotypes of it as somehow failed or weak, or lacking in many ways. The reading material, though lengthy and difficult at times, is absolutely fascinating. Anyone interested in Africa or Cultural Anthropology should definitely take the course.",
    "Highly recommend for any student interested in Africa. The class provides a necessary lens to authentically analyzing most issues dealing with Africa. It is much more than a history class, but an attempt to understanding why Africa is the way it is--and one that challenges most traditional perceptions of the continent. As well, as this was my first class in anthropology, it was a truly fascinating introduction to the methodology, and made me want to take more classes in the subject.",
    "The State in Africa uses an anthropological lens to look at various countries inAfrica. Some major themes of the class include the relationship between Africa and the rest of the world (including international organizations like the World Bank), the tension between agency and structure, and generally looking for a meaning behind the general political chaos that is Africa today. The class doesn't provide any answers, but does raise a lot of very interesting questions and definitely pointed me in a different direction. Professor McGovern is both very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject, and a really good lecturer. I would definitely recommend the class, but I would recommend having a little bit of background in both Africa and anthropology- I had neither and was definitely overwhelmed at times.",
    "Must take! I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about Africa's history, politics, economics, and the social situations. The best class I have ever taken."
