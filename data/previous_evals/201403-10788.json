    "A great class if you are interested in poetry, humanities, different perspectives and personal growth.",

    "Waka is a mode of speech that is constantly deployed in virtually any major art form up until the modern era and even there, it is ever-present in the works of certain individuals. Thus, while I have no desire to study waka or poetry more broadly in any serious capacity, the knowledge I obtained in this class on 'what' the poem is and how it operates will be invaluable when understanding how it works when it appears in the context of a different art form (prose, theatre, etc).",
    "This course perfectly suited my interest in the intersection of poetics and religion\/spirituality."
