   "comments": [
    "I gained a foundational knowledge of philosophy of action and was introduced to the key questions guiding inquiry in the field today. I learned about the connection between practical and theoretical knowledge, as well as possible ways of challenging that distinction.",
    "I knew absolutely nothing about knowledge and action before this course, though I had a big interest in the subject matter coming into the course. Now I feel fairly familiar with the major literature concerning theories of knowledge+action, and I would be excited to dive deeper into the field as well.",
    "Contrasting but often interacting theories about knowledge, action, and intention - something we are often tempted to take for granted"

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The readings were excellent and wide-ranging. The course was very effectively structured: it introduced students to differing views on a given topic and showed us how philosophers have directly engaged with each other in the literature on action.",
    "Strengths: wonderful array of readings and engaging seminars. Weaknesses: nothing comes to mind really--maybe to improve the course you could have students present on different readings each week\/bring some guiding questions to class? That might help boost weekly engagement with the course.",
    "The class was really tough and demanding. I think the overall course was so well-organised that we could contrast various theories about knowledge and action, but I'd appreciate it if we could have idea about why we have to think about the issues of knowledge and action and how the issues relate to other philogophical and other interdisciplinaty (e.g., social, political, etc) problems."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Absolutely. It was a fantastic way of getting acquainted with action theory, but at the same time it was detailed and challenging enough for students who have been studying it for several years. It also helped draw connections and parallels between different fields of philosophy, mostly action theory and epistemology but also ethics and metaphysics. Unlike many philosophy classes at Yale, this one mostly involved reading contemporary philosophy.",
    "If you're interested in philosophy and have ever wondered about the metaphysics of action and knowledge, which is kind of apparent in the course's name, yes! If not, you'll probably be confused and not too interested most of the time.",
    "Depending upon your interests, becayse the course was really centred upon abstract theories"
