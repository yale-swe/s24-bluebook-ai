    "I gained very little knowledge, skills, or insights from this course.",
    "I went into this course knowing absolutely nothing about statistics or coding. After taking this class with Ed, I understood many of the basic principles of statistics, including the Weak Law of Large Numbers, the Central Limit Theorem, etc. I also learned many of the important skills used in econometrics, such as hypothesis testing, the construction of confidence intervals, independent variables, multivariate regression, etc. In short, I learned a lot!",
    "Basic linear regression techniques, R language and its application, interpreting causal relationships",
    "I learned R methods fairly well and, right before tests, learned some math.",
    "Worst class in the economics department I have ever taken. Edward should not teach ever again. Only 9 kids out of 70 show up. He sucks at teaching. He doesn't know how to answer questions and his slides are so confusing and he relies on them so much. please dont teach ever again. I learned so much from Zhengren though and he was amazing.",
    "I have learned R (self-taught), and have a better grasp of basic statistical tools and theories, including probability, various data measurements, hypothesis testing, and regressions.",
    "Probability, statistics, and basic regression",
    "Learned about statistics in terms of economics",
    "Having never taken a statistics course before, this course gave me a great insight into statistics, and how they can be used in an economics context. Additionally, I was able to learn how to use R, which I have heard is a more applicable tool than Stata for doing this sort of analysis.",
    "Basics of probability theory, statistics, and linear regressions in the context of economic models.",
    "Basic statistics and intro to ols regression.",
    "Hypothesis testing, linear regression, probability theory",
    "Learned how to apply statistical methods to real data and research, beginning with very limited knowledge of statistics.",
    "Very, very basic understanding of some statistics and econometrics tools",
    "Learned about ways to apply data analysis to economics. And learned a lot about coding in R. Both very useful skills whose applicability were made clear in the class!",
    "From this course, I learned my first bit of Statistics and coding using the program R. I gained a new way of thinking about data and data analysis. I also saw how data analysis can be changed depending on how one defines the parameters.",
    "I learned hypothesis testing, different kinds of regressions. Through working with datasets in problem sets, I also gained insight into some socioeconomic issues.",
    "The first half of the semester focused on probability theory and random variables, while the second half applied those relationships to linear regression. I learned how to evaluate relationships between variables using statistical methods, such as OLS.",
    "Econometrics (Econ 131) is an abjectly terribly class. Rather than teaching you the application of econometric techniques, this class focuses on the probability\/statistical theory underpinning the material and expects you to just figure out how to implement it. I think my main takeaway from taking econometrics is that I learned how a university-level class should NOT be taught.",
    "Very few. I learned how to use commands in R and some basic statistical concepts.",
    "I learned about the econometric theories behind linear regression, as well as the more fundamental ideas of the statistics that was behind the more complicated econometric concepts. There was also a fair bit of R involved in the course, mostly through coding on psets."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The lectures are extremely dry and don't focus on the relevant material for problem sets and exams",
    "The topic of econometrics is inherently interesting, as it involves solving some of the key real world problems of our day, which is why I was surprised to find this class so unengaging. Its saving grace was a few of the problem sets, which gave us the data and tools to analyze interesting areas relating to housing, employment discrimination, and income inequality. The lectures were painful, abstract, and poorly constructed, so by the end most people had given up attending. The key to a strong social sciences course is usually the applied examples of concepts in class and section, and yet the professor and TAs never seemed able to get beyond teaching the most arcane theory that did not even relate to the examinations.",
    "The strengths of this course were numerous. Exams were fair, the course covered a TON of useful material, and the professor, Ed, is extremely kind and helpful in office hours. The only downsides that come to mind concern the pace of the course, which is a bit fast.",
    "This is not the level of challenge as I expected for ECON131 -- Yale changed the curriculum so it's much harder than previous years. However, though it took some time for me to get on the right track, I did enjoy learning the analytical techniques. The things that you will learn in ECON131 have",
    "The professor was a ridiculously bad professor. It was insane how disorganized he was the whole semester and he always was changing the dates and deadlines for assignments. He was very unpredictable.",
    "The material is not interesting, no one is excited about it, the assignments don't correspond much to the tests, and if you're an econ major, you have to take it. Enjoy.",
    "Wow. Where to even begin? This class is not well-taught, even though the professor really tries. The information is not well-organized for student learning, and the problem sets, which are done in R, are different from the actual kinds of problems that need to be solved in the midterm\/final\/quizzes, which are again different from what the lectures teach (more theoretical\/informational than actually working through a similar problem together). While the empirical project could have been a really exciting point of the course to apply what we learned to an actual dataset or problem we cared about, the guidelines were poorly articulated and we did not fully understand what tools we were supposed to use. Strengths: the TAs for this class were amazing. Bless all of them for the time and energy they put into helping us understand what was not conveyed in lecture.",
    "Lectures were not engaging at all. Material and psets were interesting, though, and learning R was a big plus.",
    "Weaknesses - not great explanations in lectures, not very engaging for students, and absolutely no instructions in terms of using R Studio Strengths - TAs were very willing to help students who were extremely confused",
    "The lectures were hard to understand and often the sections were the most helpful place because they broke the information down more, but they were only 50 minutes a week. By the end of the course when the lecture was down to 10 people or so I think that should have been a sign that something was flawed with the current system. The homeworks were almost always things that we learned outside of class in section about coding and it often was hard to see how they related to the course. Even an explanation about when you would use it with other work would have been nice. I think that instead of quizzes we should have been given problem sets with those questions because it was often the first time we saw the theoretical material in the lecture in actual questions.",
    "This course is very good about engaging students with real problems and data sets, such as those that deal with college applications, labor discrimination, and portfolio diversification. In this sense, the course can be very engaging. However, the lecture was not nearly as engaging as the problem sets. It felt as though it became less important to go to lecture, as all of the relevant material would either be covered in the slides. Therefore, if the professor could provide a more clear understanding of the later portion of the course (especially the more confusing statistical section) through practice problems, then there might be a greater incentive to attend lecture.",
    "The course definitely improved as the course went on. The addition of the practice problems, the optional readings for the week, and the summarized lecture notes definitely helped towards the end of the course. Although there were review sessions, it would have been nice if there was a poll beforehand for the timing of the review sessions and the possibility for TFs to host an alternative review session.",
    "Strenghts: come out with econometrics as a prereq and significant course. Weakness: class is taught in a way that not much knowledge is absorbed at all.",
    "This class is horrible. Absolutely horribly taught with lectures covering probability theory and problem sets that have nothing to do with lectures and required us to program in R even though we weren't taught how to use R. It felt like taking 2 different classes. We had barely any practice material at all and no way to apply the knowledge we gained from lectures beyond lectures themselves. The class could be improved with making the problem sets much more accessible to those with no coding experience (most of the people taking this class anyways) by teaching how to use R in lecture, and also if there were problem sets that were a direct application of the material from lecture that would be so much better.",
    "The lectures were not helpful, and were very theoretical, when a step-by-step practical application tutorial would have been more helpful",
    "The course was good in that there were plenty of forums to review and get questions answered. Ed and the TAs really want everyone to succeed! However, there were some significant logistical problems that made review very difficult: 1) all the TAs had office hours on Mondays, which was a problem if you couldn't do Mondays. 2) Ed frequently poses questions on his slides, but doesn't provide solutions. This is really problematic for students who don't get the information the first pass through in class and need to review later. 3) The slides are often overly focused on very theoretical, mathematical proofs of a topic that Ed rushes through. If you're going to put the information in the form of a proof, walk through it slowly. If you're going to do it in the form of a math problem, it's probably more easily digestible. 4) Ed posted practice problems, but the ones that were most important for the final did not have an answer key, and all of the other ones did. Again, not helpful for students who are trying to work on their skills outside of class. 5) You are asked to basically jump into coding R with little to no understanding of how it works for every p-set.",
    "This course was generally well-organized and taught well. The slides were always very helpful, the teacher was energetic, and the TFs were very engaged and helpful. I think this course could've spent more time teaching the students how to use R instead of letting us learn through trial and error as much as they did. Also, I felt like the homework assignments could be less R focused and have more practice for the statistical concepts we learned in class, as that was what the exams were mostly comprised of.",
    "This class is not fun, interesting, or easy to deal with. I can't imagine a reason for taking it other than needing it for a major.",
    "This class is a little bit back-loaded. The second half of the semester covers all the regression models, while the first half of the class introduce you to basic probability theories. Whether this is a strength or a weakness depends on the student.",
    "Strengths - the TAs were AMAZING and so helpful with every questions we had, across the board. They were extremely responsive and very competent at teaching, and I really appreciated their support outside of standard lectures. Weaknesses - the lectures. They got better as the semester progressed, but rather than reading off the slides, it really helps to go through derivations on the board and organize formulas in the way.",
    "I can't think of a single strength for this class. The biggest weaknesses are 1.) the lack of effort contributed by the instructor and Yale economics department, and, relatedly, 2.) the ridiculously poorly-thought-out structure of the class. The lectures teach you about probability and econometric theory, the problem sets test your ability to use R (WHICH IS NOT TAUGHT IN CLASS), and the exams test you on a combination of material from the lectures as well as applying statistical techniques.",
    "Horrific class. The lectures were unexplained, the psets were completely disconnected from lectures, and there was extremely little clarity across the board. Additionally, the subject matter changes from year to year and there is just so little explanation as to what we should know. Additionally, the psets were just so challenging with none of them explained in class that it required extreme outside knowledge to complete. Deadlines and psets seemingly changed every week and there was little consistency.",
    "The strengths of the course is that I was really able to engage with the material, and I thought that I could use it in my own personal research and life. That is to say, the course material was very pragmatic. The course could be improved from better organization, particularly when it comes to engaging the class and encouraging lecture attendance for students. This would help students learn more."

   "comments": [
    "Only if necessary for your major.",
    "i would not, except as a requirement.",
    "Yes! Other students may tell you that this course was too hard or that assessments were more challenging than expected, but I honestly think this is ridiculous. I am someone who had no experience whatsoever coming in about coding in R or doing statistical work, and I found the lectures and exams pretty straightforward and the problem sets very doable (though they can be a bit long). Think of this class as a good crash course in statistics. You learn a bunch of statistical skills spanning many different parts of the econometrics discipline, and at the end you feel very confident speaking about basic statistical analysis! To me this was really valuable, and for that reason I recommend the course. I also recommend the course for Ed, who is just the sweetest guy you will ever meet. By far one of the most likable professors at Yale.",
    "Yes, this course is recommendable to not only those who want to major in economics or econometrics but also non-econ\\stat majors. You can grasp a better sense of how to interpret data and how data analysis applies in the real world, and I think this is sort of an essential skill you'll need to develop in the university.",
    "I would not take it unless you have to. If you're an econ major--guess what...you have to. Best of luck, godspeed.",
    "hell no but this class is mandatory for econ so ur screwed",
    "If you have to take it for your major, it's totally fine because it's low workload. That said, it's interminably boring and the professor is not the most engaging but I do recommend showing up to class.",
    "I would not recommend this course, but chances are if you're taking it, you're an economics major so this is required! Hooray! At the end of the semester, Ed started giving out practice problems, which were incredibly helpful for the final, but I was in a state of panic throughout the midterm and going to lecture was basically like not going to lecture in that I did not walk out with a better understanding of anything. Many times I just pulled up the slides and tried to digest them on my own. Don't get me wrong - Ed is an incredibly nice man and I could really tell he was TRYING to make this course better. He did a mid-semester survey, he encouraged people to ask questions and come to office hours, and he's clearly a very smart man. But somehow...the lectures were just not well-organized for learning. I don't even know how to pin it down. I don't even blame him because I could tell he was really trying to improve. But this class was so stressful!",
    "I mean, it's a requirement for econ majors, otherwise probably not. There are better stat courses out there, I'm sure.",
    "A lot of people will undoubtedly shit on Prof. Vytlacil but he really isn't that bad. He's not the greatest lecturer ever but I think most people exaggerate in their negative evaluations. He puts in a lot of effort to help students and the TA's are very helpful as well. Can the course be better? Certainly. The material on slides could definitely be presented better, psets could be more applicable to the material, and the course could be structured better in general but that is not entirely the prof's fault. In terms of the actual course material, it is definitely easier than intermediate micro, so if you handled that, then you'll be ok. Compared to econometrics courses at other schools, this one doesn't cover that much. 7 problem sets, two online quizzes, a midterm & final. If you study the practice problems and discuss with a TA before exams, you will do fine. If you're an econ major, much easier to do 131 than both 135\/136 in my opinion.",
    "No, do not take this course unless you have to for the econ major",
    "I would only recommend this course to a student who was an Econ major, and even then I would encourage that person to take a look at the alternative courses (such as Stat 101, Econ 135, etc.) to see if there are other courses that are a better fit.",
    "I truly was very confused and all over the place at the start of the semester. The TFs and Professor worked very hard to improve the course over the semester, though. Overall, the lectures were pretty bad, as Professor Vytlacil is hard to follow as a lecturer. It's unfortunate, because anyone can tell that Professor Vytlacil is very eager to have every student excel in his class. He offers many resources (like extra practice problems, optional readings from an optional textbook, drop quizzes, etc.). However, his eagerness makes him a very nervous lecturer. However, in office hours and one-on-one, Professor Vytlacil is much better at explaining concepts. The TFs are incredible and helped me so much, so definitely take advantage of their office hours as much as possible. (They are the reason I passed this class.)",
    "Necessary but needs to be improved.",
    "This is the worst class I have taken at Yale. The material could be interesting but the class is just horribly taught. Lectures were a huge waste of time and absolutely useless and the problem sets were all in R (which you're barely going to be taught how to use so you're gonna have to figure that out) and barely related to the content of the lectures. The workload was absolutely insane if you didn't have previous experience in probabilities, statistics, and coding. the only redeeming quality of this class was my TA, Pengpeng, who basically taught me all I've retained from this class and was willing to help out anytime. I would not recommend taking this class in the fall.",
    "Yes - teaches essential knowledge of statistics and data analysis",
    "No, but it is mandatory for the econ major (or some equiv)",
    "Take the course, but be ready to work very hard to do well.",
    "Yes. The concepts one learns in this class are some of the most directly applicable skills that I've learned in any of my classes. You could directly use these skills in a job or internship opportunity. Data analysis is also a rising field, so these skills are more valuable now than ever.",
    "This class is not fun, interesting, or easy to deal with. I can't imagine a reason for taking it other than needing it for a major.",
    "Yes. If you'd like to work with datasets and do research, I think this class prepares you well.",
    "The topics and lessons covered by the course are fascinating if you are interested in how statistics and economics fit together. The material is very cool. But, the teaching was hard to follow and really made the course challenging. The TAs definitely helped make the material more digestible, but the lectures were not helpful most of the time, and since there was no textbook, it was hard to teach yourself. The Psets were well designed and interesting, but often did not align with the way content was tested. I think if psets were more aligned with exams and if teaching improved, the course could be excelled.",
    "This class is abjectly horrible and honestly reflects poorly on the Yale economics department. Under no circumstances should you take this class unless you're fulfilling the econ major requirement. MY ADVICE FOR THOSE TAKING IT: BUY AND THOROUGHLY READ THE STOCK AND WATSON ECONOMETRICS TEXTBOOK. You will learn utterly nothing in the lecturesthat is, if you can even bare sitting through the lectures.",
    "No. Horribly taught, confusingly led, work is terrible, and you will be extremely frustrated. The lectures are worthless to attend and please expect to teach yourself the concepts. The tests are pretty difficult. The class is not hard, and you take it because you have to. It is just extremely frustrating and definitely the worst class I have taken at Yale.",
    "Take this course only if you have to take it for major requirements, or otherwise if you're incredibly interested in using econometrics for research purposes--otherwise, I would recommend another economics elective.",
    "If you're an econ major, just rip the band aid off and take it"
