    "very good intro language class.",
    "Definitely. Russian is fascinating and so is professor Titus.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class. You can definitely expect to do roughly an hour of work each night (and more before tests) but your effort is certainly worth it. At the end of only one semester of Russian, I already feel as comfortable with the language as I did after three years of high school language instruction. The small class size is also great, as the individual attention makes it hard for you to fall behind.",
    "TAKE IT! THis was by far my favorite class of the semester. Russian is a fabulous and interesting language to learn, and despite the seeming difficulty of the Cyrillic alphabet, it's really not that difficult.",
    "Absolutely. Russian is SUCH fun language!",
    "I would recommend this course",
    "Yes, it is a thorough review of the introductory Russian grammar.",
    "Yes. If you have to take a language, russian offers interesting course material taught by a great staff."
