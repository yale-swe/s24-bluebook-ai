    "Art 359 is an intensive introduction to the process of lithography. It includes projects on stone and plate, incorporating techniques of drawing with grease crayon and liquid tusche, and creating images using Xerox transfer. There is also one two-color project. I would recommend this course as long as you understand the time commitment and are sincerely interested in the process and aesthetic of lithography. I think it's very rewarding as long as you're willing to put in the time and really consider the development of your images in relationship to the details of the process.",
    "Lithography requires patience and dedication. You might think this obvious for any course, but no. Except to spend entire nights printing, to be exhausted, to not understand the chemistry or even if you do to be bewildered by the weather. But you get beautiful work and the process is magical (and levigating gives you nice arms). Marie Lorenz is also an excellent professor, one of the best I've had in the art department, so try to take something with her!",
    "Lithography is an extremely powerful and beautiful form of printmaking, and where else will you get to do this?!? That said, it is universally regarded as the deep end of printmaking - the process is finicky and challenging, and takes a lot of time and work (including lots of physical stuff) - so take this class if working for it seems exciting to you.",
    "Lithography is a VERY labor intensive and often frustrating process. I learned a lot from it, but also put in many many hours of manual labor.",
    "A big time commitment, but an extremely rewarding one. The class becomes a real community because you go through all the setbacks lithography can present to you together. If you want to learn the art of lithography, take this class. Don't let the sometimes overwhelming time commitment (6 hours of class plus 10 or so more outside of class some weeks) get to you."
