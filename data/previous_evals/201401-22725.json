    "Very useful and excellent.",
    "ENAS 986 is a crash course in microelectronics and microfabrication. It's a very in learning the device physics governing a lot of commonly used devices (Schottky diodes, pn-diodes, MOS capacitors, MOSFETs). I'd definitely recommend this course to those looking to learn more about the field or who are currently doing or planning to do research in the area.",
    "\"Intro to cleanroom life.\" If they intend on doing cleanroom fab or studying devices, I'd highly recommend it. It is a rather large workload, but I feel well worth it.",
    "I would say its a fun class. You learn so much and professor is fun. The labs are long but very rewarding.",
    "I would label it a very useful introductory course and recommend it specifically for the lab component---which was a very helpful practical experience in fabrication techniques."

    "Very useful.",
    "This course was very applicable to my line of research. I had never formally learned device physics before, so this course was very helpful to me.",
    "This course fits nicely as an intermediary between solid-state physics and device performance\/circuit behavior. Worked to bridgethe gap between the two.",
    "i was unfamiliar with the physics of semiconductors before i took this course. now i have a working knowledge of these devices which will serve as the foundation of my future research and continued studies.",
    "My research has specific bearings on organic semiconductors but the fabrication methods I learned will be very helpful in producing hybrid organic\/inorganic devices should I choose to pursue those platforms."
