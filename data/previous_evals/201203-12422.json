   "comments": [
    "Most practical class I've taken at Yale. Professor Bolanos really sells his method well and going through all stages of the development process emphasizes teamwork and is fun all around. Definitely recommend it, one of the best classes at Yale.",
    "Absolutely, probably one of the best classes ever!",
    "Absolutely take this class. It's a beauty.",
    "I would absolutely recommend the class to my fellow students. There is not much work required outside of class and you will look forward to going to lecture every week.",
    "Great course for seniors to take. Easy going and a fantastic professor who understands what senior fall is all about.",
    "This is a great course that will get you thinking about entrepreneurship and teach you practical lessons about starting a company, designing a product, and working closely with a team.",
    "This is a fantastic class that is very fun and interesting. If you manage to get into the class, you should definitely take it!",
    "This class is awesome if you are interested in thinking up an idea for an innovative new product and actually building it. I would ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND this class. The demands for the class itself are pretty low (2 quizzes and occasional homeworks) but the project itself can be pretty time-consuming, depending on what you're building.",
    "Easy and fun course to take your senior year. If you have a good idea, it's fun to get together with friends and develop a product.",
    "A quallll class.",
    "Yes. Good class to meet other students and have fun for an entire semester.",
    "A really interesting class that takes you through an informative process. The grading is arbitrary and the professor didn't adhere to the percentages he set out in the syllabus. Your entire grade comes from the final project.",
    "THIS COURSE IS NOT A GUT!!! Haha just kidding, yes it is. You get out of it what you put in though, so if you make an effort you might actually learn a useful thing or two. Group project is a lot of fun if you get a good group and a good product, so come into the second class knowing what you want to work on and who you want to work with. Definitely take the course if you can get in.",
    "Pretty cool class. End project is a lot of work.",
    "Excellent course where you learn a lot about the design process\/concept generation.",
    "Yes if you're not trying to do everything to get into this class you must be some kind of stupid"
