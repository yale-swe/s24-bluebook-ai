    "This class teaches you a lot. First, the course material is the perfect intersection between science and philosophy. You learn to answer higher level philosophy questions like \"What is consciousness?\" or \"Do we have free will?\" with grounded answers in neuroscience, biology, physics, and psychology. Second, in answering the question if we have free will, some of the experiments and scientific reasoning behind this question are the most interesting, applicable experiments out there in the field. I constantly found myself applying what I learned in this class to my other classes.",
    "learned to apply knowledge from a number of disciplines to a really interesting topic. also developed skills in thinking critically about research",
    "Learned different arguments about free will; mostly philosophical theories, psychological experiments and bits of neuroscience.",
    "I learned a lot in the course, namely a deeper understanding in topics ranging from neuroscience and general theories in quantum mechanics to philosophy. The most valuable skillset I would say is learning to synthesize and comprehend the interconnectedness of different disciplines in an era when academia and education appears to be becoming more and more siloed, i.e. by disciplines."

   "comments": [
    "I think the strength is Dr. Brown wants everyone to succeed. So as long as you are motivated and put in your best effort, you will. It takes away the stress of that and then the rest of the class is just pure enjoyment. I think the biggest weakness in the course was that Dr. Brown didn't give much feedback on reading responses. He would hand back our responses but there would just be different color highlighting. If you asked deeply though he would tell you, but it was not explicit.",
    "weekly assignments can be tough (10+ hours of reading and like 5+ hours writing the assignment, at least for me) but so so so valuable. i would have appreciated more feedback on the reading responses Professor Brown would simply highlight parts of the paper and not really clarify what was good or bad about our thinking.",
    "I didn't get much out of the reading responses. I feel like it would have been better if we were asked to read smaller amounts and write about specific things rather than just summarizing someone else's work.",
    "Professor Brown is incredible. The lectures were fast-paced and very informative. The assignments were an exceptional way to think critically and further engage with course materials and reading, rather than merely regurgitate. The only thing I might change is while most of the books were quite good, perhaps there might be some different books to incorporate. (I'd replace Ravven's The Self Beyond Itself, personally. Still that being said, I understand its relevance.)"

    "Yes, this class was my favorite of the semester. I learned so many interesting examples and got to attempt answering some higher level questions.",
    "absolutely. great class that exposes you to a number of interesting topics and also great classmates who bring a variety of perspectives!",
    "Only if they were particularly interested in free will. I don't think it's really worth taking for anyone who doesn't need it for their area of study.",
    "Absolutely. It opens your mind to concepts most people go a lifetime without even considering."
