   "comments": [
    "I thought it was a good class, but I thought the subject was really interesting. Other people might not feel the same way.",
    "Take it! You really get to know the human skeleton - each section of the body includes one short lecture and then several labs playing with real specimens. The professor and TA are very helpful and excited about the field. Plus, you get your own plastic skeleton in a box for the semester.",
    "YES! One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. The workload is not overwhelming and the material is fascinating. TAKE IT! You will not regret your decision.",
    "Fun course! Not to much work and you get your own skeleton. The professor is very chill and really nice.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in gaining a very thorough knowledge of the human skeleton and if you enjoy memorizing a lot of vocabulary.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this class. it is basically memorization (2 exams and 2 quizzes). This class gives you an understanding of the human body (something that is crucial for premeds).",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in the human body. It was one of my favorite classes I have taken so far at Yale. The workload is fairly light, and by the end of the semester I learned a lot. Definitely a worthwhile class!",
    "Take it if you're good at memorizing stuff!!!!",
    "This is a really fantastic class. It's like a hidden gem. There are lectures about every 2 weeks, and the rest of classes are focused on working with specimens to get really familiar with bones. There are 2 tests and 2 quizzes, none of which are cumulative. As long as you've studied, the assessments are pretty fair. Definitely take this class, if you're interested! Also, it's really interesting to watch \"Bones\" with my suitemates now and knowing a lot more about what the characters are saying.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to someone at all interested in biology, medicine, archaeology, or anthropology. It is a lot of memorization, so if that type of learning isn't your favorite, then I might steer clear.",
    "I am an MB&B major who took this class for a So credit as a senior - it's been one of my favorite classes at Yale. The class is almost entirely lab-based, so you get to handle specimens pretty much every single class meeting after the first couple of weeks. The change from the usual pattern of lecture, seminar, lecture was excellent, and the workload of the class was extremely manageable. Professor Sargis is a great teacher and very personable, as was our TA, Stephen. The whole point of the class is to memorize the bones of the human body, along with features relevant to archeological anthropology; thus, the evaluations consist solely of memorization-based exams, in which you identify bones, bone fragments, and muscle attachments. One of the major perks of the class is that you get a plastic skeleton to bring home and study with for the semester. It's pretty much one of the greatest class materials at Yale.",
    "If you're interested in bones and don't mind a lot of rote memorization, you'll like it. Otherwise, you won't. There's not much else to this course other than looking at bones and memorizing their structures, but it's still very fun and interesting, and the labs always seemed to pass by a lot faster than any of my other courses.",
    "Yes! It's a breath of fresh air from the usual course format. And also, just good stuff to know-- the body is like a mechanical object, and it's really neat to see how it all fits together and works the way it does. Kind of like engineering.",
    "Amazing class!!! Do it. It is a hidden gem, not only within the Anthro Dept, but at Yale in general. Great workload, relaxed in-class environment, knowledgeable, fun prof. Plus, you learn EVERYTHING about the human skeleton (and a lot about its muscles too!)",
    "A great course, no homework or reading and you get to play with bones all day. Take it!"
