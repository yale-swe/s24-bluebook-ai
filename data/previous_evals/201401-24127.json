    "It was a high school level course. It should be much more comprehensive and rigorous and should be taken during the 1st year. We only really learned methodology through guest speakers (who were great). There were literally questions about APA format on the final - e.g. \"Do you indent the first sentence of the abstract?\"",
    "I was great to review all aspects of conducting and writing research, but seemed elementary at times.",
    "This course was pretty weak. As someone who has had methods courses in the past and carried out research, I didn't feel that I learned anything new. The information was very basic and tests seemed to focus on testing whether or not we had done the reading and memorization, rather than understanding of concepts. I didn't see the point of the group readings. It always felt painful to have those discussions and I never knew what I was supposed to be taking away from it. I would have much rather had a class that was challenging and\/or time-consuming but taught me new things and helped me develop my research skills. I also didn't understand why we would write the papers separately from our groups. I've never written a real research paper alone and the real challenge with those papers (for work) has been learning how to write a research paper as a group.",
    "Good, it's definitely a class everyone should take. Sometimes I thought it was a little elementary!",
    "This course is much too basic to be a graduate level research methods course, especially for 2nd year students. While the project of creating a survey, analyzing the data, and writing up a paper is a good project (especially learning SPSS), the rest of the course isn't challenging enough. Devoting entire classes to reviewing articles that we then aren't tested on seems like a waste of time, even after changes were made post midterm-evaluation. If field trips to labs are going to be a part of the course, they should be put into context....nobody understood why were were taking trips to Joan's lab and Andy Dewan's lab and how these methods fit into the research methods in social and behavioral science research.There needs to be more content to this class. The fact that we had not a single lecture taught by Joan in between the midterm and the final exam is ridiculous. 2 guest lectures plus group readings made up the entire second half of the semester.The fact that the final exam had T\/F questions regarding APA style is also pretty insane given that in today's age, we use EndNote to format our references, and could easily look up how to format a paper in APA style if submittingto an APA journal. Students shouldn't have to memorize that the abstract is indented or that the author's first and last names are included. This should not be course content.The final exam also featured a question:The __________ is the paragraph at the beginning of a paper that summarizes the paper.Knowing that the term abstract fits in the blank should not be a measure of how familiar I am with different research methods practices as I graduate with an MPH.This course absolutely should be a Fall class for 1st year SBS students....and the content MUST be made more challenging.",
    "I enjoyed creating a project and actually collecting and analyzing the data. There were a few extra assignments that seemed like busy work and the course would be improved if they were dropped.",
    "The good thing about the class is that it taught you how to write a prospectus and go through the steps of conducting your own experiment (IRB approval, collecting data, analyzing data, and writing up a report). However, for anyone who has every done any research before this was very elementary (i.e learning what a hypothesis is or IV\/DV). I think the skills are important but if this course is going to be required it should either be mandated to be 1st year in the fall, made less elementary, condensed into a seminar, or have the whole class be about conducting a research experiment so that there aren't weeks where the class is stressful.",
    "I don't think I learned anything new in this course. The course was designed poorly, and the level at which it was taught was almost insulting for a masters level student. The group readings should not exist at all - decreasing the number for each class did not make them any better nor more useful. Learning concrete methodology at an advanced level would be much more helpful - not learning what a hypothesis is, how to write APA format, etc. While performing our own studies from start to finish was somewhat useful, they were mostly poorly designed and I didn't really learn how to write a good survey nor find anything useful.",
    "Strengths: The course provides a good foundation in research methods for someone with little to no background in the area coming into the course. It was also good exposure to a variety of methods - community based participatory research, genetics, physiological monitoring, qualitative methods, etc. I really enjoyed the guest lectures. The project was a good learning experience, particularly for those with little other experience in research.Weaknesses& Ways to Improve:For those with any background or experience in research (or even just those in the second year or AP program), the course content is too basic. It was much more frustrating than helpful to be writing a practice thesis with a group at the same time I was writing my actual thesis. I would love to see an upper level alternative to the course or a clearer pathway to opt out of the course. There is too much focus on psychology and not enough on a true variety of methods (not just a variety as they apply to psychology). I would recommend more variety in the examples covered. The group readings are not a beneficial activity, I would get rid of them completely. Also, I loved the chance to use SPSS, but felt there wasn't enough of an emphasis on actually learning how to use the software. I would like to see more focus on teaching SPSS, qual methods, and mixed methods to address questions related to SBS.As the course currently stands, I would suggest removing this course as a required course in the SBS curriculum. It does not provide additional skills and information not covered elsewhere in the curriculum.",
    "Not helpful for those of us with research backgrounds. Lots of busy work and did not seem very applicable.",
    "liked the guest speakers and field trips, but I thought that the readings were not always helpful and would have appreciated more lecture time (perhaps accompanied with 1 reading) to better understand the different research methods"

    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0I'm sure that she's very smart and she's definitely really nice, but she didn't know how to teach a graduate level course. I think she would benefit from mentoring and it would help if she knew about the content and expectations of the other required courses.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan did a great job making sure we were able to get the most out of the class.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan was very nice and helpful with group projects, but the course overall was weak and I didn't feel she responded to the mid-term evaluations.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Love her. I think she is the nicest woman ever and seemed like a real genuine person and not some stuffy professor talking about their research",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0While I'm sure that Joan does great research in her own work, she doesn't bring enough of her expertise into the classroom. I get the feeling that Joan wants students to like her and so she makes the class easy, instead of trying to command the respect she deserves and making students work hard. The challenging classes during my MPH program are the ones have been most rewarding and are the ones I feel I've learned the most from. I'm sure Joan can restructure the class to make it more relevant, but she needs to seriously listen to the students feedback because I know from speaking with other students that most people were not happy with the course as it was taught this year....especially 2nd year students on their way out.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan was very receptive to student feedback and tried to meet our needs in every way possible. She gave great feedback on the work we turned in and I know she really cared about our learning.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Joan is very nice and seems to be very understanding (i.e. giving you a second chance to edit your papers). However, some times it is a little hard to follow along or stay motivated on the coursework.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Strengths: responds to and incorporates midterm feedback, direct slides",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0While extremely nice, was unable to elevate the level of the course to what is needed for masters students. Discussions were very superficial, and lectures were unhelpful and boring. Also, even though almost every student asked to get rid of group readings and do something more stimulating and useful, she did not take this advice, which was very frustrating for the students.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0I appreciated that the professor solicited feedback partway through the curriculum and worked to incorporate the feedback into the course. While she has depth of experience in psychological methods, this limits the breath taught in the course. She was very helpful in responding to student questions and feedback.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0Instructor is knowledgable about the material, however, does not always communicate the information in the best way. Lecture format is not the most effective method and the group discussions were more tedious than helpful.",
    "Instructor: Joan Monin \u00a0always willing to answer our questions, but would have preferred more lecture time"

    "Great review of research methods. The major assignment is a lot of fun!",
    "This course is very basic. If you've done any research before or taken any kind of research class, you won't gain anything from this course, so I recommend you take the time to do something else. It felt more like time-consuming busywork than challenging coursework that taught me something.",
    "Good, maybe could be a little more interesting. The topic is pertinent to the field so if it was a little more in depth, it would be better.",

    "I wouldn't recommend this course, but it is a requirement. I would advise students to select a research topic that's interesting to them so that it makes the work more helpful to your public health interests. The other courses we have to take are more demanding in terms of workload and time so its tough to share yourtime with this course when it doesn't require as much attention.",
    "didn't feel like I got too much out of the class in terms of understanding research methods, but the ongoing group research project was a good experience"
