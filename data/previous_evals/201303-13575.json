    "Phil and Jeff are highly knowledgeable and were available to answer questions and provide guidance when asked. However, it seems that due to unforeseen challenges outside of their control, the course was at times poorly convened\/ organized. Coordination with landowners and students was at times a bit lacking.When we asked them questions and asked for help - they were both beyond awesome. However, they at times did not proactively instruct the course. There was limited direction or feedback on our management plans. Perhaps that is the purpose of the course- to self-manage.I learned a lot from the process of the management plan, and I think the field trips in the beginning of the course were critical and helpful. I only wish we had more constructive criticism throughout the design of our plan to support its quality. That said, I think we will deliver a product to our landowner which will be helpful and will fit his purposes.Phil and Jeff are both wonderful and talented people with great intentions - there was just a couple of weeks there where juggling was understandably a challenge."

    "More time spent on how to design management recommendations - and feedback on how to integrate multiple goals in recommendations. This is the most important part and we did it last and without very much feedback.The test in the beginning of the course was pretty disheartening\/ demoralizing for those of us who had not taken taxonomy or geology or done crew. I think it would be best placed a bit later in the semester to give students time to gain some command over the material.",
    "professor was unorganized and not available for assistancefor example, we realized after the fact that several aspects of our sampling methodology were somewhat unecesary or very time consuming, while we neglected other aspects (merchantable timber). these are the things that the instructor or TA should have been able to help withmany class sessions did not provide relevant background for the project",
    "The course was poorly organized. Deadline were not enforced. There were frequent changes to the schedule, which were inadequately communicated to the class. Students received inadequate feedback and direction from the instructor.",
    "It was Dr. Marshall's first year teaching it. Sometimes we felt like he should have challenged us more. Not a lot of feedback provided on our work. A good synthesis for the MF program (it truly should be our capstone) but I didn't feel like I learned a lot. Could have learned a lot with the stakeholder analysis part, but with small landowners there's just not a lot going on."

The sampling design, the stand delineation, the forest health assessment and so on.The best part was the relationship to landowners. Present them with alternatives you came up with, advise them, establish trust, understand their goals and value and work from there. True bottom-up service forestry, a great lesson in humility, but also a lot of freedom on our side to come up with creative solutions.Too bad that I relied on my partner too much to do things I didn't already know (geology and soils). There's just not a lot of time to teach yourself new tools and still get the job done."
