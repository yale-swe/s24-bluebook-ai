    "Linguistics 553 is an introduction to the structure of language. It covers the basics of linguistic syntax and uses data from a number of different languages. The homework and reading load was moderate-heavy, but not overly difficult.I would recommend this class for anyone who plans to pursue linguistics, anyone who is interested in a more technical approach to language, or students from a technical or science background who need a humanities pr social science type class",
    "LING 553 introduces generative syntax, largely skipping over transformational grammar and beginning with X-bar theory. The course covers the standard topics, ending with some kinds of DP movement and wh-movement. I would definitely recommend the course; it is accessible even for students with no prior linguistic background, but it includes enough detail to keep grad students in linguistics interested."

   "comments": [
    "This course strengthened my understanding of the basics of linguistic analysis. The discussion in class also motivated one paper that I am currently researching",
    "Even though I had covered this material in classes in my undergrad, I acquired a deeper understanding of how concepts were linked in this class. The primary readings I read for the graduate section stretched me, but I was impressed with how much more I understood by the end of the semester. I am considering doing further research in syntax as a result of this course."
