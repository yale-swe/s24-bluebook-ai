    "I love the format of this class - being able to practice drawing and designing each week and exploring a different period every two weeks is fantastic. I love having been able to put the practice in and have noticed a definite improvement in my drawing since the beginning of the year. The field trips very very valuable as well. Jane is a fantastic teacher, and I will definitely miss having this class next year."
