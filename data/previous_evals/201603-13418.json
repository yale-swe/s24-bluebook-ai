   "comments": [
    "Lots of different numerical methods. I understand how Wolfram Alpha computes integrals, have a solid understanding of scientific computing, and learned some cool derivations.",
    "This class is a great class. It really forces you to learn a lot. Not only does it teach you how to code efficiently, but it also forces you to see math differently.",
    "I learned about a lot of practical methods for solving linear algebra problems numerically! Basically, a lot of simulation problems or calculations on large datasets or complex non-linear equations come up in computer science or engineering and need to be solved with the tools we learned in class, since they cannot be solved analytically.",
    "This course teaches several numerical methods that can be useful in research applications. It also teaches various analyses of those methods.",
    "I used a lot of Matlab in this course. The different types of numerical methods used, whether it was for root-finding, solving\/approximating linear systems, approximated eigenvalues\/eigvevectors, or approximating functions (the main topics in the course) were things which I found interesting. A lot of emphasis is put in how to write the code in the most efficient way possible, so as to minimize number of computations or try to use the least number of variables. I was not use to thinking in this very detailed oriented manner but I think it was somewhat helpful.",
    "This class gave me a sense of how to implement mathematics in a computational setting, providing key skills that will certainly help me as someone who is interested in using modelling as a part of scientific research. My ability to write and code efficient algorithms was strengthened greatly. I developed a stronger understanding of linear algebra and other mathematical concepts such as error and error minimization.",
    "Mathematical foundations of computation.",
    "You learn numerical methods, which are essentially algorithms for solving hard math problems using a computer. We learned a variety of them for finding roots of functions, solving linear and nonlinear systems, approximating eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and integrating."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Extremely focused and organized lectures. Very accessible professor and TA. Incredible feedback. Weaknesses: Sometimes too much time spent on obvious things, would be better spent on other topics.",
    "It really helped me learn to code well.",
    "Professor Bennett has this course organized extremely well. The handouts directly reflect the material in lecture, and both are exactly what you then need to use to complete the homework. You always know exactly what material you are expected to understand, and what is only given for background knowledge and you won't be tested on. At the same time, Professor Bennett does not go off on useless tangents! She does a very good job of explaining complex theorems and algorithms. This course covers a lot of really useful material, but a lot of these topics are not directly related to each other, for example root-finding vs calculating eigenvalues, and it can be hard to not forget about earlier material later on in the course! It would be helpful if some time in class was spent reviewing previous material and methods and trying to tie it all together.",
    "This is a great course! Professor Bennett is organized, clear, and helpful, both in class and outside of class. Its a lot of work in psets (like be prepared to be up all night if you don't start ahead of time), but I feel like I have an actual understanding as to how computers can process data. Every class feels like its timed to the minute (like when we ask too many questions we run out of time) but it just kept me engaged for the entire class period each day. Don't miss class ever or you won't be able to do the psets - the papers Professor Bennett hands out and the notes you take on them are absolutely essential to be able to understand whats going on. The material often builds on itself also, so missing something early will pose larger problems later.",
    "I felt that several of the psets only tested coding skills, attention to detail, and ability to find info in the handouts.",
    "The class is very well organized, over the course of the semester we were given 41 handouts. Actually implementing the numerical methods that we learned about in class in the problem sets was useful. The pace can be a bit quick, and there were times when we were expected to read the handouts on our own. There are a lot of \"methods\" that we go over throughout the semester, so learning\/memorizing the computational cost and other features of the numerical methods for the midterm and the final was difficult. I'm not one to really want to\/ find the use in memorize small facts so I found the problem sets to be more enjoyable.",
    "This course is amazing. It requires a ridiculous amount of work, is really hard, and can be frustrating, but it's rewarding and Professor Bennett is amazing.",
    "This is the best-designed course I have ever seen, and I struggle to think of how to improve it at all. Prof. Bennett is so organized, helpful, and expert, there is really no weak spot in the course. She is very clear about both the material and her expectations, and she is punctual in grading and clear in her feedback. Putting together this course is quite a sensational feat.",
    "Good course, though a bit slow at times"

    "An ENAS 440 student is like an NFL player. First and foremost, you play an organized game: Professor Bennett has polished this course, and polished it again. Every week you know what's coming (two detailed lectures, one problem set released, one given back with comments). Like an NFL player, your performance on the field is scrutinized down to the punctuation marks. And your codes are games of inches, where one-line changes can make or break your termination criterion. Your coach (Prof. Bennett), works tirelessly to drill these play calls into your head. She is available pretty much 24\/7 to help you win these games. You do all your work on Sundays. Not to mention, you make ba-jillions of US dollars just like an NFL player. Sometimes your profession calls for finesse, but more often it calls for down-and-dirty, plug-and-chug, gold-old-fashioned elbow grease. Follow the play calls (handouts), run your routes (GPUs), and you will be rewarded with the Lombardi Trophy (an 86% or higher average). If you want to live the Randy Moss lifestyle, this course is the course for you.",
    "This class will teach you a lot. That being said, it is a lot of work... and its also quite difficult. I would take it CR\/D and really put in the maximum effort into this class.",
    "I would almost recommend this class more to Computer Science majors than anyone else, because the algorithms are very practical, and at least understanding them would be very useful. Also terrific if you are an engineering major and expect to be using programming as part of that. This class really focuses on the algorithms people actually use to solve problems on their computers, and not on theoretical algorithms that no-one uses. At the same time, the theory of why the algorithms actually work is also discussed and explained, so you don't have to use them blindly or think they are magical. One of the best organized and taught classes I have ever taken! Professor Bennett should be teaching other professors how to improve their classes!",
    "Take this course! It balances the line between being practical and giving you a deep understanding of the things you are doing. On the first day of class, I couldn't understand ANY of the syllabus - I was only there because the class counted as a mechE elective. Professor Bennett is incredible and made me both care about and understand (at least a little bit of) the course material. If you have the chance to take any class with Professor Bennett, you should! I certainly will be. She cares about her students and her office hours are incredibly helpful.",
    "I would not recommend this course to another student.",
    "If you have had previous experience with Matlab or another programming language, like Python or C, then I would recommend this course to you. As a student who knew Java from highschool, had taken ENAS 130 (the Matlab course) and had taken CPSC 223, I found that the class could be pretty interesting at times and the problem sets could be lengthy (6-8 hours, probably more), but not insurmountable. Especially if you go to Beth's office hours. If you don't have that much experience with programming, you'll probably be pretty frustrated with this class at times. Now, some would say that the material in the class is dry, so keep that in mind. If you're not the type of person who relishes in thinking how certain algorithms can be optimized in different ways and how the implications that efficiency between different programs\/numerical methods compare, if you would rather be doing more hands-on work and not stare at a computer screen thinking about code, then you should probably not take this class. But if you do take it, I think you'll learn a lot, and it will be very clear what exactly you are learning, which felt personally fulfilling to me.",
    "Numerical Methods is one of the best taught classes I have taken at Yale--Professor Bennett has perfected the course curriculum in terms of material and pace. The class has a large workload, mostly consisting of coding on problem sets. As someone with some coding experience in MATLAB but who had never taken a formal CS class, I found the coding difficulty to be quite manageable, as the difficulty lies in translating mathematical algorithms into code (and writing cost-efficient code) rather than grasping major computer science or programming concepts. Professor Bennett is an enthusiastic and immensely helpful teacher who has made the course very challenging but gives you all the information you need to succeed (and is always available to help).",
    "Absolutely. Especially if you're an Applied Math major who isn't on the Comp Sci track, this course is intellectually challenging but accessible at the same time. You actually learn interesting concepts, and can understand how they impact real things. Professor Bennett also basically gives you a textbook piecemeal in handouts, which is amazing. The expectations of the class, although really high, are clear.",
    "I would SO recommend this to another student. It is certainly the best course that I've taken at Yale. Prof. Bennett is clear, friendly, and likeable. Her knowledge of the field is clear, and she is very talented at teaching to boot. It was a distinct pleasure to attend class every week. I will be taking Numerical Methods II when it is offered again in the spring of 2018.",
    "Decent class, it is a little slow, but very well organized"
