    "RLST409 has been the most fulfilling academic experience of my time at Yale, and it has completely vindicated my decision to be a religious studies major. The class can be described as *religious studies boot camp*. We read a new scholar in the field and wrote a short paper each week in addition to several other longer papers. At the end of term we paired into groups to present a project to the class among other surprises (you must write about what you think religious studies should \"study\"). But seriously, majoring in religious studies is worth it just for this class (you also have to be a religious studies major to take it).I would note however that much of what made this class was Professor Viefhues-Bailey. Without him I don't know what it would be like. He frequently made us cookies and when he was trapped in Europe because of volcanic ash we conducted our seminar via video-conference. Basically, if he is teaching this class, consider becoming a religious studies major and take this class.As a final note, this seminar is a ton of work. Be prepared to do ALL the readings. You'll definitely want to plan your course-load carefully, but again, do take it.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Religious theory. It's very rigorous, but if you're majoring in it, hopefully you'll find it enjoyable :). It's great to get to know the other religious studies students, and to get an introduction to the field that is both deep and relatively broad. (Most of the interpretations of religion were from a naturalist perspective, meaning that they don't believe there is a God or supernatural power from which religious phenomena derive.)",
    "If you're a RLST major, you'll have to take it. I guess the unfortunate bit is that it really depends on the professor- I'm convinced that a big reason why this class was so great was Professor Viefhues, and I don't know what it would be like with another professor, especially as some of these theorists are really dense to read.",
    "I would recommend 490. It's a great course--well organized with interesting and important content. We covered the central ideas of the major theorists of religion. I often heard the names we covered in this class used in other courses and was happy to be familiar with what they had written. Overall, it was a lot of hard work (100 pages-ish of reading, weekly 1 page reading responses, three 4-5 page papers, and a group project), but if you are disciplined and space out out your work evenly, it's not bad at all. Consequently, your writing will improve tremendously. Ludger Viefhues-Bailey is an awesome professor and makes the material very interesting.",
    "I read the old evals and they were helpful, so I'll just repeat the best advice they had to give: \"it is going to be the most important, valuable class you take all semester...and you should treat it as such.\"You will get exactly as much out of this class as you put into it. It will definitely pay back hard work. Slacking off is not going to be possible - this is not really one of those classes where you can get a \"gentleman's B+\" but if you work, you will be rewarded.",
    "I would definitely recommend it, but you have to take it if you're a religious studies major anyways, so that doesn't matter.",
    "Amazing. One of the reasons the RS major appears to be so close-knit. It's a small major but it is also the desire RLST 490 reinforces about the broad general scope of our search for spirituality and meaning that ranges psychology, sociology, literature, and all of the humanities.",
    "You can only take it if you're a religious studies major...",
    "You're going to have to take it for the major - and you're going to LOVE it! Non RLST majors are missing out, as you will come to know. Also, LOTS of work and will be your most important class of the semester, so plan accordingly.",
    "RLST 490 is an intense religious studies bootcamp in which you will read a different author's dense theories on religion each week. Unlike some other Yale classes, you actually have to do the reading because of weekly graded reading responses. While the reading might be difficult, it will provide you with a valuable academic background and compelling ideas that will stick with you. It is required for religious studies majors, but is a class that would be worth taking nevertheless if you like theory and religion.",
    "It's required, and it's a lot of work, but you will be thankful you took this class. You will learn a lot, and your perspective on religion will probably change in some way as a result.",
    "This is a survey of significant theorists in religious studies, open only to RLST majors. It is also among the best classes I have ever taken. Lot of work, but completely worth it--Ludger Viefhues-Bailey is a masterfulteacher, the reading is fascinating, and the chance to practice writing papers is very helpful.",
    "You have no choice as to whether or not you take it, but you can choose to enjoy it or not. If you make this class your priority and actually read and write each week, I think you'll get a tremendous amount out of it, and end up enjoying it. Ludger is a phenomenal teacher and a great person, so if you commit to this class, you're in for a treat.",
    "The class is interesting and fun because of the professor. The reading can be tedious at times, and there are reading responses due every week, but overall it was a good class that manages to cover many diverse aspects of religious studies as a discipline."
