    "Yes, especially if this student is looking to finish both their prospectus and orals in the same year. This workshop keeps students working on thier prospectus while they read for orals. Having to submit bi-weekly asssignments ensures that I will not be working on my prospects at the end of my third year when my orals are complete. This would not be feasible since we have to circulate several drafts of our prospectus before we can schedule our colloquium.",
