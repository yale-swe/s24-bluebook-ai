   "comments": [
    "Take it!!",
    "If you can, definitely take this class. It's really interesting and the reading isn't as intimidating as it first seems.",
    "Professor Roach is so passionate about teaching undergrads after his years on Wall Street, it's really amazing. Classroom atmosphere is electric, I enjoyed giving the presentation to a very smart class. Don't get intimidated. The course does get very repetitive, however. Start your final paper early!",
    "Definitely take this class, if you're interested in macroeconomics or economic policy. Professor Roach does an impressive job of balancing the tasks of providing an in depth understanding of Japan and examining broad takeaways beyond the Japanese case. There's a fair amount of reading, but it's definitely doable and you'll learn a ton.",
    "Absolutely - try to get in if you can, you learn a lot!",
    "For anyone looking at Asia-Pacific or economics, this course is a must. There are so many smart people offering contradictory explanations about the current global economic system. This course helps navigate a lot of complex topics with depth and breadth.",
    "The seminar covered a lot of ground, and I feel like I learned a lot about forensic macroeconomics. Finally I know how we try to relate the macro theory models to the real world! The one downside is that the professor does a lot of talking considering there's a seminar format. The class discussions didn't get to dive in as deeply as I would have liked. That said, the student presentations and the guest economists who came in were great, and Professor Roach himself gives good lectures. Also, just so you know, a lot of the other people will be i-banking people. This can be good for the subject of the class, but if you're not familiar with investment lingo, you may feel a bit out of place at first.",
    "If you can get into this class, take it. It was the best class I've taken at Yale. If your interests lie in macroeconomics and the policies concerning it, this is the class for you.",
    "Take it! This is one of the most practical classes at Yale. Don't be discouraged by the intensity of the course - you'll learn a lot, and it's worth it.",
    "This course is a phenomenal applied economics course with great structure. Throughout the semester, one covers many different countries that have\/are experiencing similar economic problems\/ decisions. Overall, one of my favorite courses at Yale.",
    "Definitely in the top 3 classes in the econ dept, and by far the best macroecon related class at Yale. Roach is very committed to teaching and an open-minded and balanced macro thinker. This is as good as econ gets at Yale.",
    "I would recommend this course to the student who has taken several economics courses and is interested in macroeconomics or monetary policy, but doesn't like doing psets (there are none for this class). A couple of the students in the course who hadn't taken basic macroeconomics told me they were having trouble keeping up with the reading materials, so I would not recommend this course without haven taken intro macro (intermediate macro is much preferred).",
    "Absolutely would recommend. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale."
