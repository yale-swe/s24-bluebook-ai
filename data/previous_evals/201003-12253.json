    "I would definitely recommend Chinese 303 to any student who is interested in getting an in-depth look at ancient Chinese poetry, and also picking up many important tidbits about Chinese history along the way. The readings are challenging at times, but they are very fulfilling and give you a very complete picture of the literature of the period.",
    "An awesome class that I would recommend to anyone who's interested in Chinese. The syllabus is different each year, and I've heard about students who've wanted to take this course more than once. If you're even thinking about shopping it, you should take it!",
    "A great introduction to Chinese poetry that allows for more or less work depending on your interest level (either overall or on a week-to-week basis). Assignments are pretty easy, but allow for deeper exploration of topics brought up in class. An enjoyable class and the professor is great."
