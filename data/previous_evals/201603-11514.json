   "question_text": "What knowledge, skills, and insights did you develop by taking this course?",
   "comments": [
    "thinking about big picture problems while tying together other big global problems, and scrutinizing author's arguments when they are way more informed on a topic than you are.",
    "I learned a significant amount about a wide range of global challenges - from gaining a better understanding of global financial markets to learning more about warfare trends in the modern Middle East. The policy memos, in-class presentations, and final paper also sharpen students' ability to speak and write concisely and precisely about the topics presented in the books.",
    "The ability to draw connections between different situations and theories and think about similar trends in different topics. You also just learn a lot about current events from people with a lot of knowledge and very interesting perspectives.",
    "A much more sophisticated awareness of global politics, both broad and narrow at the same time (many regions of the world, but often focused on a key country or issue).",
    "Professor Kalyvas' course challenged me to explore major contemporary issues while seeking to analyze, draw connections, and predict possible implications. In this process, I strengthened my reading, my writing, and my critical analysis skills. Further, this course pushed me to form arguments-- even those that I didn't necessarily believe in-- a skill that I greatly value.",
    "Global Politics is just too much knowledge, but in a good way. It's essentially an opportunity to read tons of books and then discuss them with Kalyvas, who is an incredibly intellectual person. I learned that various aspects of globalization are all interwoven, even if they don't appear to be. Most importantly, I learned to speak intellectually about a broad range of important topics of today.",
    "The course helped me develop skills to synthesize large amount of reading (one book per week) to a coherent set of arguments and evidence. It also taught me to make convincing while balanced argument on the spot. Most importantly, it taught me to be humble, knowing that the important issues in this world are always complicated.",
    "Because this course deals with complicated international issues and requires a lot of reading consistently -- a book every week -- you will learn how to distill complex issues and systems into fundamental observations or truisms. Additionally, the intense reading load requires that you improve your reading and time management skills."

   "question_id": "YC403",
   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Overall: it was an international relations\/global challenges book club. PROs of that set up: it allowed flexibility when discussing books to tie in issues previously discussed and re-examine them in a new way, and have discussions that were meaningful and important but diverged from a lecture plan. CONs: it lacked the structure that makes it easier to reflect upon and assess what we learned. I'm still wondering what exactly I got out of the course, other than a few nuggets of knowledge to impress my friends, and a reignited love of reading. It also made it hard to know how you were doing throughout the semester to grow.",
    "Strengths: Professor Kalyvas has a strong grasp of the reading material and additional information about the topics. He is a bright and unique thinker - the syllabus and the class are both well-constructed, comprehensive, and engaging. Weaknesses: It is hard to tell if policy memos \"hit the mark\" and - if not - what can be done to improve them. Additionally, it can be frustrating to do all of the reading (especially 400-page tomes on global trade, etc.) and then sit through a peer's presentation which summarizes the reading that you did without extending it or getting to the questions\/shortcomings of the book.",
    "This was a great class! I enjoyed the less structured nature, but it would have been nice to have a bit more feedback.",
    "Strengths is the people in the class, because everyone chooses to take it despite the heavy workload and bring interesting discussion every week. It's hard to know what to expect at the beginning but over the course of the semester it becomes a lot more clear and it's fun to think about all of the books we've read up till then.",
    "I believe that this course is strong because it allows students to gain what they put into their learning. By setting high expectations, Professor Kalyvas provides an environment in which students challenge themselves and become better.",
    "Personally I didn't love the structure of presenting in the course. Each week two students present and Kalyvas critiques their presentations, and thus there is little room for full class discussion, as compared to other seminars. The opportunity to have Kalyvas critique you, however, should be considered a strength of the course as well, as he is very thorough and not afraid to light you up. I found the challenge stimulating.",
    "The class was very well conceived by Professor Kalyvas. Every book we read was well selected and the books as a whole make good logical sense. Class presentations were outstanding and everybody really engaged in the class in ways unseen in many other seminars. Professor Kalyvas of course is unique in his constantly wise remarks."

   "question_text": "Would you recommend this course to another student? Please explain.",
   "comments": [
    "Kaylvas won't give you much feedback throughout the course, making it hard to gauge how you are doing. He's brilliant and incredibly well-read (what else would you expect from a prof who makes you read 12 fat books in 1 semester?) and he will push people to defend their answers and challenge him. The workload = 1 book\/wk, each w\/ a corresponding 1 pg reading memo, + a final paper (you won't get any info about it until the last week of class) + a book report to lead the class once during the semester. It's good if you like to spend a lot of time reading, and want to think about big issues (ex. wealth inequality, resource curse, instability in the middle east, the underpinnings of and fallout from '08 financial crisis), but be prepared to tie the themes of the course together yourself, or the course's meandering will leave you wondering what you actually learned other than that the world is doomed.",
    "While the reading load is hefty, it is a must take for anyone interested in discovering the unique interconnections and underlying rifts of global politics. I would not recommend it to friends that I didn't think would do the reading.",
    "This is the type of class\/professor combination that you will either love or hate. If you enjoy taking an interdisciplinary approach to big concepts in a relatively unstructured environment, then I would absolutely recommend it. It was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. The course is essentially a book club, however, so In order to get a lot out of the course, be prepared to do all or most of the reading. There is no point otherwise.",
    "Yes if you're willing to spend the time and read the books. It's a fun and interesting class but only if you know what the books were about. You can skim the books but you do need to read. Kalyvas is a good instructor",
    "I would recommend this student who is very interested in ALL the books in the syllabus and is committed to reading each one every week. This class is a lot of reading and it is not always engaging reading. The class is also just comprised of lectures by students, one on the book and one on the connection with the previous book, which is fine but I just wished I learned more from the Professor. The first presentation, which took longer than an hour, was not helpful because if you read the book, it presented no new information. Writing the final paper was nice though, and the class does challenge you and you DO learn a great deal from the books, but in the end, you can always read the books on your own.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to students who want to take a seminar in which both they, and the professor, take their learning seriously.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a large commitment, as you will read a complicated book every week, write a response on it, give 2 presentations, and despite what he says, write a long final essay. That is all fine and typical of an intense seminar, so if you're okay with that, you will learn A LOT. Reading 12 modern influential books on global phenomena is a great opportunity and the class will really push you to understand trends and how interconnected the world is.",
    "TAKE THIS COURSE! This is by far the best course at Yale for me. The level of intellectual challenge exceeds most other social science seminars. The course will teach you how to read, analyze and synthesize nonfiction work on economics and politics like non other course could. The kind of skills and intuition developed throughout the semester will definitely stick with you after the course, which is not common for any other Yale courses. Additionally, you should take the course for Professor Kalyvas, because he is a rare kind of intellectual who is both provocative and balanced."
