    "It was an excellent introduction to early modern history in Europe (the Mediterranean in particular) and the Ottoman Empire, and also linked themes related to those topics to the world as a whole.",
    "I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student interested in covering some of the central topics for Early Modern history, particularly the Early Modern Mediterranean.",
    "I would recommend this class. It covers a wide range of topics and ways of thinking about history, but not in an unfocused way. The discussions are engaging and the professors will push you but the workload isn't unreasonable.This class will probably be outside your geographic \/ temporal specialization, at least for some weeks, but that's another reason to take it. Being outside what you know forces you to think in interesting ways about the ways the themes and methods you explore in this class matter for other histories."

   "comments": [
    "The early modern period is my focus, so understanding how it played out in Europe and the Ottoman Empire was very helpful.",
    "The course contributed in very useful ways to my preparation for orals, and - related to that - my general knowledge of aspects of Early Modern history. The discussions and readings, as well, at times helped me think somewhat differently about my own dissertation project.",
    "This class was not directly related to my research, but did introduce me to some methods that may end up being useful for my dissertation."
