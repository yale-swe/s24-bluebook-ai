    "I enjoyed this course. You get to learn a great deal of history along with the Latin. be prepared for a great deal of work though- homework every night and the translations can be really tricky.",
    "Latin 120 is a great course. We covered, after Aeneas, 500 years of Roman history, through primary and secondary sources in Latin, prose and occasional poetry. Translation and history were woven neatly together, and we learned a lot about Rome as well as more and more Latin. I would definitely recommend the course; the workload is entirely doable, but you do have to devote the hour-plus a night to preparing the next day's translation, so be prepared to do so (or suffer the consequences if not). Prof. Schultz added such life--and snark--that she will be sadly missed, but the other instructors did a fine job as well."
