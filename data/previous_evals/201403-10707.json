    "CHEM 552 is a course on synthetic chemistry which integrates concepts from inorganic and organic chemistry to introduce students to ways in which transition metals can be utilized in chemical synthesis. I recommend this course for anyone who is interested in synthetic chemistry due to its relevance to this field of study.",
    "This course will give you an excellent background in the basics of organometallic chemistry. An essential course for any inorganic or synthetic organic student. I would heartily recommend this course to anyone interested in the subject. Prof. Crabtree's lecture style is enough to make this course worth taking.",
    "The course introduces students to organometallic chemistry, its differences from coordination or inorganic chemistry, and its applications to synthetic methods. Yes I would recommend the course.",
    "Yes, it was a good class.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone doing Organometallic Chemistry research.",
    "Would not recommend",
    "I might recommend organometallics to another student if he\/she is super interested in the field. Otherwise, I probably would recommend taking another class, since I think there are better classes offered."

    "Since I had never taken an inorganic chemistry course before, CHEM 552 was my first exposure to metal-based chemistry with this level of detail. It exposed me to the ways in which metals can be used to bring about important transformations as well as the challenges associated with metals and their chemistry. This course will be important during my dissertation research due to the ubiquitous nature of transition metals in the chemical literature.",
    "I started with a decent background in coordination chemistry but a very limited preparation in organometallic chemistry. I learned a huge amount about the foundational reactions in OM chemistry, which will be incredibly useful for the rest of my PhD and my larger career. This course will contribute significantly to my research as any modern organic synthesis lab will use many OM reagents and transformations.",
    "It taught me many different applications of organometallics and its applications to synthesis. I enjoyed learning about the various unique structures, mechanisms and history of the field. I found it to be very interesting and will be extremely applicable to my chosen field and future research.",
    "I learned a lot what the field is up to. I can always refer to his slides if there is a topic I don't understand.",
    "Reviewed literature but did not feel like I learned much at all",
    "Provided a good introduction to the theory behind the catalysis used in organic chemistry."
