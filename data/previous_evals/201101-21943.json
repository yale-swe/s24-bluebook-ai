    "If it's with Jay, take the class. Good L2.",
    "L2 Latin is important as a transition into learning, and I recommend it to any student serious about learning to read the language.",
    "No I would not recommend this class to someone. Latin is definitely one of the languages which requires much more work than many of the other languages offered at Yale, and is often not very well taught.",
    "Great class! The professor was excellent, the readings were interesting and progressed at a good pace. Tests and quizzes were administrated at an appropriate level.",
    "Sure, I'm primarily taking latin to fulfill my language requirement, but I think this class struck a pretty perfect balance. It was interesting enough that I paid attention and attended and I definitely came out feeling like I learned a lot and like I'm a much improved latin reader. Similarly, it wasn't over challenging or a time-suck and definitely worth taking with a full course load (and it's an interesting break for a math\/computer science person)",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to other students with any interest in Latin. It is not to hard to satisfy even the most basic of interests. Yet, the subject matter is interesting enough to stimulate all who participate."
