    "This is a great class with a strong group project.",
    "This may have been my favorite class at Yale. 40% of the grade (and really the entire spirit of the course) is devoted to a 4-person group design project. This was my first design experience; it was very challenging to think in this new way, but ultimately I learned more from the experience that I ever could have expected. My group is patenting its invention, and will be continuing work over the summer and into next year.If you get a bad group, you could have a bad time. Luckily, the class is pretty competitive to get into so most of the people who get in are really talented. APPLY TO THIS COURSE. And then work really hard on your design project.The rest of the work (3-4 long problem sets and one midterm) is super, super easy but does a strong job of reinforcing the lecture. A lot of that material is tangentially applicable to your project which is awesome. The lecture material is super interesting, especially if you've never taken an ES class before.",
    "This class was awesome! I came out of it with a new way of thinking about product design and my interactions with the built environment. I learned an incredible amount about the design process from working with my team for the semester-long design challenge and have been able to apply some of my new understanding of innovation to other courses this semester, which is the best feeling ever. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about product design and put their creative and analytic skills to work.",
    "This class isn't going to change your world and turn you into a green engineer, but if you're interested in product design and care about sustainability, you might find it worth it. Most of the lectures were quite boring, and the material seems pretty random at times. But I really enjoyed the process of actually developing a product. It was a lot less time intensive than I thought it would be.",
    "TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE ITFew courses at Yale will give you a similar degree of freedom in your coursework, and few courses will be as awesome as this one.",
    "It's required for ENVE majors; for engineers it's a good fifth class. Material isn't difficult and workload isn't heavy.",
    "Fantastic class. I would definitely recommend it.",
    "THIS CLASS IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT MAY SEEM.From the opening lecture it may sound interesting, like you're going to be creating some awesome new products and learning how to do so, but in reality, that's all done in your own time with very little guidance. You're product will only be good if you have really involved grad students in your group who can dedicate a lot of time. If not, you're pretty much screwed and all the meetings you do with your group are just a waste of time. We are not trained to create new products and you do not really learn how to. Class time is pretty boring lectures that are not related to your product and that you then have to do really long problem sets on."
