    "If you get into this section, take this class. Take it. It will change the way you think and write and think about writing. Professor Ehrgood is an excellent teacher. He doesn't totally follow the standard syllabus of ENGL 120, and it's for the better. Believe me.You will learn how to write essays that you didn't know you could write. In fact, most of this class is stretching yourself to do new things, both in class and on paper. Be prepared to be held accountable during class discussion. You won't be called out or anything, but it's worth it to do all the reading and know what's going on; you'll learn loads more that way.I'll say it again: take this class. I have never been more glad that I got into a section.",
    "Just take this class. Especially with Ehrgood. English 120 really lives up to its reputation.",
    "Take this class, whether you've always dreamed of being a writer or you would rather eat worms than have to write about yourself. English120 provides practice and feedback about aspects of writing both big and small, and will make you aware of things in your own writing that are guaranteed to help you for the rest of your life--regardless of the type of writing you ultimately want to do (I swear, this class would even make you better at writing lab reports). It's also a ton of fun, especially with Ehrgood, and you get to read a lot of really interesting and inspiring modern stuff. Ehrgood is one of the most accessible and understanding professor's I've ever had, so if you get into this section, you won't regret taking it (if you don't get in, show up to every class and you've got a good shot. seriously.)",
    "Yes, for all the reasons I talked about in my evaluation, I would highly recommend this class. The readings and papers were alwaysa bright spot in my workload.",
    "YOU MUST TAKE IT. Don't even think about it. Ehrgood is the best.",
    "I would NOT recommend this section of English 120 to anyone. This class is way too hyped up. I came into this class seeking to improve my big picture organization skills and being able to have the time to enjoy playing with words and delighting in the little details during the revisions. Instead, I felt like I didn't tangibly improve my writing. Instead, I only received comments from the professor on what he liked in what I was unconsciously doing and never meaningful advice on how to improve my actual writing. I also feel like this class is overly subjective. On most of my papers, I didn't even receive that much feedback, thus making me feel like my writing was shit and not worth the professor's time.I wanted to have a professor who seemed to care about my writing, about my topics, but instead, every time I tried to engage in a conversation, he would kick me out of his office and suggest I talk to a writing tutor instead, since I was wasting his time. On many of my essays, I received minimal comments and instead had to turn to a writing tutor to figure things out on my own. A large reason I took this class was to improve my confidence in my writing, but for the majority of the semester, I had even less confidence because of this class.I would recommend English 120 only for the feeling of accomplishment you feel at the end, because the class is extremely stressful and eats up so much of your time if you want to try to do well. It WAS useful to read the different models for every essay prompt, and I was introduced to some amazing essayists through this class. I also learned some useful models for cultural critiques. So take this class only if you are willing to make every weekend a stressful one, and take this class with a different professor.",
    "Yes, please try to get into one of the sections, preferably Ehrgood's.",
    "Most definitely yes. English 120 is a class that all Yale students should take at some point, in my opinion. Each professor structures the course differently, I think, and Professor Ehrgood's section focused a lot on creativity. We were given a lot of freedom about our topic choices, though he did restrict the structure of our essays. I think this way, I learned a lot about different types of writing; also it forced me to be more creative to say what I want to say within that form.",
    "If you are shopping some other 120 sections, here's what you should know about Ehrgood's class: his syllabus is different from the other sections in that for several of the assignments, there isn't a wide variety of short pieces like there is for many 120 sections. Instead, there are is a longer essay or book chapter by a single author. So you may feel like you don't discuss as many different authors and voices.Ehrgood is a great teacher: he meets one-on-one for every essay and is a fun and personable guy. He teaches people how to be smart in classroom discussions, a rare feat. Some people don't like his personality, though I did--shop the class to see.",
    "The class was not only extremely helpful, but also a lot of fun. I looked forward to every class and would leave totally energized. The assignments were creative and fun and usually very difficult. While I do not think it made writing any easier for me, it changed the way I look at writing. It has also made me a better reader. I appreciate different things in books and stories I read now.",
    "I'd definitely recommend 120 to another student, but they should definitely be some kind of English person. This isn't one to take just for the distributional requirement - we spend a lot of time talking about whether it's better to use a comma or a dash, about very nuanced phrasing. Additionally, most of the assignments are games in some way; they really are exercises designed to make you stretch something that other writing may not.",
    "Great, great course. Push and work as hard as you can, and Professor Ehrgood will return your efforts with interest. His conferences are extremely helpful, but be careful about timing; for my section, he emphasized the first two essays and rushed the last three essays (as opposed to the standard two week schedule English 120 generally does), although this could be the fault of mine because I had to redo some of my essays (as I said, if you show the effort, he'll understand and push with you). He's not a professor for everybody, maybe not for me (sometimes in class, he would say things that were delightfully eccentric...but I didn't understand them), but I can promise you that he will improve your writing if you try.",
    "1) TAKE IT.2) Take it WITH ANDREW EHRGOOD. Or, at least, shop it with him (and other professors that reviews show to be excellent) and see what is the best fit for you. Ehrgood is certainly eccentric, but he is so very knowledgable on writing (as well as law, music, French, Japanese...). Do not settle for a section that is not excellent.The professor will make or break this course \u0096 they choose the essays, the materials, and they provide the bulk of the feedback for your writing. I have several friends who were dissatisfied or indifferent about their English 120 because of the professors they had. But, in all truthfulness, this class can be one of the best you take at Yale. It is the \"gem\" of the writing program, and will reconstruct the way you approach the piecing together of words, sentences, and paragraphs.I could say many things about this course. We read amazing pieces of English writing. We were pushed in our writing to shape our pieces into more thoughtful, more tightly constructed works.Do keep in mind: there's a lot of reading and a lot of writing.",
    "Awesome introductory creative writing course. Take it, absolutely.",
    "Great professor. The level of individual attention you get is so important when writing and Ehrgood gives this attention. The classroom discussion can get repetitive and can stray from the specific essays we read. But the interactions and focus you get outside of class make up for having a relaxed classroom experience."
