    "This class is made for any student who speaks or knows Russian from home, but who want to improve (or to learn) Russian reading and writing. In the class, we focused on Russian grammar, had many discussions on Russian politics and economics, read classical novellas, engaged in debates over Russian current events, and wrote essays for each novella that we read. Like any other language class, this class has daily assignments and weekly quizzes\/tests, which requires always being on top of your work, but the work is worth it for the progress in the end.",
    "If you're looking to improve your reading and writing skills go for it, but make sure to keep up with all the assignments because otherwise, you might get lost. This won't necessarily hurt you in the class, but if your goal is to get a good grasp of grammar, yoiu won't be able to do it without consistent application in the class.",
    "Yes, Bilingual students need to take this course! It is important to know your own language and Professor Titus is a great Professor. It is not too hard, but you will have to put work in.",
    "The second semester of Russian for Bilingual Students is structured the same way as the first, but was more enjoyable thanks to a combination of our improved language abilities, better readings, and a stronger relationship between Julia and the students. It's really a lot of work for students who never attended a Russian school, but you make an incredible amount of progress by the end of the year. Definitely worth it if you want to truly feel comfortable speaking Russian - this is the only way to do it. Julia's great, and chances are your peers will be as well. A fun and unusual language class.",
    "Very good grammar class for those who did not go to any Russian school, otherwise can be a bit boring. The professor is great.",
    "Definitely, its a course tailored to Slavic\/heritage Russians and it imporves everybody's weaknesses",
    "Take it for a better rounded language experience."
