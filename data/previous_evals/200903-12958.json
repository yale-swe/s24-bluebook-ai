   "comments": [
    "I would REALLY recommend this course if you have any interest in art at all. It doesn't have much work (we only had one final project, to draw 100 demons over the course of the semester), and it was really relaxing and fun. And Professor Storr is amazing.",
    "YES.",
    "Yes I would recommend it. It's a good 5th credit, not a lot of work and pretty fun.",
    "This class had its ups and downs. To get much out of it and enjoy it, you definitely had to place a good amount of faith in Robert Storr's teaching method. We drew straight lines and circles for the first few classes, which is mind-numbingly dull, shockingly. It's moments like these that you just have to do the assignment and trust Robert when he says that this will make you a better artist. Did it? I'm not entirely certain. Looking back on my drawings with him in an end-of-semester critique, I did begin to see the value in some of the exercises; overall, however, I'm not convinced. Once we moved on to still-lives and figure drawings, the course improved dramatically. This was not always the most fun drawing course, but I do believe that I improved.",
    "I would recommend it to any one who would like explore art but do have art background. This course would give you a different view about how to see things and describe them in a 3 dimension world or rather see things in 3-dimension and then would be able to describe them in a 2-D paper. It is interesting art class.",
    "I would totally recommend someone take this class. Robert Storr was great for what I was looking for because he provided a relaxing environment - one where you could put as much into the class as you wanted. His class was not as intense as some of the other sections, so if you're looking for a chance to experiment and \"test the waters\" I think he'd be a good person to take it with. The homework load is light, although there is a tiny bit of it. I would definitely take this class again given the opportunity; I had a great time!",
    "I would recommend this class as a very basic introduction to drawing. It wasn't very challenging but also didn't radically change the way I draw.",
    "Yes, I really liked the class. I learned a lot and was able to start to shape my own drawing style. The only thing I did not like was that we didn't' have any big projects. They were all quick. Also the still-lifes got really boring at times.",
    "With Robert Storr there's no homework save 1 semester long assignment. Not good if you like realism....",
    "There's a bit of a different themed assignment every day, some drawings lasting 5 minutes, and others lasting the full two hours. A bit of art history mixed in. Very relaxed and almost no outside classwork.",
    "I would say that Art 114 02 is the escape from the daily stress. I recommended this class to all of my friends. Everybody needs art in their lives. It is a different world, with different rules. Rules that make you feel free.",
    "Yes! If you are looking for a not-scary first art class or the opportunity to work with a great figure in the art world, take 114 with Robert. Very little outside class work, really wonderful experience. Take it Credit\/D if you'll worry about your grade, because you'll have absolutely no idea how you are doing grade- wise at any point (but you will receive invaluable feedback on your work).",
    "Recommend, highly. Prepare to work hard. :-) But it's worth it.",
    "I would highly recommend this class for anyone looking for something different than any other Yale class",
    "I would recommend another section. Or choose one of the morning sessions that don't have as many students.",
    "Yes I would highly recommend Art 114 02, because Robert Storr is unlike any other art teacher I've ever had. He is very knowledgeable about modern art and expands not only your drawing skills, but also your perception of art as a medium for exploration.",
    "Basic drawing was a very enjoyable class that I would definitely recommend, especially in a semester where you have an otherwise heavy courseload."
