    "If you are a queer student who comes from a very conservative Christian background, you should definitely take this course! The workload itself is not too bad and the professor is amazing!",
    "An awesome class! Definitely take if you get the chance. Fun and engaging topic, great professor, helpful TAs.",
    "I definitely recommend taking this class! If you have zero experience in religious studies, this is a great class that is not too far from something like Intro to the Bible, but is much more entertaining! If you already know much about religious studies, I still recommend taking this class because it will definitely teach you new things. I laughed so much during this class because Professor Martin is hilarious. He is also very knowledgeable about the topic, and the paper topics are interesting. I learned a lot from this class about the Bible, Judaism, Christianity, and it has changed my view on sex and gender! This is probably one of my favorite classes I took at Yale all four years.",
    "It's a new course, so it has a fair amount of kinks. The subject matter is interesting, but unlike many other Yale courses there's not really a thesis to the course. It's mostly a run through of sex and gender issues in the Bible without much effort to tie them into a larger point (big surprise, women were often thought of as property!). But the work is light (the only textbook is the Bible, two 6-page papers and a final 8-page paper), and it's an interesting way to introduce yourself to the Bible and religious studies in general. My hope is that the course will get better in time if it sticks around. Dale Martin is not the best lecturer (sometimes a bit crass, in my opinion); here's a rare case where the sections are actually better than the lectures.",
    "I would definitely recommend taking this course. Professor Martin's lectures are always engaging, and the subject material is fascinating. I had never taken a religious studies course before, and I absolutely loved this class.",
    "This class is hilarious and changed so much of the way I view botht eh bible and how it has shaped perceptions of gender and sexuality. This was my first religious studies course and it was the perfect introduction - simple enough, fascinating, and totally hilarious. Prof. Martin is probably one of my favorite professors - he's totally outrageous and not afraid to tell you"
