    "Carol Jacobs is truly wonderful \u0097\u00a0warm, caring, and very accessible \u0097 but I didn't really like Sebald. Given that the semester was exclusively focused on his work, this was kind of a problem. If you have the chance, skim through a few chapters of any of his books to see if you think you'd like his style. If you don't like it, stick with your gut and find another seminar. That said, the only assignments we got this semester two ten-page papers on a topic of our choice, which weren't too difficult.",
    "You will read most of Sebald's published works. You will sit in a seminar for two hours a week and mostly listen to Carol Jacobs read a couple of pages very closely. You will write two ten page papers. Sounds great, right?",
    "This class is an amazing opportunity to read these fantastic texts and get into the details of what Sebald does in his texts. It was a pleasure both listening to other students and participating in class.If you haven't read anything of Sebald and aren't sure if you're willing to dedicate your semester to one author, you should still seriously consider this class. I would suggest browsing looking at one of the chapters in his \"Rings of Saturn,\" which should give you a good idea of his unique approach, and then deciding whether or not to take the class.",
    "Take this class if you want to read basically the entire output of a wonderful writer that you've perhaps never even heard of before. Sebald is very special. It can get kind of overwhelming, but the class is easygoing and you can pace yourself how you'd like."
