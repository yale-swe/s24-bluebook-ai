    "On top of basic introductory international law, this class also goes pretty deeply into US foreign relations law (definitely much more than I expected). Otherwise it's a survey through various topics, from international humanitarian law to the law of the sea to arbitration.",
    "I developed a strong understanding of the core basics of international law, both from a black book and historical perspective.",
    "I gained a thorough and broad introductory insight in many different aspects of international law, mainly from a legal perspective but with many aspects of the moral, the political, and the practical in the mix.",
    "Fundamental understanding of international law and the unique problems that sit at the heart of a consent-based system.",
    "Knowledge on the origins, players, and enforcement mechanisms of international law, as well as the criticisms of the field and the main cases that have shaped it"

    "Professor Hathaway is a fantastic lecturer and makes it easy to contribute and ask questions in a decently large lecture (~40-50 people). The readings are really interesting. I feel like a little too much attention was paid to foreign relations law, though.",
    "Fantastic course - Professor Hathaway is excellent, engaging, and while the material is substantial, you cover a lot of ground.",
    "One great strength is that it was twice a week, meaning we could cover all the material. Another important thing to point out is that the relatively large size of the class was not a weakness or an impediment to learning - even with a lot of students in the room we were able to discuss things relatively intimately, which is conducive to a productive learning environment. I particularly appreciate not limiting the numbers to a much smaller class as I am not a law student and was very happy that the class was open to a broader community than just people from YLS. The guest lecture weeks were very good too!",
    "Strengths great teacher. Very engaged and knowledgeable. Weakness one exam is a limiting indicator of knowledge and skills learned in the course. Should have more assignments\/applications.",
    "Strengths - breadth of the material, the readings were all very relevant and facilitates class discussion Weaknesses - There are still unaswered questions in the field, and this made it harder to analyze certain topics"

   "comments": [
    "Yes take it if you're at all interested in international law! The scariest thing for me was the final exam which accounted for 80% of the grade, but that also meant most of the year you didn't have any assignments to turn in. Law students are extremely on point and it was humbling to learn from them.",
    "Yes",
    "Yes - if you are interested in a foundational survey course in international law.",
    "100% recommended. For anyone who is interested in law, politics, international relations, history, crime, and a whole range of other subjects - or who just has general curiosity - this is a brilliant course.",
    "Yes. Strongly recommend. Course is a lot of reading, but extremely interesting material. Oona is engaging. Would like to see more applications of skills learned though.",
    "Yes"
