    "A strength was that individual projects allowed students to study what they were interested in. I wish we had done less category theory, or maybe used it in a homework. It was a bit too abstract for me to understand without practice problems.",
    "This course was good at improving presentation style. However, some aspects of the course were quite frustrating. In particular, nothing was really proved; every theorem or proposition was left to us to \"check the details\" when really the entire content of the proof is in the \"details\"."
