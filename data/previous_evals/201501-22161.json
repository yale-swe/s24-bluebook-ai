    "Take this is you love French literature.",
    "Solid French course in translation. Interesting reading list, lots of stuff that doesn't come up in other classes. Loved the focus on feminism and women -- it was refreshing to see a male teacher interested in these issues outside of the WGSS department. Medium courseload -- a book a week (of variable length) plus a 5-7 page midterm paper and a 10 page final paper. Definitely recommend.",
    "Definitely worth taking. Professor Bloch is a great professor who cares so deeply about the literature that he teaches.",
    "Excellent class! I highly recommend students take a class with Professor Bloch before they graduate."
