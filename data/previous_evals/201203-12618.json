   "comments": [
    "Yes, diffeq is a very interesting topic and is a fun course.",
    "Yes, but not with professor Luli.",
    "Based on what I've heard, this one is less work overall than the ENAS one because it only covers ODEs. That being said, it is much more theoretical, so be sure you're up for a bunch of true\/false \/ show questions.",
    "Take it only if you need it, it is not an easy class, and the lectures can get confusing sometimes.",
    "If you are reading this, you are probably trying to decide whether to take Differential Equations through the math department or the engineering department. Both will be difficult, so you should pick the course with the better professor (or the better professor for your learning style). Professor Luli was a great lecturer and overall a good teacher (VERY helpful during office hours!!), so I would recommend taking this course from him. If you need (or want) to take this course, just be prepared to put in a lot of time, both on problem sets and in studying for tests.",
    "Do ENAS if you aren't really interested in the theory. DiffEq theory is very dry and boring and even for someone who has enjoyed analysis a lot before, this class was very boring.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Mathematics even if they are not pursuing a math major. The class is largely skills based although it does include some proofs. Do not take this class before linear algebra. I did not and am very glad I did so.",
    "This is an introduction to differential equations for math lovers. If you're planning on being an engineer, this is probably not what you want. That said, I would highly recommend this course as it was one of my favorites of the term. The subject matter itself was really interesting and the proofs were pretty beautiful. The only thing is that the midterm and final were HARD. Especially the final. He let us bring a review sheet to use during the test and the average was still a D. Problems sets though are highly manageable and actually thought provoking and interesting to solve. Definitely recommend it!",
    "I would recommend Math 246 to anyone interested in continuing their math career after calculus and linear algebra. The course is well-taught, and the topics are interesting and have some obvious applications in physics as well. I really enjoyed it, and I think other math lovers would too.",
    "You're taking it because you have to. I'd recommend this over the ENAS version.",
    "Take it if you're in math, econ or science and want to understand the math behind the methods they teach in ENAS. It'll be harder, I expect, but you'll learn more because of that.",
    "If Kevin Luli were to continue teaching this course, I would strongly recommend it. However, since he is no longer doing so, take precautions. Consider your appetite for theoretical math (this takes a dabbling at what is a much greater field) and decide if you want to take the theory or the applied version of ODE (MATH 246 vs ENAS 194 at this time of writing)."
