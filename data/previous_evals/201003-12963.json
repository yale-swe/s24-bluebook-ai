   "comments": [
    "If you have an hour to live, you should spend it in this class because it will be the longest hour of your life. On the downside, you might be asleep. Material may or may not interest you, but Jan definitely won't.",
    "Teaches you about strength and deformation. As a required course, not much choice, but not a bad class and useful concepts.",
    "This class is not too difficult for an engineering class. The teacher is very nice and understanding, the tests are not too hard (and they also test you on concepts! When was the last time you were actually asked about the reasoning for something rather than just having to simply plug in formulas?!) and the textbook is excellent. Actually, this is more important than you might realize, because a combination of the 9:00 time and the teacher's somewhat slow and mistake-riddled lectures will cause you to rely on it.",
    "This course is very useful and not terribly challenging. If you would like to learn about statics and structural physics, this is a good course to take, but chances are you will only be taking this course if you need it for the ME major.",
    "You have to take this if you are a mechanical engineering major. However, if Schroers teaches this again it will be painful. Almost no one came to class after the first couple weeks because he teaches straight out of the book and not very well. He gets stuff wrong sometimes during class and then usually can't explain if you point it out.",
    "Its not an easy class, and not the most exciting material. That being said, it is essential if you want to major in ME. Take it if you have to. But if you are looking for engineering classes to sample, I would recommend MENG 185b as a good starting point.",
    "Not really. I think this course has potential, but Shroers isn't the greatest teacher. Make the most of the sections if Juan is still the TA.",
    "This class is a basic look at the impacts of stress and strain on materials, and the properties of materials. The material for this class is very interesting, applicable, and overall excellent. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested, with a background in statics. It's required for the mechanical engineering major, but should in no way be dreaded.",
    "Don't take this course unless you are required to. It's early in the morning, not that interesting, and not very well taught. If you get a good TA, use it as much as possible!",
    "This is a difficult course so be prepared to work, however, it is a rewarding course. You get to observe how materials react to varying loads and position of loads. Also, it is fulfilling to apply physics and math to real life situations.",
    "Only if it's required for your major",
    "This course is dry enough that I feel like few people would take this just for fun. However, this is a vital course to any engineer, and thus provides a solid basis for future engineering courses.",
    "An intro course in Mech Engineering \/ 280 isn't a class worth fearing. \/ The curriculum contains \/ Units on stresses and strains \/ And torsion and bending and shearing.",
    "The class is decent. It helps you think like an engineer (that is, instills the mindset associated with analytically approaching a practical problem), and you'll find the problem sets not only manageable (4-7 hours depending on length) but helpful. However, the material is basic mechanical engineering concepts and invariably tending on the Atacama side of arid. Professor Schroers is not an engaging lecturer and does nothing to enliven the material, though he is passable - you'll find attending lecture productive, if not boring. The first midterm and final were both far too long for the time allotted, and grading was inconsistent at best. Overall, these deficiencies are not enough to make the class one to avoid, but it is certainly not the most exciting course you could take in your illustrious career at Yale. If you are majoring in mechanical engineering, you need to take it; if not, there are much better classes to get a QR or gain a small taste of what doing engineering entails."
