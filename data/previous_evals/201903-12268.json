   "comments": [
    "Critical thinking, learning how to situate my ideas in historical contexts.",
    "I gained a detailed understanding of the history that we all learned in high school. I learned about trends in american history -- causes and sentiments.",
    "A whole lot of American understanding and appreciation.",
    "In this course, I learned how to analyze primary sources and developed my skills for comparing them against each other without historian's interpretation. I gained a new perspective on America history that changed the way I think about our current politics and the way I conceive of America.",
    "I gained an entirely new perspective on America's early history.",
    "I became acquainted with some of the fundamental tensions in the history of the American political tradition.",
    "General overview of early american political figures and their writings.",
    "I learned a great deal about the cultural and political underpinnings of the United States by investigating sources from the puritan era through reconstruction. In doing so I also feel as though I gained a large amount of intuition regarding the historical roots of many of America's present-day political and cultural conversations.",
    "Improved reading and writing",
    "We surveyed the period of history as suggested by the title of the course. Not having had a strong background in US history, I definitely learned a lot about important movements, figures, and the way things connect.",
    "Writing long papers without repeating myself Talking to smart people",
    "I learned a great deal about America, its values, its philosophy, and how it understands itself. It has made ma a more conscious, engaged, and thoughtful citizen and helped me to understand how a country and a countrys ideology forms.",
    "A really great overview of major pieces of writing from American history. Extraordinary opportunity to have face time with Professors Kronman and Smith if you did not do DS.",
    "The class introduced me to major trends in American political, social, and literary thought up through Reconstruction. This course, however, wasn't simply a list of chronological readings surveying a time period. Rather, both professors worked to identify the golden threads of the american imagination. The course drew connections throughout the syllabus. How have different Americans answered similar questions? What is the relationship between our puritan roots and the ideals of our revolutionary founders? What are our defining values or creeds as American citizens? The course challenges students to confront these types of questions throughout the two-term course.",
    "I learned about American history in a way I never had before. The course goes chronologically, beginning around the Revolutionary War, but instead of focusing on dates and events, the course mostly deals with themes and ideas that have changed and grown since the origin of our nation. We learned about how the debates of early national America, about the economy, the work force, state power, religion, and leisure, have long persisted. We developed skills to consider and evaluate history outside of our own, modernized perspective. We learned about circumstance, geography, and the kinds of exclusion and moral foundation which continues to ground our nation and our democracy. This is course which will irreversibly alter your perspective of politics, of national identity, of American political theory and history. You ask questions that lead you to smarter, more nuanced perspectives of American excellence and nationhood."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Super interesting course material. I only wish there was more time spent on Lincoln!",
    "Strengths: great readings, great lectures, great class discussions weaknesses: the professors rarely brought the readings into discussion in lecture and for how much reading there was, I wish there had been more specific textual discussions",
    "The strengths of this course are the lectures and sections. Kronman and Smith give very well-argued, systematic lectures that are thought-provoking and easy to follow. Sections never faltered and we usually covered very interesting material. A weakness of this class is that it did not allow us to spend adequate time on some important topics.",
    "The strengths are that it is incredibly engaging, though-provoking, and sophisticated. I also loved learning from two professors, both of whom were awesome. Weakness is just that the lectures were at times more summary than I would have liked. If you had done the reading, you knew a lot of what they said.",
    "The lecturing abilities of Professors Smith and Kronman make the course truly phenomenal. The sheer breadth of the course is both a strength and a weakness, in that it exposes all of us to some of the most important primary texts in American history, but also sets up section so that we cannot possibly cover even half of the readings in any reasonable fashion. That said, the selection of texts is truly wonderful.",
    "Strengths are the reading lists. Lectures were generally great, but a few (that were lacking in preparation) certainly stood out from the rests. Section on the other hand could use some Improvements. Professor Smith (to the ones he came to) often had trouble facilitating an engaging conversation both in relation to the course material and larger topics more generally. Professor Kronman was better at doing so.",
    "I definitely believe the lecture\/seminar split was a huge strength; it was a great way to diversify our engagement with the readings. I feel as though the fact that many readings in several weeks were not even discussed was a weakness, though not an incredibly significant one. Even readings that were not discussed in lectures and seminars were helpful in contextualizing each week's content.",
    "No weekly response paper",
    "The course is so well organized! Professor Kronman And Professor Smith are fantastic. My favorite part was that lectures were on Tuesday and discussion sections were on Thursday. This gave an adequate amount of time to actually engage with the reading, which is the foundation of most of the learning in the class.",
    "A little more feedback from professors would be great, but this is difficult given their other commitments",
    "I think its the perfect course. It is well-organized. We learn a lot about a lot. The lectures are interesting. The seminars are all very engaging. You get great access to top professors. The workload is manageable. The readings are interesting.",
    "I will only quibble with the weekly reading responses. They took a fair amount of time (45-60 minutes each for me) and I never really received feedback on any of them. It seems like the natural purpose of such assignments would be a) to incentivize students to do the reading or b) to help students gain writing practice. If a), since the responses were never graded, the incentive deteriorated pretty quickly; if b) the absence of feedback kind of defeats the purpose. I think the responses should have been assigned a grade and perhaps been given even just a sentence of feedback each. Perhaps also there could have been a requirement as to how many readings you were supposed to touch upon, as it seemed like evasion was rife - many students only commented on one (often the shortest) reading in their response. With all this said, I received incredibly extensive feedback on my two 10-page papers, so I am not making a general complaint about the level of writing instruction in the course.",
    "This is an excellent class. The course is well designed and moves at a steady and efficient pace. The readings are excellent and the lectures provide insight and texture to the material. The weekly lecture\/ seminar format also works well. I see very few weaknesses in this course. Two quick points of criticism: 1. I didn't enjoy the mid semester \"flip\" in the seminars. The entire class had developed a strong relationship with our first instructor and the shift to a new seminar leader felt jarring. Both professors are fabulous discussion leaders, but I think the course would have felt more coherent if each group stuck with their original facilitator. 2. The course moves at a breakneck pace and covers a lot of ground very quickly. I think the pace works just fine given the content. However, I wish that the readings had been slightly more focussed. The texts we cover exist primarily within three large Norton Anthologies that contain snippets and excerpts of source material. This provided the entire course with a \"scrapbook\" or \"greatest hits\" feel. I would have preferred that we dive deeply into one or two primary texts each week instead of hopping around from excerpt to excerpt. At the least, I would have enjoyed reading from a few entire books instead of exclusively from anthologies. For example, in the week entitled \"From Confederation to A More Perfect Union,\" we could have read all of The Federalist and scrapped the other readings. Regardless, this course is unbelievably strong. An impressive intellectual collaboration from Professors Kronman, Smith, Garsten, and Bromwich!"

   "comments": [
    "100%. Taking this course is part of being a responsible American citizen.",
    "If you would like to gain a more specific understanding of american history, absolutely. I learned a ton.",
    "Yes. Professors were terrific--having a chance to spend the time with them is a treat, and the material was excellent as well. A truly fascinating topic. I feel better equipped to live in this nation.",
    "Absolutely. It is a fascinating perspective on American history taught in an unconventional manner.",
    "Definitely. If you are interested in thinking critically about America, take this.",
    "Absolutely. If you are at all interested in the question of what it means to be American, this course will stretch your mind like none other.",
    "Yes, for those interested in early American thought and who are stimulated by the reading list.",
    "I would recommend this course to a student interested in learning about the political and social roots of America.",
    "Yes, smith and kronman were great",
    "I cannot recommend this course highly enough. It traces American history in a way that covers so much ground and, while out of necessity does leave a lot unsaid, at the same time feels very comprehensive. This is largely due to the variety of genres in the readings, as well as the variety of perspectives they offer on the same theme. The lecture\/seminar mixture also really makes the class, allowing you to learn from such amazing professors and then use those lectures to deepen your understandings of the readings and leading to deeper discussions with peers. The workload is somewhat intense due to the amount of readings each week, but honestly they're a joy to read if you're interested in American history at all, so it rarely felt like a chore. There are only two papers, though, one at midterm and one final paper, so in terms of actual work it's not overbearing at all. An absolutely brilliant class that embodies the strengths of double-teaching, you should definitely take it if you want an American history class that will teach you about America as a conglomeration of complex people and beliefs and values rather than just a bunch of dates.",
    "Yes!! Both Professors are amazing lecturers. They break things down in an unintimidating way for someone who has mediocre knowledge of US history. They also focus on complex themes and questions for those in the class who were already familiar with basic events. The Tuesday lecture \/ Thursday discussion section format was perfect for giving adequate time to complete the readings, which become less and less over the course of the semester. There is no final exam. Just one paper each term.",
    "Yes if you like reading and American studies",
    "I would recommend this course to anybody who wants to understand America or American philosophy, to anybody who wants a fantastic seminar with top professors., and to anybody who wants to learn how a national ideology forms.",
    "Definitely. As a history major, I felt a bit frustrated that so many of my courses focused on a narrow subject or aspect of American history. While this course necessarily sacrifices depth for breadth, it allows you to take in the full sweep of American history at once and trace the connections between eras. It's a wonderful and unique academic opportunity at Yale.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course. The class is absolutely fabulous. You will learn a whole lot of American history but also be exposed to intriguing issues of American identity, values, and creedal beliefs. Professors Kronman and Smith are excellent and the reading list is expansive and thorough. The course is challenging but fair. Don't skip out on this while it's offered.",
    "Definitely. If you want to understand American history and how it informs the present, while really working through our collective identity and our individuating ones, take this course. You will think for yourself, have room to formulate your own values, and you will feel more able to think critically about the place in which we have now found ourselves. It's a course for anyone who wants a comprehensive understanding of being an American and the past with which we must always reconcile. The lectures are always somewhere between good and great, and in seminar, students have lots of authority in what is discussed. You will learn American history well, probably for the first time, and you will finally feel grounded in your knowledge of how America came to be."
