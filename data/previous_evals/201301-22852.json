    "Definitely recommended!",
    "Professor Weiss apparently originally intended for this to be a graduate-level anthropology\/archaeology seminar, but the class ended up mostly full of undergrads in unrelated majors, so this class ended up being sort of a half-lecture\/half-seminar type deal that was more or less a survey of the idea of \"collapse\" and some case studies on individual societies that collapsed. The class starts with some popular readings (e.g Jared Diamond's \"Collapse\") and moves from there to more scholarly works, with a strong focus on quantitative climatological data rather than vague theorizing about decadence and so forth. As far as workload goes, you have weekly readings with occasional associated assignments; a 10-page midterm paper; a 15-page term paper; and a presentation sometime in the second half of the semester. It's really quite manageable. All in all, I heartily recommend this class to anyone with an interest in \"collapse\" or in paleoclimatology or anything else that this course touches on. Note that Prof. Weiss can be a bit difficult to follow at times, but he's extraordinarily knowledgeable, and it really helps make the class interesting.",
    "Professor Weiss is the most passionate and interesting professor I have had at Yale. Sometimes lectures are dry but it was a simple midterm, final paper, presentation class. TAKE IT!"
