    "The readings and discussions are great, and Professor Mirakhor was great at complicating our understanding of migrant narratives. Overall a very honest class, probably among my favorites.",
    "I learned about the themes and trajectories of literature about and by migrants and refugees, I got to practice my close-reading skills, I learned how to be a good participant in a writing group.",
    "I came away from this class with a heightened and deepened sensitivity to art in everyday human interactions. I read accounts of movement, loss, belonging, home, and find myself acutely aware of how these themes are infused into the lives of authors and characters and actors in historical events and my family members' lives today. I gained an understanding of the relationship between literature and life, and how to examine events of mass displacement and trauma through the lens of art and literature.",
    "This class exercises an amazing balance between analyzing personal narratives, literary theory, critical theory, and history. Not many Yale classes, or even ER&M classes are able to accomplish such a balance. Through the readings and seminar discussions, I learned a lot about migrant and refugee history and began to formulate a new idea of what my \"ideal\" world looks like."

   "comments": [
    "Discussion was well-structured with the alternating reading responses and focusing on specific questions raised by those responses at the beginning of each class was a great pedagogical tool.",
    "Strengths: very high class engagement, very well led class discussions, assignments were well timed and well thought out, office hours were very helpful, good use of Yales museums as teaching tools Weaknesses: some of the books werent as interesting as the others",
    "Strengths: The readings are INCREDIBLE. Novels that deal with different historical events but related in themes, and incredibly engaging secondary sources. Professor Mirakhor is the best seminar leader I've encountered at Yaleshe is incredibly passionate, she moves, she guides discussion in a way that feels fruitful, dynamic and high-stakes, not a single minute ever felt wasted. The workload is very fair, one analytical essay and one large-scale research\/creative project that was incredible meaningful to do. Mind-bending visits to the art galleries. Zero weaknesses I can think of.",
    "The strengths of this course include the incredible reading list and Professor Mirakhor's creative insight.",
    "The readings for this class are great, and cohere really well around the central themes of the course.",
    "Overall, this seminar was fantastic: great instructor, important and engaging subject material, and high level of engagement from the other students. Seminar discussions were very powerful, as both the students and instructor collaborated in digesting the topics in the materials that we read. The class provided opportunities for students to think about literature, theory, history, and personal experiencesomething which not many classes accomplish successfully. One weakness: For me, engagement with the class fell off a little bit towards the end of the semester. This is pretty common among seminars, but since I was so excited about the class, I felt that I wanted a little bit more."

   "comments": [
    "yes, take it and then switch to the ER&M major",
    "Yes! The books are interesting and the way Prof Mirakhor helps you engage with them is unique and valuable",
    "Yes. The course texts are great and Professor Mirakhor is great at facilitating discussion and challenging students to think deeper.",
    "Yes. Take it. This class changed my life. The readings, discussion posts, and assignments are all incredibly meaningful and tailored to bring you to a critical engagement with themes that touch so many aspects of humanity and the world.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who would like to sharpen his or her reading and creative skills with the course's themes in mind. Someone who is personally drawn to the course's themes will find this course even more meaningful and informative. This class has the potential to teach a student about him or herself.",
    "Yes! This is a great class",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. The reading list is fantastic and Mirakhor is an amazing seminar teacher. The class provides individual flexibility while still pushing students to think critically of themselves and the subject matter of the course. For those considering this seminar, discussions covered history, legal history, literary style, politics, and others. (:"
