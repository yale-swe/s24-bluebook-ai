   "comments": [
    "Yes. It is really good if you learn better in seminar like settings.",
    "I mean, it's a basic economics course. Who would take it for fun? It's dull, uninspiring material covering a field of study that *tries* to make accurate models for predicting human behavior. I can't recommend it for inspiration, but if you have to get an introductory microeconomics credit out of the way, it's probably better than the large lecture.",
    "Yes, if math is not your strong suite, than definitely take this class.",
    "Yes, I would recommend it. It's not a gut class, but it's not an impossible QR credit, either, and you'll feel like you actually learned stuff.",
    "I would definitely reccommend this Econ class as opposed to the lecture. This is far and beyond superior to the lecture in every way. Professor, speed of the course, how well material is taught - it's just better. The professors for 108 are pretty solid, and I learned a ton over the semester. Midterms and finals aren't bad as long as you study a good amount. Psets are fairly straightforward as well. The Friday problem solving sessions were great and would be even better if they weren't so early in the morning. The problem solving sessions went over a lot of good problems that were on the psets and midterms. Overall a solid course for those interested gaining a basic foundation of microeconomics.",
    "The class is a basic introduction to microecon. Just be warned that the professor has a heavy Russian accent and isn't always the best at explaining concepts. If you get a tutor to go along with the course, you shouldn't have any problems.",
    "I guess it is a good class to have taken. I heard the other Econ courses were worse.",
    "I would recommend you take Economics 108. It is one of the best classes I have taken so far at Yale, and you really learn a lot. Dr. Simons is amazing. She is the reason this course is so great. I very much enjoy her lectures, and it is the only class I took this semester where I attended every single class session. She is extremely adept at explaining economic concepts in a way people with no background in economics can understand. I enjoyed her emphasis on the quantitative foundations - I feel like having so much math made the material more understandable compared to the Micro lecture class.",
    "I would certainly recommend this class over the large lecture hall format of intro microeconomics. It wasn't exactly eye-opening, though I'm not sure how much the subject allows that to begin with."
