    "You probably wouldn't take Coordination Chem if you weren't a chemistry major, so most likely you're looking for a good class to finish your major electives in. Coord Chem is a good class, although definitely more work and more difficult that some other options. Would still highly recommend, you learn a lot, and the class is interesting.",
    "Definitely take it for an advanced lecture! You have to put in a solid amount of work for a grade, but not more than other advanced lectures. Hopefully the take-home exam policy is sorted out for next time -- we were supposed to have two take-home exams, but Professor Holland was discouraged from doing a second one so we ended up having an in-class exam instead. He did give us a chance to better that score with an optional makeup test later in the semester, though. Bottom line is that it wasn't unreasonably difficult or challenging if you put in the work. Don't slack on the research proposal, and especially make sure that you know your coordination chem concepts to incorporate them into your proposal -- I found that I forgot some details from earlier in the semester and had to spend longer than I wanted re-reading my notes and book and incorporating concepts.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in inorganic or even physical chemistry, as the course ventures a lot into spectroscopy."
