    "Yes. It worth to take. It will help us know the contemporary archaeological theory systematically.",
    "\"ARCG748 is a review of popular theoretical frameworks since 1960 until now.\" I think this class is absolutely necessary for any archaeologist.",
    "Summary: This class will give you an insight of archaeological theory from processualism to the present day, through reading and debate. Be prepared do do a lot of reading that will not always be easy to understand but necessary to your growth as an archaeologist. I would recommend this as a MUST for any archaeology student, and maybe do those who study physical anthropology (if they study cultures\/people of the past) I would not recommend this to someone who is simply interested in archaeology as a side."
