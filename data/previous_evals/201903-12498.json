    "Research",
    "Learned presentation skills, the ability to develop hypothesis-driven experiments as an undergraduate research associate, and learned to communicate with professors and students on a higher-level.",
    "This semester really allowed me to take control over my project, organize my own experiments, and become far more independent than I was last year.",
    "Research",
    "Really delved deep into my research project",
    "From my lab, I learned new lab techniques, how to present in lab meeting, about my lab's work, how to write grant proposals, and how to give presentations on my research.",
    "I have learned how to carry out a hypothesis from beginning to end and to take detours and adjust that hypothesis based off of results along the way. Experimentally, I have learned how to do lots of histological imaging, particularly in coronal mouse sections. Quantification and image analysis has opened up the ability for me to examine the relative distribution of neuroinflammatory markers, which is vital in my research.",
    "I learned how to conduct scientific research and design experiments. to answer key questions in my project."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "No weaknesses, enjoyed the process.",
    "VERY disorganized. Like the syllabus REALLY needs a better outline of the expectations for students in terms of how to format papers, grants, etc. I can not tell you how many times I got the boot from my PI because of miscommunication between the syllabus and what I say. Also, the PI is never notified about how to grade the student until AFTER the fact the semester ends. I had only my mentor come to the presentation, which is probably my saving grace. But the fact that my PI could not come makes me anxious about how he\/she is grading me.",
    "There was not much guidance and information about end of the term. While it was expected to be very remote throughout the whole semester, we could have had more than two sentences about how the final report and presentation should be written\/formatted. Also, while we had all semester to prepare, it was still difficult to have to go to two different presentation sessions, present your own presentation, and write a paper in the same week. It would be nice if one of them was switched to finals or reading week.",
    "strengths- gives you the ability to really take a research project far. There's no better way to do undergraduate research honestly.",
    "All deadlines were outlined in the course contract, but it wasn't clear to me initially that we'd present our findings in December instead of the spring. Also there weren't many reminders about due dates so it would've been easy to forget to submit assignments.",
    "It obviously is just a lot of work, though I do not think there is much of a way around it. I honestly did really like the presentation to our other classmates, and the feedback and questions from others who might not have any knowledge in the field was helpful.",
    "The strength of this course is it encourages students to invest energy and time into their research. A weakness is that it can take time away from other activities and classes, as the time commitment of 20 hours\/week can balloon if experiments do not work."

   "comments": [
    "Yes",
    "Yes!",
    "I think that taking 495 is a great decision especially given the fact you get 2 credits.",
    "If you're going to be doing anywhere near 20 hours\/week of research, definitely get up to 20 and get the 2 credits\/semester for it.",
    "Not really. Do it if you want",
    "Make sure you have a great PI! Mine meets with me every other week to update on progress and guide my experimentation. it makes a huge difference.",
    "Take this if you think you'll spend like 15+ hours\/week in lab, then you might as well commit to the 20 hours\/week",
    "Required for major. 20 hours a week is a lot but very rewarding as I actually have a project that is really interesting. My advice is to find a PI early in a field that you enjoy, then the time commitment doesn't feel so bad.",
    "You should do the intensive research only if you really LOVE research. If not, 20-25 hours is a drag for sure and you will likely live at the lab. Taking the semester to really dial into research can be really sweet, but you have to know it is for you. 10-12 hours is also totally fine for those who might not be sure. Don't do this because you think you should, do this because you think you want to.",
    "I would recommend this course only to students who have the time to fully invest in their research at least 20 hours a week."
