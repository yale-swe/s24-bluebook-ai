   "comments": [
    "Given that it is still taught by Prof. Inwood, take it iff you have to.",
    "This is a great course that everyone should take because the material is so important, but allow yourself A LOT of time for writing those papers. You can write many kinds of papers last minute, but not philosophy papers. Just don't do it.",
    "I would recommend it to anyone who's intereted in ancient philosophy. The theories were not very difficult to understand yet the views themselves were",
    "This is a survey. Take it if you need to take it, but don't take it if you expect to work closely with philosophical texts. The paper topics won't force you to do much more than close-to-surface-level thought about the texts.",
    "Yes, I enjoyed learning about ancient philosophy and I feel it is knowledge that all those interested should attain.",
    "A good introduction to ancient philosophy. Will make you engage with the works but it may not necessarily be fun.",
    "A must for anyone who is slightly interested in philosophy or at least wants to know what Socrates, Plato and Aristotle said.",
    "This is a great class. Definitely take it if you're even considering philosophy as a major. Note that this isn't a particularly simple class. It requires a lot of reading and 3 essays which are pretty critixal",
    "This class will probably bore and frustrate you, unless you naturally care a whole lot about ancient philosophy. The texts are pretty interesting, and they are probably worth reading if you're interested in the (traditional western) humanities.",
    "You'll read pre Socratic philosophers first few weeks. Then Plato and then a lot of Aristotle then the stoics. Prof knows his stuff. Not too much work. Don't expect to find a philosophy for your own life here. Seek elsewhere.",
    "The course offers a general summary of ancient philosophy. While the material is valuable and interesting, the presentation was somewhat lackluster.",
    "The work load isn't too bad. The essay grading is fine and there are philosophy writing tutors that help a lot. However, the class is a surgery course and sometimes it felt more like a history class than a philosophy class. It was fine, but there are more interesting philosophy classes out there.",
    "I would summarize the class as a solid introduction to western philosophy, starting from before Socrates up to the skeptics. Plato (Socrates) and Aristotle overshadow the other philosophers in a way, but everyone is covered such that you would be able to have an intelligent conversation about their theories. I would recommend the class to another student, because it expands one's understanding of (or capability to understand) reality and the nature of one's existence. It also helps with writing, since there are three major papers to be written throughout the semester.",
    "Good introductory class to ancient Greek philosophy. Some of it will be more boring than other parts, and it's a good way to tell whether or not certain philosophical questions are interesting to you, but overall there are probably more specific courses that would be a better starting point.",
    "I would recommend taking it pass\/fail, it's a very interesting course, but hard to follow everything and the papers are very challenging.",
    "For everyone, who considers gaining some background in philosophy, this course is an absolute must. It provides exactly the right amount of breath and depth for a basis of further philosophical enquiry. As such it is incredibly valuable and an indispensable part of anyone who wants to consider herself an educated citizen.",
    "A great survey and general introduction taught by an engaging and highly approachable professor."
