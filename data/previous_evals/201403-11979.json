   "comments": [
    "I definitely learned a lot in this class. The professor is always willing to help out his students. The tests and homework were challenging but fair. I would recommend this class if you have a very strong interest in astronomy or need it for your major.",
    "It's not a bad course, but not really exceptional, either. A lot of the material is fairly interesting, but sometimes the psets can be a hassle, in that a lot of the questions from the book don't have instructions that are as clear as they should be.",
    "Take it for the major. There's a whole lot of information to learn, and it's all of about equal importance. The textbook isn't great, but usually homework isn't too difficult. Professor Kenney likes to keep going over the end of class, usually 3-4 minutes, record was 13. Not a lot of guidance as to how to prepare for tests - just review all of the online slides."
