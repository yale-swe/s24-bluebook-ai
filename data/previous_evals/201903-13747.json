   "comments": [
    "One very helpful thing with the course was hearing from the business office before we left for COP, so that issues of reimbursement were much more clear than they are in other FES contexts.",
    "Strengths: very well-organized, great speakers invited, all questions were answered promptly Weaknesses: none",
    "The format was helpful. I wouldn't recommend making any changes.",
    "No concerns here, it all seemed to fit the brief.",
    "The COP process is confusing but I think the student TA and faculty did a good job providing information that was useful",
    "It is a good course.",
    "I'm not sure that I should answer these questions as I was the TF for the course.",
    "na",
    "Would have liked to feel more like a cohort attending together. More focus on building that, ie organizing flights and lodging with more intentionality to keep the group together as much as possible.",
    "The course was very helpful for answering student questions and coordinating with other classmates. I would have appreciated more written content, for example, providing answers to common FAQs, past examples of work plans (for a national delegation and for an NGO), links to relevant UNFCCC and COP websites over Canvas (not just showing them on the projector), and instructions about student reimbursements over Canvas (not WhatsApp). It would have been especially useful to give more guidance on creating a work plan, recognizing that each student's work plan will be different."

    "Take the initiative - the quality of your time at COP depends on your work and research beforehand. The course guides you, but it's really up to you to put in the time.",

    "This course is extremely helpful in preparing for upcoming COPs.",
    "Believe them when they say it can be hard to find time to eat at COP.",

Communicate with the organization or country you are working with lots before you get there but be prepared for them to take a long time to get back to you. COP is super hectic and you, as an intern, are not a priority.",
