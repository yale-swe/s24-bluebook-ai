    "364 is a multidisciplinary approach to choreographic style in American musical theater from the 1940s to the present. Focusing on four dances by different choreographers, this class allows students to experience firsthand the dance's intricacies while fitting it into the overall context of musical theater. Definitely recommendto anybody interested in either dance or musical theater.",
    "I took this course as a second semester senior wanting something different. I hesitated for lack of experience in theater studies or dance, but couldn't be happier that I stuck with it.Where to begin?You'll have four units on four different choreographers. Two hours per week will be spent with a guest professional learning some of that choreographer's work and another two hours will be spent discussing the work, the person, and the historical context from which that person emerged. Yes, it's a lot of time in class, but I must say that this was one of those rare classes where you always wished there were MORE time.The professors are brilliant. Dan Egan knows musical theater history front to back and it is always a pleasure running ideas back and forth with him. Believe me, he will not be shy about sharing his! Emily Coates is one of Yale's treasures. She has so much dance experience and also brings a lot to the game academically. Together, Dan and Emily make a phenomenal team.There is a good deal of outside work for this class: weekly readings and blog posts, as well as two papers. Its definitely manageable, and was usually fun.I would take this class over and over again if I could and would love knowing that other people decided to have this experience too.",
    "I took this class as a dancer with no acting or singing background. I'd never really thought seriously about dance in musical theater, but this course introduced me to the material in a way that was both engaging and enlightening. We studied the works of four major choreographers: de Mille, Robbins, Fosse, and Jones. For each we learned a particularly famous excerpt of dance. We also held discussions every other class, covering readings and viewings. The key here is to be CONSTANTLY drawing connections between the two modes. Don't keep performer and student divided; both doing and thinking will help you make some really amazing discoveries. I recommendthis class highly to anyone interested in the subject or the Shen curriculum.",
    "This was a great class - the experience of learning choreography from 4 Broadway shows was incredible, whether or not you have significant dance background. Somewhat different in style of discussion\/investigation than the other dance studies courses because of the nature of the material.",
    "A quirky little gem with a very niche academic audience. Honestly, as a performer, I may have gotten more out of this class with twice as much time spent on the practical components, but that's not the Yale way. Good mix of choreography styles, and definitely more useful for intermediate level dancers than super-beginner or super-advanced.Some of the paper writing seemed a little wishy-washy, but maybe there's lingering bias on my part about the potential of contemporary dance scholarship. Overall, enjoyable, but not life changing. A good 5th class.",
    "This class is unlike any other you will take. If it is something that strikes your interest, I would definitely check it out, as it is one of those rare alignments of the stars that will probably not come around all too often. Dan Egan and Emily Coates are both wonderful individually, and they make a great teaching duo, bringing expansive knowledge of the worlds of musical theater and dance, respectively. The chance to perform actual dances from musical theater history, taught by professional choreographers, was invaluable (though do not expect an advanced level of dance training in the class). Finally, the emphasis on movement research brings the students of the class into a field that is still developing, one in which their voice and the things they say actually carry weight and are innovative (something you may not find in a lot of other classes)!",
    "Yes!"
