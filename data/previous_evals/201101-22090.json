   "comments": [
    "It's a great way to fulfill the language requirement without just doing grammar tables. The material is interesting and Professor Hayes is fun to learn with.",
    "fun, cool mirashim, a nice 5th class",
    "The class was very interesting and Professor Hayes was excellent, but I found the topic a little too narrow for an entire semester. After a while, the different Midrashim appeared really similar and boring. Nevertheless, I would still recommend this class for its interesting discussions and the great, fascinating insights Professor Hayes brings to the table.",
    "Very interesting, worthwhile class. Not too heavy, good view of a very broad class of literature. Brilliant and friendly professor.",
    "Overall assessment: A great broad overview to many types of midrash, although the material is a little inaccessible when it hinges on subtle Hebrew grammatical points.Strengths: Interesting to study a topic in such detail and great exposure to types of midrash, current scholarly research on the topic, and a fabulous professor!Weakness: Sometimes difficult to engage with material (because of the language barrier: many readings in Ancient Hebrew, some in Aramaic). Also, the skill level of the students varied greatly and made class discussion skewed and sometimes unintelligible.",
    "Take this course if you are interested in Biblical commentary. It's an L5 Hebrew course so be ready for the amount of Biblical Hebrew thrown at you. If you don't know Hebrew very well the course is pretty hard.",
    "Yes, yes, yes. Take this or any class with Professor Hayes, even if you don't have prior Jewish education. She makes the material she loves so accessible and dare I say, fun!",
    "I would recommend this course to another student interested in Judaism and biblical interpretation. The course is a great way to learn about rabbinic interpretive techniques as well as current scholarship in the area of Midrash. Also, it is a fun course!",
    "Jdst400 is a great class. Even if you have never had experience working with this type of material before, Professor Hayes makes it accessible and enjoyable. An amazing way to delve into Biblical exegesis.",
    "The Midrash Seminar on the Golden Calf is an amazingly fun and engaging exploration on interpretation of the Golden Calf story in Exodus, from inner biblical exegesis to translations to rabbinic midrash. I would certainly recommend the class to a student passionate about Judaism with some fluency in Hebrew. Whether you are a graduate of yeshiva in Israel or have just learned the basics, you'll gain a lot from this class."
