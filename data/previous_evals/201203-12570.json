   "comments": [
    "Anthropology 311 is an overview of structuralism from Durkheim to L\u00c3\u00a9vi-Strauss to Foucault. The reading list is fantastic and Professor Shneiderman is absolutely, inexpressibly fantastic. It has been my favorite class that I've taken at Yale and I've told all my friends to take it. If you're looking for a deep, textual understanding of structuralism, praxis theory, and semiotics, take this class! It'll change your life.",
    "A small seminar focused on the great works of former and modern anthropology, social theory, and critical theory. This course is essential for Anthro majors and would be very enriching for anyone studying the humanities or social sciences.",
    "Although this is a course full of dense reading, it is a must take if you hope to really understand what anthropology means. It is really eye opening and really cool. Totally worth it.",
    "This class succeeded as a survey of the major texts that have informed anthropological thought in the 20th century. I thought that the discussions were for the most part fruitful and thought-provoking, and Professor Shneiderman really helps her students to understand some of the more difficult texts. Be prepared to do a lot of reading, especially at the end of the semester, but it's definitely worth it! Even though the class doesn't really deal with modern anthropological theory, it's still a class worth taking for anybody who wants to major in anthropology and\/or get a higher degree in anthropology.",
    "This course teaches the main theoretical arc in anthropology in the 20th Century. The reading list is excellent and rigorous, the papers very intellectually demanding. I found it similar to Directed Studies. And Professor Shneiderman is spectacular: very good at explaining things and very good at leading discussion. One caveat, I recommend you take it conjunction or sequence with an ethnography course (Field Methods, etc.). I didn't, and I lost out on how to apply the theoretical stuff to actual projects. Also, we had to write a total of 5 papers. On top of often considerable amounts of reading, it came to be a lot of work.",
    "I took this course because I believed it to be essential knowledge for any anthropology major. While I certainly gained a lot, the course is pretty intensive and I warn anyone that you have to be into theory to really enjoy this course. After a point I got a little exhausted by it and wished that the course could have included readings that demonstrated how anthropologists applied these essential theories in ethnographic settings. Professor Shneiderman is welcoming and generally a good discussion leader, though sometimes I felt she could have explained points a little more clearly. The course is also rather writing intensive (despite the lack of wr credit), with 5 short papers (supposedly 1000 words, but we all wrote far more) and one final paper. Overall, I still maintain that all anthro majors should take the course, though I would like to see some changes made.",
    "a hidden gem that you must take if you are human and want to understand the nature of some of the forces (social) that govern your mode of being. lots of individual attending given to make sure that you've understood the incredible ideas presented in class. a little challenging with the number of papers to write; but the papers help you understand and are completely worth the time invested. mostly full of anthro students but some others, like me, took anthro for the first time and were quite blown away but the freshness of ideas in this field, ideas that this class makes sure to tackle head on each time. you'll always have learned something incredibly interesting upon leaving each session. to better judge i do recommend you look through the syllabus and perhaps pick up a book or two before hand (personal recommendation: durkheim\/bourdieu)"
