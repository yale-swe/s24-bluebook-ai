   "comments": [
    "Take this course! There are some great readings and Professor Horan is really fantastic at leading group discussions.",
    "We discussed how to define poverty, design policy, and measure its efficacy.",
    "The title of this class is pretty straightforward: it's a class about urban poverty and the policies attempt to combat poverty. The readings are interesting and the reading load is manageable, but you do actually have to do the readings in this class, think critically about them, and then write a 1-2 page comment on the readings every week. So, it's manageable but not if you're looking to just \"coast.\" Professor Horan is really wonderful and incredibly dedicated to helping her students. I wrote my senior essay in this course and had a very good experience doing that; again she was very helpful and supportive. I would absolutely recommend taking this class.",
    "Definitely take this class if you're at all interested in the topic, you will learn a lot. Professor Horan is not really that scary at all, so don't be intimidated by stories, she's great. There were only 7 people in my class and not many of them were very loud so be careful if it looks like it's going to be small. Also she WILL read your reading responses before class and ask you to talk about them to stimulate discussion. Don't freak out, she probably thought you had a good idea and wants the class to talk about it, it's just the way she starts discussions. Obviously you have to actually do the reading responses, but they're really not that bad, just make connections between readings. You get two free weeks, so use them well.",
    "Take if you are into poverty policy.",
    "Take the course if you are interested in learning about poverty in the context of the American city. Topics covered vary from community to economic development."
