   "comments": [
    "The studio went approximately as expected. I think it would have benefited from more consistent pinups and sharing of work as a studio. After the initial research phase, the studio became very individualized into groups working alone. The work atmosphere became mildly hostile at times. This was not an issue within groups (no major conflicts within any single team), but rather between the 4 teams all working in isolation and trying to keep ideas and strategies secret from one another. This is not the instructors' fault, but more routine, standardized sharing and progress updates might have prevented the competition and secrecy and led to a more productive semester for all.",
    "Most of my expectations for this studio were not met. Please see below:1)I expected to work with Bjarke Ingles at least a little. This was not the case. He showed up for the mid and final reviews only.2)I expected to work with Douglas Durst at least a little. This was not the case. He showed up for the mid and final reviews and once via Skype. There was also very little developer input for the Tappan Zee site as most of the expertise seemed too revolve around the NYC area.3)I expected the studio to have some kind of logistical method to make use of structuring the studio around teams, but there was none. It would have been just as successful ofa studio to have teams of two or individual projects.4)There was no clearly define brief at the start of the project which made it difficult to clarify the goals of the studio.5)I do not know why the studio was broken into two different sites. This fragmented the research and provided unnecessary divisions inn studio for who got what site. Also the Tappan Zee site selection, though the more realistic of the two sites, was the least in line with the larger utopian(i.e. \"BIG\") vision for the studio.",
    "The research aspect of the studio was great. The manner in which that would be turned into an architectural project was not as clear.The development aspect of the studio was unfulfilled. I don't have any more clear understanding of the mentality of development than before the studio began.",
    "High expectations, very low outcomes.",
    "I expected groups to do more inventive things but they were no pushed to far. The Tappan Zee site was a bad choice. The scale made it much to different from the 42nd street bridge. It turned into a planning exercise.Perhaps there should have been 6 teams of 2 rather than 4 teams of 3.",
    "I wanted to approach a studio project like a developer, and this studio gave me the opportunity to do just that. I think it was probably the best studio I've done here at Yale."

    "The studio travel was great - excellent resources.",
    "No, we need more user space and class folder space. 8gb is embarrassing. The class folder should allow for studios, especially those working in teams to have more room on the server.",
    "Yes."
