    "I would recommend this class to someone who was very interested in homosexuality in the military.",
    "This is a good introduction to WGSS for someone who's interested in war; I didn't realize that there were so many connections between the two subjects. The coursework wasn't too bad: 6 weekly papers that can be done anytime over the semester, a final paper, and class attendance.",
    "Gives a good overview of the close ties between gender propaganda and gender politics and war. Great class for WGSS or AMST majors.",
    "Yes it is a solid seminar.",
    "War, Gender, and Sexuality is your typical seminar course: readings, reading responses, final paper. If it's taught again, it won't be taught by Timothy Stewart-Winter, which is a sad thing. With that said, it will definitely be a different course from this semester. Still, this course should be taken by anyone interested in war and sexuality, especially considering current debates over DADT.",
