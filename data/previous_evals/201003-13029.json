   "comments": [
    "This class is all about polishing conversational and writing skills. We read a variety of works ranging from Guy de Maupassant to the theater of the absurd.",
    "A good review of French grammar from the AP with a bit extra. The readings and films are all very good. The five two-page essays (worth a total of 20% of the class grade) are good practice for writing, but are graded fairly hardly. Not very good practice for speaking French, with the exception of two oral exams. Overall, a good course for securing your knowledge of French grammar, expanding your vocabulary, and engaging with some interesting texts and films. However, if your goal is to become a more fluid speaker of French, then this is not the best class for that.",
    "Yes, because even though it is a lot of work, it is quite rewarding for your written and spoken french. The course includes many types of works, as in films, books, plays, and novellas, all of which are pretty entertaining.",
    "It's a great course overall--the course material was engaging, and as long as you were prepared, each class generally went by very quickly. Unfortunately, some of the lectures were a bit rushed, which was not helped by the large class size.Definitely take it, either as a lead in or a course after doing Summer Session at Paris.",
    "I would summarize the course as well-balanced and ideal for those who wish to refresh their knowledge of grammar. I would recommend it for a fellow student if he or she wanted to work mainly in their writing skills and vocabulary, instead of speaking and listening comprehension.",
    "I would summarize FREN 150 as a course that helps students to improve writing, comprehension and reading skills, speaking skills, and vocabulary. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who want to improve French skills and gain more confidence (especially writing and reading in French).",
    "I would recommend this class to someone who wanted to improved their overall french skills and wanted a continuation of the L1-L4 style of teaching.",
    "Thorough review of everything you learned in L1-L4 with an emphasis on filling in the gaps and solidifying your knowledge. Emphasis is on conversation although there is a lot of reading. Not much writing, especially coming from Intensive French."
