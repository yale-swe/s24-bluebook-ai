    "First half of the semester, students learn theoretical material for the course, and it is great. Personally spending good amount of time learning theoretical stances on the matter really grounded my project firmly. However, i wish I had more time with my project. Perhaps starting to design just before the spring break might help. Because fabrication of the project takes certain amount of time, design process was cut short.",
    "The course covers from Ruskin to today, so it is extremely comprehensive. The required reading responses, however, were too much work for a class that does not require a final paper.",
    "The content of both reading and case study material were very helpful and clear. It provided goog understading of the subject, \"ornament and technology\".",
    "The materials are very comprehensive and related to the topic. Half seminar and half fabrication program is interesting but leaves less time for the final project, especially when students are all busy with their studio and paper production.",
    "The course divides the semester into two parts. The first provides theoretical background and the second seeks material experimentation. This general structure is effective but I think that the amount of time for the material exercise was too short and the theoretical discussion maybe too long. Starting the material exercise earlier in the semester will provide the students more time to accomplish a more refined and challenging production.The first assignment that required an exploration of the CNC tools of the school was interesting but the assignment of making a model from the readings was not very productive.",
    "The readings and discussions essentially dealt with how to define \"ornament\" in the modern age, but I feel we never reached a clear definition of what ornament is. That being said, my understanding of the issues improved significantly."

   "comments": [
    "My expectations were medium, and they were met. However, I expected less theory and more building, and that was not the case.",
    "The expectation for this course was to learn and discuss on ornament. Due to the short amount of time for the design and fabrication, the second half of the seminar was little of frustration.",
    "My expectations are met quite well. The discourse is interesting by itself and our project came out nice as we hoped, thanks to Ben's helpful criticism.",
    "I expected to learn about the discussions on ornament and understand its relevance in contemporary practice and my expectations were met. The results of the fabrication exercise were not as successful as I expected.",
    "I expected to gain a better understanding of the theory of ornament and its relevance to the contemporary architectural discourse. I would say that the readings and assignments satisfied these expectations."

    "This course has a medium value for me, and it was met.",
