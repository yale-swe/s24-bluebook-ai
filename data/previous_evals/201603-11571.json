   "comments": [
    "I was able to practice and learn how to design a study and carry out the logistics and finer details.",
    "I learned how to conduct hands-on research in the field of disinhibitory psychology, working with participants, analyzing data, working with empirical papers and formulating new research ideas.",
    "I was able to improve my ability to read and engage with scientific papers. I also developed my ability to think of new research ideas from preexisting literature.",
    "I have learned a lot about the beginning stages of the research process, including idea development and pilot data collection.",
    "I learned how to write a professional and synthesized research report, I learned more about Autism, and I learned more about what it is like to work in a research lab.",
    "I got to do my independent research and get a kick start on my senior project, which was very instructive and productive.",
    "It's always fun being able to learn through doing. I got a lot of insight on how to work in a psychology lab, and the day to day requirements of the job. This is particularly useful because I am planning on going to grad school, and it's good to get lab experience.",
    "Experimental setup\/design",
    "I learned vital skills in research, experimental design, human subjects requirements, and official proposal writing.",
    "This \"course\" was incredible in the fact that I got to contribute to clinical research and in doing so I learned more than I could have in so many other classes. I learned about the clinical recruitment process, EEG setup and processing, interpersonal skills and so many other things.",
    "I continued to work on my thesis this semester, managing to crunch some data with my advisor Ema Tanovic and working on other projects in the lab at the same time, including phone screening, tracking clinical recruitment for lab meetings, helping out with our clinical battery protocol and completing various administrative tasks for Ema. I continued to hone and develop the skills and theoretical background in clinical psychology that I've been acquiring since the summer before last!",
    "Learn the in-and-outs of what goes on in a research lab. This is especially helpful if you're thinking about a Ph.D. program after graduation.",
    "This course is a true gem. Professor Chance is incredible.",
    "I developed an understanding of how psychological research works in one particular area: affect and cognition in clinical disorders. I learned how to conduct a research protocol, which included administering surveys, measuring eye gaze with an eye-tracker, and recording electrical signals from the brain using electroencephalography (EEG). Additionally, in my literature review final paper, I examined the phenomenon of social pain as processed in the brain's affective pain circuit and applied it to the pathology of depression."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths - lab meeting were always great place of discussion and I felt like I really benefited from listening to ideas of my peers and grad students. Weaknesses; there wasn't as much structure as I would have liked. I think having formal lessons on how to come up with research questions and what exactly to look for when reading scientific papers would have been helpful",
    "The independent research experience depends a lot on who your advisor is. It is a lot of fun and a very fulfilling process if you choose a graduate student and PI with whom you work well. In my experience, the course offered the perfect balance of structure\/guidance and independence\/autonomy.",
    "This course was great. I liked working independently in the lab, and being able to focus on the areas of Autism that I find interesting. There is nothing that I can think of that needs to be improved.",
    "The course is mostly self-paced, so it's important for the faculty sponsor to check in with the student to make sure they're on track.",
    "I probably should have met with my advisor Ema (more) to go over thesis stuff, but I think it's going to work out fine in the end, plus we were both quite busy this semester. I very much appreciated the feedback I received on my thesis introduction -- it really helped me to re-draft what I had written and create something that I think was much clearer and to-the-point.",
    "10 hours\/week will be more than you put into your other classes, so consistently doing this every week can be a bit much. If you have a great PI and graduate student, though, everything will be okay.",
    "Very low workload, very high reward.",
    "Since this course was individualized and based on the lab I worked in, I don't think its strengths and weaknesses could be applied to other students."

   "comments": [
    "yes, MoD squad for life. Thanks for another great semester, Arielle.",
    "Yes, I think conducting independent research is a great way to complete the senior requirement for the Psychology major, especially if you are trying to determine whether psychology research is what you want to pursue after college.",
    "Yes, absolutely. This course is a great way to engage in material and lab research that you are interested in.",
    "I highly recommend doing research for credit. Though 10 hours is more than I usually spend on a 1 credit class per week, I find that this experience is extremely useful.",
    "Absolutely yes",
    "Take directed research if you can! Great way to get a credit if you work in a psychology lab and want to get some academic recognition for your work. All it takes extra is a 10-page paper at the end and a presentation during the middle of the semester in lab meeting (depending on your advisor's preference).",
    "Yes. Do research in a lab if you want to go to graduate school or want to experience something different than the typical classroom-style setting. Also, take this course if you want to meet professors in a different capacity. Doing research with them lets them see you in a different light and it helps you develop a more than superficial relationship that may come in handy down the line.",
    "100% yes.",
    "For students interested in discovering how research in psychology is actually conducted, I would highly recommend taking 493. Be prepared to delve deeply into a specific topic for your final paper--it is a challenging but highly rewarding experience."
