    "Seeing as it is a required course, the issue of recommendation is a moot point. Still, I am glad that we had to take this class, as I do think it was helpful in ways I hadn't even anticipated.

    "This course didn't contribute to my dissertation\/research, but it was very helpful in deepening my knowledge of one aspect of my profession. While my eventual goal is to teach literature courses, I will almost certainly have to teach language courses at some point, even once I finish with my departmental teaching requirements here. This course will make me a better teacher, and a more attractive job candidate, I believe.",
    "This course did not contribute to my research, but it did prepare me to be a very good Spanish teacher."
