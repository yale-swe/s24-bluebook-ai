   "comments": [
    "I would recommend it to anyone looking to study African history over the past 100 years",
    "Take it. Good first hand experiences.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to find out more about a broad variety of African countries. It isn't really a history course, though there are aspects of history incorporated. It's more of an overview of why parts of Africa are the way they are today. It's really fascinating. Lots of reading, but the books are almost all interesting and readable.",
    "Slightly boring but interesting subject and not too difficult. I'd recommend it.",
    "recommended. however a bit repetitive at times",
    "Yes, great survey course.",
    "I probably wouldn't recommend this class. It's pretty easy to do well without doing much work, despite the heavy reading load, but I don't feel that I learned very much. Professor Onoma is very kind and has interesting things to say, and lectures were always pretty interesting, but the course lacks the kind of cohesion that I've found in courses from which I've learned a lot in the past.",
    "Not a lot of work and a pretty interesting class.",
    "You should take this class. You go to lecture, take notes, and write your four papers.",
    "A very general and broad lesson on African Politics. I recommend it because it is pretty laid back and the lectures are not huge. The prof is awesome too.",
    "Good class, not too much work. Interesting course",
    "I would definitely recommend Intro to African politics to anyone. It is a manageable course and as long as you do the readings and come to lecture, the work (midterms and finals) is relatively straightforward. The professor is a great lecturer and covers a wide breadth of interesting topics. I recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn more about Africa since this class covered a lot for a one semester course; topics spanned from the effects of colonialism to how identity politics affect current events.",
    "Professor Onoma is really interesting and insightful-- he has a way of making you think of things in ways you never have before, and I think that is one of the most valuable components of his class. I would definitely recommend to other students to take this class-- or any class-- with Professor Onoma because I just enjoyed this class and his unique gift as a professor so much. I would also really recommend actually paying attention to what he says. What Professor Onoma had to say was always enlightening, and again I think his manner of lecturing was perhaps the most valuable component of the entire class.",
    "it is a great class if you have no background knowledge on African politics and economics. great class. take it!",
    "No, there did not seem to be a clear theme to the course.",
    "Ok fifth class. Only a map quiz, and take home midterm and final - you have a choice of three questions and have to write 5 page papers in response to two of the questions.",
    "I would recommend it for anyone who wants a good overview of African politics.",
    "This course has manageable workload, though keep in mind it is a book a week of reading. I'd say the lectures were good, but the content was more generalized than I would have liked. The midterm\/final are take-home, which is really great."
