    "Textiles of Asia was a great way to get my Asian fulfillment out of the way-- if you're interested in taking a class that is based in the YUAG's collections and really getting to know the textile traditions of Asia. That being said, all you learn about are textiles... so be prepared to gain a lot of pretty useless knowledge. But the work load is very light and Barnes is incredible, so you should take this class!",
    "I would recommend it if you really want to put work into the final research project. That is the best part of the class, and where I learned the most. The lectures and looking at textiles is great, but it takes some additional reading and puzzling to pinpoint major themes in the development in textiles."
