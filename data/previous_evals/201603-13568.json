    "I enjoyed this seminar-style course. We learned about various tobacco related issues each week and then for homework we provided feedback on what we learned and developed quiz questions based on the lecture content."

    "great grad student course and i would definitely recommend it because it gives you a lot of new\/different information on a topic that has been a part of the public health field for decades",
    "marney and dana were great, but the course didn't really seem to have a clear focus and the material became a little redundant. I learned a lot about why smoking is bad and how e-cigarettes are changing the field but not necessarily how policy and science intersect. take the course if you're really interested in the topic.",
    "Great course",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course to a fellow student.",
    "Yes, will recommend",
    "Excellent course. The course is really organized and was my best course at the school of public health so far. Marney and Dana had a lot of experience. They put a lot of energy and effort to make sure we had the best guest and best learning experience. I also recommend anyone in the AP program who is interested in tobacco control to take this course.",
    "Most week you attend a 1 to 1:30 lecture and then complete assignments regarding the lecture. The class is being turned into an online course and thus the assignments are usually an evaluation of online material.",
    "This course is structured the way all graduate level courses should be! You learn various material each week and then provide feedback on the lectures for homework. There are no tests or quizzes. Aside from the homework, which was not assigned every week, there was a final project."
