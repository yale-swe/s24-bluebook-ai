    "This class deepen my knowledge in algebraic geometry and modular forms theory, it exploited connections between the two branches and gave me a better understanding of notion familiar to experts in representation theory (Hecke operators). Also, provided the constructions of the moduli space of elliptic curves over a base scheme that I found to be very detailed."
