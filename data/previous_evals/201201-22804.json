    "English 120 is a non-fiction personal essay writing course. If you've taken a course like it in the past (i.e. AP Lang or some class where you read Orwell's \"Politics and the English Language\"), you will already be somewhat familiar with the style of writing. The main benefit comes from reading a large number of models and interacting with your professor.Professor Shirkhani is very attentive to her students. She was very available and talking with her was always helpful, which is even more impressive considering she took on two sections of 17 students this term. She is sweet and knowledgeable, and her sections were probably the most sought-after during shopping.I went into 120 hoping my writing would improve, and I think it did. It's rather hard to get an A (across all sections I believe), which is why I took this Credit\/D (still did a lot of work).",
    "Take it with Shirkhani! She's so supportive and sweet, and really cares about what you have to say. I didn't mind having this class at 9 am, and that's saying something. The kind of writing you use for this class is more fun than what you'll do in most others (research papers, etc). Even if you're already confident in your writing skills, you'll become more aware of different tools and come out of it with some pretty good essays (hopefully).",
    "Assignments are great, readings are excellent. Take it. Every teacher is supposedly great, but get Shirkhani if you can. She's fantastic.",
    "This class is an absolute MUST for every Yale undergraduate. It not only helped me develop a love for writing; it also, more importantly, prompted me to really think about my surroundings and write with a sense of my identity and purpose (which can both be easy to forget in a place as fast-paced as Yale).",
    "English 120 was a fun course. I know everyone says their writing improves drastically, but I feel like I just got feedback and had a clearer sense of what styles of writing I was better at. The readings were fun for the most part. The workload honestly depends on how much effort you're willing to put into your essays. You could make the course take up your entire life if you wanted, or spend the bare minimum time required to write the essays.I would def. recommend taking 120 w\/Prof. Shirkhani. She's really fun\/engaging and approachable during office hours. She gives you feedback on both the rough and final, and everyone gets one of their essays workshopped by the class as well.",
    "This course is a wonderful course to have under your belt for the rest of your Yale education. Although it can be rigorous, those who step up to the challenge will be glad they did. I am a science major, and I throughly enjoyed the course. It is truly a great way to get that WR credit.",
    "I would recommend ENGL 120 wholeheartedly. You will regret nothing.",
    "I would recommend taking this class while at Yale - it is a great class centered on personal writing with broader application and can really improve your personal writing style in any respect.",
    "If you do not like reading New Yorker articles, do not take this class.",
    "English 120 is an extremely useful course that every Yale student should probably take before graduating. It\u0092s a lot of work \u0096 you write five essays, turning in a draft or a final revision every week, in addition to ungraded exercises throughout \u0096 but it\u0092s certainly worth it, and none of the assignments are redundant. The essay topics are unlike anything you\u0092ve probably had to write before at Yale (personal experience, profile of a person, profile of a place, cultural critique, and satire, in our class), and although at first you\u0092ll complain that they force you to think outside the box and be more creative than you\u0092re used to, in the end it\u0092s a very worthwhile experience, and the kind of reading and writing you do in the course is much more relevant, applicable, and useful to any field of study or career path than the typical English writing course that focuses on analytical reading and writing of literary works. The amount of reading for each class is highly manageable and comparatively shorter than in other English classes, because you spend most of your time outside of class writing. If you can take it with Professor Shirkhani, you should definitely do so: she is wonderful, engaging, and funny; her syllabus is great (the readings are all useful, interesting, and fun to read); and her comments on your essays and drafts (both on paper and in person) are helpful, specific, and thorough.",
    "There is a decent amount of reading involved in English 120, but it is definitely worth it. It is very interesting and you learn a lot. I would definitely recommend English 120 to another student. Take it with Professor Shirkhani! She is great!",
    "Take it. Put time into your essays. Do your readings. You'll get what you put into this class out of it.",
    "When selecting this course, make sure you are interested in the content. The professors are all wonderful and your writing will improve. At the same time, the style of writing and the type of essays in the course is very particular. Make sure that it is a style that you will enjoy, because it is not for everyone."
