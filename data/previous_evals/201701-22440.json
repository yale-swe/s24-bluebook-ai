    "Discussing about papers",
    "Ability to critically read literature and hold discussions about the papers.",
    "This class was meant to teach skills to read a variety of different papers. However, the topics were so disjointed and very little background information was given to truly allow in-depth understanding of some topics. Often times, the significance of the paper was lost on me, someone with a predominantly biochemical background. I did not really learn too much about biophysics, which was the intention of this course I think.",
    "Reading papers outside of my persecutive field, critiquing about computational and experimental method, and study of papers in interdisciplinary areas."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Some of the sessions are really great and super organized, but some of them are kinda confusing.",
    "Strengths: I think reading papers and have cross-discipline discussions was the best aspect of this course. Weakness: Some of the papers were not the best for such discussions, I wished we had read more seminal papers of the field. The timing\/length of the class was also difficult.",
    "I enjoyed the format of this class, I thought the student discussions were very helpful and allowed me to feel more prepared for the discussions with faculty members.",
    "Weaknesses: More background must be provided The discussions are only as good as the professors' questions. The best experience I had in this class was with Tony Koleske who asked many engaging questions and really allowed us to understand his papers. I was worried until then that it was my and my classmates lack of understanding that was causing the long and somewhat awkward silences that would occur during some classes, and the professors made me feel that way sometimes. However, after the session with Tony, I felt as though my class proved that we could do a good job analyzing the papers when asked the right questions. Some professors barely knew what the class was about (one thought it was an undergraduate seminar) and perhaps if they understood better what the goals were, we would all have a better time.",
    "Because each week is a different professor with a different flavor, a lot of time it takes a lot of effort to really get used to the class. Especially I am a bit introvert, chances that I can participate get slimmed while every time there is a new face in the class. Papers are sometimes not as interdisciplinary as we think."

    "Probably not in its current form.",
    "Yes, this is an excellent chance to meet different professors across departments and to discuss various types of papers that are very different from our field expertise."
