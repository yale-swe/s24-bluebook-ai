    "This is the best seminar I've taken at Yale. Without doubt, take this course if interested in the largely theoretical nature of the class.",
    "Professor Kapustin is a masterful seminar leader. The course is a philosophy course on the nature of violence in all its forms, and by the end of the course you will have a completely new conception of violence. The course is really half-lecture, half-seminar, as Professor Kapustin would direct us in mulling over the readings for a while before weighing him himself. Though his talks could occasionally be repetitive, they were always helpful, and I did not feel short changed at all on either end of the talking-listening spectrum. The other members of the class were all intelligent, which led to some great class discussions. The midterm is a straightforward, do you understand the writers, take home, while the final paper is 15-18 pages on whatever you want. Yes, yes, yes, take this course.",
    "Definitely take it if you are interested in the topic!",
    "Absolutely recommended. A good, solid intellectual challenge with an excellent teacher.",
    "BEST COURSE I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. Prof. Kapustin is an all-star professor. This course is not to be missed. You will never look at politics, violence, or the combination of the two in the same way. You have to do the readings to make the most of this course and participate in the discussions.",
    "We read the key readings concerning political violence - focusing on the themes of structural, physical and symbolic violence as well as nonviolence. The best readings were Pierre Bourdieu, Hannah Arendt, Alexandre Kojeve, Walter Benjamin, and Barrington Moore, Jr. I would absolutely recommend this course but be prepared for a great deal of difficult reading. But Professor Kapustin is great at explaining and leading class discussion.",
    "Critique of Political Violence examines specifically the concepts of coercion, violence, structural violence, revolutionary violence, and non-violence. In other words, this course has little or nothing to do with interstate violence, but instead focuses mainly on questions of violence and coercion within society, primarily in political contexts (revolutionary responses to structural violence, state violence against the people for good or ill, terrorism, nonviolence, and justification of violence in all these contexts). The course is heavily theoretical, which of course means the professor and students may and will still reference real world examples of violence in their discussions, but that those examples or 'test-cases' will not be presented in the texts (with the exception of the final discussion, which examines the Vendee revolution in France).The course turned out to be a deep and interesting look at the topic, directed by one of the best (if not THE best) seminar professor you'll find at Yale. The only disappointments came when we ran out of time for discussion. TAKE THIS COURSE.",
    "Definitely. Great understanding of violence from a philosophical angle..",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. However, the course is challenging, and it is important to stay engaged throughout the semester. But it's very worthwhile! Do the reading before class, and come to seminar with questions and thoughts about the (extremely dense) texts that you have read.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. It very interesting, and while there is a lot of work it is definitely manageable. The professor is great, and you actually leave having learned something really fascinating.",
    "Absolutely take this class. Professor Kapustin is the most intelligent professor I have had at Yale. He was a joy to have as a teacher. Every time he opened his mouth I was excited to hear what he would say, and he spoke with such genuine passion for the subject that it was impossible not to love whatever author we were discussing, him, and everyone around you who was experiencing the same excitement. The workload is high but manageable and worth doing. Be aware that the class will be very theoretical and philosophy-heavy, but even as someone used to talking about case studies I found it fascinating. Take it if you can."
