    "I think the biggest takeaway was really how consulting with a client is actually like in the real world. it is uncertain, it is ambiguous, and it is challenging.",
    "This course was great at developing crucial skills for the work environment: working on a team, collaboration, meeting deadlines, developing deliverables to meet a client's needs, etc. I also developed a better understanding of certain data analysis tools as well as a deep understanding of Nigerian social, political, and economic issues.",
    "I learned about the main drivers of violence in Nigeria and ways in which to improve financial transparency at the federal level. The depth of this knowledge is frankly pretty shallow and could have been obtained in one or two weeks of a more rigorous, better designed course."

   "comments": [
    "The groups of 8 to 10 are really too big to be productive. Groups should be about 5 or 6 maximum to be really effective. Also, there should not be a common theme for all the capstones, simply because it seems to be forcing everyone into a similar topic, in which not everyone is interested in.",
    "I believe that Jackson should do more in the lead-up to Capstone projects to conduct workshops on how to organize work-streams, collaborate in a team, etc. It was difficult to discover a team system on the fly while trying to please a client.",
    "You get to apply things you learned to real life situations. The aim of the project is up in the air at times",
    "To be entirely candid: I recognize that this feedback is going to the Jackson Institute and therefore will either (a) not be read or (b) be read and promptly discarded. However, I write this with the hope that it will receive a modicum of attention. In theory, the capstone can be the gem of the Global Affairs major. I laud this innovative program for allowing students to apply their skills, talents, and knowledge to a real world problem in a team environment. In reality, the program is a disaster. Professor King told us that this project is supposed to mirror a McKinsey or Bain style consulting project. Many of my friends work as these firms full time. My dad was a consulting partner for 20 years. This capstone could not have been further from a McKinsey or Bain project. It was hopelessly disorganized, mismanaged, and built on a crippling lack of accountability and quality controls. There was no attempt to teach students basic consulting skills such as how to interact with clients, build presentations, structure strategic questions, design efficient workstreams, educate oneself about the client and the industry, etc. etc. etc. Even if there were an effort to teach these fundamental and crucial skills, who would be doing it? Individuals who have zero credibility in a corporate consulting environment; while some of the professors do consult here and there independently, they are in no position to credibly discuss fine-tuned corporate frameworks employed by top-tier firms like McKinsey or Bain. My professor literally told us consulting is making BS look legit! and admitted to manipulating and confusing us intentionally in order to simulate a client experience. He made it clear that his goal was to produce something impressive to the client and meet the client demands that all of us thought were misguided (which is completely contrary to a McKinsey or Bain value system). He would berate and belittle students in class on one day and, on another day, bring muffins to us and tell us how impressive we were. This gross mismanagement and lack of vision made the entire process utterly unbearable. These projects are a disgrace to the Yale University brand they appropriate. As a mismanaged, ineffective, visionless institution, the capstone truly tops off the Global Affairs experience. Capstones need to be redesigned from top to bottom by selecting directors with corporate experience and by rigorously structuring the semester to guarantee skill and knowledge building, clear hierarchies of management, deliverable timelines, and quality controls. Without such reforms, the projects will continue to be an utter waste of time."

    "Capstone is a great learning experience, at times painful and challenging and a struggle, but also one where you develop key skills to work through difficult, sometimes distressing, situations in the work place.",
    "The capstone is absolutely miserable. I don't know of a single person that a. enjoyed it b. learned anything from it or c. produced really anything of much value. Grit your teeth and get through it. Because you want to graduate. It sucks, and even after people tell you it's going to suck, it still somehow sucks.",
