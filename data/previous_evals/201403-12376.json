   "comments": [
    "Phys 401 is a standard intro to mechanics class. Take it if you are not specializing in physics but you need it for requirements (if you are specializing in physics, take Phys 410 instead). Light workload.",
    "If you are smart, just read Marion and Thorton. If you are not, take this course, but only if you have\/are taking 301 or have experience with diff eqs.",
    "Definitely take it if youre going to major in physics, but not otherwise",
    "Who needs Shankar when you have Harris?! 401 was well taught, expertly paced, and fairly tested. Expect challenging yet fair problem sets and exams, and the occasional hilarious one-liner from Prof. Harris. The course is asset to the physics major and specially suited for a wider variety of student levels.",
    "A good course. Was only a little bit redundant coming from 260 (repeats some Lagrangian mechanics stuff, but goes way more into detail). Professor Harris is very clear. Problem sets don't take very much time, but as a result, I had to put in a ton of time preparing for the final because I didn't feel like I had an in-depth understanding of some of the topics yet. A good alternative to 410 to avoid being bound to the intensive major if you're interested in taking a broader range of courses without as many requirements (particularly PHYS 420).",
    "I would recommend this course. It's interesting, manageable, and generally pleasant. I wish we could have gone a little deeper into some of the topics, but as a first step, it's pretty good.",
    "I definitely recommend Physics 401 to other students: the concepts covered in class are interesting (classical and Lagrangian mechanics, Hamiltonians, Oscillators, etc) but also because Professor Harris' teaching style is great. Without a doubt, he is the best science teacher I have had at Yale: he is very organized, he speaks clearly and slowly, and he is very delicate and understanding with students who are struggling in class. If you must take this course for your major, try to take it with Prof. Harris.",
    "Not the most exciting area of physics. Would not take unless a requirement.",
    "Take it if you want to expand your skills in solving mechanics problems.",
    "You probably don't have much choice but it's decent.",
    "A random assortment of physics topics that seem to have very little in common. The course moves pretty slowly but not that interesting. Simple Harmonic Motion is useful but things like orbital motion seemed tangential. The teaching was hit or miss. Homework ranges from simple to impossible. Exams are not complex. Fortunately homework accounts for 50% of your grade which is really generous for physics.",
    "If you're taking this, you probably have a reason that you need or want to take an advanced classical mechanics course, so this recommendation won't affect you too much. What I can say, though, is that Professor Harris was remarkably clear in his instruction, especially considering that it was his first time teaching the course. The topics covered are generally covered starting from first principles, and it makes things easy to follow."
