   "comments": [
    "very good instruction for urban studies, especially for the Asian cities.",
    "The global perspective of this class in invaluable. Even if you are not particularly inclined or well-versed in the study of Asia, this seminar is eye-opening and will fundamentally change the way you view the world. The non-western, historical and anthropological perspective is essential to any academic pursuit; and Professor Siu is incredible and is reason enough to take the class.",
    "I would say that the course describes some very new, emerging thoughts in the anthropology field, while being grounded in past theory--would recommend.",
    "It's a must-take class if anyone is interestied in world cities especially cities in Asia, mobilities as well as urban planning. Highly recommend.",
    "I would inform prospective students that the course is very much grounded in anthropological paradigms. For students seeking more political analyses or more direct urban planning\/design studies, it may be of less interest."

   "comments": [
    "1. rethink the time-space framework 2. see the city as a multi-layered with mobility and imobility",
    "I am not an GSAS student, and this course was very important for me. It helped me to understand my own discipline of architecture, and I am amazed by the parallels that can be drawn between the social sciences and the study of architecture and urbanism. If I had my way, this would be a required course in the School of Architecture. The course has profoundly altered the way I think about the world and has inspired new ideas for research and design projects.",
    "This course deepened my knowledge of the emerging trend of the global city, especially in East Asia and Southeast Asia, which is one of my interests.",
    "This class is very helpful for my understanding the social relations, class relations, political\/social conflicts, and social displacement in cities of different Asian countries."
