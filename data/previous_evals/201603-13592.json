    "Ital 130 is a continuation of beginner Italian and goes at a nice pace. This class builds on what you've learned before and is a fun way to learn the language.",
    "I developed a greater appreciation for Italy's culture because this course was taught by Simona, a lovely native Italian. However, I do not think that this insight was something that I could not have gained outside of this course.",
    "I made as good a start as possible on continuing to learn Italian. The instructor was awesome, encouraging and a really fine teacher.",
    "Although Ital L3 felt very much like a review of L1 and 2, I left the course feeling far more confident in the basic grammar concepts with a broader range of vocabulary.",
    "The course is basically a recap of the L1 and L2 courses with a little new material sprinkled in, though not much.",
    "How to study and memorize",
    "I developed the ability to speak and understand Italian.",
    "I learned to understand Italian better and speak Italian better by actively participating in class discussions and learning proper grammar.",
    "L3 Italian with Simona was an amazing course. I was able to get a deeper understanding of Italian and improve my speaking, writing, and reading skills.",
    "I gained a greater level of proficiency speaking and understanding Italian."

   "comments": [
    "I really enjoyed the movies and songs. I think the textbook assignments that we go over in class could be limited. But overall the class is great.",
    "This course was good in meeting daily and doing constant repetition of activities such as speaking and reading. It was weak in that students did not take it very seriously and often were not prepared for class.",
    "I loved the daily structure of the course, the additional cultural sessions, and the films we watched and excerpts of books we read. Weekly temi were of great use. The workbook sections that had to be completed before esami seemed entirely pointless, but that would be my single complaint. A very good language course.",
    "The course was fantastic overall. No complaints.",
    "Strengths were the variety of the material in class, from worksheets to watching Italian Films. The weaknesses were just that the grammar sometimes was not as engaging to learn.",
    "The strengths of the class were talking in Italian for at least 10 minutes each class to practice speaking because I think that is really important. I also thought the workbook was extremely helpful. Weaknesses for the class I think was the textbook used and we could also work on speaking more.",
    "The course does a good job of forcing students to speak daily, and having students practice daily. The only aspect of the course that seemed pointless was the workbook due right before exams. Because of the bulk of exercises that students needed to complete, filling out the workbook was often an exercise in how quickly one could dispatch it, rather than how diligently one could fill it out. As a study aid, it was unhelpful compared to exercises in the textbook, which could be easily cross referenced with grammar explanations that were on the next page."

   "comments": [
    "I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who wants to continue their learning of Italian in a fun and clear way. Simona is an absolute delight and an outstanding educator.",
    "I don't think that the language requirement is beneficial for STEM students because it builds up frustration towards language by imposing requirements on an already requirement-heavy workload. However, Simona was a great teacher and made Italian very fun and approachable.",
    "Absolutely!",
    "Absolutely. Italian is an incredible language to learn, particularly with as good an instructor as Simona.",
    "Ye, if you have to take L3 Italian, take it with Simona, as she is understanding and makes learning a new language fun!",
    "I love the Italian department and I highly recommend taking this class with Simona!",
    "Take this class if you have already done L1 and L2 because this class is basically a recap of those two levels with very little new material sprinkled in. Simona is excellent and very sweet. Great, great class.",
    "Simona is fabulous. This class is very much what you put into it. You can study and really learn the language of Italian and be engaged in every class, or you can kind of make it your \"last class\" that you think about and still study and do fine. It's all and all a fun learning environment and very low stress. It very much was a summary of L1 and L2 though-- as in I feel like I could've potentially taken the L3 final right after taking the L2 final.",
    "Yes i would.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student if they are passionate about learning Italian.",
    "Great language with fantastic teachers (in my experience). I would recommend to anyone even slightly interested in Italian.",
    "YES! This was an amazing course and I enjoyed it greatly. Simona takes the time to help you whenever you need it and Italian is a fun language to learn.",
    "I would recommend the course. Professor Lorenzini is very professional, but also kind and nurturing. The course allows you to become interested in aspects of Italian culture by exposing you to films and politics in Italy."
