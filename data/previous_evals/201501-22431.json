   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in reading both canonical and obscure Modernist texts, consider this class! However, if you really care about How Your Professor Leads Class, be wary! Prof. Creswell doesn't really guide students toward particular readings, nor does he (really) point us towards the more knotted, interesting parts of the text. I'm glad I read the poems I'm not glad I spent 2 hours a week in that classroom.",
    "Take it!",
    "Yes - though it requires a lot of prior background knowledge to get the most out of the class, and so I wouldn't necessarily recommend underclassmen to take it without having taken some lit theory or lit classes that read material from around this time.",
    "I came into this course not having read much modernist poetry, and I am coming out of it with, I think, a reasonably good understanding of what the modernists were up to. To be honest, I don't think I like modernist poetry very much, but I have no regrets about the course. The syllabus is a pretty eclectic mix of people, some of whom do not strictly fit the standard definition of modernism, and whether or not I loved the reading, I always got a lot out of the class.",
    "Actually, I do not recommend this course, which is unfortunate because it seemed quite promising. The focus was too limited to authors read in other Literature department classes or new authors presented poorly. The professor was disengaged from his students and failed to lead interesting dialogues in the classroom or on the forums.",
    "I would recommend LITR 419. It's a great poetry class, regardless of whether you're familiar with modernist poetry. Creswell is a bit of a stickler but fair, and he clearly knows his stuff.",
    "I loved this course. You read amazing poetry and essays by the poets themselves. No secondary literature at all, which I really likedit gave the course a really cool immersive feel as we tried to understand modernism only through the source material. It's a very basic seminar format, but I thought that Prof Creswell did an excellent job leading discussion and giving the right amount of context. Also he wasn't afraid to take control and explain things when the conversation lulled, which I really appreciate. A very simple course done very well."
