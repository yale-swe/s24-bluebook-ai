   "comments": [
    "This course was so refreshing and wonderful in the way that it filled in so many gaps of the Yale pre-1800 cannon We were able to think critically about questions of race, gender, sexuality, authenticity, consumerism, authority, what makes literature literature, the limits of the novel, political art",
    "Truly a great class. Professor Campbell is brilliant and I learned an enormous amount from her, the texts, and the other students in the class.",
    "I definitely feel like a have a better grasp of literary analysis and particularly how to approach older and more obscure texts. Also, integration of secondary sources into essays. (Which is a way of saying I've checked out more books from the library for this course than any other, plus I accidentally found an unbound 30-page text from 1828 in Sterling. Is reading 19th-century books without causing them to crumble, breaking either of the two strings holding them together, or drowning them with my coffee a skill?)",
    "On a surface\/syllabus level, I gained a literary (as well as historical) knowledge of 18th century transatlantic writers and literature. However, I gained so many more insights in this class, that I couldnt possibly remember them, or at least write them all down. This was the first class where I truly understood how intertwined history and literature are; they exist as two sides of the same coin. I learned that people intake their information about the community in which they live through stories. This class caused me to question and consider how I as a writer can empathetically represent those who are different from me. Finally, coming off of the ENGL 125\/126 sequence, this class helped to wean me off of writing critical essays exclusively about poetry.",
    "I never really knew I could analyze literature with political intention before, now I feel confident about it. I feel more aware of the politics around me, and the continued influence of race and gender conflicts upon our society. Thanks Professor Campbell!"

   "comments": [
    "I love Jill Campbell. She is so kind, intelligent, wonderful. The syllabus was also excellent. I know nothing apart from this course about this kind of literature from this period, but I did wonder why we read so many works by the same authors (Behn, Edgeworth) and wondered about whether the fact that there were so many works about black characters by white authors was a choice or was because there weren't many other options. Maybe we could have been given a little more guidance on the info reports\/had a clearer sense of the way they were supposed to guide the class? Maybe also to do them in pairs...? Sometimes there was a way lot of reading and it was clear that only like 2 people in the class did it...",
    "This was the only course that is both a pre-1800 and has a diverse and varied syllabus, and truly a wonderful and careful selection. I would recommend this course to every English major.",
    "In addition to Professor Campbell being generally awesome, the syllabus and the seminar environment were this course's big strengths. There were a few items on the syllabus that felt either repetitive (I'm thinking mainly of \"Obi\") or that didn't receive the same level of focus (I'm thinking of \"Oluadah Equiano\") but overall the diversity of materials on the syllabus served the course well.",
    "Though this course was mostly run as a typical English seminar, an additional feature that I really appreciated was the informational report. Each class member signed up to research a topic that was related to our reading for the day, often providing helpful historical background or context. These two-page reports enhanced my understanding and enjoyment of the readings. We were lucky in 225 that we had an incredible group dynamic, so that the discussions were always engaging\/interesting. Of course, we often ran out of time during our discussions, and I would have wanted to spend more classes our heftier reading assignments so that we could have delved deeper into the discussion.",
    "Great reading list and taken at a nice pace, too. We didn't try to cram an excessive amount of reading into each class, which meant that we could have deeper discussions than some other seminars manage.",
    "This course provided a strong supplement to my reading within the English major, especially with regards to p.o.c. and woman writers. It's a wonderful class and I would love to see it integrated more into the core English curriculum.",
    "Strengths: - Several really fantastic readings - Professor Campbell is a beautiful human - Class material and discussion is interesting, engaging, and surprisingly applicable to a variety of other subjects - Professor Campbell gives incredibly thorough feedback on essays and essay proposals, and meets with students individually to prepare them. - It's a pre-1800 lit class Weaknesses: - There's a couple readings that you'll probably end up SparkNotes-ing. - This class is very difficult to SparkNotes due to its attention to work off the beaten path of the more widely recognized \"classics\" - Like most writing credits, if an essay sneaks up on you it'll kick your ass."

    "an excellent course, especially if you are an english major looking for a pre-1800 that actually feels relevant",
    "Absolutely. Campbell is fantastic and cares about her students more than any professor I've had, practically. The books are great, and there are only two papers total, on which she gives extremely detailed and valuable feedback.",
    "This is a wonderful class! I only took it because it was the only pre-1800 that didn't center the voices of white men, but I ended up really loving it. It ended up being really illuminating and relevant to my life--I'd absolutely recommend this to another student.",
    "Absolutely take! Prof Campbell is terrific and does a wonderful job of integrating historical and modern texts, film, visual art, and use of Yale's libraries to create an exciting syllabus. The texts weren't necessarily those I would have chosen for fun, but I always felt that I got a lot out of them. The syllabus is diverse not just in including many female authors and people of color, but including many types of writing. We read novels, memoirs, poetry, plays, even legal arguments and children's stories. The diversity of material made for an excellent approach to the topics of race and gender. Basically, if you're interested in conceptions of race and gender in the 17th and 18th century, if you have a pre-1800 requirement to satisfy for the major, or just want a refreshing and different English course, this is definitely worth taking.",
    "Absolutely! Professor Campbell is a generous and dedicated professor, who makes each discussion, and each reading assignment, rewarding. The conversations are always fascinating, and the syllabus is across the board incredibleit was the reading I typically did to procrastinate the other reading I didnt want to do. I genuinely felt as if I had learned something after every class.",
    "TAKE. THIS. CLASS.",
    "Absolutely, Professor Campbell is a dear (seriously she must have brought us coffee like five times) and Yaa Gyasi's book Homegoing in particular is super engaging. Also, if you're looking for a pre-1800 class that goes a little bit further off the beaten path, and is not all dead white dudes whose names you've heard a bajillion times before this class is about the best Yale offers at the moment. That said, if you're not an English major required to read several bookshelves worth of texts over 200 years old then I understand there are a lot of other classes out there that are also pretty great. Still, if you want to discover the less well-remembered pioneers of the English language, and their struggle to find a voice in a society that devalued them, this class may be the one for you."
