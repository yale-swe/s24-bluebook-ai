    "PSYC 454 is a senior seminar. The semester starts with a series of lectures led by Professor Marks. A few weeks in, you start student presentations -- everyone is assigned one paper and one week to present, and during that class you lead a discussion of some topic in sensory information processing. This umbrella term encompasses quite a variety of different subjects, which is both good and bad. Good in the sense that you can explore something that really interests you for the final paper, bad in the sense that the syllabus as a whole feels rather scattered and disorganized. But, this class is not a lot of work aside from the week you have to present. So I would recommend it if you want an easier senior seminar, although personally I wish I would've enrolled in something that taught me more.",
    "Take it. It's not that difficult of a course but you'll get to explore the facets of sensory processing in a manner that suits you best.",
    "You will learn the most while writing your final paper (20 pages minimum), but don't expect to learn much outside of that. The discussions are also much \"softer\" than one might expect -- this is not a course for someone seriously interested in psychophysics\/neuroscience\/etc.",
    "Professor Marks is an engaged expert in the field of sensory perception and fantastic professor who is interested in each of his students. You may have to put some work in to develop a relationship with him, but it is absolutely worth it. The class format is half lecture, half student presentation. Some of the research that we discussed felt a little dated, but professor marks always managed to bring in new and exciting results to keep the class fresh. Definitely an upper level course. Some background in neuroscience and neuroanatomy would be useful, but it isn't absolutely necessary. All told, highly recommend to any upper level psych or cogsci student.",
    "It's a fine course. Not too much work but I don't think I actually learned anything.",
    "Sensory Information Processing is essentially five or six lectures, and then student presentations for the remaining weeks. You learn some interesting things, but basically the only work for the class is a long 20-page final paper."
