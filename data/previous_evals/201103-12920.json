    "Definitely recommended!",
    "Korean 130 is a continuation of Korean 120. The teaching methodology is very much the same as I had with Professor Lee-Smith, as both Professor Lim and Professor Lee-Smith taught at the same language institute in Korea. I would recommend the course if you are at an intermediate level of Korean, but your vocabulary and fluency isn't quite at a native level.",
    "Definitely take Korean if you are trying to improve your Korean. As an L3 it is not the easiest, but it is not too difficult either. There are many little assignments on a pretty regular basis but overall it's not too bad in terms of workload for 1.5 credits. Class is entertaining and worthwhile.",
    "I think the teacher will change next year, but I enjoyed the class. Korean's a very cool language."
