   "comments": [
    "The class is an introduction to animal behavior from an evolutionary point of view. It also teaches you how to write a scientific grant proposal and walks you through that process, which is helpful if you want to go into science.",
    "Don't take it- didn't really gain much from this class.",
    "Really good class. Perfect if you want a science based writing credit! Not too much work, the midterm and the final were reasonable and writing the paper was interesting as you get to pick the topic.",
    "I really liked this class, Professor Alonzo is great and the material is interesting. It was a decent amount of work, especially regarding the final project, but the course material isn't terribly difficult as long as you go to class and pay attention. I'd recommend this to someone who's interested in the subject or needs to take an ecology course.",
    "I would recommend it",
    "Yes, it was a great course, we learned a lot, but the take-home final ended up being the same length as a 15-page paper :( The midterm was fair, though our final research proposal (also 15 pages) ended up being graded extremely harshly. But, I learned a lot, an topics covered in 122 were covered in more depth.",
    "I took this class as a SC credit, and was very happy with it. I was looking for something that would be accessible for someone whose last Bio experience was the AP in 10th grade, but that wouldn't be a boring silly class for Humanities majors. This fit the bill. Very interesting info, and I really learned a lot about how to think scientifically. Definitely don't expect an easy A, and don't underestimate the research proposal project\u0097it's hard, and will take you a long time. But, if you're a humanities major like me, and want something that's actually interesting and rigorous but isn't Cell Bio, I'd totally recommend shopping EEB 240.",
    "THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS. Definitely one of my favorites. Very interesting material, great professor, great TFs, great focus on scientific approach and experimental design, manageable workload (plus I know have experience writing a research grant proposal, with a lot of feedback), and so many pictures of animals!The downside? 9am on science hill is early. But for this class? Worth it.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student who wants to learn about animal behavior in greater detail. It looks at a wide variety of behaviors. At times, it is a little math-driven, but overall, I learned a lot.",
    "wouldn't recommend at all for EEB majors. total waste of time, poorly taught. large overlap with 122 and evo bio. take something else.",
    "This is a great class for science majors, but don't take it unless you want to think more about experimental design than animals",
    "If you are interested in sociobiology, this class is one of the few options available. It is a survey of methods and topics in the field, and so does not go into great depth in any area. There is, however, a lot of material available, so if you do the reading and attend lecture you will learn a lot. The term paper is a proposal for a research project, which requires a good deal of research and time designing an experiment to answer an open question in the field. If you haven't had much experience with science writing, you will learn a lot.This class is accessible for someone with little scientific background. I came into it only knowing the biology in The Selfish Gene and did fine. Intro Bio is not necessary.",
    "This was a great class. It was challenging and it really pushed you to think as a scientist.The first half is very theoretical and teaches you how to approach the study of animal behavior, introducing you to optimization theory, game theory and experimental design. The second half of the course is topics in animal behavior, approached through the application of what is learned in the first half.If you\u0092re a EEB major, this is a great class because it gets you to apply evolutionary thinking to behavior. If you\u0092re not an EEB major I also rceccomne this class because it teaches you to think analytically. Some background in ecology and evolution would be helpful though.",
    "Overall it's a great course. Professor Alonzo is very knowledgable and the TAs are very helpful. Managable course load with a term long experiment proposal paper and a midterm and a final (was take home this year). Sometimes the material got pretty dry, and the textbook was pretty terrible (zero photos, poorly organized and beyond dry), but for a pretty cool science credit, I would definitely take it again. I did come away learning more about animal behaviour and some cool facts about fascinating animals.",
    "Yes, this was a pretty good course. The paper did make the class a bit more stressful than it otherwise would have been, but if you're interested in the subject matter and want a general overview, this is a good class to take.",
    "An interesting survey of the study of Animal Behavior. Professor Alonzo is an enthusiastic and effective teacher.",
    "Not as great as I was expecting, but still interesting. It had a fair amount of overlap with the intro EEB course and with genetics. We had a fairly small class (around 20), but it was held lecture style. The powerpoint format with the lights off can put you asleep at 9am, which was a problem for me. Assignments aren't too bad--a midterm, a 15 or so page paper, and a take-home final. Doing the readings wasn't necessary and I wish I hadn't bought the expensive textbook.",
    "E&EB 240 is a decent introduction to the subject of animal behavior. Like many E&EB classes, it has significant overlap with other classes. A better option than most if you want to practice thinking like a biologist (but still lacking); a weak option if you're looking for a well-structured course with dazzling lectures. Recommended for students with an unusually strong interest in this specific subject."
