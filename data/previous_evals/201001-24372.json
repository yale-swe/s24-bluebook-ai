    "Definitely recommend",
    "Great intro to microecon. The book does not help that much.",
    "Not nearly as difficult as people make it out to be, if you stay on top of the assignments and go to section. Prof G can be confusing at times and is pretty inaccessible inaccessible if you need help, but the TAs help straighten things out. If you can, try to take this with a different professor. The textbook provides little help explaining the concepts, and is often totally unrelated to what is discussed in class.Those who took AP Econ in high school will find it mostly review, but with some new topics that are supposedly important for intermediate-level courses.",
    "Unless you have a really strong Econ background, I wouldn't recommend taking this class with this professor",
    "No, not recommended to another student. It is a prereq for the econ major, but if you are just taking it \"to see what econ is like\" stop wasting your time. take a course in finance at some other university (yale offers like 2) to learn about business but econ is completely theoretical and has minimal practical application.",
    "Difficult. Take only if you want to major in Econ (and why would anyone want to do that?)",
    "Mathematically this course wasn't difficult. Conceptually, the first half was easier than the second half but overall I'd recommend this course. Professor Guinanne teaches it well and makes things easy to learn.",
    "Basic overview of microeconomics--I think that especially now, understanding Economics is important, so yes, I would recommend it.",
    "A great class for anyone considering majoring in economics, however I would recommend it even if someone wasn't planning on majoring in economics.",
    "The concepts are interesting but the lectures\/sections are boring. I wish I took this as a seminar. You can get through the class fine if you do a bit of self-study. But don't expect it to be fun. It merely gets the job done.",
    "Only take it if you plan to major in Economics, otherwise it is not the most worthwhile class.",
    "I would recommend it to a fellow student as a class because I think knowing basic Econ is really important, however DONT TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR GUINNANE!",
    "A good introductory class. The second half of the course is significantly faster\/more challenging than the first.",
    "If Guinnane's teaching it this semester, definitely take it.Econ 115 was reputed to be the single worst class at Yale, but I took it with Guinnane and actually really and truly enjoyed it.I am not an overeager freshman -- I'm a poli-sci junior whose advisor told me no one would take me seriously without economics. Evenin my jaded and compelled condition, I liked this class.",
    "Take it, its important, but shop for a good TA. It makes all the difference.",
    "If you have to , you have to right?",
    "Yes.",
    "I hated it. Economics is boring. But this class is relatively easy if you keep up with the material!",
    "Good intro to micro. Take it if you will read the book carefully.",
    "Not the easiest QR credit to get, but not impossible.",
    "The class is pretty standard. The experience really depends on the professor (read: do not take this class with Tim Guinnane). If Tim Guinnane's ceaseless mistakes in graphing and general knowledge aren't enough to make you drop the class, his cringe-worthy, pathetically unfunny jokes will. His wannabe loose-cannon demeanor makes the students both pity him and feel generally uncomfortable and insulted.",
    "I think it is a tough course grade wise, as is almost any intro course at Yale; however you learn a lot and is a great foundation if you plan on taking anymore econ courses or, obviously, if you decide to major in econ.",
    "I would definitely recommend you take this class with Guinnane. He has a very good teaching style and the information is presented in a very practical way. The information is easy to understand and the workload for the class is very manageable. Very good class.",
    "Take this class out of necessity rather than desire. This class counts towards the econ major so that's kind of nice. Other than that, you will probably end up spending 2 or 3 days before the exam trying to learn everything that was taught in the class.",
    "I would recommend this course in a heartbeat based on the nature of the topics discussed - Economics is incredibly pertinent in today's world (especially in recent years). Sadly, I wouldn't recommend it in general simply because Professor Guinnane is so incapable. His irritability and disorganization were so distracting that lectures often proved useless. Section, while optional, meant understanding the topics presented briefly in lecture, which means that it won't be optional if you are interested in doing well on the midterms and tests. The work in general is light, yet the extra studying required after the poor teachings of Professor Guinnane meant an hour or so extra per lecture. If a different teacher is teaching this course your semester, I implore you to enroll.",
    "I would highly discourage you from taking this course with Guinnane. He makes it clear from the start that he doesn't really care about teaching. Lecture is not terrible, and the problem sets take very little time, but the class as a whole was just unpleasant because of him. At the end of the semester, I felt that I had wasted my time.",
    "This is a very plain introduction to microeconomics--no frills. You will understand some of the basic underpinnings of firms, consumers, and some governmental policy after taking this course. Not much work--psets, a midterm, and a final (you don't really need to do the reading if you go to class and stay conscious), and a decent way to get a QR if you aren't a math type. Take this in the spring if you aren't an econ major--you won't have the overly eager freshmen econ majors mucking up the curve.Also, Professor Guinnane is wonderful. Perhaps a little harsh at times, but his off-color jokes and hilarious way of describing things injects some life into this otherwise quite dry material.",
    "Economics 115 is your standard introductory course in microeconomics and microeconomic analysis. It\u0092s actually what it says it is in the Yale College Programs of Study, nothing more and nothing less. The first half of the class (pre-midterm) builds the skills necessary to understand the theory of supply and demand and how consumers and firms behave in a market. The second half of the courses uses these tools to analyze real world example such as reasons why people buy insurance, the effects of asymmetric information on a market, and the motivations for international trade. There are weekly problem sets (of which the lowest two are dropped according to the syllabus) for 20% of your grade, a midterm for 30% of the grade, and a final exam for 50% of the grade. For the most part, grading on assignments could have been fairer and more transparent and given the competitive nature of the class (due to the economics department imposed curve) would have made understanding the material a higher priority than receiving a good grade. Professor Guinanne would bring in his expertise and specialization in economic history to concretely tie historical examples to what we were learning in class and would do so at a very easy to understand level. Professor Guinanne would explain topics with sufficient depth and breadth and in such a way as to make the concepts clear and lucid bringing in levity and analogies to make the subject enjoyable. Overall, I would recommend this class to a fellow student, especially one who would like to major in economics, wants to see some applications of mathematics (which is done in the more advanced course; mathematics, unfortunately, is all but eschewed in this intro course), or wants to build the quantitative and qualitative skills to better understand economics as it applies to individual persons, firms, industries, countries, etc.",
    "Not thrilling but interesting if taught by someone competent.",
    "ECON 115 is a good class to take. While this course does a good job of providing basic tools necessary for economics, I suspect that those interested in majoring in economics may be better off in enrolling in a microeconomics seminar, as the class size is much smaller.",
    "Yes, just not with Professor Guinnane.",
    "I found this course extremely boring. i fell asleep almost every day in lecture, and I never sleep in any of my other classes. The professor was not especially good in lecture or helpful. I would not recommend this course to another student unless he or she was very interested in the subject matter.",
    "Your standard intro econ class. Take it if you have to as a prereq. If you're bored...then, hell, why aren't you taking something more fun?",
    "Tough class but needed to take any other more interesting ones.",
    "It's what you would expect of an econ class. Not very fun, a lot of information, pretty hard, but probably good for you.",
    "Boring, Boring class, and generally badly taught since calculus is outlawed. This makes very simple things unnecessarily complicated.",
    "Take it if you want to do higher level econ classes. There are easier QR classes if thats what you're looking for.",
    "Absolutely not. If you think for some reason that econ is interesting, this class will almost certainly dissuade you.",
    "Don't take it! I only took it because it is a prerequisite for the International Studies Major, take it credit\/D and then you fulfill the requirement!",
    "Take it if you think you might be interested in taking upper-level econ courses. If you're just looking for a QR, there are probably more rewarding options.",
    "yes",
    "Not a horrible class, but nothing I would take just for fun. Work was difficult and lectures weren't very useful. Don't take it unless you have some interest in economics.",
    "I would recommend the course, It is an interesting introduction to economics and a reasonable amount of work.",
    "Economics 115 covers basic topics in Microeconomics, such as Supply& Demand, by presenting the theory and then the mathematical and practical applications. Two lectures + a section each week; problem set every week; one midterm, one exam. I would recommend the course, not because the course in and of itself is a particularly good course, but because I feel that, considering its real-world applications, Economics is a subject everyone should study to be educated.",
    "You may have heard bad things about intro econ but this was a pleasant surprise. Guinanne is engaging (though he makes some stupid jokes). Not too hard either if you have the intuition. Though the final was much much harder than the midterm\/psets....",
    "I would recommend taking this course because it provides fundamental knowledge required in life.",
    "I definitely expected Econ to give me more pratical knowledge than it actually did, so that was a considerable disappointment. You definitely do end up learning some basic building blocks, but I found that I really only consolidated material in studying for the midterm and final: I felt like I was essentially having to use the textbook and lecture slides to teach myself. The problems sets and exams are all fairly put together and fairly graded.",
    "I would definitely encourage all students to take this class as you will learn useful information regardless of whether you have an affinity for economics.",
    "I would highly recommend this course for all students although it may not be the most interesting material to many. It lays down a lot of basic information that explains a lot of what we see in the real world. It is relatively easy to comprehend, as well.",
    "Take it! And get a tutor if you need to, I did and my tutor was really helpful.",
    "Worth taking just to see how you like economics.",
    "It's not a fun or great class. If you think you might be interested in Economics, take it. If anything, it'll give you a general idea of what the subject is like.",
    "Great introductory economics class.",
    "Economics is one of the most important things to learn. Every students should take it regardless of how the class is taught.",
    "Yes, it is good to gain a fundamental background knowledge in economics. The class offers a wide variety of material to study from, including real-world examples.",
    "Easy if you've taken Econ before, impossible if you haven't. Kind of interesting if you choose to make it so. A LOT of self-teaching is necessary in order to do well.",
    "Yes I'd recommend it. I thought the final was harder than the midterm, which was kind of unexpected. It's just one of those classes that everyone takes...Guinnane was funny. Very dry\/sarcastic. Though I went up to him to ask about a re-grade, and he snapped at me. Guess he didn't like the class...",
    "It's one of those classes that you will take, regardless of how much you want to. I'm glad I did; I think knowing this material somewhat will make me better off. Also, I needed to fulfill a QR. But make sure you get a good professor and shop around for a good TA -- that will make or break the course.",
    "My least favorite course this semester. Most classes had at least one mistake, poorly drawn graph, or illegible handwriting in the lecture notes, not to mention some politically incorrect remarks toward Koreans or rednecks. The professor seemed to me apathetic or incompetent, or both. TAs at least tried to correct some mistakes of the professor. This class made going in to office hours almost crucial for your success in the class, just because problem sets and material were often explained poorly and needed clarification; I don't feel this should be necessary for a normal class. I did not feel that I was in good hands, and I would not recommend this class to other students.",
    "Really tough course unless you really pay attention and go to lecture. Do not just take for the QR.",
    "The class wasn't super fun, but it teaches important general knowledge that I think everyone student should have. It's an easier curve than the seminar, and not too much work.",
    "I would recommend taking it in the fall with Steve Barry.",
    "It was a survey course in econ. Lots of assumptions. You could probably pick up an economics textbook and derive the same utility.",
    "Econ 115 is your typical introductory microeconomics lecture--tedious and sometimes frustrating but in many ways a necessary rite of passage for college students. Take it if you think you might be interested in economics or if you want to know what economics is about, but if you are shopping around and you have another option that seems better, take that instead--this class is really not worth giving something else up for.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn some interesting basics of economics. It was highly enjoyable, and the way Guinnane teaches the class makes grasping topics very easy.",
    "This is a survey course of basic microeconomic principles. If you took AP Micro the first few weeks are a breeze, and then it gets a bit harder but still not too bad. The homework sets take less than an hour except for a couple, and the midterm wasn't hard. The final was a little tricky though. It's good stuff to know so I'd recommend it.",
    "I definitely would. It's a great class, and one that you need to take for many of the other economics courses. It's a nice, stimulating challenge.",
    "Intro micro. it's not going to be great, but Guinanne made it pretty good.",
    "I would recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn econ. It is a manageable introduction, though depending on your level of background and instinct you may need to seek TA help to survive the curve. It made me love economics as a subject though--you will definitely learn a lot if you pay attention and everything is very applicable and interesting.",
    "A decent class. Don't take it if you aren't an Econ major or if you're just looking for a QR.",
    "It's an interesting class. Not too hard. Worth taking.",
    "Mildly interesting, mildly informative--but very self-study-able. Take an interesting class instead, don't take micro-econ because you feel like you should. However, if you do take it Guinnane is a good explainer even if his jokes fall flat 80% of the time.",
    "Difficult. Would only recommend if interested in Econ.",
    "Introduction to Microeconomics is a better course than you might expect. I had very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised to be interested in the material. I think it is a good course to take before leaving Yale, especially because you might discover an interest in economics and be able to continue to pursue it. The problem sets are no problem. if you seek the help of the TFs. The concepts are interesting and the work is not too bad. The class is impersonal, but you have plenty of opportunities to get to know the TFs - I would suggest doing that. I would recommend this class to anyone who had a vague interest in economics.",
    "Great class--definitely take it with Guinnane. I was terrified to take a QR after the one I took last semester ended disastrously but Econ is definitely not difficult so long as you pay attention most of the time and follow up on concepts you don't understand. Definitely go to the lecture, but don't bother to read the assigned textbook chapters. Professor Guinnane is hilarious, irreverent and great at explaining the concepts, and the TAs are wonderful for further explanations. The class also looks at a lot ofpractical examples that are extremely interesting and helpful for applying the abstract principles learned earlier. This is class is great so long as you aren't insulted by Professor Guinnane's vendetta against rednecks.",
    "Econ 115 was pretty much an introduction to the vocabulary of economics. I do not think that this course is very necessary in terms of the concepts it taught because most of the concepts are pretty intuitive. I also think that my expectation of econ would be that it would help one learn basic concepts in terms of maybe running a business or working with money but instead it seams more like this class would help one along the path towards working in public service. This is fine but not clearly explained in the course description.",
    "Econ 115 was, overall, a bad experience. Lectures, especially in the first half of the semester, were mind-numbingly boring. The class' refusal to incorporate calculus and its general aversion to numbers was extremely frustrating. Both the midterm and final were far too easy, meaning that (at least for the midterm) forty percent of students scored above a 90%, and the curve was regressive. There was also no link between the lectures and the textbook. If you feel strongly about pursuing economics, perhaps take intermediate econ first. If not, avoid this class!",
    "I would recommend Economics 115 because concepts of microeconomics come up in other subjects and in the real world. Non-econ major student should also take this class.",
    "You will read TERRIFYINGLY BAD reviews of this class from previous years. They were reviews that made me not even shop the class for the first week because, as a junior in a humanities major, they actually scared me that much. HOWEVER. I had a great time in this class. If you get as entertaining a professor as Timothy Guinnane, you should absolutely take Econ 115. It's so important for a full understanding of the world to have a grasp of econ, no matter what your major is, and the way it was taught this semester really emphasized concept over specific mathematical formulae.Prof Guinnane made sure to review concepts at the beginning of every lecture, so although the class does build on itself, he made sure that everyone had a solid base in what came before. The class absolutely takes a certain amount of extra individual effort on the part of the student, but if you take advantage of weekly office hours with the TAs (who are AWESOME) for help on psets, you really will learn the material. And you'll be glad you did, because it's definitely worthwhile stuff. Also, just want to put a plug in for Jamin Speer as a TA--if you can get in his section, DO IT. He is amazing.",
    "Pretty interesting if you're willing to stay motivated.",
    "This is a pretty good econ class. I left the class feeling like I have a solid grasp on micro concepts, though the class felt pretty ridiculous at times (for reasons it's hard to put my finger on). I'm glad I took this class, though. The TFs were for the most part weak, but if you shop around you can probably find a good one, and sections are optional so you can move around. Take Chris Hines as your TF if that's an option again.",
    "it can't be avoided!",
    "It's a large lecture class so it's not such a great 'class experience' like the freshman seminars but the introductory material isn't bad and the large number of people means that whenever you have a question, there's always someone around to answer it.",
    "I mean, anyone interested in econ or IS or many other things NEEDS to take it. I think everyone should try to take the small seminars. I can imagine that more accountability for the material would help people actually learn it. The huge lecture can work for some people but not for everyone.",
    "Professor Guinnane's lectures are not terrible but certainly not interesting. He makes annoying side comments throughout.",
    "I came to the course with a solid background in microeconomics from AP Econ in high school. The course offered little new information from my AP course, and what overlap there was was very often confusing due to different terminology and variable usage. There is almost no math in this course, just a lot of abstraction with basic algebra and variables, few numbers. Professor Guinnane was not very good with confusing lectures and odd comments. If you can, take the course in the fall with Professor Barry.",
    "A course on relatively basic concepts. If you can understand the material on the problem sets, you can do well with only a moderate time investment. For the most part, you don't need to do the textbook reading or go to lecture if you can understand the concepts covered in section.",
    "I loved the preparedness of the professor and being able to follow along with slides. Before the midterm however he went through the material not so thoroughly in each lecture and then repeated in the next. I would have rather gone through everything once more thoroughly. This is not as bad as intro economic classes are rumored to be.",
    "I wouldn't recommend it if you don't need it, it's a little hard to understand and boring.",
    "Probably. I think most everyone should take an econ class, and this about what I expected...not too hard but not the most orgaized\/well taught class.",
    "ECON 115 is a good introduction to microeconomics and covers a variety of topics such as supply and demand, perfect competition, monopolies and duopolies, international trade, game theory (briefly), Pareto efficiency, among others. The lectures are long and often boring, though the professor makes a good attempt at making lectures more enjoyable by cracking jokes. The workload is not difficult (one problem set per week, with a few that are optional), and almost everyone has a very high problem set average. The exams, however, are more ambiguous and require much more studying.Overall, I would recommend this course if you are looking to a basic introduction to microeconomics and do well in a lecture setting - taking good notes and drawing accurate graphs is essential.",
    "This was an interesting class regarding the foundations of economic thought. Rather than what you might imagine as your typical econ class, this class tried to cultivate an 'economic way of thinking,' that basically modeled behavior, both on the individual and societal level, from a microeconomic perspective through such lenses as utility, marginal benefits, maximization, and a little game theory. There was a strong distinction drawn between \"mathematical\" thinking and \"using your intuition.\" The problem is that, for those that see mathematics as a language, math is itself very intuitive, and can make economic concepts significantly more clear. However, this class often eschewed math for this so-called intuition, which often tended to obscure some otherwise simple concepts.",
    "A survey course of introductory economics. Provides some interesting tools for basic analysis of practical issues in economics. Recommended.",
    "If you want a review of basic economic concepts, this is the class for you, those who have taken AP should take it just to refresh unless they're very confident.",
    "You have to take it for econ so it's not bad all things considered.",
    "It is a good class to take if you are interested in pursuing economics, or if you need an So credit and are good at QRs. It is not that much work (problem set a week, a midterm, and a final).",
    "Yes, I would strongly recommend the class for any econ majors or non-econ majors, who just wanted to try out the subject.It gives you a good overview of what microeconomics is about. The class is very well taught, and at the same time not too difficult.",
    "If you're actually interested in the material, take the course. If you're taking it just because you think you should or because you want to fulfill a QR, you might want to reconsider. The curve, though fair, can be a little difficult.",
    "Would not recommend this course, unless you need a QR.",
    "The material is interesting and useful. It's also a great way to get a QR.",
    "I took this course to learn about microecon and that's what it was. It was interesting and explained a lot, even for someone who is not going to be taking any further courses in econ.",
    "Great course, take it.",
    "A must-take course - everyone has to do economics in college. Too bad it is a fast-paced lecture with a terrible curve.",
    "If you are very interested in economics take it. If not, avoid taking it.",
    "take it if you want to do the econ major",
    "Make sure you really know the material because you can guarantee everyone else will",
    "Essential introduction to economics and quantitive methods employed in its study. Yes I would recommend it to a fellow student because it gives one an important grounding in the subject",
    "It's a good introduction class for economics, but beware who your professor is. Definitely shop it and make sure their lecture style is to your liking.",
    "Econ 115 is a difficult class only if you come in intimidated. It is essential knowledge though.",
    "Guinnane clearly didn't know what he was talking about a lot of the time; kept messing up on so many things that TAs and other students had to call him out on. Ended up confusing students, and looking at Barry's exam... his exam was such a joke in comparison. A confusing, badly-worded joke. It was probably easier than taking it with Barry, so it's up to you on what you're looking for... clarity, or ease.",
    "Not exactly a typical intro econ class, I felt like we did a lot of unorthodox things and covered topics other course of the same level would not. I would recommend it if you have any interest in Econ.",
    "It provides a good background of economic terminology and gives you a social science credit. I would recommend it if you are genuinely interested in economics but not otherwise.",
    "If you have to take it, you have to take it. You need to go to lectures and try your hardest to follow what's going on. Beware that Prof Guinanne thinks he's missed a comedic calling, so pay attention for his cringeworthy attempts at humor. Problem sets aren't that bad, and the TAs are generally helpful. But def go to lectures, because it's the only source of a lot of the information you need to know (the textbook is helpful for the information it writes about, but some things are only covered in lecture, especially towards the end of the semester)",
    "Big lecture. Materials not too tough. Not too much work.",
    "A solid course. Not super-exciting but gives you a basic understanding of economics.",
    "Do it if you have to, it's not that bad, focus on doing what needs to be done to get the problem sets done and keep in mind that most of the exam questions are drawn from the problem sets. Don't get bogged down in lecture notes or reading.",
    "I would recommend this course to almost any other student. It is useful to understand how markets work and how firms choose output quantity and price.",
    "Econ 115 is the introductory class for all other economics classes. If you're interested in any econ classes, I recommend you take it. If you're not interested in econ, you can skip this class.",
    "I would recommend it. Even if you are not a math-y student, econ is useful and interesting",
    "Microeconomics is a necessary building block for further economics. Honestly, it is not the most engaging class, and sometimes I feel it may be a waste of time when there are so many fascinating subjects to study at Yale. However, if you want to take classes in the Economics department, it is a prerequisite and isn't wholly terrible especially with Guinnane.",
    "I'd recommend Econ 115 to a fellow student as it's an interesting if at times boring overview of a subject matter that educated people should have at least a basic knowledge of.",
    "Take this class if you're interested in seeing what economics is about.",
    "It's Intro Micro Econ. If you want to know it, take it.",
    "The concepts are interesting and edifying. The class itself is not very enjoyable, but if you are interested in understanding how society operates or continuing a path in economics, I would take this course.",
    "This is a class that should only be taken if you hate life or are forced to by the Econ department. (I fell into the latter category.) The material taught is very basic introductory material, and focuses entirely on the distilled abstract representations of the theory with little information on why and how it applies to the real world. The biggest gripe I have with the class is that it is taught with no calculus, although 95% of the freshman class know the basic rules of derivatives that are needed for a calculus version of this class of the same depth. As a result, awkward rate of change constructions are told to us instead of explaining the actual reason behind why things are. This leaves students scrambling to memorize a series of disconnected abstract models and graphs when the truth underlying and connecting them can be easily explained both intuitively and mathematically, yielding true understanding, love, and appreciation for economics. Add this to a professor that actually hates the students, and it is a recipe for repeated frustration.I hear a rumor that you can just take intermediate micro, and nobody will ever know. If this is the case, do at all costs.",
    "Yes, it's a pretty good course to take for a QR and the things you learn are pretty useful for real-life applications.",
    "This course accurately teaches the basics of microeconomics. Besides being a required course it is also a very helpful and well-taught course. If you have any interest in understanding the field of economics, take this and macro to be informed",
    "Ew.",
    "I took this course as a senior, and not an economics major, so I was not the typical student (freshman considering studying economics). I found the material difficult to follow at times, and Guinnane wasn't always great at sensing when he was moving too quickly through challenging stuff. He was better than I thought he'd be, though, and the course was far stronger than I was expecting it to be. Section is very helpful if you have the right TA. Shop around to be sure that you get as good an explainer as I had in my section (Jamin Speer).",
    "I recommend it if you are looking for a less work intro econ class",
    "If you're going to be an econ major, you have to take it. Otherwise, it's not all that useful. I took it because I figured everyone needs to know a bit about economics, but this class does not help in the slightest with that, as it covers only the most basic concepts. I've heard macro is much more useful and interesting though, and this is a prerequisite.",
    "fine",
    "A pretty terrible lecture. Take it only if you need it as a prereq for something.",
    "Take Econ 115 if you need to. Otherwise, it is a very dry course. Steven Berry is a better option that Professor Guinnane.",
    "Really not that bad. First half of the semester introduces foundational micro concepts, and second half focuses on real world applications and such. Guinnane is a funny guy, but don't take him too serious or you'll probably be offended multiple times throughout the semester.",
    "This is a great course in economics. I had a semester of general econ in high school and found this course to be the right mix of review and new ideas. A lot of things were more in-depth than my public school required econ as well. As a non-major, the course wasn't too hard, but pushed me to go to class and to focus on problem sets to make sure I understood things. Take it if you're interested!",
    "Your staple lecture at Yale. Really big textbook, lots of lectures, lots of students, lots of problem sets, one midterm, onefinal.Micro was pretty interesting, but every topic had its annoying and esoteric points.The problem sets were obnoxious. Rarely were the questions ever straightforward, and I often had to ask for clarification. Whoever wrote the problem sets made too much of an effort to be humorous, and too little of an effort to be clear and comprehensible. A student's nightmare.There were slides posted on classesv2, but they were not filled in. So, to really benefit from the slides you had to bring them into class and fill them out as the professor went along. This is fair when the information can easily be found in the textbook, but towards the end of the semester, much of what the professor was teaching was not clear in the textbook. In such cases, I think it would be fair to give us completed slides, no?The midterm was fair. The final, however, was unlike anything we had ever seen in class, and I was completely surprised by everything I had to answer. We had never worked on the bizarre \"application\" questions that were on the final, and many of the exercises were different from any exercise on our problem sets. An unpleasant, and unfair, surprise.The professor was a nice guy. He made an obvious effort to make lecture more enjoyable for his pupils by speaking to us like we were real human beings (can't say the same for all Yale lecturers). He was down to earth and approachable. He did a good job for how difficult his crowd was. That said, he made too many jokes during lecture, which got repetitive and got in the way of my learning.",
    "An awful class that is sadly a pre-requisite for many other courses. I would not recommend this course due to the professor.",
    "This course gives you strong basics to microeconomics in a simple, fun way."
