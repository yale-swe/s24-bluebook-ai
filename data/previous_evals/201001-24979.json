    "I would recommend MCDB 415 to a fellow student, especially if you're a senior majoring in MCDB. What you get out of this course is definitely dependent on how much work you put into it. You could do minimal studying outside of class and still get a good grade, but if you put more effort into actually studying the topics it could be useful. There are a bunch of different lecturers and diverse lecture topics, so the quality of the class varied a lot over the course of the semester.",
    "Take this class if and ONLY if you really love membrane physiology. I happen to like it, so I enjoyed this class. The majority of the class's focus is on the normal and abnormal function of membrane transport proteins at both the molecular\/submolecular level and the clinical level. It's really unlike any biology class I've taken as an undergraduate simply because it is so focused and in depth. You learn quite a lot.",
    "This class is interesting if you want to take a look at a very limited range of topics in biology - namely channels, pumps, and motors. Can't complain about the take-home tests.",
    "Quite specific and advanced class. A good deal to fulfill an upper-level elective requirement.",
    "Yes, great material, low stress.",
    "Joke of a class.",
    "If you love bio take it."
