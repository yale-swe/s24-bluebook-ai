    "I would absolutely recommend PLSC 698 to a graduate student with an interest in IR and IPE. The syllabus offers an excellent mix of classic, foundational work and cutting edge research that gives students a strong sense of where the field is moving and how some areas of the IPE literature might be moved forward."

   "comments": [
    "The syllabus offers an excellent mix of classic, foundational work and cutting edge research that gives students a strong sense of where the field is moving, and discussions were well-suited to exploring how some areas of the IPE literature might be moved forward. I found the freedom to explore intersections between classic IPE work and our own research to be especially helpful. The course prompted me to think in terms of the domestic distributional consequences of trade policy in weak and conflict-prone states, which is a dimension of my research I had given little attention to before this class."
