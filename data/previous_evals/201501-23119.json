   "comments": [
    "Would recommend. I think it's a pretty fun class, though you will need to devote a good amount of time to doing the assignments.",
    "If you want to learn how to run simulations for stress analysis and fluid flow, take the class.",
    "good course that teaches a useful, applicable, marketable skill. Definitely worth taking",
    "I ended up learning a lot through this course, but most of it was self-taught. It could have been better organized. Professor Long can move through Solidworks lectures pretty quickly so it's very easy to get lost if you glance away for just a second. The non-Solidworks lectures were a bore. Ultimately, I appreciate taking it because it forced me to tinker with Solidworks. The psets can take long because it often takes many, many, many tries before your simulation actually works.",
    "This class is pretty annoying, but you'll probably be okay if you actually pay attention in lecture (this is not an easy task, to be clear) or look up a lot of tutorials online. Solidworks isn't as easy to google your way through as some software, so you should be planning to work with your classmates and help each other out.",
    "MECH 400 is different from other STEM classes in its emphasis on practical skills. Learning SolidWorks was definitely one of the most useful skills I've picked up during my STEM career at Yale. True, you can learn about forces, stresses, fluids and its accompanying theory - but in reality, people don't sit and crunch out numbers from those equations by hand, they use simulation and design software like SW. 3D design and simulation immediately became useful in all of my work, including senior project in Physics. There are 2 MATLAB assignments (more theoretical) and 9 SW design assignments. The final project is open and you can also machine your design at the CEID too! Prof. Long is very responsive in emails and was very good at teaching SW.",
    "It was a lot more work than I thought it would be. You learn a lot of valuable skills, so I would definitely recommend it, but know that you will have to sit through some boring lectures. Also, there's some material in the beginning about outdated computer monitors that is not very useful or relevant to what the class is actually about, but it is on the 1st midterm. A word of advice: don't do your final project on something that needs Flow Simulation. Flow Simulation is a pain, takes forever, and is not the analysis tool where SolidWorks really shines. There's a reason it is not called FluidWorks.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to anyone wanting to be an engineer. This was probably the most applicable class I've taken thus far at Yale. You learn how to use Solidworks which is very important for designing. You have a pset almost every week and they can be challenging, but the course wasn't overwhelming.",
    "Learning Solidworks is a really good skill for being a MechE. The class is alright, with sort of this weird parallel thing where half the time you're learning how machines and processing works for modeling\/taking exams on this material and half the time (okay, maybe not half and half) you're doing Solidworks. I think the Solidworks part is the most valuable part of the course, but the other part isn't hard to understand or do well on so don't let that dissuade you.",
    "It's a very practical course focused mostly on how to use Solidworks for analysis and simulations, as well as some of the basic concepts that are behind these capabilities. The assignments can at times be frustrating or unclear, but Prof. Long is generally pretty helpful and accommodating.",
    "Great course to learn SolidWorks and the principles of computer aided engineering. Very useful if you see yourself going into an engineering career. Sure, you can learn SolidWorks by yourself, but not this rigorously.",
    "learn solidoworks. chill midterms. manageable assignments. good teacher.",
    "Good for learning Solidworks! Avoid if taught by Professor Long - it will be boring. Use other students as resources to help with different concepts. Be warned that some of the solutions to assignments were not always clear (think spending 9 hours on the computer and then suddenly something says it works, but you have no clue why...) Bottom line, take it if you want to use solidworks in college, but realize that you learn a lot on the job (internships) so don't worry if you cannot take it.",
    "This class will definitely teach you a great deal about SolidWorks, which is an essential tool used in many different companies. I would recommend taking ENAS 130 before this class, because you will need MATLAB for MENG 400, and his crash course of 2-3 lecture slides isn't quite comprehensive enough. That said, Professor Long is a really nice guy, and very willing to help. The only other class I know of that teaches SolidWorks is Mechanical Design (MENG 185), and this class certainly covers it much more extensively than 185 does.",
    "I would definitely recommend MENG 400 to any student interested in learning about CAD or learning how to use SolidWorks. I came in with some experience in simple modelling in SW, and I felt the class was well paced from the start: the assignments never felt like busy work, but they were never overly difficult either. Prof. Long is very nice and approachable, and he seems genuinely interested in the subject matter. The midterms aren't something to stress over as they only cover one or two lectures of material each. In general, this class was more hands-on than most of the engineering classes I've taken, and I really enjoyed that."
