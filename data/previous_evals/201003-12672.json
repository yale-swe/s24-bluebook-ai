    "IT'S ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST CLASS I'VE EVER TAKEN AT YALE! I had the professor for a class before and knew I wanted to take it, but the class was a little small since she is new and there weren't yet any reviews on the course. Brunson is incredibly enthusiastic about the material and composes really brilliant lectures that are interesting and easy to follow. The reading is a large commitment, as the Russian novel is famous for its length and Dostoevsky wrote many of them. But it's worth it if you're willing to open up to the idea of a substantial amount of reading. I really liked the course. The grading is fair, the papers are well spread out and not too long, and the themes brought up really make you look at the literature in a new and very interesting light. Honestly, if you haven't read Dostoevsky, you should. He'll change your life entirely if you let him. And if you already have read and like Dostoevsky, you'll like the class too, as it definitely does him justice.",
    "Great class if you like Russian literature and want to learn more about Dostoevsky. You'll really end up learning a lot about the author and his historical and biographical background. It's great if you've got a good knowledge base of the Bible though.",
    "Yes, although lots of reading, the reading is interesting.",
    "TAKE IT! Hands down one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. If you are reading this review it means you really really need to take this class because you have even the smallest interest in Dostoevsky. I raved about this class all semester to my friends. True, it is a lot of reading, but I enjoyed every minute - it never once felt like homework, but rather a break from homework. I'm finishing this semester feeling like I know Dostoevsky's mind inside and out, and it is a wonderful feeling. SO GOOD!",
    "The reading list alone should make you want to take it. Reading Dostoevsky is an experience, emotionally and intellectually. The reading load is heavy, but not impossible. The requirements for the class are not bad at all (one 3-5 pg paper, one 5-7 pg paper, one 7-8 pg paper, and a low-stress final). I did much of the reading before, but found that the context and insight I gained from Professor Brunson's lectures helped me understand the texts on a deeper level. One of the best class decisions I've made at Yale. If you like reading at all, take it!",
    "If you already know you like Dostoevsky, yes. I discovered that I was not his biggest fan, though I did love Crime&Punishment. And only if you're prepared for way too many assignments.",
    "You sort of know what you're getting with this one - a thorough overview of Dostoevsky. The reading is intense and pretty relentless, but that's why you take the course. Brunson, while young, is a good lecturer - I think she'll only improve with time. I took it for the reading, and I got what I wanted out of it, but I wouldn't say it was a particularly great class. Good though.",
    "This course is pretty easy going. While dealing with a fascinating subject (i.e. Dostoevsky) at times the course manages to lapse into a sparknotes-like analysis of the novels, which is always a shame. But there's no way you can go wrong with Dostoevsky. Molly is very approachable and you get plenty of moments to think deeply about the works, as the course entails a total of 3 short (one 5 pg and two 7-8 pg) papers. Do take the course. Even if dry at times, the reading itself is well worth it. And no, you won't do the reading on your own, os take the course!",
    "This class is exactly what you'd expect it to be - a survey of all of Fyodor Dostoevsky's major novels in addition to some ofhis lesser-known works and short stories. Assignments include one short response paper (2-4 pages) and two longer papers (7-11 pages), all of which were graded toughly but fairly. I would definitely recommend the course, primarily because Professor Brunson has such interesting insight that you might not otherwise glean from reading these novels yourself.",
    "Prof. Brunson is an amazing lecturer, and the class is easy. Do it.",
    "If you like analyzing the themes Dostoevsky evokes; I personally had a hard time because his books disturbed me a lot on a personal level and I didn't want to analyze these books, just take them in.",
    "You'll be swamped, and you won't have nearly enough time to do the works the justice they deserve, but pull yourself together and do it anyway. Just promise yourself you'll reread them all at a more leisurely, thoughtful pace later in your life."
