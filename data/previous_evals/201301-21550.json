   "comments": [
    "It gives a general overview of various topics important to environmental politics and cites various famous\/significant examples for each subject covered in the course.",
    "Yes. Interesting and important to know.",
    "Yes, definitely.",
    "Take it if you want a light workload class. It's not bad but gets a little boring sometimes. You learn a lot of useful stuff though",
    "This course gives an introduction to a number of different issues related to the environment today, and explores how regulations related to these issues have changed over time. I recommend it if you are remotely interested in the environment because it is really interesting.",
    "Take it.",
    "I would. The workload is reasonable, the lectures are interesting, and the discussion section is engaging and doesn't keep you in the dark as to the lecture material.",
    "Chill class that goes broadly over the most important topics in environmental politics and law. Low workload (midterm, paper, in-class final) but grading isn't super lenient-- great for a cr\/d! Lectures can be a bit boring, but if you go to class and do the readings that interest you you'll be fine.",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Not a ton of work, interesting lecture, nice professor and TA. We had two in class exams and a 10 page paper.",
    "GREAT CLASS. I learned so much about important topics in historical and contemporary environmental law. The class shed light on government power, secrecy, susceptible populations, and current health risks related to food and chemicals around us. Wargo did a spectacular job of communicating to us themes that underlying almost all environmental issues: these tools also use to parse out current and future conflicts regarding the environment.",
    "EVST 255 is a great course for anyone interested at all in our environment. I would recommend it if you are looking for an interesting course that is not of the typical english, math, etc. Not a lot of work and very interesting material.",
    "Yes, it's easily one of the top 10 courses that must be taken at Yale. Students will come away with a deeper understanding of how environmental regulations affect everyday life.",
    "Lecture is interesting, though you'll learn more about chemical hazards than you ever wanted to know, and the workload is very manageable.",
    "A great class for exploring the history of environmental politics in the US. Focuses mainly on pesticides, nuclear war, tobacco, land regulation, plastics. Pretty easy, although the test format was a bit wonky since they were trying out in-class tests for the first time. Highly recommended, a great 5th class.",
    "Very good class. I would recommend this class to another student because it's not overly daunting, and the material is interesting.",
    "Great class. John Wargo is the most interesting man in the world, and if you've never taken a class with him, I highly recommend it (and you'll probably get that joke by the middle of the semester).",
    "Not a ton of work but it covers some interesting topics. Even though some of the topics are pretty unrelated, lectures tend to follow some central themes and it all comes together at the end. If you're looking for a relatively easy class to balance out a tougher schedule, I'd definitely recommend this one.",
    "The class was interesting, the readings were good, and the assignments weren't too difficult. That said, I don't think I'd recommend this class to anyone who isn't mostly clueless about environmental law.",
    "This class is a great introduction to Environmental issues and law. The lectures are very interesting, the assessments fair, and the sections are great. Take this class!! It is wonderful.",
    "Environmental Studies 255 01 has interesting lectures about today's environmental issues. It made me think differently about things we consume. Lectures are a bit dry though.",
    "YES take this class!! It will open your eyes to issues that everybody should know about.",
    "Do the reading or come to every lecture. Doing both is unnecessary.",
    "yes! It wasn't too hard (though I wouldn't call it a gut...). There is an in class midterm and final (non cumulative final) and a final 2500 word paper. Overall, readings are interesting and workload isn't bad.",
    "Great class.",
    "Great class! Professor Wargo is a great professor, and the material is interesting.",
    "Really depressing but super interesting. Take it! This convinced me to be an EVST major",
    "I would highly recommend this class. This class focuses on law and politics, but covers all facets of environmental studies and uses case studies to give you a comprehensiveunderstanding. Professor John Wargo is an expert on the field and has been teaching this course for many, many years. He teaches you general themes (ways of thinking) of environmental politics and use eye-opening evidence to guide you to conclusions. Probably because of a good pace and density of content, the 50-minute lectures are enjoyable and interesting. Just 2 midterms and a paper. The weekly discussion sections are enjoyable too.",
    "Yes! But don't take it thinking its Shute gut. There are a lot of memorization and writing involved with this class.",
    "Even if you are not that interested in environmental policies, you should take this class.",
    "I really liked this class. I kind of got shafted grading-wise but I loved the material learned in this class. Wargo is great and really smart even though he talks himself up in class. He is also very monotone.",
    "Amazing class. You learn a lot about the issues. Don't do the reading because you learn enough in section if you try to be active and use common sense. Take this.",
    "This is a very laid back, interesting class on topics that are relevant to your life that you don't even know are relevant to your life. Also the lectures are up online.",
    "This is a phenomenal lecture course. If you are interested in the environment, government policy, economics or social justice issues this is a must take course. It deals with a variety of issues, but remains focused around key themes of patterns in law, regulation and use of the environment. Professor Wargo is a great lecturer and has crafted a particularly compelling course that evokes frustration, hope, agitation and inspiration. One cannot help but feel motivated to take action on environmental issues when engaging with this material. The course convinced me to become an environmental studies major and is one that will stay with you long after the end of the term and even after your time at Yale.",
    "Very good class. The stuff you learn will blow your mind.",
    "Great class! This is really an eye-opener. Professor Wargo presents some really interesting material during lectures that will make you see your environment in a different light. Every topic is intriguing and comprehensible. I only have great things to say about Professor Wargo and this class.",
    "Enviromental",
    "Strengths include the well- run discussion sections and the great variety of information and case examples covered, which really provided great insight to the field of environmental law and the importance of health, justice, and more. Definitely a laid back class to take for your major or just for fun.",
    "Good basic class in Env. Law. You'll learn a lot of interesting things about what affects human health and the scary health dangers that exist in our world!",
    "Interesting class overall. Worth taking to get an idea of the problems facing the environment.",
    "This was a very informative course, and you'll come away having learned a lot about the different categories and issues within environmental law. Lectures were interesting, the paper was reasonable, and preparing for the exams was not difficult at all. However, the reading load can be high. Definitely want to keep that in mind if you're already taking a few history or English classes.",
    "If you are interested in the environment and law, definitely take it. I loved it.",
    "I would recommend EVST to another student because I learned so many things that are relevant in my everyday life that I didn't know before.",
    "It was a good amount of reading - about 100 pages a week, but the readings were interesting and not bad at all. the tests were fair and not difficult if you attended lecture and did the readings. I really liked it and would recommend it to all students. It touches on many very important environmental issues.",
    "I only took it because it was a requirement, and it felt like that the whole time, if you know what I mean.",
    "Great class",
    "Great class with not that much work. Professor Wargo really wants the class to do well and he does everything in his power to let you do that. He is also incredibly famous in this field, which makes his first hand experience with each topic that much more interesting in lecture.",
    "Yes I would recommend. It's an easier class that's great as a fifth class tacked on a busy schedule, but it's still very very useful.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take it.",
    "Take it",
    "i would definitely recommend this course. its a fairly easy survey of environmental topics. wargo pays closer attention to issues about human health than about protecting the environment for its own sake, but that fair enough because statutes more often come out of health concerns. you wont become an environmental lawyer, but you'll gain (1) a great knowledge of the current environmental regulatory framework and (2) how environmental statutes come about. as a non-major, this class was pretty easy and the readings were interesting enough for me to actually do them. go for it!",
    "I would recommend it. It covers many of the shortcomings of particularly American environmental law and many diverse environmental problems I wasn't even aware of.",
    "Awesome class, I would definitely recommend it. Wargo is a great professor.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Wargo's lectures are not the most engaging and I would suggest reviewing the syllabus first - this is a large survey course that gives you a ton of breadth on many subjects but does not go into as much depth on the subjects as it could - but this is a great course. It is thought-provoking and the material is engaging. The themes of the course are interesting and you ask the same questions throughout, but it's frustrating not to know the answers to those questions. If you're interested in thinking about the law and especially if you're interested in the environment, then this class is the right class for you!",
    "Environmental Politics and Law is a great introduction to environmental issues and government's response to these issues. Take it if you love environmental studies, or if you'd just like to learn more about the issues and have some interest in policy.",
    "Yes, it is a great opportunity for students to figure out their interests in Environmental Politics and Law. The wide range of topics helps one to familiarize themselves with topic and pickout things that stand out to them as focus points\/ passions. It's a great building block to a major in environmental studies.",
    "Great course. Very broad, but well worth it if you are interested in environmental policy - wonderful background for anyone curious about the subject. Well worth taking.",
    "I would recommend this class to another student. It's not a difficult class, but it's very interesting and thought-provoking, so it's a good class to take if the rest of your schedule is pretty heavy.",
    "If you are looking for a really exciting class with a great professor, with reading you will really want to do and lectures you want to attend then this is not the class for you. If you are looking for a pretty easy POLISCI class thisis good",
    "Fantastic course. A must take! The readings are great and very manageable. The lectures are great. The TF's are super nice and mine was phenomenal. The material is something everyone should learn for living in a modern world, especially for, but not limited to, those who are interested in environmental policy.",
    "I would recommend it to another student.",
    "While not incredibly difficult, this class is definitely not a gut. It makes you think about the real issues facing our environment through a historical and legal lens. A must-take for anyone interested in chemistry, biology, political science, environmental fields, or law. LOTS of reading though.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who wishes to live well or make a positive impact on the world. This course will make you conscious of the many environmental threats we face, and the noble efforts some have taken to prevent them. Warning: this class will make you angry at big corporations on a daily basis, and you may leave as a better person.BUT! It's on Open Courses, so if you're not interested in writing the paper, just watch it on the interwebs!",
    "It is a basic overview of environmental issues. Wargo was a decent lecturer but some of the topics weren't great. Also some of the lectures were about issues that were pretty basic so you probably don't need to listen to lectures about them. THe structure of the class changed from past years so it is 2 tests and a mandatory paper. You don't every have to do the reading.",
    "Take this course. It's interesting and relevant, the professor is godly, and the coursework is highly manageable.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class! I initially chose this as a random 5th class, but it ended up being my favorite class of the semester. Professor Wargo is a great lecturer and all-around nice guy, and everything we learn is relevant to real life, which is really rare among classes at Yale. I especially liked that that the course covered important environmental issues that I didn't know much about, such as weapons testing on Vieques island. The coursework is all very reasonable - two exams, 1 paper, and section. Nothing too strenuous, but you'll learn a lot.",
    "This is a great class. It teaches you some vital information. The final paper is fun to write.",
    "Take it if you want to work hard and if you are interested in the topic area. Even if you aren't interested there is a lot of fascinating information to learn.",
    "A good big lecture about environmental law, general overview of many different topics",
    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It's not a lot of work, but you definitely get what you put in to the course. Readings and lecture are interesting.",
    "Good and easy"
