   "comments": [
    "This course is necessary for many programs of study and is a good complement to the lecture, although it demands the work of a full credit class rather than a half-credit class",
    "Definitely take this if you are a Chemistry major (or related major) or Pre-Med. DiMeglio is awesome and is very willing to help you through any rough spots. Be sure to meet with the TA to discuss the reports before they're due, because the grading can be a little tough depending on your grader.",
    "Chances are, if you're reading this, then you have to take this course to fulfill your major or premed requirements. Take it if you have to. It's a great lab course, but the work boring(aside from learning mechanisms and techniques).CHEM 223L is the typical organic chemistry lab. Every week you perform a lab that demonstrates a mechanism you learn in lecture (e.g. Diels Alder, Wittig, Aldol condensation, esterification, etc.). The workload is very light, but writing the EPs, PLs, and reports can be a pain because you have to pay particular attention to the formatting prescribed by the lab manual.",
    "Basically, I'm guessing anyone looking at this has to take the class because they're premed or some equivalent. I wouldn't really recommend it otherwise as labs generally are huge time-sucks, but this lab could also definitely be a lot worse.",
    "Probably taking it for pre-med, so you don't really need my \"recommendation\" for this...but yes, I'd recommend it if you're in to chemistry at all.",
    "223L is the lab where all the tools you learned in 222L come together to be put to use in a coherent way. Similarly to 222L, 223L's success entirely depends on the strength of the TA.Dr. DiMeglio is a kind, entirely well-meaning prof who really wants to teach and have her students learn (unlike other professors she has given up scientific research in favor of focusing on improving the labs she teaches). She makes the students feel welcome, but due to thelarge number of students in each lab section, it is hard to establish a really personal relationship with her.",
    "Sure, it's not half as bad as chem labs could be, but it is a little harder than first semester orgo lab.",
    "Very low stress lab. Not that much work apart from the few post-lab assignments and 2 lab reports. Less time commitment than orgo 1 lab--you usually get out by 3:30. Final exam is straight forward, although pretty detailed.",
    "Sure, they have to take it anyways so it's not up to my recommendation to help them decide, is it? Just take it, if it were not required, then don't. I don't see the point unless you want to be organic chemist. Even so, finding an actual lab to work in might be more beneficial.",
    "CHEM 223L was an improvement from 222L. Students spend time actually synthesizing compounds rather than simply practicing techniques. As such, I felt like I learned much more this semester. Also, the course complements the orgo II class nicely.",
    "Yes, it was even better than first semester. Not that many lab reports and plenty of time is given to complete them.",
    "While this course was still way too nit-picky in terms of grading, the grading was better than last semester. I think this is entirely dependent on the TA, which is really annoying, since having a harsh TA worsens your grade.I do feel like I got more comfortable with the organic laboratory, but the course lacked support when I just wasn't sure what had gone wrong in my experiment (which usually happened).Overall, this course is better than first semester organic lab. It's nice to feel like you kind of know what you're doing, and since the labs this semester require you to do pretty much the same thing every week, you get used to the set up and how to conduct filtrations, heating at reflux, etc. We made some cool products, which was fun, and I was glad there wasn't much diversity in the procedures (ie, no distillation or chromatography other than TLC) since it made studying forthe lab final that much easier.In all, I guess I'd have to say that I'm glad to be done with intro orgo lab, but that I didn't dislike it enough to dissuade me from going further into organic chemistry. It felt like a lot of hoops to jump through so from that perspective, I'm glad to be done with it. However, making stuff in lab is fun (a lot more so this semester since every day is a synthesis lab)!!!",
    "If you are thinking about taking this you probably don't have a choice. I felt like there was way too much NMR on the final relative to how much we worked with it and how unserious-ly it was treated in the syllabus.",
    "Your experience with Chem 223L is mostly dependent on your TA. The workload isn't horrible but you should pay close attention to detail on your lab reports.",
    "You probably are taking this course because you have to, but it isn't bad at all. You can usually get out early if you have everything together.",
    "This is a better class than the first semester of organic chemistry lab. It is less work and the labs are shorter. That being said, it is still organic chemistry lab and a class that people should not take unless they need to.",
    "Minimal learning. But not much work either. Don't get freaked out by the first lab and lab-report; they are not indicative of the amount of time the course will require.",
    "Chances are, you need to take this lab for a major or for some other requirement. With that said, I found the labs enjoyable for the most part. The workload is reasonable for a 0.5 credit class and the experiments are nice in that they allow you to apply techniques learned from first semester lab in syntheses. Expect to run into some hurdles as far as the grading of post-lab reports, however; points will often be deducted for trivial and arbitrary reasons. Overall, however, I had a very good experience with the professors and T.A.'s.",
    "sure not bad at all- Heaven compared to Gen chem",
    "An excellent second semester organic chemistry lab course."
