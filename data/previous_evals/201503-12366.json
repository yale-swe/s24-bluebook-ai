    "This class splits linear algebra and multivar. calc., in my opinion, before any of the two subjects get way too hard. However, bear in mind that this also means you have to wrap your brain around two different math subjects that don't have a lot to do with one another, which is kind of difficult. As someone who has liked math, but hasn't really been particularly good at it, this was a good course (also not planning on taking more calc after this). I didn't take math at all for a whole year of college, so when I placed into 120 I was thinking really hard about what I wanted to take. I shopped 115 and 118 and after the first hour of each I had decided to take this course, even though I probably could have used more of a calculus refresher. I guess outside of class I spent about 10 hours a week on math? Overall I found that allowed me to understand the material well. Another important thing: if Professor Logan is teaching another math class that you are considering it, TAKE IT. She is literally the best math teacher I've had from high school until now. Not only does she make sure to go at a pace where the students can catch up (also only one pset per week when she's teaching it, heard in the past it was 2 psets a week for 118), but she also holds 5 hours a week of office hours, no joke. She's always super cheerful and brings us treats during midterms and finals season just to make everyone happy and energetic. She is really the sweetest professor and is very good at what she does. If we consider professors who focus on research and those who focus on teaching, I would say that Professor Logan definitely gets a double thumbs up on teaching.",
    "If you are interested in taking more math beyond 112 but not too much after that, this is a good course. A bit challenging but a fair math class if you like math.",
    "Totally recommend math 118 to students that want to get an exposure to linear algebra but don't feel ready to commit to a pure linear algebra class. It's nice because this class has multivariable calculus which can feel really familiar to students who took calculus BC in high school. Also, Professor Logan is just the best! This class is challenging, but you will enjoy taking it with her.",
    "Lots of overeager freshmen who honestly can be super annoying and rude. The material itself is really interesting, and Logan taught it in a very clear manner. Not too difficult either.",
    "Great introduction to linear algebra and multivariable calculus.",
    "If mildly interested in math, take this class.",
    "Definitely yes, if Professor Logan is teaching it.",
    "Its a great option for those that are willing to put a bit of work in order to get through the matterial needed for an Economics major.",
    "Most people who take this class are Econ majors. That being said, it is not econ-specific so if you have any interest in learning Linear Algebra and Multi without taking the bigger classes, definitely take this class, especially with Professor Logan.",
    "While this is a math course for econ majors it is still a math course. the teacher is in the Math department and teaches like a math course is taught. However Logan is very good about being flexible and finding ways such that everyone does well. this course got bad reviews before but with Logan a lot of those issues have been ironed out.",
    "A good class if you're an econ major and looking to finish math requirements. I highly recommend that econ majors take this class rather than stick to the Math 112 requirement because it provides you with a stronger foundation in mathematics necessary for the major."
