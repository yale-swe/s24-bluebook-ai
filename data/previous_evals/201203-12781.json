    "This class is perfect. If you get in, YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT. It was my saving grace all semester not because my other classes sucked but because this class blew every other out of the water, it was INSANE. Take it take it take it take it take it take it. So...yeah. Take it.",
    "Intro to Verse Writing is a workshopping creative writing seminar in which you write one poem a week (based on a prompt). Three poems are selected each week to be workshopped, but even if your work isn't being workshopped the experience is rewarding (since you'll be able to read and work with peers' work).",
    "This is a simple, introductory poetry workshop in which you are asked to follow a specific assignment and create one poem every week. Louise Gluck is a master of her craft and has a real investment in the work of her students. If you are interested in writing and talking about poetry, you should take absolutely apply for this class. You will be a better poet coming out of the course, whether you realize it or not.",
    "Absolutely. Even if you do not write your best work for this class, you will come to consider poetry in a new way - I think that is incredibly valuable. The reward is not just the class itself but the time afterward...It will make you think about yourself.",
    "It's a privilege to have your poems read by people interested what they can be, not only what they are; and it's a privilege to have among those people one of the reigning dons of American poetry. You may not agree with their (or her) opinions or even the attitudes that motivate them, but you will learn a lot in conversation with them.",
    "Overall, I would not recommend this class because of its stylistic narrowness and negative criticism. If you really like Professor Gluck's poetry and aspire to write poetry like hers, it would be worthwhile to take this class and learn the tricks of her trade. If you're interested in other styles of poetry, this class does not provide an environment for you to explore them.",
    "This class is deceptively simple: you write one poem each week, and during class you discuss three of the poems that were written that week. The prompts, however, are often difficult, and as the class progressed I found myself spending more and more time on each poem - trying to write a half-way decent poem in only one week is a terrifying but invigorating challenge. Being workshopped by your classmates is nerve-wracking, but it is Louise who really pushes everyone to produce the best, most interesting work they are capable of. If you are not too proud and willing to work hard, this class will help you become a better poet. I would recommend that everyone who is serious about poetry take this class.",
    "It's an incredible thing to get a thoughtful response every week from a Pulitzer Prize winning poet, and that's really what this class is about. Be hesitant about Intro to Verse class only if you aren't already familiar with contemporary poetry, as this is definitely not a course on the fundamentals of poetry (we occasionally were assigned a few poems to read, but they were provided more for inspiration than anything else). It's a discussion-based workshop, and you'll be expected to be able to give intelligent and reflective responses to your peers' work.Prof. Gluck is an incisive critic herself: she seems to understand, inherently, what makes any particular poem work, and she can pinpoint exactly what needs to be done to make that poem feel more \"whole.\" Her insight will change your poetry (some are happier about the change than others). Know that she does not 'sugarcoat' her responses to your work -- she gives praise when praise is due, but she treats her students as serious poets and thus is not especially effusive. Take advantage of her conference hours, which will allow you to get to know her in a less formal setting.",
    "Yes, definitely definitely take it."
