   "comments": [
    "You have to take it to graduate, but Griffiths is a good book. Reading it is helpful. The workload isn't as high as in other physics classes I've taken, although the material isn't as exciting either.",
    "Literally the least interesting course in the Physics major. Those who took 260 will find huge overlap in the material. Long annoying problems and lots of formula memorization. Overall not too much work though.",
    "It's hard to get around the fact that E&M is essentially a math methods course and that a certain amount of dull practice with the various differential equations is necessary - that being said, there are a lot of interesting problems in Griffiths that were totally skipped over. This class wasn't that difficult, and I don't feel that I got a really deep understanding of the material precisely because I didn't have to work very hard. In some harder classes, we might spend 20 hours\/week on the problem sets, but by the end of the problem you had learned something new and interesting - I never felt that way in this class. It was just the same problems again and again with slightly different boundary conditions.Lecture was mostly useless except for occasional exam-related hints. He pretty much lectures straight out of Griffiths but makes it way less clear because he's extremely sloppy on the blackboard.",
    "Definitely take this over the course in the engineering department.",
    "A straightforward course on electrodynamics, following Griffiths rather closely. You get a strong ability to solve boundary value problems in various coordinate systems in this class, which is nice. Topics: electrostatics (a lot on Laplace's equation and boundary conditions), dielectrics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics with Maxwell's equations, inductance, etc., electromagnetic waves, and relativistic electrodynamics. I recommend the class if you want to learn electromagnetism beyond freshman physics.",
    "I would recommend taking PHYS 430 to the student that can entertain him\/herself with boundary value problems. It's not very difficult, so if you want to feel like a physics major then I would recommend taking other courses as well.",
    "You're probably only taking this because you are an intensive physics major. If you are not an intensive physics major, do not take it. It is not worth your time.",
    "bite the bullet and finish the intensive major.",
    "This class is pretty much the same as your intro physics class, but probably easier as you don't cover circuits. Take it as a junior though because you'll have more of the math background required. Professor Parker is a great DUS, but spends a lot of time on really easy concepts in lecture and his lectures are generally hard to follow.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in optics.",
    "This course was a little slow for my taste and felt too much like review. However, I did learn several important topics. I became well versed in solving boundary value problems learning Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials for solving Laplace's equation in different coordinate systems. I also learned how to solve simple EM waves in various media from conductors to dielelctrics. Finally, although it was review for me, we did touch on the Lorentz invariant formulation of EM. For me, it was an easy class that was interesting about 1\/3 of the time, and the rest was review.",
    "You basically follow Griffiths's Introduction to Electrodynamics straight through. You've probably encountered a lot of this material in AP Physics C, or in Yale's PHYS 260\/261. It's probably the easiest course in the required sequence for the physics major.",
    "If you're taking this course, you're probably a physics major and are required to take it. Worry not, though, since the class is well taught and is not terribly difficult. Although Griffiths is not the best book out there, it does a good job covering the material without being confusing or going off topic. If you read the book regularly, you should be fine in the course. Parker closely follows the book, so reading up before each lecture is very useful. Parker himself is cheerful and is dedicated to making sure everyone is behind him, so as long as you come to lecture, you need not worry about him leaving you behind during derivations. The p-sets are not particularly difficult and their challenge is mainly conceptual; if you understand the material, you should be fine, as the questions do not have overly tedious algebra or unnecessarily difficult concepts (and are straight out of Griffiths). TAKE IT.",
    "This class was such a drag. Honestly, going to class was counterproductive, because Parker's explanations seem designed to actively confuse you - which shouldn't even be possible, since basically all you have to do in this class is solve differential equations. You'd be much better served to just read Griffiths."
