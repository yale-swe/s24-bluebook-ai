    "I would not be too eager to recommend this class unless the student had extensive prior knowledge of the countries discussed (in terms of history, culture and politics) as well as a strong background in political science and political history, since this course requires a deep and vast knowledge of these subjects.I would summarize this course as being challenging, with rewarding dialogue, however, at times, it was confusing and difficult to follow.",
    "The course gave me invaluable perspectives and conceptual frameworks to understand Latin America. I would certainly recommend it to another student, but would give the caveat that the workload, in terms of reading, is intense.",
