    "I thought this course would be really interesting because the topics sounded cool, but as it turns out, it was not what I signed up for. The lecture class turned into a class of only 12 or so which normally would've been great, except that the professor's style of teaching was essentially reading off of notecards for every single lecture. There's also a lot of reading and it's not so fun to realize that you have a huge chunk of your grade (40 percent I think) left to be determined by a final exam that encompasses an incredibly detailed amount of information. A shame because the course covers all sorts of interesting topics. I just wish the delivery were better.",
    "Excellent material. A little dole. Sensational TA in Heidi. Final was a little narrow, but certainly doable.",
    "Yes i would recomend it",
    "I would highly recommend this class because it is very relevant to all of our lives, and the class is very well taught.",
    "Yes"
