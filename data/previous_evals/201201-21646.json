    "Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It is interactive and more of a conversation. so you feel like you are really learning and involved instead of memorizing information",
    "Interesting class on FOOD, A lot of problems, not a lot of answers. future leaders in ALL fields need to think about the issues considered in this class. It is going to be a big problem in our future and I think evveryone should graduate with a basic knowledge of issues facing the food industry etc.",
    "It is an overview of the current topics in the world food system today, from the obesity crisis to genetically modified foods to company marketing. It is unlike Brownell's lecture class, though, in that discussions are extremely small and heated, and the topics are not so much presented as delved into.",
    "If you have any interest in food, this class will cover it all, and if it doesn't cover it explicitly-- just bring it up in class and he will allow you to discuss it. It is a fantastic course. Professor Brownell is a fantastic facilitator of discussion. The class is primarily discussion. Most of the work is done on your own.",
    "I enjoyed this course a lot. The readings are varied and interesting, and discussions were lively. Some days were repetitive because many of the discussions circled back to the same issues, but the course is still absolutely worth taking.",
    "Definitely take this class! It is so eye-opening and interesting!",
    "Excellent, excellent, excellent course, one of my favourites at Yale! I've taken Professor Brownell's lecture course and this senior seminar and both are phenomenal. Weekly discussions were always interesting and Professor Brownell always had an interesting way of presenting discussion questions and follow up. He is clearly at the top of his field and yet is so modest and so willing to engage with all of us on these very important topics. He presents many opportunities for how we will all be engaging in this field in some way or another in our futures, because food affects all of us and in whatever capacity we are involved, we will all have choices to make about what these topics mean to us. By all means, take this course!",
    "You should definitely take this course if you can get in. It's a really eye-opening class that helps you be more informed in the choices you make.",
    "Take this class!!!!! Be warned though, it is a seminar, and it is hard to get into since it's a subject that most people, at least, are tangentially interested in. But if you are actually passionate about food related issues, you will enjoy this class greatly.",
    "I loved loved loved this class! Totally changed the way I think about food -- one of the few classes at Yale where I actually thought about the material in day-to-day life, and I think about it every day. Really interesting readings and topics, though they sometimes seem overwhelming when you start getting into policy issues. Professor Brownell is so sweet and one of the major players when it comes to food issues in the US right now, so it's amazing to get to take a class with him. In fact, I think the only complaint I have about this class is that it was unsatisfying to have it only once a week.",
    "Definitely take it if you can get in! You will be fascinated by the topics covered, and it will be so refreshing from other Yale courses.",
    "A must if you are interested in food policy and science"
