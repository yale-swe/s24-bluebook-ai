    "It was a useful bonding exercise for our cohort, and I found the debates about methodology, the role of theory, and the future of the discipline to be both interesting and helpful for understanding the discipline as a whole. However, I'm not sure it merits being a required course, since there are so many other courses we can take that will accomplish more for our future research.",
    "Lots of knowledge, but breadth not depth. Should be that way.",
    "This was a useful course overall. Very important to be introduced to the various research being conducted in the department."
