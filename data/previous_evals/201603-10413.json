    "Figure drawing! I got familiar with techniques for drawing with charcoal (vine and compressed), cont, china marker, white charcoal, and towards the end, ink. Through practice with poses ranging from 20 seconds to 20 minutes, I learned to work quickly while still capturing everything important (usually...).",
    "I learned how to draw figures using charcoal and ink.",
    "I learned a lot about different styles and techniques of drawing, as well as different ways of approaching and looking at the body. I learned a discipline and respect for drawing and the skills and effort it takes to produce good work. Going to draw at the morgue was a sobering and difficult though ultimately strengthening experience; where at first I was uncomfortable, actually beginning to draw the figures became automatic and interesting. I was more focused on rendering the forms than that they were bodies, which showed me the transformative power of drawing and just how far I had progressed as an artist."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths: Live models and always provided supplies. Also a small size so the class feels very intimate.",
    "The strengths of this course come from its rigor: this is not an easy or carefree drawing class. Everyday you come to be professional and work; every day is a chance to improve and develop your skills. I felt encouraged by Mark even when he was critical because I knew that he was pushing me to be the best I could be and I improved so much over a short time. The weaknesses of this class were the variability of the workload. Sometimes we were expected to produce a lot of great, highly-detailed work and sometimes there was none which was somewhat difficult to manage. I would've preferred a more regular pace and schedule of homework."

   "comments": [
    "Yes, absolutely. Unlike many of my other courses, I looked forward to attending this class every week. It was challenging, but I learned a whole lot and felt like my drawing skills improved. I highly recommend this course, especially to non-art majors interested in art.",
    "This was an excellent course and my figure drawing skills improved by leaps and bounds thanks to Mark's feedback and the well-thought-out lesson plans. This class provides not just practice but good practice, both in-class with models and outside with sketchbook assignments every week or two. Also don't be afraid of taking it if you're not an art major - barely anyone was.",
    "I would recommend this course if you are interested in learning to draw figures. You will definitely see a significant improvement in your ability to do so by the end of the semester.",
    "I recommend this class to someone who already has some experience with art and wants to improve, but will be professional and truly pursue progress. This is not an easy class and should be taken seriously because the critiques are tough and always very true. I grew in my confidence as an artist and I find drawing to be relaxing and cathartic, even under pressure so this was a fulfilling educational experience for me. The atmosphere of the class was also great and gave me a calm group of friends with whom to work."
