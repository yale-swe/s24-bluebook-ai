   "comments": [
    "I learned a lot about the SDGs, but very little about the specific challenges facing child health and development and the interventions that would be effective in addressing these challenges.",
    "I really didn't learn new skills or insights from this class, which is disappointing because it was advertised as an upper level class (numbered 380, with some grad students in attendance). I did learn a bit about international development financing, how the UN operates, and how the sustainable development goals were developed, but to be completely honest this was not really my interest. There was very little discussion of child health, health interventions, or even Dr. Alipui's personal experiences which I am sure are fascinating.",
    "Although not a skills oriented class I believe I got a good insight on some of the internal processes that resulted in the current 2030 Agenda.",
    "I learned about SDGs and how to adapt and monitor their implementarion to very specific countries or regions. I also learned about giving statements and negotiations through the UN group intergovernmental negotiation simulation.",
    "Great learning curve in terms of learning about sustainable development and global health.",
    "Understanding of what the Sustainable Development Goals are, how they came about, what their purpose is\/what problem they address, how they are important and different from the Millenium Development Goals, challenges related to implementing them, ongoing issues related to child health globally. I learned a lot about the workings of the UN, UNICEF, and other organizations towards making the SDGs happen and the negotiation process that led to them.",
    "I learned how to think about intergovernmental organizations, as well as how to contextualize much of the negotiations and implemented programs through the lens of international development.",
    "Understanding the negotiation process and policy behind initiatives for child health"

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "Strengths: -Alipui is very knowledgable and if you ask him pointed questions he will provide good responses. However he will not offer up anecdotes, examples, or really insightful\/detailed points in his lecture presentations alone -learned a bit about financing for development and how the SDGs were developed, but this really could've all been condensed into 1-2 classes at most Weaknesses: -the seminar was really a 2hr lecture of statistics, with little critical thinking involved -very ambiguous assignments -paper topics were so long, and page limits were very short -- ultimately felt like I was discussing nothing of substance. Also in these papers I felt like I was simply regurgitating information rather than thinking -not at all focused on child health; way too much on the UN bureaucracy -lectures were very repetitive -i really disliked the simulation -- if this were something I were interested in, I would do model UN Areas for improvement: - Less reading of long, buzz-word heavy UN reports; more readings on critical analyses of child health interventions or (if need be, but these are far less interesting) UN processes -More natural seminar discussion -- don't have students research a topic then go around the table and talk about things; instead pose an opinion-based question to the group on the readings, and have them discuss -Less presenting of statistics",
    "It is a very interesting class, very intimate, and relevant if interested in the content. The class could be stronger if a bit more organised both in course schedule and within lectures. It could also benefit from more elucidating of ideas with specific current examples. Overall very interesting and pleasant to attend to. It was humbling to participate and be able to listen to both the professor and the guest lecturers. It was also very personal, the professor gave personal and individual feedback for every assignment which was very nice and conducive to learning.",
    "More diverse guest speakers, clearer guidelines on papers and the dynamics of class participation. Perhaps a better combination of master and undergrad students would be helpful to amplify the scope of the class discussion. Overall, this was a great and very applied course. I truly enjoyed learning from the Professor's amazing experience and also from my classmates.",
    "This class was a good environment to learn about the SDGs and sustainable development and global health. However, I wish more discussion was involved.",
    "The class was great for someone who had very little exposure to the SDGs or global health\/child health beforehand. We had the chance to meet interesting speakers with serious practical experience in this field, and delve into a lot of the policy aspects, especially at the multilateral level. However, for students with more background in this area, the material was often times not new and very general. The course could benefit from better time management\/planning, and also having readings that are better linked to the lectures. It would be great if the class better facilitated a discussion, which we sometimes had but was not well directed enough. Overall, though, I think the professor is committed to helping his students, and these issues were due to the fact that it was his first time teaching. I think in the future some of these problems will be troubleshooted.",
    "This class was very unorganized and the assignments and due dates were often unclear. Similarly, even course expectation were not made clear to the students. There was a persistent culture of confusion among all students in the class. The syllabus was constantly changing and assignments were unpredictably added through out the semester.",
    "I very much enjoyed the small class size, which allowed for each of us to get to know each other's professional interests and ways of thought.",
    "This course could have definitely focused more on the health aspect and on case studies as opposed to a very broad overview of the SDGs"

   "comments": [
    "I would not recommend this course - the lessons plans were somewhat disorganized and most meetings felt like repeats of the last, it was more of a lecture then a seminar - very rarely did we have group discussions, we focused on only the SDGs and infrequently spoke about the challenges facing children and interventions to address them, assignments were incredibly vague (deadlines, expectations, lengths, topics).... Professor Alipui is an incredible person with a very interesting story and set of experiences, but this class fell short.",
    "If interested in international development I would highly recommend this course. It will give the student insight to internal processes and knowledge from the UN, although still introductory and not advanced knowledge. It is nice for some students that might like a less academic class, more based in work experience and knowledge and more applicable.",
    "Totally, I think that this is a great course, in paricular for future policy makers.",
    "I'd recommend this course to another student. Although the work expectations were a bit confusing at times, it was worth it in the end.",
    "I would recommend this course depending on what the student wants to get out of it. This course was great for learning about some policy issues associated with developing child health globally at a multilateral and macro level. It is a very broad overview, then again, the broad nature of the topic may make it difficult to go in depth while maintaining breadth. Sometimes expectations were ambiguous, so students should come in with some flexibility in mind (though I think this will be improved in the future). The professor was very knowledgeable, well-experienced, and dedicated to the subject. He was especially great at providing extensive one-on-one feedback, beyond what I have ever seen before. The field trip to the UN, as well as guest speakers from UNICEF, were also very interesting. I think all in all I came away from it with a much greater understanding of what goes into health development at an international and multilateral scale and what the mechanisms are for such processes, something which I knew very little about before.",
    "Take this course! Professor Alipui is very invested in passing on his knowledge and the curriculum was very well paced. We learned about the SDG negotiation process, key actors, challenges in project implementation, means of implementation (aid\/financing), and a whole host of other pertinent topics in international development.",
    "A very unique course with the opportunity to learn from Dr. Alipui (an individual with incredible expertise) and the opportunity to visit the UN headquarters. There was very little organization to this course at all--up until the last week of class, no one had any idea what was expected or what assignments were still due. We had to take an entire class just to talk about what we were responsible for in our final simulation, but the class provided insight from a very critical area of policy\/negotiations."
