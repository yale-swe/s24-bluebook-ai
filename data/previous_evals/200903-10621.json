   "comments": [
    "I would recommend this course to students with a basic engineering background because it covered some topics that are difficult if you haven't seen them before",
    "Biological processes relevant to environmental engineering, particularly cell growth (how it happens, what affects it, and how to quantify or study it), wastewater treatment and bioenergy.Yes, I would recommend it. It is certainly more useful for students using microbiology in their research than for students who are not, but these students can also benefit from this introductory level of understanding in looking at the biological implications or confounding variables related to their work.",
    "Yes, would recommend to other students:The course covers many of the current issues plaguing our society and any environmental engineer should have knowledge and the ability to speak on such topics as new renewable energy technology.It also covers fundamental topics, such as waste water treatment design, that are necessary to understand before working in the environmental engineering field.The professor makes the class fun and exciting. Any student will leave the class learning tons.",
    "Yes, this was an extremely useful and well-presented course. It is definitely worth taking!"

    "It introduced me to a lot of important topics in environmental engineering, including those used in the past and novel ideas\/concepts",
    "This course will allow me to better relate with my colleagues in environmental engineering who are doing biologically-based research, but I don't expect it to help significantly with my own research.",
    "This course presented a lot of necessary and useful material, and will be vital to my better understanding of my dissertation\/research topic. Thanks for a great semester!"
