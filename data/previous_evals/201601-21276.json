   "comments": [
    "If you're mathy and up for it, take it, but there are definitely easier 400-level Econ credits.",
    "Firms Markets and Competition is a good course, if a little on the easy side for people with a lot of preparation. If intermediate micro left you wanting more, this is a great followup with more coverage. On the other hand, it's a bit of a copout as a senior capstone class for the economics major; there are more substantial courses out there.",
    "An overview to industrial organization, which you should know is a math-heavy field - lots of interesting applications and potential senior essay topics - among the must-take courses in the Econ department",
    "Take it if you think you did not have enough applications of the theory that you learned in ECON 121\/125. Seniors in the class do not care much about their grades, which makes it easier for you to get an A if you are an underclassman. Being good with math and probability helps. This class also requires you to be smart and thoughtful about the ideas that you learn and answer challenging questions in the exams -- like coming up to auction schemes where no one bids her own valuation.",
    "I really liked this class. Professor Haile presents everything very clearly. Probably don't take this class if you hate math though. I think the material will be very applicable for my job as a consultant next year.",
    "Absolutely! It's an interesting but difficult applied micro course.",
    "ECON 409 is a good advanced econ lecture. If you enjoyed imperfect competition material in intermediate micro, then you will probably also enjoy this course. At the beginning of the term, Professor Haile said that we would \"use a little math a lot.\" This is a perfect description of the course--you consider many simple models of competition and solve them using game theory, some differentiation, and a lot of algebra.",
    "An excellent class - one of the best in the economics department. You learn about product differentiation, auctions, oligopolistic competition, and game theory, which tons of real world applications. Professor Haile is great - not lenient but very fair. Highly recommend the course."
