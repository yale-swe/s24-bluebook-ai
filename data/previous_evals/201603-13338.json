    "Question 8: Chad Oliver is great! I am most impressed with how he explains concepts using pictures he took himself (mostly.",
    "Yale F&ES is a good place to put it all together: how are we feeding, clothing, housing people, and affording ourselves places for recreation and refreshment? How is biodiversity affected by us? What are we doing to the climate? What is happening to ecosystem services because of us? How many people are there, and what is human population doing -- expanding? shrinking? One will get out of the course what one puts in. I recommend taking it, keeping up with the reading, participating in class, starting the data mining exercise early. Chad Oliver is very knowledgeable (an understatement) as well as very supportive of each and every student. The main material for the course is a book Chad is co-writing. It is interesting to see how Chad and Fatma are putting together global statistics and projections; and one has an opportunity to speak ideas that could be included in what will be a very important text for the educated -- or wanting-to-be-educated --- layperson.",

    "The personal experience that the professor brings to the class is excellent. He has a global view of all the issue discussed in class. The diversity in the class both in career focus and countries of origin was really important and gave broad insights to the contents of the class."

I learnt some new information which will help shape my understanding of the environment in general, going forward.",

    "Take it, if you want to learn contemporary issues on managing resources and some thoughtful ideas on managing resources by the instructor. most of the class materials are based on Chad book draft on managing resources.",
    "This course is amazing but the name at first will give you a wrong assumption. The name sound broad, yes, but the content is amazing and detailed and can be as specific as you want. Especially during class discussions. You should take this course if you want to know about the environment and its resources in one sitting.",
    "Take it if you will do the reading, participate in class, be enthusiastic about the wonderful data mining project. I believe everyone in our class did these things, and so we had a fantastic class -- the people and the process.",
    "if your looking for a class that is focused on data mining and its use and covers a wide range of natural resources, this will be a good class to take"
