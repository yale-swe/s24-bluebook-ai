    "I would definitely recommend this class--more specifically, Jill as an instructor--to other students. Even for non-18th-centuryists, the inquiry into 18th-century novels undertaken in this class provides both a period-specific foundation and a varied and powerful set of theoretical, methodological, and historical issues able to be used in relation to other periods.",

   "comments": [
    "I feel very familiar with at least the broad contours of current 18th-century studies, and more generally with the kinds of conversations critics are having about the novel as a genre. This latter generic theorizing will prove particularly relevant to my own research, though I hope to incorporate the 18th-century texts we read as touchstones in my future projects.",
    "This course perhaps most significantly reminded me that I am interested in going further back in history and in navigating media genealogies through novels. I am convinced that the rise of fictionality and other ontological leaps in reading practices will be benchmarks of my future research."
