    "I learned a lot about the morphology of different plants. I learned the structures that help identify certain species and applied the information we learned in lecture in our lab sessions.",
    "A greater appreciation for the diversity of plants in the world.",
    "Excellent class! Made engagement with the material from lecture super interesting.",
    "You really learn how to pay attention to detail. The lab consists of basically looking at different plants, drawing their structures, and labelling them, and in the process, learning how the plan works, how it evolved etc. At the beginning, you can't really see much, but, as the course goes on, and with the lecture to compliment it, you begin to notice more and more details, and ask more and more questions. Your drawings and labels become much more detailed, both because you know more, and also because you've learned to see more and ask more questions.",
    "A basic overview of structure and function throughout a number of plant clades.",
    "This lab was remarkably very useful I learned how to observe, dissect and identify plants.",
    "I learned how to look at plants and really SEE them. Where I used to see a just sea of green, I now see a huge amount of diversity. I feel like this lab (along with the lecture) has really made my overall day-to-day life experience so much richer. Now when I walk around, I find my self stopping, crouching on the ground, and looking absolutely ridiculous to examine an interesting plant structure or try and guess the plant clade that some little weed may be in. I loved this course, and the lab especially was so much fun, but also really facilitated learning.",
    "How to examine plants to determine how they fit into phylogenetic trees and understand their basic features. Also I absorbed tons of random plant trivia about certain species which is just fun to know. I walked away with much improved flower dissection skills.",
    "I learned as much if not more from the lab than from the lecture. I learned by experience the relations between different plant parts, the evolution of structures and relations of those structures to function, and uses of these plants. I also improved my observation and drawing skills.",
    "We got to get hands-on with every major plant group we covered in the lecture. This gave us a really helpful integration of those concepts and improved our ability to identify and dissect different plant parts. I feel more capable now in drawing plants, identifying different anatomical parts, categorize types of fruits, seeds and other structures, and just basically understand plants around me.",
    "How to identify a plethora of different plant family based on many different traits, how to label the parts of a plant flower and other structures, I also got try try a huge amount of different plant food products.",
    "Able to identify a surprising number of plant traits and types!",
    "I learned how to dissect plants and identify important and differentiating structures of plant families. This lab course really helped me learn how to look closely at plants.",
    "Drawing skills, lots of ability to identify plant morphology and groups."

   "comments": [
    "The labs were very interactive and very fun. It was very helpful being able to see what you learned in lecture in person, and it really helped to dissect the plants with the guidance of Michael and the TFs. The labs were pretty lax and there was always food to taste that applied to the certain plant clades we were learning about that week, which was really fun. The only problem (at least for Tuesday section) was that sometimes the labs we did involved information that would not be taught until the next day, so it could get pretty confusing to understand what exactly you're looking at in lab.",
    "Have you ever heard your parents or older friends talk about \"this one class\" in college that was iconic and a truly unlike anything else they had ever done? That's this lab. It provides a low-stress environment (full of snacks related to that week's plant families) to explore and appreciate plants and their intricacies.",
    "I considered attending the lab the weekly \"homework\" from the lecture. So I would say that the lecture + this 3 hour lab made the class about a regular amount of time commitment. Loved the food and the friendly collaborative environment! Got to know Michael and my TA very well in lab and I enjoyed it a lot. The final was fair and confirmed that I had learned a lot. Reading Michael's handwriting was a little difficult at the beginning of the class sometimes. If there was any way to have an overhead projector project the phylogeny that would have really helped me situate our lab in the phylogeny more clearly than his hand drawn phylogenies.",
    "Fun and interesting way to spend an afternoon -- examining plants, drawing them, and eating food. Definitely the most chill and enjoyable class sessions I've had at Yale. The downside is that sometimes it's unclear what exactly we're supposed to be drawing\/labeling. Also how much you learn can be dependent on whether you happen to be near the instructors when they're explaining things. I think this lab would have been a lot less stressful if the instructors had collected and commented on our lab notebooks partway through the semester so that we would know if we were doing something wrong. I have no idea what my grade is going to be.",
    "247L is taught pretty well. In general it encourages students to understand the plants on the syllabus, and it's helpful to see them in person. It's also useful to have to draw and explain them. It would have been nice to have somewhat more clear instructions on how the lab notebooks are graded and to get more feedback during the semester, but the class was still interesting and helpful. The food provided is also very nice.",
    "This lab is great. There is food every week relating to the plant families you study, and TAs\/professors are on hand at all times to help out. It was also very collaborative and people seemed to enjoy the meditative experience of dissecting a teeny tiny plant and trying to identify placentation\/various other structures.",
    "The lab is amazing. You learn so much by being fully immersed in the plant groups you learn about each week. Not only do you look at and draw plants in your lab notebook, but you also get to eat and drink plants through the food, drinks, and teas that Dave (the AMAZING greenhouse manager) collects for the class each week. This course has no weakness. It is completely perfect. I would take it again in a heartbeat.",
    "Strengths: The incredible food made this class a highlight of the week. It was also a wonderful group of people in a relaxed low-stakes setting (hard to find in Yale classes). It was great to work with plants hands-on and learned from up-close. Truly no weaknesses. A must-take",
    "Perfect class!",
    "No weaknesses. Food at every lab. TAs are great, Michael was present at every meeting to give us an introduction of where the current lesson was within the plant phylogeny and what the groups' characteristics were, and provide endless wisdom in response to all our questions. So, so fun. If you draw fast, you can leave early. If you stay late on the second lab day of the week, you can take home leftover flowers and food. Amazing learning opportunity and great community.",
    "Strengths: The perfect lab course! Drawing was a fun and powerful way of understanding the parts of plants, being in the greenhouse was beatiful and comfortable and a nice oasis from the cold outside, the food was delicious and managed to be even more delicious each week.",
    "All strengths! Great class, very wonderful atmosphere, clear path to learning incorporated, known expectations.",
    "This course was fun, engaging, and informative. Every class, there was food provided that was made from the plants that we were studying. By drawing the plants each lab, the concepts we learned in class were reinforced. Professor Donoghue was present at each lab to answer questions.",
    "Amazing food, big plus. Great instructors and TFs. Weakness was how far away the lab was (a hike up to Marsh greenhouses)."

   "comments": [
    "The lab is super fun and super helpful for the 247 E&EB course. I definitely recommend it.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in it. It was certainly the most memorable and enjoyable course I have taken at Yale.",
    "Aboslutely! Be ready to do lots of memorization, and commit some time during the week for leisurely sketching of plants!",
    "This is one of the most incredible experiences I've had at Yale. Lab was always such a joy to attend. Being able to sit in the green house and study plants for three hours was a really effective way to gain familiarity with plant structure and the concepts we learned in lecture, and it was also incredibly enjoyable. In those three hours, you could really focus on the material in front of you and you were encouraged to look around and ask questions of your own. Both Professor Donoghue and the TA were there to help you with any doubts and guide your work, but you were also encouraged to work with others. Keeping a lab notebook with your weekly plant drawings was a really nice project. Flipping back through it for the practical exam made me realise how much more detailed my labels got throughout the class as I learned more about plant structure, but also learned how to notice more details. The material for this class is incredible, but I think what brings it to life is the clear passion the Professor and TAs have for it, their attention and dedication to teaching it and helping you discover what is so wonderful about it. For that reason, Lab was definitely a very educational experience, but it was also very enjoyable. I looked forward every Wednesday to hiking up to the botanical gardens and spending time studying and drawing plants. Dave, who runs the green houses and helped put the lab together, did an incredible job and every week's material was accompanied by some kind of food and\/or tea derived from the plant groups we were looking at, so you could work on your journal and get through the material, and also enjoy some really great food. It really added to the magic of this course and made your realise what a huge and wonderful world botany is. Professor Donoghue also put together some field-trips, and although one of them got cancelled, the one we did go on was, again, very educational, and consisted of us walking through the forest and being encouraged to ask our own questions and figure out our own curiosities.",
    "It's required with the lecture for good reason, and I would absolutely recommend them together. I learned a ton in a really fun way.",
    "If you're taking it, it's because you're in EEB 246. The lab section on the whole improves EEB 246, partially because it helps you see the plant groups and the topics that are being covered in person, partially because the provided food is excellent.",
    "For sure, if it fulfills some sort of requirement. It's not a negligible weekly time commitment, but it's fun and you do really learn a lot about plants (more than the course itself, honestly.) Don't eat lunch beforehand you will be fed almost every week.",
    "Absolutely! This class is the perfect compliment to the lecture. Its not a traditional lab -- there are no lab reports (or any homework at all). You get to hang out, chat about plants, eat interesting foods, and draw for a couple hours each week. Honestly, even the final lab practical was fun! There is no reason not to take this lab. It's perfect.",
    "A MUST-TAKE. This lab with Prof.Donoghue may be the most enjoyable and eye-opening class you take at Yale.",
    "The lab is why you take this course! Does sitting in the greenhouse for 3 hours a week drawing plants and eating pie\/fruit\/salsa\/chips\/jam\/etc and drinking tea sound fun? Yes, obviously. But also you learn so much by this hands on experience with the plants! It's one thing to look at a leaf under a microscope, and another to be shown carefully prepared slides of micro and megasporangium.",
    "YES! Go eat foods make of plants! Discover new tropical fruits! See how (developmentally) a pumpkin is actually a berry and nuts are actually the same as achene fruits!!!! Learn that almonds are seeds not nuts! See how milkweed flowers are the craziest things on the planet! Understand how pollination happens! Discover the similarities and differences in different plant groups! Learn that sweet potatoes are actually in the morning glory family! Have your mind blown and your tummy filled!! Make friends! Operate microscopes, scalpels, and colored pencils! WOOHOO!!",
    "This lab is what makes the plant diversity and evolution class so special! I haven't taken anything like it! I looked forward to it each week and i always left feeling happy and relaxed. You get to hang out with friends, eat delicious food, and draw and learn about the most beautiful interesting plants! I recommend it to everyone.",
    "Would 110% recommend this course. Prof is a delight, the lab is very enjoyable, and the workload is reasonable. You will absolutely need to know things, it's not a gut, but the lab aligns really well with the class so if you're studying for the class you'll be prepared for the lab. It feels like a gut because you're so happy to do the work it doesn't feel like work.",
    "This lab course was required with the class. I would recommend this class because it had a very light workload but still was very well worth my time and taught me a lot of important information.",
    "Yes, if you need to take a lab, like drawing, and want to learn about plants for 3 hours every week."
