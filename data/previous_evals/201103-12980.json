   "comments": [
    "Seems easy at first, but be prepared for a steep incline in work and expectations conveniently timed for right after Shopping Period. Don't take if you've never taken Spanish before.",
    "If you take L1, take it with Ellie. She's absolutely wonderful, and I can bet she'll be better than any other instructor out there.",
    "You'll learn a lot of Spanish without really doing that much homework for it. Gansen is very nice and a pretty good teacher. Meeting 5 days a week can be a drag, but the class isn't boring and the 50 minutes will go by pretty quickly.",
    "This class is so rigorously regimented and based on evaluation that you will think in numbers, deadlines, and percents more than Spanish.",
    "L1 Spanish was extensive course covering about three High School semesters worth of Spanish in one semester. Multiple forms of learning and reinforcement (the lab, the book, an d the class) were nice but sometimes became convoluted to follow what we had to do.",
    "Yes if you want to learn the basics for the language... I would not take it if you are just trying to get rid of a requirement",
    "This was a class that I always looked forward to, however you have to realize that you will be investing about two hours a day just for this class."
