   "comments": [
    "I learned how to effectively report, write, follow journalistic standards, think about moral dilemmas in reporting, and so many other insights from some of the best journalists around.",
    "I learned the fundamentals of journalism and reporting. I also learned about the basics of financial and business reporting.",
    "This course taught me an incredible amount about journalistic writing and the importance of reporting with accuracy. It is a very practical course and offers an incredible amount of opportunities for students to go on field trips and meet experienced journalists and financial experts.",
    "I learned that I have a passion for journalism. I learned how to analyze business statements and better comprehend such business jargon. My writing skills improved tremendously. This class was invaluable- I cannot put into words how transformative it was.",
    "What it takes to be a journalist in today's era of online\/instant news.",
    "I learned about the economy and the business-side of the newspaper industry. Furthermore, my article-writing skills were sharply improved.",
    "This was my favorite class. You learn about real world journalism through not only theory, but also practice. Professor Herman, who is a giant in the journalism field, introduces you to many highly accomplished, Pulitzer Prize winning journalists by bringing them to class for class dinners and\/or organizing field trips to New York.",
    "I had zero prior exposure to journalism and this course was a wonderful crash course in the subject! I developed my writing skills while also expanding my knowledge of financial markets and gaining the valuable skill of being able to translate that knowledge into easily digestible articles.",
    "I became a much better writer through the class assignments, and developed a deep understanding and appreciation of journalism as a profession through the lectures, guest dinners and the New York trips."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "This course is incredible; there are amazing guest speakers every week, many opportunities for in depth journalism, and two field trips to places like the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, and Buzzfeed.",
    "This is the best course I have taken thus far at Yale. It teaches students all sorts of reporting skills and journalistic writing techniques. Students learn from private meetings with professor Herman, class discussions, amazing guest lecturers, and field trips to NYC.",
    "Fascinating guest speakers are invited. The assignments are challenging and help one grow. The field trips are extremely eye-opening. This is extremely minor but class sometimes got a little repetitive.",
    "Strengths - wonderful professor who cares about the subject deeply, great guest speakers and amazing trips to New York, a chance to greatly improve reporting and writing skills. lots of helpful feedback and opportunities to meet with professor. Weaknesses - the lectures were a bit repetitive toward the end of the semester, and did not seem to coordinate much with the assignments.",
    "Strengths: Professor Herman! He's incredible, and a font of information. The subjects we learned were all extremely interested. The field trips were fun and informative. Weaknesses: Hard grading!",
    "This is a simply amazing class. Take it if you can get a spot (it's very competitive so keep your fingers crossed).",
    "This class has only strengths, I would put it as my favorite course I have every taken at Yale. The readings are so much fun to read, the papers are exciting to write and the field trips are the cherry on top. The best part by far though, would be professor Herman, he is above and beyond.",
    "It's definitely a good course for people interested in business and journalism, taught by a knowledgeable voice in the field. That being said, the course had some organizational issues. Classes routinely carried on beyond 520pm and while they were engaging classes, a lot of people had evening commitments. There were also a few assignments that were given at short notice which is difficult if you're the kind of person who finishes things in advance."

   "comments": [
    "This was the best class I have ever took. I learned so much and it helped me with my finance interviews greatly. Furthermore, Professor Herman is an incredible teacher and I wish he could teach me again.",
    "Oh my god, yes! You will get to take on fun and interesting writing assignments, you'll meet and learn from some incredibly impressive and insightful people in the world of journalism (professor Herman himself, a lifelong WSJ reporter, David Barboza from the NYT, etc.etc.etc.), and you will have the chance to go into New York City on numerous occasions to tour news bureaus like the Times, Buzzfeed, Bloomberg, WSJ, etc.! This is one of those classes that seeps into your life in so many ways outside of the 2 hour weekly meeting time slotted for the seminar. That being said, if you don't have interest in journalism, and wouldn't be interested in letting a class invade your life outside of the classroom (especially via the field trips, which are such a highlight), don't take the class, because you'll get much less out of it if you put little in (as the ole' clich goes). But above all, take it for Professor Herman. The level of dedication and care Professor Herman puts into this class is unparalleled. I had never had a professor who I felt was so devoted to the class and the students before him, and I'm so glad I got to experience that before I graduate Yale next Spring.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course! Definitely take it if you are at all interested in journalism!",
    "I highly reccomend this course to anyone interested in journalism or business at Yale. The opportunities in this class are endless.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was by far one of my favorite courses thus far. The professor, material covered, and field trips are all excellent.",
    "Yes!",
    "TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Herman is such a gem. Iif you're interested in the news industry or the stock market, then you'll love this class.",
    "Highly recommended course. It makes you think about journalism in a new way and Professor Herman is always willing to take the time to help you improve as a writer.",
    "I would absolutely recommend this course! Whether you have had journalism experience or not, this course is so great. My absolute favorite course I have taken at Yale."
