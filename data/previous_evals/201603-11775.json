   "comments": [
    "Writing skills, interesting knowledge about food and its relation to women and culture",
    "None.",
    "WFC made me think about analyzing information a different way than most other class I'd taken at Yale had. It didn't really value factual material as much as fostering different kinds of thought, which was a cool experience but also sometimes I wished for more concrete information to grasp onto because i didn't feel like I was getting the full context.",
    "I became a better reflective writer given the nature of the assignments. I also learned a lot about myself and food, including my relationship with food.",
    "I learned how to analyze a variety of sources, including those that are not traditionally studied (cookbooks, interviews, etc.), and I practiced asking probing questions about gender and cultural practice.",
    "My TA did a good job going over my writing with me and letting me know how to improve in each paper. WFC had as write in many different disciplines which helped my writing overall.",
    "A new perspective on women's roles in food production.",
    "After taking this course, I will never look at food again. Because of my exposure to this class, I will carefully consider food justice and how that interacts with racial, gender, and ethnic justice. Food is so important to our physical bodies but it is also incredibly important to other broader aspects of our lives.",
    "I gained a little experience writing in different styles, and a fair amount of skill in using non-traditional sources as sources for critical analysis. While the class doesn't push very hard, and so doesn't get you as comfortable with these things as you would hope, the work that it does ask of you to do is focused around women's voices - biographies, cookbooks, interviews, and photographs of women and families, with one or two more academic sources thrown in the mix. It is a good empowerment of these types of expression to be treated as academically valid, unlike how many classes would interpret them, but then the class fails to ask for an analytical depth beyond an introductory level, and allows itself to be dismissed.",
    "This course makes you think about things you never considered before-- the intersection of women, food, and culture. The readings are interesting, the professor's lectures are amazing, and I even enjoyed writing the paper. After the course, I definitely look at food differently.",
    "I developed writing skills and knowledge of the connection between women and food.",
    "Women, Food and Culture.",
    "none",
    "I learned a lot about women, food, and culture. Not trying to be funny, but this was essentially what the class was all about. We also learned about these concepts from different perspectives. Male perspective, female perspective, racial and religious perspectives, etc. It was a very good, very sound class.",
    "Definitely helped me improve my writing and changed my perspective on food and its importance in people's lives.",
    "I learned a lot about how women's role in food production, consumption, and preparation has evolved over time, and I found this to be very interesting.",
    "Interesting class with very intriguing sections. Not always a huge fan of the lectures because they could be quite dry.",
    "This class was a huge gut, but I would love to take one of Professor Trumpler's real classes because she's clearly quite brilliant. I learned some about the history of women and food, but I definitely didn't learn any new skills.",
    "Interesting course on food and gender. Did not gain any particular skills or insights, but the gained some general knowledge on the topics discussed",
    "I learned a lot about the various ways in which food preparation, production and consumption interact with various aspects of my daily life. Food is definitely something that can be analyzed and used in many more ways than we usually think. I also developed skills in using different types of sources to write papers on an assortment of topics that intersect with food in some way. Using sources like cookbooks, interviews, and photographs was a lot of fun and taught me a lot about how to write a good paper.",
    "Literally none. If anything I lost writing skills because the assignments were so strange and unlike anything in other writing courses.",
    "I learned how to analyze photos in addition to many other skills.",
    "This class was truly interdisciplinary and I learned to expand my comfort zone. From writing differently to analyzing various topics in a new light, I can confidently say I have become a more perceptive and well-balanced scholar and individual.",
    "I developed my writing through the interesting essay topics. Definitely had to think outside the box.",
    "Better analyze women's roles.",
    "In this course, I was able to drvelop my writing skills.",
    "In this course I learned a lot about everyday topics that I used to never think twice about. Additionally, I learned how to write many different types of essays which was very helpful.",
    "I further honed my research skills, developed my ability to analyze and critically evaluate images and other works of art, I improved my writing skills, and most important gained a new appreciation for the value of food in our culture and how it influences our way of life in more ways than just through consumption.",
    "I think I learned how to get to the heart and the meat is a paper.",
    "I developed a new way to think about food and explore the culture around food. I started to view food events around me in the context of women\/gender\/sexuality. I learned to analyze primary sources like photographs, and to conduct interviews.",
    "The course is an excellent survey of how culture and gender roles play an important role in the history and preparation of food.",
    "I learned more about food and how women were often in charge of its production. Women have such a big impact on how cultures are shaped because of their position in food production.",
    "I learned how to write different genres of papers and analyze new types of evidence that I have never done before.",
    "If anything the class just made me more aware of the problems of gender roles in society.",
    "I learned a decent amount about writing tactics. Also learned about various cultures in many different countries.",
    "I became a far better writer, and was able to work on my skills using both images and events.",
    "In Women, Food, and Culture I gained insight into how many aspects of culture, society, and history can be analyzed through the lenses of food and gender. I also learned about various examples of this, from forager-hunter cultures to the impact of sugar on the slave trade to the advent of home economics. The lectures imparted interesting knowledge on a diverse sampling of topics, but the takeaway for me from the course was more about those lenses of analysis than any cohesive set of material.",
    "In this course, I learned about the fascinating intersection of food and culture in the United States in particular, from a historical and modern day perspective. We approached this intersection through primary sources, secondary sources, government related pieces... museum artifacts, memoirs, cookbooks and photographs. An examination of cultural practices involving food revealed the gendered nature of food production, preparation and consumption-- beginning with the dawn of civilization and ending with 21st century feminism, dieting, food artwork and general cultural norms. I also learned to reconsider analysis-- as the writing assignments overthrew my traditional understanding of analysis (and way of going about it). This challenge proved exciting, challenging, and forwarding.",
    "This class helped me develop my writing skills. Each of the four papers were different writing approaches, which were practically all new to me.",
    "Not knowing much about WGSS classes and the relationship and importance of food, I left this class with a greater understanding of feminine narratives and the ability to write on more creative topics."

   "question_text": "What are the strengths and weaknesses of this course and how could it be improved?",
   "comments": [
    "The course tries so hard to intellectualize areas that do not need intellectualizing. In order to make this course better, make sure all TAs are following a standard procedure and some arent being harsher and more demanding than others.",
    "This course might be improved if it were a DEPARTMENT instead of a course because it was way too much material, every lecture could have been its own class.",
    "The strengths of this course include that I learned a lot about food, and it was very enjoyable. The workload was fair, too, and since there were no tests, you didn't have to go to lecture or do all of the readings. There are just four 5 page papers, all due about every month and I was done before reading week, which is super nice when midterm and final seasons begin. This class balanced my schedule nicely. I have no weaknesses!",
    "The course gives a great overview of topics within this area of inquiry. It's a good introduction for anyone who is interested in women and\/or gender and\/or culture! The papers are cool opportunities to develop a writing style somewhat different from what I've experienced in other Yale classes.",
    "Very interesting readings and materials, I was never bored with the readings. There was no motivation to go to lecture because our grades were only based on papers, but the lectures were very interesting regardless.",
    "Workload is very manageable and the material is fairly interesting.",
    "Very interesting course material that makes you think in a different lens towards food production throughout history.",
    "No set curriculum or structure, but with a course like this that is something which is nearly impossible.",
    "The lectures could be more engaging, which would encourage more students to attend more regularly.",
    "The course did not adequately or convincingly cover the material that it set out to do. Especially in the first half of the semester, Professor Trumpler's lectures were more focused on providing historical context for women at any given time period - and seemed to lack a thesis beyond providing this context. For a WGSS class, even a 100-level one, it took a surprisingly long time to get around to much critical analysis of society and women's roles, and instead spent its time simply delineating them. Besides this, the course was a complete gut (which is good if you're looking for it), and let one off of the hook for doing any readings or even coming to lecture - the 5-page papers do not relate to these in the slightest - and if you can bs your way through section, you can ignore most of what happens in this class.",
    "This course is the perfect balance of interesting material and not too stressful a workload. There are weekly readings in section, and 4 total papers to make up your grade. A lot of people don't go to class because the material in lecture isn't tested, but you learn so much from the professor that I would highly encourage it.",
    "The readings and lecture were not very related.",
    "The biggest strength of this class was teaching me how to write. I learned how to formulate a clear thesis and argue using my own voice. Another strength, though, was Professor Trumpler's passion.",
    "Strengths are that this class is engaging and provides a lot of interesting material. Weaknesses are the powerpoints are not posted in Classes V2, and I would have liked to have been able to go over the material again, which would be helpful for the papers we needed tow rite in class.",
    "I thought the lectures were super interesting and engaging! Prof. Trumpler is very passionate about food and it makes her class pretty interesting.",
    "This was an overall great class. The paper topics were especially interesting.",
    "Strength: engaging with Yale through farmer's market trips and YUAG visits really helped me utilize all the resources we have in the school. I also liked how each essay topic was different from the last which forced me to diversify my writing style. Weakness: Lectures did not always correlate with essays. Sometimes lecture topics could be dry. Did not always go into depth into topics that I was more interested in, i.e. sexuality and food.",
    "I think it's totally bizarre to have classes geared specifically toward athletes to make their schedules easier. I signed up for this class before I realized it was one of those guts, and I was so disappointed because I was interested in the class. I think its strength is actually that it's so broad, and Professor Trumpler actually leads us to some very interesting topics and through some cool readings. The flip side of that is that I can't really distill what I learned about into any type of important knowledge with any identifiable implications. I just kind of added to my general knowledge.",
    "The course has so much potential as an interesting discussion of some of the most important topics that humans face every day (we eat all the time!) Unfortunately, the big lecture format just doesn't do the course justice, and the assignments seem to have very little relevance to the course. More problematically, the assignments don't seem related to each other at all, and required completely different sets of skills that the lectures or section did not prepare us for at all. There was no opportunity to actually take feedback from one assignment and apply it to the next, since the feedback just wasn't relevant for remaining assignments. Assignment expectations and grading was very unclear, and it seemed like course could either be incredibly easy or difficult, depending on which TF you got \/ who was grading your papers. There seemed to be no effort to establish any consistency whatsoever (and if there was, it would've been nice to know as a student).",
    "This class was great! Professor Trumpler's lectures were interesting and learning the different ways to use food as a source of information was cool. The use of unique source materials for the paper topics was a major strength. And sections were also helpful and interesting.",
    "Lectures have absolutely nothing to do with readings, sections, or essays and felt like a waste of time to attend. Also, most people in the course didn't do the readings so section discussions were pretty tough sometimes. Most of the readings were actually really interesting so it was a shame that more people didn't do them because I think the discussion sections could be really great if there was more substantial participation. Writing assignments were super hard because they were weird topics that expected personal voice but somehow needed analysis included.",
    "The lecture material had very little to do with the assignments. It would be helpful if formal writing skills were taught during lecture and if the essays weaved together the different things we learned about.",
    "The lectures and readings for this course were thought-provoking and fascinating! I learned so much about the main themes of this course: women, food and culture. Professor Trumpler is an engaging lecturer and I enjoyed going to class just to hear her insights on topics she cares so much about. The assignments were also unique, giving me the opportunity to expand my writing abilities. This class is truly interdisciplinary, giving me the chance to grow as both as a scholar and individual!",
    "This course was very interesting",
    "More open-ended essays.",
    "The course was very dry and could be taught with more interesting material",
    "The writing assignments were very interesting but the lectures could have been more interesting.",
    "This course was strong in that you could make what you wanted out of it. The topics were interesting so it was easy to learn. A weakness may be the amount of reading because I found it impossible to get it all done every week.",
    "It was strong in the sense that it forced us out of normal patterns of thinking and analyzing images with the writing prompts that were supplied. Personally because there were no tests, classes did not seem as useful as they could have been.",
    "Relate lectures to your grade",
    "The paper are all interesting and fun to write.",
    "The papers and readings are interesting for the class. However, I felt a disconnect from the material being taught in lecture because it didn't really seem essential to the assignments we were doing.",
    "The course had a great instructor. The weakness of the course was the grading was very subjective. There should be a more universal standard for grading.",
    "Section was more of an unnecessary pain than helpful. The section requirements should definitely be relaxed.",
    "To be honest I was rather disappointed in the level of engagement in the class demonstrated by my fellow classmates. The atmospheres in both the lecture room and discussion section room were dull. Although the premise of this class interested me, the presentation and execution of the class did not.",
    "Very interesting paper topics, would be helpful if more specific examples maybe in the assigned readings were provided to demonstrate what the intent of the assignments were (sometimes hard to know what to do since the assignments were so unique). Also, having more consistent rubrics for all the TFs would be good, as it seemed some TAs expected more from students and added challenges to completing assignments that were not consistent with the original assignments.",
    "This class was very knowledgeable in the many fields of culture, specifically in regards to women roles. The writing section was not as helpful as I hoped. I found myself learning more about the readings rather than improving my writing as well.",
    "There is very little connection between lecture and the essay assignments. As a result, there's very often a small number of people in class",
    "I think the lectures could do with more cohesion, and they would be more meaningful if the class were taught as a seminar to allow discussion. I thought the paper assignments were the best part of the class because they really allowed us to dig deeper into topics of interest and this type of analysis, and they encouraged me to go out of my writing comfort zone because they were somewhat nontraditional.",
    "I can name only strengths of this course: Both the lectures and the readings (which didn't always cover the same information) supplied students with fascinating content. This content altered my conceptions of modern day cultural norms, food practices, and gender binaries. Upon leaving lecture, I felt compelled to share what I had learned with others, and upon leaving section, I felt compelled to continue the conversations that were initiated. The different backgrounds and viewpoints represented in section made for an incredibly engaging experience and thought-provoking conversation. The workload was entirely manageable: i felt challenged by the nature of the assignments but not overwhelmed (neither by their nature nor by the time they required). I would recommend this course to any open minded student that is interested in contributing to a fascinating conversation.",
    "This class is extremely strong purely because of the content, all lectures were very interesting and easy to follow."

    "NO. This class may be a gut to some extent but you want to make sure if you are taking a gut you are at least enjoying the course and learning something new. I disliked every aspect of this class and found it tiresome. I will not recommend, Take something else if the material doesn't seem engaging",
    "Definitely a gut, you don't have to go to lecture and it's only 4 papers. A good WR credit, although it's hard to get above an A-.",
    "I would highly recommend taking this class if you are looking for an easier class that still has relatively interesting topics of discussion.",
    "I recommend it if you're interested in the material and plan to engage in lecture but not if you're just taking it because you heard it was easy.",
    "I would highly recommend this course. I learned a lot about food, and it was very enjoyable. The workload was fair, too, and since there were no tests, you didn't have to go to lecture or do all of the readings. However, you will want to because they're lovely! There are just four 5 page papers, all due about every month and I was done before reading week, which is super nice when midterm and final seasons begin. Four papers may sound like a lot, but they were all quite reflective and fun, so they almost wrote themselves. It's also a great fifth class, and because it's so different than the usual Yale workload, it balances a schedule nicely. Must take!",
    "Yes! Interesting topics and really engaged professor\/TFs.",
    "Yes, it's super interesting and really fun to talk about. I love food and talking about gender and connecting those two were a lot of fun and gave me a new perspective to think about food. Really easy class and not a lot of work at all.",
    "Yes because it was not an extreme course load but still required some effort and the papers pushed people outside their comfort zone.",
    "Very easy class, take it.",
    "Definitely recommend this course, it stretches your perception of women's role of food production throughout history.",
    "Yes I would because it allows you the opportunity to analyze different media like photographs and cookbooks.",
    "Yes, this course is an excellent way to learn how to write in college and has improved my writing skills immensely.",
    "Yes! An excellent gateway to Women and Food studies.",
    "If you want a gut, go for it. If you want a WGSS class, don't. There is hardly any critical analysis, and the course shapes up like a high-school history course for at least the first half (factual lectures without much of a thesis). Professor Trumpler speaks well, but has designed a course around allowing one to experience a few different ways of writing - historical essay, literary analysis, photograph analysis, and an interview - without successfully tying these in to her lectures or most of her assigned readings. It's an easy writing credit, with four 5-page papers, but that's about all it was to me.",
    "I would definitely recommend this course. Professor Trumpler is amazing and engaging as a lecturer, and the material is definitely stuff that you don't normally think about. I'm a Computer Science major, so taking this class was really different from what I normally do but I loved every minute of it. There was a field trip to the farm, photographic analysis of food, and guest lecturers.",
    "No it gets boring fast.",
    "Yes, great way to get a writing credit.",
    "I recommend this class to anyone who wants to take a WGSS class. It's one of the few lecture WGSS classes offered and it's taught by an amazing professor teaching really interesting concepts.",
    "I took this class honestly with the intention of it being a gut and I surprisingly learned so much more than I thought i would! and very interesting things at that there are only 4 papers throughout the semester which was nice balance of workload - no final which was super nice readings were very interesting and the way the course was split up was a great way to learn the subject",
    "Yes, absolutely! I recommend this class, because WGSS 120 has been such a fascinating experience, with really interesting lectures and readings. The papers were super fun to write.",
    "Yes! This class had a really minimal workload and the topics were also very interesting! There are 4 assignments (5 page papers) and no final. Professor Trumpler is incredible and teaches you about topics you ever would have thought of! Great class!",
    "Yes, this class was pretty low-stress. It's definitely not as \"gutty\" as you think though. You really should put the time in to do well on the papers, as some can be a little challenging.",
    "NO, unless your TA was great but mine absolutely wasn't.",
    "Yeah, take it to improve your writing. Particularly as a freshman the class is a great way to figure out the \"Yale style\" of writing and provides a lot of support in how to do research.",
    "Make sure you know what you're getting into when you sign up for a class like this. I had obviously heard that this class was a gut, but I thought that just meant it was a lighter workload than most Yale courses. Turns out there's this whole other world of classes where the standards are so low and your fellow students go out of their way to avoid any type of intellectual engagement. It's a huge bummer too because both Professor Trumpler and my TF had cool things to share. The work is a joke, section is hell and silence, and you probably won't learn much, but if you're looking for a cheap social science credit with an easy A, take WFC. Just remember how much money you're spending to be here and how few classes you get to take and think about whether or not it's worth it to encounter the army of the brain dead just to get a credit done.",
    "If you're looking for an easy fifth class, this is it. It's interesting, so it won't feel like a complete waste of time. But, if you don't need the class and you're just interested in the topic, just read the books in the syllabus and talk to people around you - it's no different from the course and you can go take another class instead.",
    "Yes 100% recommend taking this course. Professor Trumpler is great, the TAs are helpful and the course isn't much work at all. It's worth taking as a fifth credit if you don't get into a writing section.",
    "Yes, the class was interesting and engaging while not being too difficult.",
    "Yea",
    "No.",
    "I would reccommend this course because it pushed my intellectual boundaries.",
    "A solid low workload class in which you actually get out as much or as little as you want. 5 short writing assignments throughout the semester, plus discussion sections. The lecture topics and readings were actually really interesting to learn about, so if you're really engaged, you can learn a lot, and it's a great gateway class for WGSS. It's also a great class just to take to complement more stressful\/high workloads and as a 5th class. Highly recommend.",
    "The lectures and readings for this course were thought-provoking and fascinating! I learned so much about the main themes of this course: women, food and culture. Professor Trumpler is an engaging lecturer and I enjoyed going to class just to hear her insights on topics she cares so much about. The assignments were also unique, giving me the opportunity to expand my writing abilities. This class is truly interdisciplinary, giving me the chance to grow as both as a scholar and individual! Overall, I would highly recommend this course!",
    "Women food and culture is a fantastic course.",
    "In the first class, the professor referred to Africa as a country twice. After that, I decided lecture would not be my thing. My section was nice because I had a chill TA, but I hear horror stories from other sections. The papers aren't bad, but sometimes the grading is. I got a B on one paper because apparently I stuck to my thesis too closely and did not write an open-to-interpretation paper on what my TA wanted me to write. But overall, the course is chill and I would recommend it, especially if you need a WR credit. WR goes out fast so be sure to be on OCS as soon as sections open.",
    "Yes. Not a lot of reading and the readings were interesting. Class was interesting and there were only 4 essays 5 pages each and they were about fascinating topics",
    "Good class if you like essays.",
    "If you need another WR credit, this is an easy class for that.",
    "Yes, I would recommend this course for anyone who needs a writing credit.",
    "I would recommend this class for a writing credit. It was interesting and the essay topics were sometimes enjoyable.",
    "Yes because it expands your style of learning and way of looking at the world through a different lense around food, in addition to positive discussions.",
    "No, a student can find better ways to waste their time at Yale.",
    "Yes, easy WR.",
    "Yes I would. The papers are interesting and there are no tests or quizzes.",
    "If you are interested in the subject material and looking for a low-workload class, this is a good one to take. Lectures can be a bit dry but the individual work is interesting.",
    "Take this course. The information is interesting. You do not have attend lecture, but you need to keep up with the readings for section. Essays are not extremely difficult, but requires good planning.",
    "I thought the lectures and reading were unfortunately a little dull, but the four writing assignments were helpful and enjoyable.",
    "Yes! Definitely take this course because it is very fun and everything you learn is so applicable!",
    "Yes, the paper topics are unlike other courses and they are pretty fun if you get into it. Your TA will make or break the experience for you.",
    "For a writing credit I would. There were four writing assignments in the class so the workload was not that bad. However at times I found myself in trouble to write around certain topics or techniques.",
    "Yes, for anyone who wants to work on his or her writing skills",
    "I would recommend Women, Food, and Culture to another student because it has a relatively light workload and the lectures provide plenty of interesting topics of conversation with friends. I got by doing a minimal amount of reading, the lectures were not necessary to attend but they were interesting, and the four 5-page paper assignments were interesting to complete. The course was not as engaging as I had hoped (it would probably be better as a seminar) and the lenses of analysis focused on women and food rather than digging a little deeper into gender and sexuality, but I did get to try a new type of writing and analysis so the course was a net positive in my opinion.",
    "This is not a gut class. Four five page papers using a variety of different sources-- cookbooks, interviews, photographs-- were actually incredibly difficult to write. Easier if you get an easier grader for a TA, but that's random. The only thing about this class that is on the easy side is that the class doesn't have anything to do with the grade-- so you never have to go to class.",
    "I would recommend this course to any open-minded, curious student who desires to engage in a fascinating conversation. While it is somewhat less rigorous than other courses, the material is quite thought-provoking and compelled me to heavily and seriously engage. The assignments are challenging in nature-- but I believe their challenge would be beneficial to all Yale students in their untraditional requirements--their call to students to analyze in revolutionary ways (i.e. to analyze material that isn't traditionally analyzed).",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone that is looking for a WR credit and can enjoy writing papers that revolve around the name of this course.",
    "Yes I really enjoyed this class!",
    "This class was very interesting and forced consideration on food that I had never really thought of before. I really enjoyed lectures and Professor Trumpler is really inspiring.",
    "Yes especially to those students who majors prevent them from interacting with material outlined in this course.",
    "This course is definitely one of the more interesting classes I've taken thus far. I loved analyzing photographs as well as cookbooks to piece together the societal implications and personal aspects of women during various time periods. The guest speakers as well as the personal anecdotes of Prof. Trampler were very intriguing. The class is very low commitment, with a few essays due at various times throughout the semester, weekly section to discuss readings, and two classes a week where attendance was actually not part of the grade but because the information was so new and interesting, attendance is very highly encouraged."
