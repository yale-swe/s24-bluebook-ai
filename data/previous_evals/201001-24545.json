    "Take this class if it is required for your major. If you are good with numbers then this class will be a piece of cake.",

    "Yes, I recommend it for anyone interested in chemistry, the environment, or geology.",
    "The chemistry itself was interesting, but the classes were boring. Mostly psets.",
    "This is acid-base equilibrium on steroids. Its pretty dry and tedious but also pretty easy. Take it if you must, but don't otherwise.",
    "Absolutely. If you think it sounds interesting, take it.",
    "It was an ok class. Lots of material is covered, but if you keep up and go to class everyday, you will be fine. Tests are open book.",
    "I would only recommend the class to a fellow student if they were required to take it for a major. Otherwise I would recommend that they not take it.",
    "If you have to take this course you will take it. If you don't need it I wouldn't take it. Some of the material is interesting but most of it seems quite repetitive."
