    "Reasonable 6th class. If you're an astro major like me, you'll already know all the astronomy and going to class will mostly be a waste of time. But doing the labs was lots of fun, and they really helped me understand the observational basis of the material taught in 220, 255, 310, and 343.The 6 labs included measuring the separation of double stars, creating color images planetary nebulae, creating an HR diagram of an open cluster, measuring the period and distance of Cepheid variables, taking and analyzing spectra of stars of different spectral classes, and an independent project of our choice, for which I measured an exoplanet transit light curve. All of the lab reports could probably be written in 3 or 4 hours for full credit depending on how much you care, but I got overly excited about most of the labs and spent 10 or so hours on each. They were mostly fun, though.Dr. Faison is a great resource in that if you're in the class, he'll probably give you access to the 0.4 meter telescope to do whatever you want as long as you bug him about it. If you're used to professional telescopes, Leitner isn't much, but it's a huge step up from little amateur telescopes.I do wish Dr. Faison would work on being a little more organized. It's reading week now, and we haven't yet gotten back any of our 6 labs yet or even learned our grades on them. This makes it very hard to tell how you're doing and whether you should change anything in the way you do write ups. He also wasn't always at his office hours, which made it hard for me to improve my labs. Finally, telescope time was occasionally booked for two people at once, which was frustrating. Not a huge deal, but the course could definitely be improved if it were a little better organized.",
    "If you have room for an extra half-credit lab course, I would recommend to take it because it interesting and the labs aren't too demanding. And you get to use the telescope on a weekly basis.",
    "It's not terribly much work or class time, which is nice. All the labs are at night, though you can choose which nights (it'll be once a week, or once every two weeks). I'd recommend this if you need a low pressure half science credit, but a word of caution: Professor Faison seems great, really knows the material and is excited about it, but he has not given back a single piece of work. It's the end of the semester, I'm back at home, and even though I've turned everything in, I have no idea how I did in that class. If he fixes this next time, the class would be a lot better.",
    "This course is not work intensive, and the material covered was not terribly comprehensive. That said, the professor is very engaging and passionate, and becoming familiar with and being able to use the Leitner Observatory equipment was tremendously rewarding. I would very strongly recommend this course. Being able to use high powered professional astronomy equipment to image distant stars, planets and galaxies is a remarkable experience, and this course offers a unique opportunity to do so while also offering a very manageable and flexible workload.",
    "Take it, really interesting and you do cool things",
    "YES. Take it, its fun and you get to use a telescope.",
    "A swift run-through of various observational methods. I would absolutely recommend this course with Professor Faison. One issue is that we were not handed back our previous labs, so some more feedback would have been welcome. Nonetheless, Prof. Faison is an excellent professor with a brilliant sense of humor, and I do feel I learned a lot from his lectures as well as the labs themselves.",
    "BE WARNED: this class is not a look-at-the-stars class as much as it is a spend-hours-on-lab-reports class. It is a great introduction to the field of astronomy but not a great introduction to naked-eye astronomical observing. I found it to be NOT ACCESSIBLE FOR NON-SCIENCE PEOPLE. One of the worst classes I've taken at Yale :("
