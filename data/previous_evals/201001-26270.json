   "comments": [
    "Strengths: variety of class formats, timely subject matter, diverse topicsWeaknesses: too many topics covered so that no topic could be covered adequately or in enough depth, too many guest lectures, too many class activities and group work",
    "overall the course was enjoyable.",
    "This class was ok and the topics were interesting, but it is still a very new, and young class. There is high potential for this class to be great though!",
    "Overall, this was one of the worst classes I have taken since high school. It was completely inappropriate for someone with a somewhat larger public health knowledge base as the topics covered were such a broad overview. I only learned one new thing from this course that I will carry with me into my future work.Strengths:The exam was fair; the \"letter to the editor\" was a good assignmentThe discussion led by Tara on HIV in conflict settings was dynamic and very interesting; more of that type of class environment should be utilized in the future.Weaknesses:Having us choose long-term project groups based on \"general interest\" at the beginning of the course was a bad idea. I would have not worked with 2\/3 other group members if I had known them better (or known that they actually had no particular interest in the topic chosen, they just didn't know what they wanted to work on so they picked something ad hoc). Also, there was not enough guidance about the objectives of the assignment before we chose topics; accordingly, I would have picked a completely different topic if I had had a better idea about how the project needed to be framed eventually.The readers were boring. Also, presenting readings to be done DURING class (e.g. DALYs) was ineffectual at really delving into the issues related to a topic.Too many guest lectures where the goal of some lectures was unclear as it pertained to the course. Also, if someone (even with an MD after his name) doesn't know abouta specific topic (e.g. malaria), then he shouldn't be invited to speak about it; he should stick to his specialty (e.g. tuberculosis).",
    "I thought it was a great class. It touches upon lots of different interesting epi topics around the world. It's well taught and I am happy I took it.",
    "The course was new, so it was expected to have its moments. The idea of guest lecturers was great, and the course brought in very well versed people in their respective field. The information was useful and the structure was well thought out.",
    "Strengths: (1) subject matter; (2) guest lecturers\/speakers; (3) interactive activitiesWeaknesses: (1) video\/skype letures (this weakness may have been a product of the actual lecturer rather than the technology)",
    "Course was good, covering a wide range of topics related to global health. Guests contributed significantly to quality of class.",
    "I really enjoyed this class -- I wasn't particularly proficient in global health, so I really learned a ton. That said, it's definitely a survey course, which may have been too broad and basic for some students who have lived abroad. Perhaps it would have been better to cut out a few of the more random, one-time lectures, and go a bit more in depth with a few concerns (e.g., infectious vs. chronic disease, reproductive health and gender-based violence).This class made me realize that there are some aspects of global health that really need to be incorporated into other courses. I learned about some things (e.g., the epidemiological transition, the demographic health survey) that I think are really major pieces of public health outside the US. I'm really quite thankful I took this class, actually, because I don't think I would have gotten any global health information from this program if I hadn't.This was Dr. Gupta's first class -- so obviously there were some kinks, and survey classes aren't exactly the easiest courses to teach! It was the guinea pig year, so it wasn't perfect, but I think it's off to a good start.",
    "This class was an excellent introduction to disease trends and health disparities throughout the world. The class was organized very well and the activities that were assigned over the course of the semester were for the most part interesting and relevant to the curriculum. My only recommendation would be to reduce the work load slightly. There were quite a few assignments and in the end they each amounted to a very small percentage of our grade. I would recommend making the final group project either a paper or a presentation, but not both.",
    "it covers many important issues on global health epidemiology, and i hope it could cover more regions in the future.",
    "The best lectures were guest lectures but this was countered with other lectures that communicated the same info as a wikipedia search. I found this course to be rather mundane and really a drain of energy. I would not recommend it for anyone. Indeed, it really made me think twice about staying in the global health concentration.",
    "I feel like there was not enough hard epidemiology taught in this course. It was more like a Social and Behavioral course and less like an Epi course. Also, the assignments were often times vague and difficult to understand. Also, we were presented with a lot of issues regarding the health status of many people in low and middle income countries. However, I feel like a lot of this information was things that we already knew. Instead of just re-learning what the problems are, I would have liked to know more about possible solutions.",
    "Although the course was newly introduced, it was well taught and the professor was nice. It however still requires some structuring as I felt that one of the assignments was not very relevant to the course (letter to the editor).Course content touched on virtually all global health issues. In all, a very good course.",
    "TOPIC AND THEMES WERE GOOD, DISCUSSION WAS POOR, TEACHING FORMAT (LECTURES + SLIDES) DID NOT MAKE A VERY STIMULATING LEARNING EXPERIENCE."

   "comments": [
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Strengths: instructor was clear, easy to understandWeaknesses: instructor lacked confidence",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0The instructor always tried to engage students into a discussion, which was helpful because the students were able to learn from one another through discussions.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Wish she gave us a lecture on her own work. I know she has a lot of experience and knowledge and wish that could have come out a little more.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Just to put this out there: I understand Dr. Gupta is a new professor.However...Professors need to command a class with an air of confidence and expertise in his\/her field. I constantly felt like Dr. Gupta was uncomfortable standing in front of the class or having a strong opinion. She could not answer questions asked of her half of the time, even when they were pertaining to data presented on her slides.The worst thing was when students would make a point to one of her questions and it would be wrong, she would say \"well, that's a good point\". NO...it really wasn't a good point and you should be able to correct a student. We are here to learn, not be \"know-it-all's\" from day one.Another key problem for me was the narrow knowledge base Dr. Gupta appeared to work on in terms of \"global health\". There are other countries in the world beyond India. However, there are a lot of fascinating issues in India and in many ways, it's an incredible country in which to study a multitude of global health issues. Perhaps the course just needs to be taught as a comparison of India as a developing country and say, the UK or the US. That structure could allow Dr. Gupta to shine because I know she has plenty of experience (that just didn't come through in her teaching).Lastly, if you are supposed to teach a course, it would be nice if the professor were there for the course. If one does the math, adding up guest lectures, cancelled classes, and absenteeism, I think Dr. Gupta taught, perhaps, half the course. However, given my aforementioned comments, maybe that was to my benefit.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Jhumka is a great professor. She's very understanding and teaches great. She's really helpful and sensitive towards the needs of her students.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Gupta did an excellent job of using her resources to bring in academic leaders. Since she is adjusting to her new faculty position, while at the same time advising students and organizing a class, I think she did a very good job of teaching the class. My only criticism i for her to control the discussion a little more, as sometimes students led the conversation astray and class information was sacrificed (though I think that may be a product of the student's personality)",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Strengths:- Incredibly affable and approachable.- Provides thorough and valuable feedback for papers and projects.Weaknesses:- Lecture style is a bit monotone and lacks enthusiasm; excessive use of \"um\"",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0I would rate Dr. Gupta as a good instructor with a good background in global health, both academically and practically based.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Dr. Gupta was very helpful in terms of meeting with us and giving us feedback about our projects. She really did try and incorporate guest speakers and small-group discussions, which was nice -- though I think having some more time for general class discussion would have been great.I know he had a pretty rough end to the semester, with her father's illness. During the first of her two trips home, though, she did a class for us over Skype, which was so amazingly impressive to me. I never could have done that given the situation.She's a brand-new professor, and there's a learning curve (especially with such a broad survey class), but I think she's off to a good start. I would love her to teach a class on gender-based violence and her other research interests!",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Dr. Gupta was an excellent professor. She did a wonderful job in her first semester teaching and was always available to students if we had any questions or concerns.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Dr. Gupta is willing to answer all the questions in class and provide feedback to individual students. She meets students for group projects and provide feedback on a regular basis.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0The instructor said \"um\" a lot when she spoke, which made it a bit difficult to convey her train of thought in a fluid manner. This made it hard to follow the lectures.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0Prof Gupta was very nice and approachable and very willing to offer clarification on issues. Very good professor.",
    "Instructor: Jhumka Gupta \u00a0STRENGTHS WERE HER EXPERIENCES IN FIELD WORK. WEAKNESSES WERE HER INABILITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT TIMES AND STIMULATE DISCUSSION. OVERLY RELIANT ON SLIDES AND PRESENTATION"

    "Tara is very helpful and takes great responsibility in assisting the course.",
    "I was a bit surprised at how and why a young professor like Dr. Gupta was placed with an undergrad TA to teach a graduate course for the first time. The TA was nice and thoughtful but could often resort to childish tendencies of thinking that she was running the class. I thought that it was all a bit odd given her age and relative inexperience with global health. When selecting a TA for the course, Dr. Gupta should have made a more concerted effort to recruit someone older or more experienced. Just looking at the face of guest speakers that entered the classroom to see a 21-year-old TA was such an amusement.",

    "This course is a survey course. It covers so many topics that there isn't very much content in each lecture. If you already know the basics of mental health, AIDS, maternal and child health, you do not need to take this course.",

But if you feel like you don't know as much as you'd like to know (or feel that you should know), definitely take it. It wasn't a huge amount of work, but you'll learn so much about what's going on around the world...there's so much that the US media glosses over or ignores.",
    "This course gave an introduction to epidemiological trends and public health issues faced by the world today. I would definitely recommend this course to students interested in global health.",
    "This course encourages discussion and participation and students could learn from not only the class materials, readings, but also their peers.",
    "My advice to future students:1. With only 20 courses to take during one's MPH, I would really think twice about taking this course. If you want to know the materials, a simple copy of the syllabus and a google search engine will suffice.2. This course should be made optional. It definately does not meet the criteria of a core requirement course as it superficially touches upon issues and really doesn't offer anything substantive to academic growth or an understanding of the course subject.",
