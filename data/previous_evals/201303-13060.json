    "Generally interesting but a large amount of work.",
    "It's a good class to take if you think you might be interested in Linguistics. You'll do some work, mostly writing, but the reading and the lectures are pretty fun and you get to look at a lot of different topics. If you're already doing Linguistics it is a good introduction to Historical Linguistics. Definitely recommend it."

   "comments": [
    "I, for one, had never been exposed to historical linguistics per se as a general topic of discussion before graduate school. What experience I had was limited to lectures on the history of particular language families (mostly Germanic), never once considering more cutting edge approaches to reconstruction and philogeny as discussed in this class. Even if computational phylogenetics (for instance) does not lie in my future in terms of dissertation-level research, I am at least more aware, now, of where my knowledge of methodologies in linguistics has room to grow.",
    "The graduate sections were very helpful, especially the reading diary. It was helpful to present papers and to start collecting citations and making notes on articles that we've read."
