    "Overall, the course was very interesting. I enjoyed the readings and the in-class discussions. Of course, there were some topics that were more interesting to me than others. The major strength of the class was that we were able to learn about important historical epidemics in Asia from a very knowledgeable professor. One of the weaknesses of the class was that the seminars did not seem very structured. However, being a seminar, the focus is on class discussion rather than lecture.",
    "the course provides you an overall understanding of the major infectious disease outbreaks in Asian and helps you view it from different standpoints. The final presentations benefits students by providing a platform for sharing their ideas."

    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Professor Summers is very knowledgeable in both the medical and historical fields. He always had interesting bits of information to share with the class. As previously mentioned, perhaps a more structured seminar discussion would have made the class even better.",
    "Instructor: William C. Summers \u00a0Professor Summers has profound knowledge in history in disease outbreaks and can integrate clinical and epidemiological knowledge into the class which makes the understanding of disease outbreak more concrete and fun.It will be even better if powerpoint that conclude the keypoints mentioned in class can be provided online and can be used as a future reference."

    "I would definitely recommend this course. Provides an interesting look of how infectious diseases have shaped international relations in Asia.",
    "yes, good course to take if you are interested in infectious disease especially the investigations of disease outbreak. it helps to broaden your horizon and pave the way for future infectious disease study."
