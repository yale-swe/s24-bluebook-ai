   "comments": [
    "There is tremendous demand for this subject matter. Class was packed the first day and many people ended up sitting in on the class or auditing it. I audited the class, so I cannot comment on the readings\/homework.",
    "This course is super helpful as an introductory course for finance. If possible, could design this course for different-level students. Those with some financial knowledge could have more in-depth courses.",
    "4. For a 1-credit class (and compared to other 1-credit PSCs offered at FES), the workload was Way too heavy.6. The instructors tried to cram too much information into this course. The weekly class meetings were rushed, with instructors flying through lots of material with inadequate explanation for most of it. As a result, I felt very unprepared for some of the weekly problem sets and majority of the take-home final.",
    "The intentions of this class were great. And the subject matter should be covered at FES. However, I finished the class still not really understanding much of the material. In some ways it felt like we raced through just to cover everything and didn't really go in depth on much. The lectures themselves were often hard to follow, and I felt that I could learn more if I just picked up a book on basic financial concepts. Examples often were explained too quickly as if Maureen and Bill assumed we already knew the concepts they were trying to teach. The late classes (6-8pm) and large class size also made learning the material difficult.",
    "I think this course is really important for the environmental management curriculum. However, Prof. Burke's lectures \/ slides were not as helpful as her handouts for the course material. The slide transitions and clip art were really distracting...",
    "Some classes felt too slow and others too rushed.The final exam which took more than 8 hours for most students coupled with weekly assignments was too heavy a workload for a 1 credit class at the end of second semester!The material was useful and Maureen and Bill did a valiant job of trying to squeeze it into 6 lectures.My biggest suggestion would be breaking this into two classes for next year a beginner (for students with NO financial\/excel\/projection\/business experience) and an intermediate section for students who've taken Maureen's classes before and have some background in these issues.Ideally this would allow for more appropriate assignment and give students more time to learn the material\/less time struggling with tools and terminology.",
    "Students that do not have previous financial analysis training will have a difficult time with this course. Too much information was presented in too little time. At times, professors rushed through the presentations to fit in materials during the allotted time slot. Some of the homework assignments were discussed during the class but most were not. The class was too large and didn't offer the right venue to allow discussion among students and professors.It would have been helpful to have more resources. I found myself using google to obtain more information about the basic concepts.The coursework was very heavy for a 1 credit course. It should be at least 2 credits.",
    "Course was at a hard time of day to pay attention to pretty detailed material",
    "If you're interested in financial management, I guess this might be an alright intro, but you'd be better off taking a regular accounting or finance class. On the other hand, if you're not that interested in financial management, why bother taking this class. I guess the idea is that it at least gives you the vocabulary, the basics, but to be honest I felt that in order to get anything out of this class I would have had to put significantly more time and practice than a 1 credit class is worth.",
    "I would have liked more depth and fundamentals. This should be a semester course not a short course. We mostly just learned the lingo without learning the underlying principles.",
    "The course was fast-paced and covered a lot of material - which is understandable given the time constraints and the nature of the course. I thought the instructors could have done a better job narrowing down the information covered in class to that most relevant to environmental professionals - it was perhaps a bit too comprehensive for someone who's never taken a finance course in the past.",
    "Extremely useful class. With a little more time, or perhaps people that can take it for two credits, we could do more financial modeling.",
    "Question 8.The course is helpful to provide the basic financial concepts to people that have no previous exposure to it, but I found it went too fast and I could learn more if we limited the materials we learned in each class.",
    "This is the first year this course is taught- inevitably there will be a few kinks to iron for next year. I do think this course should be taught at FES, in this very same format: half semester, half credit, introductory course tailored to environmental managers. (Should FESers seek anything more in-depth, I suspect other schools might be able to fill the need.)Maureen's notes and handouts were fantastic! It was easy to refer back to them to review concepts taught in class. Bill did not provide any notes aside from his lecture slides. This course was missing some sort of text-book like resource. Especially since class concepts were entirely foreign and novel to many students in the class!",
    "For a one unit course, the work was too intensive. Weekly homework took too long and was too difficult to do on your own (correctly). The final exam took 8 hours... granted this is because I have no background in this material, an 8 hour final for a one unit course is a bit ridiculous. Further, I was not the only person who took this long with the final, not was I the only person who took a really long time on weekly assignments. It did not serve a learning process well, as assignments often created confusion."

   "comments": [
    "As someone coming in with no background in the material, I wish the class had moved a little more slowly. But more importantly, one of the homework assignments were very frustrating: the NPV spreadsheet given in class as an example did not match the one used in the homework - without prior understanding of these concepts, it was very confusing trying to understand how to transfer from the in-class example to the HW. And the TA was no help with this question, unfortunately!",
    "The cap. 20-30 people could not register for the class.",
    "the section on stocks and bonds. The man tried hard but it was way over my head, and I think lots of others felt the way I did.",
    "Revise the class syllabus and curriculum. It should either be a 2 credit class that meets for the entire semester, or else it really needs to cut down on the material that is crammed into it.",
    "There was a ton of material shoved into 6 classes, and it was a bit hard to keep up with them, particularly since it didn't seem like the material lent itself well to being taught via powerpoint.I also thought we spent a lot of time dealing with concepts that might be basic in the accounting world, but don't seem very applicable to a career in environmental management (like learning about profitability\/debt ratios and how they compare to industry standards). While knowing how to think through some of \"The Good Fish\" financial concepts was helpful, we spent a lot of time on details very specific to starting a business or being a venture capitalist.One suggestion is for the course to go into some of the concepts associated with public-private financing partnerships for things like land conservation, low-impact infrastructure, or energy projects (this was covered somewhat). Also helpful might have been an introduction to what environmental investment firms are and how they operate.",
    "A few things:6-8pm 2nd half of spring semester is a difficult time for concentration. It would almost be more ideal to run the course the first half of the spring semester, but it's apparent this may cause conflicts.I really like Maureen as a lecturer, but the space isn't conducive to her teaching style. With Bowers, speakers really need to be teaching up on the stage in order to project their voices to the back. And by teaching from the corner in front of the tables, students tend to give a one row buffer, meaning that everyone is even further back than if the speaker were on-stage.",
    "The workload seemed high for just one credit. Also, the final exam did not quite match what was covered in lectures\/homeworks (or at least the language used was unfamiliar for many of us).",
    "see response to Q 11",
    "See above. Assignments demanding - perhaps could be started in second half of class so that major process questions could be asked.",
    "More regular homework perhaps? Or no final exam, and make it a CR\/Fail course instead of graded one?",
    "The content needs to be scaled back - way too much information in such a short period of time.Have more in-class activites (the ones we did were great)Have breaks and, budget permitting, some snacks",
    "The course needs to be reformatted to suit F&ES students' interests - it was too much about pure accounting and finance, and didn't have anything to do with environmental management or firms. Also, the lecture notes could have been clearer, or more resources could have been provided.",
    "It would be nice if this were a full-semester course to get deeper into the material.",
    "The class size must be smaller.The course should either be a semester long, or the content needs to be revised.The course needs weekly TA sessions to go over the homework.",
    "The instructor tried to cover a lot of material in just 6 weeks. Consequently, it was really difficult to absorb and understand everything.",
    "I would liked the course at the beginning of the semester, where usually the work load is lower.",
    "Need more directly applicable examples. There were not any actual financial concepts for environmental managers. This was just intro to finance.",
    "Time of day.",
    "Pace was too fast, better taught as full semester course.",
    "IMO, this class doesn't necessarily make very much sense (see above). But, leaving that issue aside for a moment, the class was well put together and delivered. Excellent prep on the part of the profs, exercises that build upon material covered, etc.",
    "It was too shallow and moved too quick. The problems required more knowledge than was presented in class, so unless you already knew a lot, you would be lost.",
    "The material in the course should be spread over more lectures - ideally 8-10 classes. It's difficult to get a solid grasp on each of the core concepts when you're moving through them so quickly.",
    "This course seemed to be biased toward people interested in someone starting a small business and who sought funding from venture capital firms, though the instructors themselves acknowledged that very few businesses are successful in the VC arena. It was less illustrative of other finance concepts. Definitions of key terms were not defined in a clear way - too mixed in with other material. Certain key terms used interchangeably without prior explanation.",
    "This should be a semester long course. Too much material for 6 weeks.",
    "This course went way, way too fast, and covered very complex concepts that were far beyond the scope of what most students wanted to learn about financial concepts. The homework assignments were confusing and the course overall tried to cover way too much information for a half semester, 1 credit course. The course could have covered 1\/4 of the information and been far more effective.",
    "More environmental related cases",
    "Too much information is packed in one class, it make some parts of the class hard to follow. It would be nice if the class is more than 12 hours and we would have more sessions.",
    "- the need for some sort of text book or similar resource- slightly better\/more effective design of HW exercises- a final exam more in line with the goals of the course! Or if detailed financial literacy and practice is desired, exam questions should be designed like #1, where previous HW exercises could provide guidance.",
    "It's so hard to get around the volume of material in lecture. With the course packed into just 6 weeks, both profs went through their lectures very fast and it was hard to assimilate and pay attention to the new knowledge. Either less material or more time would be great.",
    "Lectures and powerpoints weren't very engaging. A financial concepts course that is meant for environmental professionals might need to start by considering why none of these students have never taken a related course in the past. For some, the subject - although relevant and important - is not engaging. Finding ways to teach the material in a different way (i.e., not through 2 hour powerpoint lectures) might help students connect to the material and get more out of the class. Also, using the classes to try out the course material (i.e., doing mini-assignments in class with more guidance, support, and instructions) might help homework assignments achieve their goal of teaching students the material."

This course move very quickly and covers a lot of information about stocks, balance sheets, etc etc and was much more information than I needed to learn. I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless they make significant changes to the course.",
    "It is harder than you might thought",
    "Do the problem sets early in the week, so you can digest things learned in the class. Wait till the last minute may not be the best option here.",
    "If the course is to be taught in the same manner as it was in Spring 11:you get out of it what you put in.",
    "Focus on the problem sets. The profs give you the lecture materials and notes and everything you need to do the homeworks is in there--read them over and take the time to do the homeworks and you'll learn the stuff."
