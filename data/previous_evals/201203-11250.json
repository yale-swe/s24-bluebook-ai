    "This memory seminar is a fun class that is appropriately challenging and covers interesting material. If you have no interest in memory it is not for you, but the content of the course is pretty broad, so it is likely to peak your interest somehow. I think it is telling that on the last day of the class we all sat around the table an extra moment and kind of collectively sighed, sad that it was over.",
    "Useful introduction to academic research topics in memory.",
    "A seminar discussion of memory drawn from relevant scientific articles in psychology, neurobiology, and cognitive science. A must take if you are interested in the subject!",
