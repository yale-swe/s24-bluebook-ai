    "Yes absolutely! It's a great upper level french course that covers interesting topics",
    "Class was very small, topic engaging but you will not have a chance to learn too many new words. I recommend this class to French majors and people who are truly passionate about art\/caricature and do not mind spending several hours per week discussing only this.Professor Madame is a true expert on the material that we cover. I really appreciated the fact that she invited a guest to our lecture. However, I believe tat she should be more strict about executing homework. I had impression that not all of the students read the material before the classes, what did not allow to keep class discussions on the appropriately high level.",
    "Mme Girard has a stunningly exhaustive knowledge of her subject, and she's also one of the most available French professors I've ever had - more than willing to meet after class, to look over your essay, to give you advice about things to visit in Paris, anything. (She also brought our class chocolates after her trip to France during Thanksgiving break, to give you a sense of her personality.)This is class is different from most French classes at Yale in that it's more about art history than literature, which was a nice change for me. That said, I think students would have been more engaged if there had been more class discussion. At times, it felt more like a lecture than a seminar, which was a shame, since there were fewer than 10 students.In terms of workload, you can expect two short papers, a class presentation, and a longer research paper. Eminently doable.",
    "The course itself was about French caricature from the 19th century onwards, which I didn't really expect from the title Art and Literature in France, so be sure to look at the syllabus first to see if you like the material covered. It is a pretty relaxed class - a survey of different French caricaturists. In class, you look at a lot (a lot) of caricatural drawings and images on slides by artists such as Daumier, Monnier, Gavarni, etc. and later from satirical journals such as Charlie Hebdo, Le Canard enchain\u00c3\u00a9, etc. Sometimes the material becomes repetitive, particularly in the beginning\/middle. One neat feature is going to the Beinecke and the Art Gallery Prints room and seeing the actual caricatures themselves. The professor is speaking for much of the class, so even though it was a small class size you spend a lot of time listening rather than talking; some people like this style, others would have liked even more of a seminar setting. The professor knows her material really well and is clearly very passionate about her subject. Overall, I think if you are interested in learning about a very specific type of French visual material, the caricature in all its forms, you should try this course. You will learn about the strange concept that is French humor.",
    "Tough class but very rewarding. Caricature images are fun to dissect."
