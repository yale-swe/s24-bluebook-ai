   "comments": [
    "Anyone considering pursuing any aspect of film should take this class. You learn really fundamental things applicable in all aspects of filmmaking and a lot about how the industry works.",
    "Write a script, revise it with love, think on paper about what you wanted to say, a crazy midterm folder.",
    "If you have any interest in screenwriting, take it. Lapadula is crazy in all the best ways and his stories are amazing. Midterm folder isn't bad if you space it out and the only work after that is writing a screenplay which is just fun. If you get a great group of people this course is even better.",
    "It's a really good class, so I'd definitely recommend it for anyone interested in the subject. You have to come up with your idea for a screenplay pretty quickly, and there's not much class brainstorming, so make sure you get the ball rolling quickly on that. Ditto with your mid-term packet - it creeps up on you, but getting a head start on coverages and plot-points (they take longer than you think!) makes a big difference. Professor Lapadula is a lot of fun, so, if he teases a bit, take it in stride and enjoy his anecdotes and wisdom. The experience of writing alongside others is also really meaningful, and a highlight of the course is reading aloud everyone's screenplays and discovering the cool work of your peers.",
    "I think you have to really be interested and have a story to tell but it's certainly a great introduction to screenwriting and literally just throws you into it",
    "I would definitely recommend it. Fun and fulfilling.",
    "I would recommend this course to anyone looking to practice screenwriting, especially if they're looking to go into industry. The class has a lot of valuable lessons, not just on writing but on how to translate good writing into success in the filmmaking business. However, for students pursuing simply experience in creative writing classes, I would recommend looking into other courses there's less discussion of how to be a good writer and more discussion of how to succeed in the screenwriting industry. Lots of opportunity to practice craft, but not a lot of discussion about how to improve it. There are definitely better courses for learning how to be a good writer, but for students interested in professional screenwriting, this is an excellent, excellent course.",
    "I would recommend FILM 350! It's a chill class that meets once a week and is fun. You get to talk about movies, read cool scripts, and at the end you have a product. Professor Lapadula is funny and passionate.",
    "I would recommend the class to anyone interested in the subject. The midterm portfolio is an incredible amount of work, but it can be fun to do if it is started with enough time to not have to rush to finish it."
