   "comments": [
    "This course is required for physics graduate students.",
    "Rigorous treatment of stat mech, fast paced but very rewarding. Even though it'll probably be one of my lower grades, I ironically think it's a subject I now have really good command over (having just took the final).",
    "This statistical mechanics class is a good summary on the subject. I would recommend that students take it.",
    "It was often hard to understand why we were doing a particular derivation. Often the professor was walking through the math when out would pop an equation he'd say was important. It may have been more helpful if towards the beginning of the lecture he'd state what we were trying to derive, or what context we were in. For example, in one lecture on scaling, we spent the whole lecture deriving the relationship between various pairs of exponential powers, but at the end we had a series of relationships that practically none of the students understood for what they were even used.",
    "I felt that the first 2\/3rds of the class are important for physicists to learn and I feel that I can confidently say that I now understand thermodynamics, where as in undergrad, I felt I had more of a \"working knowledge.\" The statistical mechanics portion was basically a (helpful) review of undergrad, with some parts in more detail. I do wish we would have gone deeper into topics such as density of states, as those tend to show up on the qual.",
    "Standard Kardar class.",
    "highly recommend the course, but I also just find statistical physics very interesting. It's very mathematical, but can be applied to a huge number of fields so it will undoubtedly be useful.",
    "Overall it's definitely a good course. The textbook (Kardar) is very good conceptually and provides ample practice problems, but skips a lot of math between steps in derivations, which made following step by step difficult. Psets are very difficult (sometimes more for the math than the physics), but Prof. Read is helpful at office hours. Both exams were fair, although I thought the final was much harder than the midterm.",
    "A powerful subject, taught in a way that didn't quite connect all the larger pieces for me until essentially I began studying for the exam. Kardar's textbook has really interesting questions for problem sets but the text itself was a bit weird and not that helpful for me -- I preferred supplementing it with external lecture notes (e.g. David Tong's from University of Cambridge).",
    "Yes, I will recommend this for physics students.",
    "This course follows Kardar's Statistical Physics of Particles, starting with Thermodynamics, and followed by statistical mechanics with much focus on various examples of partition functions. I would not recommend this course with Professor Read, but I would probably recommend it with another professor because the topics covered are generally quite interesting.",
    "Worthwhile. Relevant."

   "comments": [
    "The course material is very closely related my research.",
    "My command of stat mech went from literally 0 (being an undergrad with no formal stat mech experience) to fairly substantial this semester, so I am very pleased with the course.",
    "This course gave me mainly an appreciation for what assumptions go into descriptions of ensembles of particles.",
    "It's not meant to deepen my knowledge, it's meant to make sure I know some of the basics. Not much is particularly applicable to my research."
