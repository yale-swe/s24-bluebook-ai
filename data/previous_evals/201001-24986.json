    "If you are doing a lot of work in lab, you might as well take the intensive rather than the regular one.",
    "If you are interested in research and presentation, this is the perfect class for you.",
    "This course is a great way to get involved in real bench work. Just make sure that you are able to devote twenty hours a week to your research. Also, it's important to have a good relationship with your pi and labgroup.",
    "I prefer 495 to 485 because it is hard to get enough done in only 10 hours a week. It is imperative that you select a good mentor, otherwise your year will be miserable.",
    "It was the senior project. There's a lot of work at the end of the semester but since you have to do a presentation and a poster before you write the paper, the paper is a little less painful than it would otherwise be."
