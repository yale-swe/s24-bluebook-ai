    "I learned a ton about autism. But I also learned just how nebulous the term is and how the experience of autism vastly differs by individual.",
    "I learned so much about autism, something I really knew nothing about! The lectures were interesting and the practicums were a good place where we could actually interact with autistic individuals.",
    "PSYC 350 is one of the most interesting PSYC courses at Yale. We learned a lot about autism spectrum disorder and explored almost every aspect of it. This course really helped me gain a much better understanding of autism.",
    "So much, especially from the practicum!",
    "I learned about autism from various perspectives which was very interesting, especially the talks from the man with autism and the Yale graduate with his brother.",
    "Amazing course!! Going to local schools was an amazing hands-on experience.",
    "This course provides a comprehensive overview of autism spectrum disorder through lecture material. There is also a practicum component to the class, where I gained hands on skills in learning how to work with autistic populations.",
    "This class gave me a broader background of the psychology behind autism treatment and diagnosis. It was particularly interesting to take as a sibling of someone with Autism. The class does a good job of covering a variety of topics...some that are more psychology-heavy, some that involve the relationship between politics and autism, and some that help the class understand the impact of the condition on a more personal level."

   "comments": [
    "Strengths - Professor Volkmar is the biggest one for sure. He is so smart and so knowledgeable - he literally wrote the book on autism (and sections of the DSM). He is absolutely hilarious and makes taking this class a true pleasure. In addition, he brings in guest speakers nearly every week to give us a chance to hear from an expert in nearly every subfield of autism study. This was really cool - the last three weeks we had someone with autism, someone whose daughter had severe autism, and someone who had a sibling with severe autism. Placement sites were SO cool and such a great opportunity to put theory into practice. All in all, amazing class. Weaknesses - the class is really easy to not keep up with. This isn't necessarily Prof Volkmar's fault, but it's easy to not really do any of the reading and just show up to class, especially since the final paper determines nearly 100% of your grade.",
    "the professor is definitely the strength of this class- he is great!",
    "I really liked that different lecturers presented each week on what they specialized in. It was interesting to hear from practicing professionals who had first-hand experience in whatever they were speaking to us about.",
    "The strengths of the course is that it touches on all of the related topics and does not miss anyone. Additionally, the guest lecturers that we frequently had were a great addition to the course and the practicum placements provided invaluable first-hand experience with patients.",
    "Great class and Professor Volkmar is the best!",
    "I think the real strengths of this course lie in addressing facets of autism that people may not have heard about\/experienced. I think that almost everyone in the class had some background knowledge on autism, so maybe replacing the general\/introductory lectures on treatments\/diagnosis would be good. I would have liked to hear more about new research\/theories of autism, maybe linked to Hannah's research for example.",
    "Strengths : Great balance between in class lecture learning and on site practical experience in working with individuals with autism. Instructor is an expert in the field and provides engaging lectures with excellent guest speakers.",
    "The course does a solid job of bringing in a variety of guest speakers that are specialists in their fields. Some are more interesting than others. In my opinion, none of them are more interesting than Professor Volkmar. Therefore, I would definitely like to have more of the lectures lead by him. Placements are an excellent part of the class that require students to engage in working with people with autism so they can see the real-life impacts of the condition. My placement was such a fulfilling experience for me."

   "comments": [
    "Absolutely take this class. If not for Professor Volkmar, take it for the placement site - truly one of the coolest aspects of this class. It was incredibly taught, very very little work, and extremely rewarding. Could not recommend more highly. Professor Volkmar is so willing to help and so knowledgeable, you will literally be learning from one of the most important people in the field of autism. Like he's actually very famous; if you work with people with disabilities or have family members with autism and want to learn more, you absolutely should take this class.",
    "Yes I would recommend this class to another student, especially if they are interested in learning about autism!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested in psychology or the field of developmental disorders as a whole. The weekly placements at a mental disorder facility are a great learning experience and Professor Volkmar is an AMAZING professor. The course is well structured and the workload is super low in term of assignments.",
    "Yes!",
    "I would definitely recommend this course overall - the interventions were really enlightening and the workload very minimal but lecture is very enjoyable.",
    "This class was so refreshingly different from any other class I've taken at Yale -- it was definitely low-stress and low-workload (great fifth credit), but I'm pretty sure I learned more than in a few of my other classes combined. The lectures were (for the most part) very interesting, and my placement was absolutely wonderful, which really made the class as amazing as it was. It's a niche subject and you'll learn about it in great depth and from many different perspectives. I highly recommend it!",
    "Highly recommended. Dr. Volkmar is a world expert, and he's happy to meet with you individually. He brings in experts in many different areas of autism, and he'll usually discuss them at the beginning of next week's class. These experts include both researchers and people with clinical experience.",
    "I would recommend this course. It is a thoughtful survey of ASD with many experts in the field and unique viewpoints of the disorder. I learned a lot and highly recommend the practicum experience to get a closer involvement with ASD and a more rewarding course than usual.",
    "Would highly recommend",
    "I would definitely reccomend this course to anyone interested in learning more about Autism. I would especially reccomend it to siblings of people with special needs because it provides you with a new perspective on the condition. Professor Volkmar is a character. He's a very funny guy and a great speaker. This class has a very low workload. You do not have to do readings and there is just one 10 page paper at the end of the semester. Other than that there are the placements and then interesting lectures once a week to attend."
