    "Take it if you want to learn how to read spanish by the end of it.",
    "SPAN100 is an overview of the Spanish language, especially grammar, geared toward the ability to read texts with a dictionary. Even without Spanish experience, I was able to read full chapters of academic texts by the end of the semester. I would highly recommend this class if you ever plan to use Spanish in your professional life or for research!",
    "Take this class if you plan on doing Spanish Translation for work or in your personal life. It is a very practical skill, and I cannot recommend the class enough!",
    "This was my favorite Spanish class I took at Yale it was incredibly fun and was a great environment for a Spanish class. If the course still says no Spanish required, watch out because you need to know some Spanish in order to succeed in this course. However, if youre L4 or L5, this class should be the easiest Spanish class you ever take. Thats because the professor is incredibly easy-going and the most flexible, kind teacher Ive had here at Yale. Every class we just do some translations if youve done Spanish before, itll be super easy, theyre not from difficult texts, but even if some of them are, you get to use WordReference.com. There are five quizzes, which you dont get to use WordReference on, but 2 tests, which she lets you use WordReference for. All quizzes and tests are translations of a text shes found. The class doesnt test exact word accuracy, per se, just your ability to form English sentences from Spanish sentences. Its all Spanish to English, and no English to Spanish translation. No homework, not once. One project is bringing a text to class and having the class translate it together. And the final is translating the first few pages of a book that hasnt been translated before. Its all great fun and all you need is to have taken some Spanish before. Its a gut if youve done L3 or greater, but take it primarily because the professor is so kind and really loves her students and invests herself in them. A gem of a Spanish class!",
    "fun, relaxed, flexible -- if the purpose of the class was to fulfill a language requirement then it was perfect. if the purpose was to improve your spanish, i think the impact was marginal.",
    "I've recommended it already. A course that is perfectly designed to its objective, and enjoyable as well!"
