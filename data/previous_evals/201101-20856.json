    "I will not recommend Econ 551 if it is taught by the same instructor.",
    "Definitely. ECON 551 is a good and natural continuation of ECON 550. It introduces a broad range of practical topics in a rigorous way. It also provides strong foundation for other more advanced econometrics courses, such as ECON 552, ECON 553 and ECON 555.",
    "YEs I will recommend it",
    "Overall yes, but there is much room to improve the class.",
    "551 is a crash course in linear regression models. Although it has some applied aspects of working with data, it is a mostly theoretical course of when to use what model for a specific set of data.",
    "If you did some introductory\/intermediate metrics or statistics before but you want to strengthen these skills by rebuilding your knowledge about core topics in a more formal treatment, then this course is for you.",
    "I would only recommend ECON 551 for students interested in pursuing theoretical econometrics. For students interested in applied work, the course was near useless, save for one lecture on models for limited dependent variables.",
    "I would not recommend this course. I have been told that Econometrics III covers pretty much the same topics, with somehow more depth and the professor is much better."

   "comments": [
    "A little bit.",
    "The proofof consistency and asymptotic normality of estimators, and the expansion from iid sample to stochastic sequences prepare me for rigorous study in more advanced class. The introduction of decision model and nonparametric methods also broadens my knowledge in the field.",
    "Not much.",
    "My theoretical foundation is excellent. The course also strengthened my fundamentals in the course. However, I still only have a vague understanding of how to apply these models to the \"real-world\". I suppose I need to read more applied econometric papers to get a better grasp.",
    "Quite so. See 1.",
    "I don't feel I learned very much from this course despite doing all the homework. It seemed to have a very detail oriented focus and I failed to understand the motivation behind learning these concepts or their applicability to economics."
