I was suddenly in conversation with the history of scholarship on each piece we read through Prof. Greenwood's amazing handouts. And we thought critically about pedagogy the whole time."

    "This course was designed and executed well. I cannot think of any weaknesses.",
    "One of the best things about this course was the many ways of assessment it employed, from asking us to take standard translation quizzes to having us present in class and make a lesson plan. The nature of the course is to ask students to make connections across every text we read as we form a picture of Greek literature for ourselves; I think one improvement to the course could be making those connections more explicit throughout the semester, whether that's pausing at specific points to look back or creating a visual map at the very end."
