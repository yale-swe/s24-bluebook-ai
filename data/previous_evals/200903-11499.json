   "comments": [
    "This course was wonderful. It successfully combined reading modern american plays with learning how to write (for many other writing classes assigned reading and the exercises don't seem to work together). The problem with sticking to the plays on the syllabus, however, was that we seemed to be reading only one specific style of writing, and whenever an author strayed from short, sensible sentences, he was deemed the only person who could get away with it. But considering that reading the plays on the syllabus was such a pleasure, it wasn't actually that much of an issue.I highly recommend it.",
    "A great way to learn how to write plays, plain and simple, and a fascinating course in the study of plays otherwise. Yes, I would recommend it.",
    "I would recommend this class to everyone interested in theater or writing. You don't even have to be interested in both! Professor Margulies is wonderful and everyone should take a class with him!",
    "This is a great class for anyone interested in any kind of writing, theater, human expression, or life in general. I would recommend it highly.",
    "In THST 320, students dissect masterpieces of the modern British and American stage to see what makes them work. They also learn the fundamental techniques of playwriting through practice. I would definitely recommend it to another student because the reading list and the professor are fantastic, and you will learn an incredible amount about theater and literature, whether or not playwriting is your primary academic interest.",
    "Probably the best class I've taken at Yale. It reminds you what is so great about yale - you make a personal connection with an expert in his field, who brings his passion and knowledge to your project. Donald Margulies is phenomenal, and his class is most certainly one worth taking.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in playwriting and especially to anyone who has already explored playwriting on his own. I had been writing for years and was honestly afraid this class would be a little mundane, but I loved every minute of it. My writing has improved immensely. The weekly assignments inspired me so much and gave me so many new ideas for my own writing. I can't wait to write more after taking this class.",
    "This is an absolutely fantastic class for anyone interested in playwriting. It makes the lessons from older plays directly applicable to the practice of writing today, across styles and methods of storytelling.",
    "If you have any interest in playwriting whatsoever, take the class. It is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and Professor Margulies is a brilliant, brilliant man."
