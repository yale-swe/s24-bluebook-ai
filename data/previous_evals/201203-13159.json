   "comments": [
    "If you're interested in sustainability, I recommend looking into this course and seeing if it's for you.You should know that it's pretty science-focused (not like Gen-Chem, but certainly more than other EVST courses I've taken).It's not an easy course. The field trips were pretty fun, but weren't always that productive. The readings were tough to get through, and the discussions too. The lap report and the lit review were really tough.But I came out of it feeling like I'd learned a lot. This was the first year the course was offered, and I think it'll improve in future years.Also, take a look at who else is shopping the class. You'll be spending a lot of time with them, especially if it's a field trip. I felt like my class kind of split into two factions, and sometimes the discussions felt a little homogeneous. I wish there were more non-EVST majors taking it.",
    "I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in the environment and the outdoors. The field trips and labs are really fun and the broad topics covered in discussions are extremely enlightening. The workload was also manageable with only 2 lab reports, a presentation, a semester long research paper of your choosing, and weekly readings. There may be some re-structuring of the course since this was the first semester it was offered. However, my experience was quite rewarding.Also, if you can, go on the Yale-Myer's field trip. TheYale forest is a REALLY cool place!",
    "Field Science: Sustainability provides the opportunity for field-based, experiential learning within the Environmental Studies department. The classes are broken down into one discussion section and one four-hour lab section each week. For the agro-ecology unit, we visited two local farms to compare arthropod communities between organic versus non-organic systems; for the forested landscapes unit, we went to a Yale-owned forest to take measurements on forest composition; and for the urban ecology unit we mostly stayed on campus, focusing on Yale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sustainability efforts. It was a good class in theory, but in practice, it suffered from a serious lack of cohesion and structure. The discussed scientific studies were not effectively tied to our field research and class discussions often drifted too far from the literature itself, turning into the same broad discussion. This was the first year of the class, however and I think it will greatly improve in its nextsemester. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s definitely worth a try.",
    "This is a class you can take and make anything you want out of it. It was wonderful to sculpt my own lab reports and to read so many excellent studies in the environmental field. I think this class has a lot of potential, and EVST majors should take it if the course is offered again.",
    "Yes! This course is an excellent introduction to agroecology, forestry, and urban ecology. As it was new this term, we had to work out a few kinks here and there. I expect it will be even better next year. Professor Freidenburg is not everyone's cup of tea, but if you're interested in the topics it's worth taking the course.The \"field\" component was incredibly fun. It's a little too-good-to-be-true, to get to visit local farms and forests during class... every week. In truth, some aspects of our data collection lacked the rigor& precision I expected, but it was a good introduction to field work.The readings cover an impressive range in the literature. The weekly assignment to write discussion questions for every reading - though a little over the top - makes you actually read the material.",
    "In its current state, I would not recommend EVST 234L to another student. The class lacks direction and a clear focus. Expectations for students are unclear, making it difficult to know how to proceed, which was frustrating. Class discussions tended to be repetitive and lack direction. That being said, the class definitely has potential to improve. The subjects covered are fascinating, and the readings are, for the most part, relevant and engaging. If Professor Freidenburg would take a stronger lead, I think the class could be much better. The lab field trips are great for getting away from New Haven, but could use a little work in order to streamline the assignments and data collection processes."
