    "I would summarize MATH 120 as a standard multivariable calculus course. I would tell them to drop it quickly if their teacher is not good.",
    "Math 120 is an introduction to the problem solving techniques related to multivariable calculus. Assuming you need multivariable for your major, you have three basic choices: math 120, math 230, or ENAS 151. Comparing to some of my friends who took ENAS 151, I think I learned roughly as much through less work. There is not much busy work in math 120. Math 230 is harder and you learn more. One thing lacking in math 120 is an emphasis on an intuitive understanding of the material. I really dont know how a given theorem applies in the real world yet. If you are taking physics, this is mostly fine because you can apply these ideas especially in electricity and magnetism. If you take math 120, try to form a study group early on, and try to go to office hours. Also, what section leader you get matters.",
    "I would recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in cool Math that applies to the physical world.",
    "Fast paced but fun.",
    "If you want to do well in this class you must but in a tremendous amount of outside time and you must also hope your teacher is telling you everything that you need to know directly. This class if very fun and rewarding if you put the time into it and have the right teacher. If you haven't already taken multi then this is probably not the class to take because everyone else has and at least my teacher skipped or or breezed through a lot if material.",
    "Honestly, the instructors of Math 120 are kind of screwed from the start. It's designed to teach multivariable calculus in a practical way (although it's more proof-based than ENAS 151, and I PROMISE that's a very very good thing!!!!) and so the math isn't particularly elegant or beautiful. Also, many of the students aren't particularly interested in it. To make matters worse, they don't have enough professors to teach all of the sections, so they make grad students teach about half of them. Senia is probably the best grad student you could hope for - he's dedicated, cares about his students, and is generally a good and patient teacher. He did occasionally struggle explaining a concept, but that happened less and less as the year went on, as he got more practice teaching - and I would bet that if he taught the class again he would have no problems at all. His greatest strength is that he makes himself very available for office hours - go to them if you need anything at all! He's really helpful and it's fun to hang out in the math lounge. His office hours are the only ones I've ever gone to in 3 semesters at Yale. I would try for Miki's section if you can - she is in charge of the course and has taught it many times, so she's probably your best bet if you want to do well (and they do NOT curve by section, so some sections do worse than others!) If you can't take it with her, though, I would recommend Senia - as I said above, he's a good teacher, and he's also a really nice guy."
