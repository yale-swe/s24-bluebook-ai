   "comments": [
    "AMAZING course if you like Coetzee. If you're unfamiliar it might be a bit tough at first but most people learn to love him. The work load is fair - one short but difficult novel per week with a response, one 5-8 page paper, one ten-minute presentation, and one final 15-20 page paper. Certainly more work than a lot of classes, but worth it if you want to truly delve into such an amazing author. Also, one of the few English seminars that give you a chance to study a living author -- take it!!",
    "Yes, but be warned that the author is a bit disturbing. These are not happy novels.",
    "This is a class dedicated to one author and the many ethical issues that surround his work. Very interesting cross section between literature and political philosophy. I would recommend that people who are only truly invested in learning to read and write about modern fiction and modern social justice take this class. It is not for the faint of heart.",
    "A really great class. Coetzee is one of the great writers of our time and engages with some of the most difficult ethical questions with stirring, often unsettling, results. Prof. Neuman is fantastic; he leads an actual discussion and structures the class in a way that is both fair and of great intellectual benefit to the student.",
    "Yes, take it! Coetzee is challenging and frustrating at times, but with Neuman, the class is engaging and the discussion is provocative. Neuman is fun and here to stay.",
    "If you've read Coetzee and like him, take this course. Reading an author's entire works is a great experience, and Professor Neuman is engaging, helpful, and very invested in these books. Coetzee is not for everyone, but if you know what you're getting into in the material, you'll enjoy the class.",
    "I'd recommend it. Coetzee is brilliant and his novels are fantastic. Anyone who wants to be educated about contemporary English fiction should read Coetzee before anyone else. Justin Neuman is not the most brilliant English professor in the department, but he's really enthusiastic and runs a great discussion.",
    "ENGL 401 is a fantastic class. If you enjoy reading Coetzee, or are simply looking for exposure to a unique contemporary writer, this is the class for you. In terms of work, expect to read all the books and have intelligent things to write and say about them. It is well worth it."
