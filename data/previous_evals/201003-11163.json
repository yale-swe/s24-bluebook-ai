   "comments": [
    "I enjoyed this course, and came out with a different understanding of both diplomacy and US-Iranian relations than I had going in. As the course was taught by a practitioner, not an academic, it had a different feel. I felt at times as though Prof. Leverett was working very hard to convince us, as she would when giving a briefing, rather than examining an argument from the outside. The highlight was definitely the class trip to meet with Iran's President Ahmadinejad in New York City, and having Prof. Leverett's expertise to prepare and discuss the event with. The course gave me more knowledge of current, day-to-day affairs, but would have been strengthened by more historical analysis of past diplomacy.I would recommend this class to a fellow student with some reservations. Unless Iranian affairs are at the center of your interest area (as was the case with most members of the class) you may not be up for this level of detail. I'd also like to see Prof. Leverett provoke more class discussion. When we did have discussions, they were very interesting, and the simulation exercise was valuable. However, I would have liked to see more time devoted to this type of involvement."
