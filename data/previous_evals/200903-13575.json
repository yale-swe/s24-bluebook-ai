    "At first I was hesitant about having to take this course; I didn't want to 'give up' a class of interest for a requirement. But ultimately I'm extremely glad I took this course. It really forced me not just to write a proposal but to think hard about my project in a way that would have been difficult if I were fully occupied by other classes.",
    "Both the instructor and the TA were very well qualified and very responsive. The course was extremely useful for MESc student developing research proposals. It is a very practical course. The final panel exercise was an excellent experience, very informative. Classes and assignments were well organized. My only suggestion for improvement is that both the instructor and the TA provide an individual summary review of the student proposals, in addition to the panel review. I really enjoyed attending the class with professor Lee and I plan to take additional classes with professor Lee in the next semesters. Outstanding class.",
    "At times I felt the material of this class to be very basic, and somewhat too basic. However, through pushing us to write our research proposals I feel that I benefited greatly from this course.",
    "Q.7: The Professor did a great job at bringing to the fore, the \"philosophy (or rather philosophies) of science and scientific research. In my experience, this is often glossed over. This time, this Professor gave time to \"thinkings\" that guide scientific research. Personally, i found that very useful.",
    "3. Assignments should have been more clearly defined and described further in advance. Verbal attempts to explain assignments were often confusing, and email follow-up descriptions were often sent several days after the assignment was assigned.",
    "The class was a lot to handle, and given that, I think the professor and TA did a great job of reining it all in. Both were obviously very dedicated to trying to have every project properly reviewed. A more organized, detailed syllabus in the beginning of the semester would have been helpful.",
    "I have a feeling opinions of this course will range widely. That's probably valid. I know mine ranged widely over the course of the semester. I'll articulate what I thought was great about it later, but here are my suggestions. This course absolutely needs to be limited to a smaller number of people. It requires an enormous amount of work from the individuals, who are focused on something very crucial to their academic experience (their own research project), and these individuals deserve a large amount of time and energy from their peers and instructors in the form of feedback on these projects. This is impossible if there are 27 students in the class. The process of presenting our proposals and especially the last \"simulation\" would have benefited *immensely* from having more time to spend on each proposal. Less class time should be spent on the readings (especially time where the professors simply present back the material in the readings - that's not necessary - the readings are not complicated) and more time should be spent in groups discussing our projects with students who have a background in what we are researching. In other words, the industrial ecology people should have more time to benefit from the expertise of the other industrial ecology people, etc. I feel we already have enough time to present to the whole group.Sometimes, it felt like we were doing the most important work in the world (when we were presenting our ppts, for example) and sometimes it felt like we were truly wasting our time (with the readings, for example). Evening this out would be helpful. And did I mention the class needs to be smaller? Offer two sections if necessary - but it's unworkable with 27.",
    "I felt like the class could have been better planned to help students learn more. I think small discussion groups would have been more helpful when talking about proposals. In small discussion groups, students could get more input about their proposals instead of just a few minutes in class. I feel like many of my peers could have offered me great feedback if we were in smaller groups (5-6 people). In addition, I feel like some of the assignments were not helpful in developing my proposal and others should have had more time. For instance, I believe that having two presentations within a 2-3 week period was not helpful to my learning. Maybe if we were in smaller groups and had one presentation about our project where the others in the group had to comment (on paper) about the presentation, would have been helpful.",
    "The topic of this course is Research Methods, but topics of the course did not cover research methods as was to be expected. This ended up just being a class that had us write our research proposals and present our research plans. The readings were not very relevant to our class and were not interesting. The class was not organized. Expectations, class assignments, and grading procedures were not adequately explained, clarified, and were often unorganized. This class has a lot of potential to be a useful class, but many students, including myself, found it aggrivating and just busy work.",
    "Question 8:I definitely benefited some from the class because it forced me to start thinking about research in more detail, but in the end, my proposal was rushed by the pace of the course and I didn't get significant feedback.Question 10:Both the instructor and the TA focus on ecology in their own research, and so the class discussions were heavily skewed in that direction.",
    "Question 6: My major complaint centers not around the quality of instruction or readings (both, as I indicate above, were excellent) but on two simple logistical problems that significantly detracted from my learning experience. The instructors had little control over these two issues.1. There were simply too many people enrolled in the course, including several students who were not enrolled in the MESc degree track. This had two effects. First, it spread the instructor and TA very thinly -- while they did an admirable job, feedback and commentary on the multiple deliverables for the course could have been much more extensive had there been fewer students. They simply did not have time to provide top-quality feedback to 30 students on what amounted to a significant assignment every 1-2 weeks. Second, there was not enough time in the allotted course meeting periods to adequately and fairly address each student's work. While I recognize the administration may want to make as many classes as possible available to all students, Research Methods is one of only two courses which MESc students are required to take. The course is one of the reasons students undertake significant additional effort (i.e. a thesis) to obtain an MESc degree. The least the administration could do is restrict enrollment so the primary targets of the course (MESc candidates) get the most out of it.2. Tied to the first issue: Even after the location was changed in the first weeks of the semester, the course was held for the entire term in a classroom that DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH CHAIRS for all students to sit. THREE TO FOUR students SAT ON THE WINDOWSILL for 90 minutes twice a week for twelve weeks. This was unconscionable at an institution with resources such as Yale's!"

I attribute a lot of that to the individuals that taught it.- the design is (mostly) great. It's a terrific, real-world way to get students to learn about writing proposals. seems really unique and probably was the most useful course I took this semester.- the presentations and simulations- giving us small assignments along the way- it felt like we were being given real work to do , of great importance, and it motivated me to work really hard.

   "comments": [
    "The course was heavily loaded toward the end of the semester. Some of that load could have been moved to the beginning of the course with a required literature review earlier on, so at least a draft was done.Unfortunately I did not receive any constructive criticism from the instructor or the TA on my proposal at any step along the way. This means that I have no idea how the final project I submitted will be received. Nor do I know if they will give me any feedback besides a grade at the end.",
    "Perhaps encouraging students to start a literature review early on in the semester.",
    "We didn't really spend any time on some very important aspects of research; e.g. we did not talk at all about how to craft a literature review and organize previous work in one's field. We also didn't cover the preparation of budgets or timelines. Even a single session to cover all the basics of these would have been very helpful to those of us who are preparing our own research proposal for the first time.",
    "They need to figure out whether second year and and fifth year students should be allowed to recycle the proposals associated with their original projects.",
    "Not many improvement opportunities. I would like to see a more detailed final review of the proposals by the instructor, TA, and even maybe other professors with extensive research experience. The more feedback the better.",
    "Although I felt some of the reading materials were a bit redundant, I feel that for some who do not have a scientific background they were necessary.",
    "In the last part we have to rush because there were too many students and we had not too much time too discuss in depth.",
    "The mimicked peer review I found really poorly designed. There really must be more time to discuss the merits of each proposal before voting. The class should be split into very small groups for this exercise. Then, feedback could be given meaningfully and the point of view of different reviewers questioned before the vote. We were essentially unable to discuss each others work at all, and that was supposed to be the point. I liked the intensity of presenting to the whole class and the whole class voting, but it eliminated meaningful feedback. It was more a personal challenge than a learning experience relevant to our proposal.",
    "The pace of the course does not allow much time to explore different research ideas. My recommendation for improving the course (and the overall basis for this course) would be to either include more time or to dedicate some of that time before the course (during MODS for example) for 1st year MESc and MFS degree seekers specifically for idea exploration.",
    "The need for at least 3 writing labs",
    "The final voting for student proposals should definitely be anonymous. Also, the schedule made it impractical for students to read EVERY proposal before voting. Maybe the subgroups should vote first and have their votes weighted as 50% of the final vote--or some system other than a popular democracy.",
    "Could have done a better job of handling students' projects which are not natural science oriented or involve qualitative methods. Most students don't fall strictly within the natural or social science research methods classes. I felt that students who didn't fall within the natural sciences sphere were criticized more.Readings were not useful. The topics of the readings were not applicable to many students.",
    "Evaluation of my work was peer reviewed. I would suggest a ballot that is silent rather than raised hands in class. I would also improve the method by which assignments are evaluated. I felt as though several of my pieces were commented on in a brief way. In this respect, I felt as though my project was better than the evaluations received by my classmates and instructors.",
    "Professor did not adequately respect the end of class time and ran past the allotted time making students late for other classes that immediately followed.The process by which proposals are evaluated needs to be reconsidered. It was too rushed.The last week or so of class should be dedicated to discussing what should happen in the project planning process during the spring semester and leading up to project execution.The budget development process should be explicitly covered in class.Class size was larger than optimal.",
    "- a clear syllabus was presented in the beginning but for some reason, it didn't always feel like we stuck to it.- the work to be done over Thanksgiving was not clearly articulated until the day before break.- Lectures do not need to focus on presenting material in the readings. It should be discussed by the students *or* additional information should be presented not directly from the readings.- smaller, smaller, smaller.- more time in groups with people with similar backgrounds.",
    "The structure and design of the course are in need of improvement. See question 11.",
    "1. Make it an actal research methods class instead of a proposal writing class (which could be taught in half the time if it is just about a proposal).2. Revamp the peer-review of our proposals. The instructors had us review, critique, and judge some of our peers proposals in a mock peer review panel with the aim of picking the top two proposals that would receive $1,000 each. Students ended up voting on proposals they did not read and did not understand. It is a very flawed and unfair process. This is a very positivistic and biased class. The instructor does not really understand or appreciate any research projects that are more interdisciplinary. There needs to be a research methods class that is interdisciplinary where a teacher is trained in both the natural and social sciences and who understands the value of proposed research projects that bridge these two fields.3. An instructor should be engaging and clear about instructions and assignments. While this instructor clearly tried his best, it is not a very rewarding class.4. The majority of the class was devoted to student presentations with a few minutes after each presenter to quickly ask questions and give comments. It would be more helpful to give students more time to fill out peer evaluations to get better and more constructive feedback.",
    "I did not leave this class with a full understanding of research methods to be employed in conducting research (ex. statistics, fact checking, particular quantitative methods). Although I realize this is not the intent of this particular class, I would have appreciated a greater emphasis on the nuts and bolts of research.",
    "I don't think that crafting a final NSF style proposal is the most effective use of time in the course.",

Because my background was different than what I came to FES to pursue, I would have benefited from having more coursework before being required to write a project proposal. There is probably a better way to structure the course to help students transition into the research degree. Perhaps holding it in the second half of the fall semester and having proposals due at the end of the first half of the spring semester. That would allow the ideas to be developed over winter break.We were pushed to choose proposal ideas early in the semester.

This was incredibly frustrating.We skipped right from grand theories of science to the final proposal, skipping all the material I needed to learn to design my research project. We didnt learn any \"research methods\" at all, we were expected to have already worked all that out. It was a backwards approach. I was not ready to develop a coherent proposal until I learn what a good hypothesis is and how to test it. I am still going back and changing my proposal almost weekly. It only helps a little to have developed this proposal premeturely, and it caused me a lot of anguish.I was left scrambling all semester to identify people and places to learn actual \"research methods\" from, and distracted from that by having to finalize my proposal. The literature review is not finished, the budget is doubtful, and the whole premises of the project are subject to major changes because I have not yet gone through the preliminary step of understanding how I might test a hypothesis in a rigorous way. It is turning out to be a circular, rather than a linear progression, which is chaotic and confusing.This course should be offered in the spring and a different one should be offered in the fall that actually starts at the beginning of the process, teaching experimental design and hypothesis testing.",

    "The group work was just busy work that was not helpful to the course.",
    "No disadvantages. It was helpful to hear other students perspectives, especially for the dense technical papers we read.",
    "We were grouped by interest areas for several assignments. Getting to know other students who have similar interests was helpful, but due to the small size of the class and diversity of interests, there wasn't really much overlap.I think that the groups could have been developed further to help workshop proposals and ideas more.",
    "The work groups were helpful for the early-on assignments that involved significant class discussion. However, I did not think the work groups were particularly helpful later on in the semester, particularly since none of us really had the same specific technical backgrounds as the other members of the group (therefore it was difficult for us to help each other with the real work of disciplinary proposal writing)."

   "question_text": "For students taking this course, what advice would you give them?",
   "comments": [
    "start working on your project proposal early so you have time to get a few drafts done.",
    "Work hard on your proposal and take it seriously. You'll be glad that you did.",
    "Standard stuff:Keep up with the assignments, participate fully in class discussions, ask for help early and often.",
    "Prepared for a fast paced course which places very heavy emphasis on decisions made early on in the semester.",
    "Focus your effort on developing a good research proposal and you will get out of the class with a great product.",
    "Treat the proposal as seriously as possible and really try to work on something you actually intend to do.",
    "It should be offered in the spring and a different one should be offered in the fall that actually starts at the beginning of the process, teaching experimental design and hypothesis testing.Science degree students should also be required to take a project course your first semester, no matter how excited you are about course offerings!",
    "Students taking this course need to already have a good idea about what they wish to research.",
    "It is a necessity if they wish to do research here at Yale.",
    "Allow plenty of time for analysis and rewording of the proposal.",
    "This course did not meet my expectations perhaps because I had the wrong expectations. I was on the fence between a research based focus and a non-research degree. I was expecting this class to be useful in helping me learn how to conduct research. Instead the entire class was focused on how to write a research proposal for funding. I think this class would be useful for students that have conducted research in the past, already know what research project they are going to do, or have an advisor with a project that the student will be a part of. Otherwise, I would wait to take this course until one of those criteria are met.",
    "Keep your expectations low and be prepared to have to figure out a lot on your own. Plan on meeting frequently with your advisor(s) and rely on them more than you do on the class.",
    "Just be very clear what this course will require of you and talk to people who have taken it. This course is very dependent on the people who are in it - that's true of any class - but moreso with this one. I don't mean whether you \"like\" them or something. But the best parts of this course come from students who are really dedicated togiving you good feedback and to working hard on their projects. If people are just \"going through the motions\" and treating this like a simulation, it doesn't work.",
    "Seek help outside of the class (other professors, students, etc.)to write your proposal. Ask questions and make comments in class because they are valuable to the instructors and the students.",
    "If this instructor continues to teach this class, I would warn students that it is going to be mainly a class on writing proposals and giving (and hearing) many presentations.",
    "Read other students proposals, summaries, etc. It will expand your thinking and help your own research.",
    "Keep your proposal idea simple. You probably will not be sufficiently prepared to write a real proposal in the timeframe of the course. It should be related to what you are interested in, but a full proposal will take more time if your interests are not something you have extensive background in.",
    "Put a lot of effort into the proposal -- use your classmates' feedback and the time and care of the instructors to your advantage. You will come away with a product you can use and which has high value."
