    "You need to take it, so take it. But do it in the fall. My best advice is to do it in the fall. You hear me? Do it in the fall. You don't want to deal with this project in the spring. So do it in the fall. One last piece of advice: do it in the fall.",
    "You have to take it to finish the major. It's independent work with an advisor.",
    "You gotta take it. Find a project you're actually excited about or else it'll be really hard to get work done on it. The project can be as easy or difficult as you like.",
    "You have to take this, and CS majors usually do things very last-minute. It'll get done, but try starting early! I recommend picking your own project after researching the state-of-the-art in the field. Make sure it's something you're excited to work on.",
    "You have to take this, and CS majors usually do things very last-minute. It'll get done, though, and try starting early! I recommend picking your own project after researching the state-of-the-art in the field. Make sure it's something you're excited to work on.",
    "I think it's probably better to do your own research, or implement something you've always wanted to build than to do a project assigned to you by a professor. Unless of course you find something absolutely fascinating from existing projects, It makes the class a lot more interesting if you work on your own ideas. Also start thinking about this in the fall.",
    "A good course to study a topic in-depth and build a project to help solve a problem. It all depends on your advisor to determine how much work you have to do, what your final code should look like, etc.",
    "Make sure you talk to previous students who have done a senior project with a professor before choosing them. Some are really good as class instructors but not great for actual project advising.",
    "Required for majors",
    "Yes I would recommend it. Fun time.",
    "CS490 lets you basically do a project of your choice. If you have something computer science-related that you've always been wanting to try, this is a fantastic opportunity to go for it and get advice from a faculty member on a regular basis."
